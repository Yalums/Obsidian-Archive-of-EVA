### Chapter 4: Broken Heart 第四章：破碎的心

The redhead awoke in the morning a little disorientated and confused; the atmosphere seemed unfamiliar and her position wasn't her usual sleeping position either. The girl still found herself to be quite comfortable and warm though. Shifting her head a bit, Asuka let out a gentle breath of hot air. Suddenly, whatever she was resting on moved, much to the sleepy girl's surprise, before settling down again. Curiously, Asuka poked her head out of the blanket covering her and looked around. It was soon concluded that she was lying on top of Shinji on the couch in the living room with a blanket covering the both of them.  
红发女孩清晨醒来，感到些许迷失与困惑；四周的氛围似乎陌生，她的睡姿也并非平日习惯。然而，她依然觉得相当舒适与温暖。微微转动头部，明日香轻轻呼出一口热气。突然，她所枕之物动了动，令半梦半醒的她颇为惊讶，随后又恢复平静。好奇心驱使下，明日香从覆盖她的毯子中探出头来，环顾四周。很快她便明白，自己正躺在客厅沙发上，身下是真嗣，两人共裹一条毯子。

_'What in the world happened yesterday? All I remember was getting the brains fucked out of me…'_ the redhead thought. She felt a sense of déjà vu as she remembered something similar happening just last week. Last week, returning home after a sync test, her and Shinji had passionate sex, resulting in the girl passing out from exhaustion. Asuka pondered over the past week, mostly confused as to what was going on with her and the boy. The redhead felt enmity towards the third child for what he had done to her, but at the same time she was somewhat enjoying a more honest Shinji who was no longer pretending around her.  
'昨天到底发生了什么？我只记得自己被彻底榨干了……' 红发女孩思索着。她感到一种似曾相识的感觉，想起上周也发生过类似的事情。上周，完成同步测试后回家，她和真嗣激情缠绵，结果女孩因疲惫而昏睡过去。明日香回想着过去一周，大部分时间都困惑于自己和那个男孩之间究竟发生了什么。她对第三适格者心怀怨恨，因为他对她所做的一切，但同时她也享受着不再在她面前伪装的更真实的真嗣。

During the week they had some long discussions about various things, including the experiences of piloting their evas or just life in general. They had another two sync tests since the one Ritsuko discovered their secret and the girl continued to score very high. The two eva pilots were spending a lot of time together, despite Asuka's standoffish attitude towards him and of course they had been having sex as well. The girl blushed a little as she finally recalled yesterday's actions and somewhat understood why she had passed out. The redhead wondered why Shinji had taken her to sleep on the couch with him again, she wasn't really sure why he had done it last week either; it was a little risky as Misato could come by and see them, causing all sorts of misunderstandings. Although, Asuka recalled tonight was another all-nighter for her guardian so they were not likely to see Misato for a while yet.  
在那个星期里，他们就各种话题进行了长时间的讨论，包括驾驶 EVA 的经历或仅仅是生活中的琐事。自丽发现他们的秘密后，两人又进行了两次同步测试，而女孩的成绩依旧名列前茅。尽管明日香对他保持着疏离的态度，两位 EVA 驾驶员还是花了很多时间在一起，当然，他们也发生了性关系。女孩的脸颊微微泛红，终于回想起昨天的行为，多少明白了为何会昏过去。红发的她疑惑为何真嗣再次带她去沙发上和他一起睡，她也不太确定上周他为何这么做；这有点冒险，因为美里可能会过来看到他们，引发各种误会。不过，明日香记得今晚她的监护人又要通宵，所以他们暂时不太可能见到美里。

Asuka wondered if maybe she was letting something form between her and Shinji, wondered if maybe the boy was getting the wrong idea about the situation; it was a weird set of circumstances after all, the redhead still found it hard to fathom how things had turned out this way. Her thoughts were interrupted as she felt the sudden urge to relieve herself.  
明日香不禁猜想，或许她和真嗣之间正有什么在悄然形成，或许那男孩对现状产生了误解；毕竟，这一切的发展实在匪夷所思，红发少女仍难以理解事情怎会演变成这样。正当她陷入沉思时，突然感到一阵尿意袭来，打断了她的思绪。

At this, the girl carefully got off Shinji so as not to wake him, causing the blanket to fall to the floor. Just as Asuka was about to move off to the toilet, the boy instinctively grabbed Asuka as he lost his heat source and pulled her back. Shinji then wrapped his arms around the redhead, making the situation even more difficult; she really needed to go.  
听到这话，女孩小心翼翼地从真嗣身上下来，以免吵醒他，导致毯子滑落到地板上。就在明日香准备去洗手间时，男孩本能地抓住了她，因为失去了热源而将她拉回。真嗣随后用双臂环抱住红发少女，使得情况更加棘手；她真的急需解决内急。

"Let go of me baka, unless you want me to piss on you" she hissed.  
“放开我，笨蛋，不然我可要在你身上解决了。”她低声怒斥道。

The boy only grumbled in response.  
男孩只是咕哝了一声作为回应。

"Shinji! I need to go to the toilet!" she practically shouted.  
“真嗣！我要上厕所！”她几乎是大喊道。

The male eva pilot still didn't stir. Enraged, the girl elbowed him in the groin, causing him to grunt and release her. Asuka wasted no time in getting away and out of range, just to be sure he didn't pull her back. Surprisingly, the boy remained asleep on the couch, a pained expression on his face. The redhead quickly entered the toilet, closed the door and relieved herself. After washing her hands, she exited the bathroom and headed back to the living room, determined to get revenge on the boy.  
男性 eva 驾驶员仍然没有动静。女孩气愤之下，用胳膊肘猛击他的腹股沟，让他痛得哼了一声并松开了她。明日香毫不犹豫地迅速逃离并保持在安全距离之外，以防他再次拉住她。出乎意料的是，男孩依旧在沙发上熟睡，脸上带着痛苦的表情。红发女孩迅速进入厕所，关上门并解决了内急。洗完手后，她走出浴室，回到客厅，决心要向那个男孩复仇。

Arriving back into the living room, the girl rested herself back on top of the boy and he wrapped his arms around her again. It was now that he finally woke up. Shinji stretched a little before noticing that Asuka lay on top of him. Smiling, he stroked her red hair and kissed her on the forehead. The redhead wanted to smack him so badly, but she resisted the urge; what she had in store for him was far better. Instead, she bound her arms around him.  
回到客厅，女孩再次趴在男孩身上，他又一次用双臂环抱住她。这时，他终于醒了过来。真嗣伸了个懒腰，注意到明日香正躺在他身上。他微笑着抚摸她的红发，并在她额头上轻轻一吻。红发女孩真想狠狠地拍他一下，但她忍住了这个冲动；她为他准备的东西可比这有趣多了。相反，她用双臂紧紧抱住了他。

"Morning Asuka" Shinji said sleepily as he realised she was awake.  
“早上好，明日香。”真嗣睡眼惺忪地说道，意识到她已经醒了。

The boy found his position a little uncomfortable, but he didn't mind; he had a beautiful girl sleeping on his chest after all. Soon, however, his rest had to finish as he felt nature's call. Attempting to get up, he found himself unable to do so because of the weight on top of him.  
男孩觉得自己的姿势有点不舒服，但他并不介意；毕竟，有一个美丽的女孩睡在他的胸口。然而，不久后，他不得不结束休息，因为自然的需求在召唤他。他试图起身，却发现因为身上的重量而无法动弹。

"Asuka, can you please move?" he requested.  
“明日香，你能挪一下吗？”他请求道。

The redhead almost smiled in triumph and made no move to get off. "I don't wanna, I'm comfortable" she replied.  
红发女孩几乎得意地笑了，却丝毫没有起身之意。“我不想动，我正舒服着呢。”她回答。

The boy tried to pry Asuka off of him but she just held onto him tighter, only causing him frustration.  
男孩试图把明日香从自己身上拉开，但她反而抱得更紧，这让他更加沮丧。

"Asuka please, I need to go to the toilet" he said a little louder.  
“Asuka，拜托，我需要去洗手间。”他稍微提高了声音说道。

"Fine!" she shouted. “好吧！”她大声喊道。

Shinji couldn't understand what she was upset about, but he didn't want to deal with it right now; he really needed to go. The redhead, however, had other plans as she reached down to his groin and fondled his cock, making sure he had an erection.  
Shinji 不明白她在气什么，但他现在不想处理这件事；他真的需要去。然而，红发女孩有别的打算，她伸手到他的胯下，抚弄他的阴茎，确保他勃起。

"Now you can go" she said, smiling evilly.  
"现在你可以走了" 她邪恶地笑着说。

After this, Asuka moved off the boy, allowing him to go to the toilet. The boy just gave her an annoyed look before quickly rushing off to the toilet. However, Shinji found himself unable to take a leak because he was erect. He groaned in frustration; what the hell did Asuka do that for?  
之后，明日香从男孩身上移开，让他去上厕所。男孩只是给了她一个恼怒的表情，然后迅速冲向厕所。然而，真嗣发现自己无法小便，因为他勃起了。他沮丧地呻吟着；明日香到底为什么要这么做？

"For fucks sake!" Shinji shouted out, being unable to become soft again.  
"该死的！" 真嗣喊道，无法再次软下来。

Asuka heard him swear out loud and began rolling on the couch in laughter. The boy stood there next to the toilet, desperately trying to calm himself; unfortunately, every time he tried to concentrate on something that wasn't stimulating, provocative images always popped into his mind.  
明日香听到他大声咒骂，开始在沙发上笑得打滚。男孩站在马桶旁边，拼命试图让自己冷静下来；不幸的是，每当他试图专注于不刺激的事物时，挑逗性的画面总是会跳进他的脑海。

"God damn it Asuka! You're so going to get it for this" he shouted again.  
“该死的明日香！你这次死定了”他又喊道。

The redhead only laughed harder in response. In the end, Shinji had to resort to counting prime numbers and stood there at the toilet for about fifteen minutes before he was finally able to relieve himself. The boy then washed his hands and exited the bathroom; his face didn't look too pleased. Heading back to the living room, Shinji walked back over to the couch where he could see a still cackling redhead. As he stood over Asuka, the girl looked up at him smirking.  
红发女孩只是笑得更厉害了。最终，真嗣不得不求助于数质数，站在马桶前大约十五分钟，才终于得以解脱。男孩随后洗了手，走出浴室；他的脸色看起来不太高兴。回到客厅，真嗣走到沙发旁，看到一个仍在咯咯笑的红发女孩。当他站在明日香上方时，女孩抬头看着他，带着一丝得意的微笑。

"What took you so long?" she asked mockingly.  
"你怎么这么慢？" 她嘲讽地问道。

"Playing innocent isn't going to save you Asuka" Shinji replied, annoyed.  
"装无辜救不了你，明日香。" 真嗣不悦地回答。

"Save me from what?" she asked pompously.  
"救我什么？" 她傲慢地反问。

The boy just grinned at her before answering her question by shoving his hands under her shirt.  
男孩只是对她咧嘴一笑，然后通过将双手塞进她的衬衫来回答她的问题。

"Jesus Christ! Are you trying to kill me?! Remove your hands!" the redhead yelped, jumping at the contact; his hands were ice cold. It would seem the boy had left his hands to soak under cold water for a while before exiting the bathroom.  
“耶稣基督！你想杀了我吗？！把手拿开！”红发女孩尖叫着跳了起来，他的手冰冷刺骨。看来这男孩在离开浴室前把双手泡在冷水里好一阵子。

However, Shinji only moved his hands further up, making Asuka shiver. The redhead grabbed his hands and tried with all her might to pry them off her. Deciding she had had enough, Shinji removed his hands from under her shirt and instead picked her up to kiss her on the lips. Grateful that he had finally removed his hands from her bare skin, the redhead didn't bother protesting.  
然而，真嗣只是将手向上移动，让明日香打了个寒颤。红发女孩抓住他的手，用尽全力试图将它们从自己身上拉开。觉得够了，真嗣从她的衬衫下抽出手，转而抱起她亲吻她的嘴唇。庆幸他终于把手从她的裸露肌肤上移开，红发女孩也懒得抗议了。

"I think that was sufficient punishment" he said after parting.  
"我想那已经足够作为惩罚了" 他在分别后说道。

"Asshole…" she replied, punching him in the chest.  
"混蛋……" 她回答道，一拳打在他的胸口。

"Come off it! What you did was damn cruel" he refuted.  
"得了吧！你做的那件事真是太残忍了" 他反驳道。

"Before you woke up, I needed to go to the toilet as well. However, you wouldn't let me go. I was merely returning the favour" she explained.  
"在你醒来之前，我也需要去洗手间。但是你不让我走。我只是回报一下而已" 她解释道。

Shinji just shook his head and chuckled. "Oh, I'm sorry Asuka" he said playfully, putting on a remorseful face.  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，轻声笑了起来。"哦，对不起，明日香" 他调皮地说，装出一副懊悔的表情。

"You're such a jerk, you know that!" she said, sticking her tongue out at him.  
"你真是个混蛋，你知道吗！" 她一边说，一边对他吐舌头。

"And you're such a bitch. We make a perfect couple" he retorted.  
"你真是太刻薄了。我们简直是绝配" 他反唇相讥道。

"Fuck you" she said, shoving him off of her.  
"去你的" 她说着，把他从自己身上推开。

"You already have" he replied.  
"你已经这么做了" 他回答道。

At this, Asuka got up and slapped him across the face. "Don't be a smartass" she warned.  
听到这话，明日香站起身来，一巴掌扇在他脸上。“别耍嘴皮子”她警告道。

Shinji couldn't hold back his laughter at her comment. "And what do you do all the time, you hypocrite?" he rebuked.  
真嗣听到她的评论忍不住笑出声来。“那你整天又在做什么，你这个伪君子？”他反驳道。

The girl just glared at him, annoyed at his behaviour; he was acting as if he was her boyfriend. _'How dare he call us a couple, I knew this baka would start getting the wrong idea about us'_ she thought.  
女孩只是瞪着他，对他的行为感到恼火；他表现得好像是她的男朋友一样。‘他怎么敢说我们是情侣，我就知道这个笨蛋会开始对我们产生错误的想法’她心想。

Oblivious to the redhead's thoughts, Shinji kissed her again; he found her irritated expression to be quite cute. This time, however, the girl moved away as their lips touched and walked off, taking him by surprise. For some reason as Asuka walked away, she thought she felt a small pain in her chest. Shinji, a little dumbfounded, just watched the redhead as she went off to her room and closed the door.  
对红发少女的心思浑然不觉，真嗣再次吻了她；他觉得她那恼怒的表情颇为可爱。然而这一次，当他们的唇瓣相触时，女孩却抽身离去，让他措手不及。不知为何，当明日香走开时，她感到胸口隐隐作痛。真嗣有些发愣，只是目送着红发少女回到自己的房间，关上了门。

"Did I go too far?" Shinji said out loud.  
“我是不是做得太过分了？”真嗣自言自语道。

The boy decided to just ignore it for now and make breakfast as he was sure the girl would be hungry. Acting upon this decision, Shinji then moved to the kitchen and opened the fridge. He felt relieved as there was still lots of stuff in the fridge that wasn't Misato's awful instant ready food; he could certainly make a good meal. Taking out several ingredients, Shinji then began to cook breakfast for him and Asuka. Compared to last week, he felt much better. Asuka had admitted to enjoying the sex, her synch ratio was consistently high and she seemed to have partly forgiven him for the incident. Their relationship was looking far better than before, although he wished it had come about a different way; he should never have done such a thing to her.  
男孩决定暂时不去理会，先做早餐，因为他确信女孩会饿。基于这个决定，真嗣走向厨房并打开了冰箱。他松了一口气，因为冰箱里还有许多不是美里糟糕的即食食品的东西；他肯定能做出一顿美餐。取出几样食材后，真嗣开始为他和明日香准备早餐。与上周相比，他感觉好多了。明日香承认喜欢那次性爱，她的同步率一直很高，而且她似乎部分原谅了他那次事件。他们的关系看起来比以前好得多，尽管他希望它是以不同的方式发展；他本不应该对她做出那样的事。

Thinking over the past week, Shinji had really grown to enjoy Asuka's company. They had spent much time together and had made love a few times. Just yesterday had been another passionate exchange; there was no pretense between them in regards to wanting to enjoy sex, so Shinji had gone all out. Much like the week before, the redhead had passed out from exertion and he had once again lay down with her on the couch, not bothering to take her to her room. As Misato was taking another all-nighter, he figured it wasn't risky. With all the conversations during the week and the closer it seemed they were, the boy was certain he liked her, surprising as it was. Shinji just wished he could make her happy and somehow reverse the harm he had done to her.  
回想过去的一周，真嗣发现自己越来越享受与明日香相处的时光。他们共度了许多时光，也几次共赴云雨。就在昨天，又是一场激情四溢的交流；在享受性爱这件事上，他们之间没有任何掩饰，所以真嗣全力以赴。与上周一样，红发女孩因疲惫而昏睡过去，他再次与她躺在沙发上，没有费心将她送回房间。由于美里又在彻夜工作，他认为这并不冒险。随着一周内对话的增多，他们似乎越来越亲密，真嗣确信自己喜欢她，尽管这令人惊讶。他只希望能让明日香快乐，并设法弥补自己对她造成的伤害。

Returning to reality, he continued preparing the breakfast, wondering what Asuka was thinking.  
回到现实，他继续准备早餐，心中好奇明日香在想些什么。

---

As the redhead had closed the door, she had felt her heart pounding; was she nervous? It felt like something was off with her, like a part of her was trying to tell her something. Shaking the feeling off, Asuka jumped onto her bed and started thinking over the situation. Asuka was sure the problem was Shinji; she was sure he was to blame for her strange reactions. She could feel him making his way into her life and she didn't like it. But then again, she supposed she was to blame; she had been leading him on a little, despite the protests she made. In the end, the girl remembered she had initially let this relationship continue so she could relieve her sexual frustration and hurt Shinji, however, part of her was now reluctant to make Shinji suffer like that.  
当红发女孩关上门的那一刻，她感到心跳加速；她是在紧张吗？似乎有什么不对劲，仿佛内心某处正试图向她传达些什么。甩开这种感觉，明日香跳上床，开始仔细思考当前的状况。明日香确信问题出在真嗣身上；她肯定他要对她的异常反应负责。她能感觉到他正逐渐进入她的生活，而她对此并不喜欢。但话说回来，她也认为自己难辞其咎；尽管她提出抗议，但她确实在某种程度上引导了他。最终，女孩回想起自己最初让这段关系继续，是为了缓解性压抑并伤害真嗣，然而，现在她内心的一部分却不愿意让真嗣承受那样的痛苦。

Sighing, Asuka also realised the situation would only get harder with time and knew she had to take action. Even though she had grown to like Shinji a little and even gained a little more respect for him, she couldn't have a close relationship, she knew she couldn't, especially not one that started… in such a way. In the end, everyone left her and Shinji was no different, she didn't have to be abandoned again, she could just dump him and forget it ever happened. The only thing holding her back was Shinji's reaction, she couldn't decide when she should break it off with him; she didn't want him to ask her questions or attempt to stay together.  
叹了口气，明日香也意识到情况只会随着时间变得更加棘手，她知道自己必须采取行动。尽管她对真嗣产生了一丝好感，甚至对他多了几分尊重，但她清楚自己无法与他建立亲密关系，尤其是这种关系开始的方式……注定无法长久。最终，每个人都会离开她，真嗣也不例外，她不必再次被抛弃，她可以选择甩掉他，然后忘掉这一切。唯一让她犹豫的是真嗣的反应，她无法决定何时与他分手；她不希望他问东问西或试图维持这段关系。

_'Oh what the hell am I being so concerned about that baka for? I can tell him to shove off if I want to, he can just go to hell. This doesn't mean anything to me anyway, he had already taken my virginity so it's not like the sex even meant anything'_ she thought, annoyed at her deliberations. It was her fault this had been dragged out so long and it was her responsibility now to cut off Shinji's hope.  
'哦，我到底在为那个笨蛋担心什么？如果我想，我可以让他滚蛋，他可以去死。反正这对我来说毫无意义，他都已经夺走了我的初夜，性爱本身也没什么意义'，她想着，对自己的犹豫感到恼火。这一切拖得太久都是她的错，现在她有责任斩断真嗣的希望。

A pleasant aroma interrupted the redhead's thoughts and her stomach grumbled. Asuka then realised she was starving and promptly stood up from her bed to exit her room and head to the dining room where she was sure Shinji was making breakfast. The girl saw this as an opportunity to reveal the "breakup," so as to get it out of the way quickly and so that she did not have to further endure any of his advances.  
一股宜人的香气打断了红发女孩的思绪，她的肚子咕噜作响。明日香随即意识到自己饿极了，便迅速从床上起身，走出房间，朝餐厅走去，她确信真嗣正在做早餐。女孩认为这是个透露“分手”消息的好机会，以便尽快解决此事，避免再忍受他的任何追求。

As Asuka made her way to the dining room, her heart seemed to pound even more; was she really this nervous? The redhead couldn't understand what she felt so anxious about; he was nothing to her. After sitting down at the dining table, the redhead began drumming her fingers on the wooden surface while waiting. It didn't take long for the boy to finish preparing the breakfast and he entered the dining room with the meal in hand. He smiled when he noticed Asuka sitting down and placed the food down on the table before taking a seat himself.  
当明日香走向餐厅时，她的心跳似乎更加剧烈；她真的这么紧张吗？红发女孩不明白自己为何如此焦虑；他对自己来说什么都不是。坐到餐桌旁后，红发女孩开始用手指敲击木质桌面，等待着。没过多久，男孩就准备好了早餐，端着食物走进餐厅。他看到明日香坐在那里，便微笑着把食物放在桌上，然后自己坐了下来。

"Don't worry, we haven't run out of good food like last week. This is a meal with proper ingredients, so don't hesitate to eat" Shinji announced, noticing Asuka didn't dig straight into her meal like usual.  
“别担心，我们没有像上周那样食物短缺。这是一顿用正常食材做的饭，放心吃吧。”真嗣注意到明日香没有像往常一样直接开动，便宣布道。

"Mm" was all she said before she started eating.  
"嗯" 是她开始吃饭前说的全部。

"Is something wrong Asuka?" he asked, concerned.  
"有什么不对劲吗，明日香？" 他关切地问。

"I'm fine" she replied. "我没事" 她回答道。

"That's good to hear, I thought maybe you weren't feeling well or something" Shinji commented, relieved.  
“那太好了，我还以为你身体不舒服或者什么的。” 真嗣松了口气，评论道。

"It's all good" she replied, holding back her irritation; she wanted to at least have some food before she blew off at him.  
“没事的。” 她回答道，强压下心中的不快；她至少想先吃点东西，再对他发火。

Content with her response, Shinji began eating his breakfast. Asuka couldn't stand his happy behaviour; it's not like he actually had true feelings for her, he was just happy he was fucking a girl as beautiful as her. She had rejected him, told him there was no meaning in their relationship, so why did he act so cheerful when he was with her? What the hell could he like about a girl who constantly slapped and insulted him, a girl who constantly pushed him away? He could only be in it for the sex as well and if that was the case then he wouldn't be that distraught after her announcement anyway.  
真嗣对她的回应感到满意，开始吃他的早餐。明日香无法忍受他那高兴的样子；他并不是真的对她有感情，只是因为能和一个像她这样美丽的女孩上床而感到高兴。她拒绝了他，告诉他他们的关系毫无意义，那么为什么他在她身边时还表现得如此开心呢？他到底能喜欢一个经常打他、侮辱他，一个总是推开他的女孩什么呢？他可能也只是为了性，如果是这样的话，那么她的宣布也不会让他太过伤心。

As the two teens ate their breakfast, time seemed to drag on for the redhead. With each passing second, the girl's heart seemed to beat ever faster. When the two eva pilots had finally finished eating their meals, it seemed as if Asuka's heart was going to burst out of her chest. Her hands were shaking and her legs twitching as she watched Shinji gather up their dishes and enter the kitchen to deposit them into the sink. The redhead breathed in deeply in an attempt to calm herself, though she couldn't understand what she was so nervous about. Asuka just wanted to get it off her chest or she would feel like this all day and so decided to tell Shinji as soon as he came back to the dining room.  
当两个少年吃着早餐时，时间似乎对红发少女来说格外漫长。随着每一秒的流逝，女孩的心跳似乎越来越快。当两位 EVA 驾驶员终于吃完他们的餐点时，阿斯兰的心仿佛要从胸口跳出来。她的手在颤抖，腿也在抽搐，她看着真嗣收拾好餐具走进厨房，将它们放入水槽。红发少女深吸一口气，试图让自己平静下来，尽管她不明白自己为何如此紧张。阿斯兰只想把心事说出来，否则她会一整天都这样不安，于是决定等真嗣一回到餐厅就告诉他。

It didn't take long for the boy to return from the kitchen and so Asuka stood up from the table ready to confront Shinji.  
男孩没多久就从厨房回来了，于是阿斯兰从桌边站起身，准备面对真嗣。

"You know Asuka I was thinking, because it's Saturday today we could go somewhere or do something-" he started.  
“你知道吗，阿斯兰，我在想，因为今天是星期六，我们可以去某个地方或者做点什么——”他开始说道。

"Shinji, we need to talk" Asuka interrupted.  
"真嗣，我们需要谈谈" 明日香打断道。

The boy looked a little surprised at the sudden seriousness in the girl's tone. "What is it?" he asked, a little worried.  
男孩对女孩语气中突如其来的严肃感到有些惊讶。"什么事？"他略带担忧地问道。

The redhead took a deep breath before continuing. "I'll get straight to the point Shinji. This relationship we have, whatever you wanna call it, I want it to end" she said bluntly.  
红发女孩深吸了一口气，继续说道："我会直截了当地说，真嗣。我们之间的关系，不管你怎么称呼它，我希望它结束" 她直白地说道。

Shinji's face instantly fell upon hearing those words. "W-why?" was all he managed to reply with.  
听到这些话，真嗣的脸色立刻沉了下来。“为——为什么？”他只能勉强回应道。

Asuka sighed as he asked the question she knew he would ask. "There was never anything between us, if I lead you to believe that we were going out or something, it wasn't my intention. Furthermore, my sexual desires have been satisfied and I don't need you for sex anymore. It's no big deal, I'll let the fact you raped me slide and we can move on with our lives as if nothing happened" she explained.  
明日香叹了口气，知道他会问这个问题。“我们之间从未有过什么，如果我让你误以为我们在交往或其他什么，那并非我的本意。再者，我的性需求已经得到满足，不再需要你来满足。这没什么大不了的，我会原谅你强奸我的事，我们可以像什么都没发生过一样继续生活。”她解释道。

Shinji was silent for a few moments as he digested the information. "Are you… are you saying that all that time you were just using me? You never felt anything else?" he asked, unable to believe that their relationship had meant so little to her.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，消化着这些信息。“你是……你是说，那段时间你只是在利用我吗？你从未有过其他感情？”他问道，无法相信这段关系对她来说如此无足轻重。

"Well, you put it so crudely but basically yeah. I told you beforehand I had no feelings for you whatsoever and was just with you for sex. Did you really think _I_ would want to be with _you_? But what does that matter anyway? You were doing the same thing anyway" she replied.  
"好吧，你说得这么粗俗，但基本上没错。我事先就告诉过你，我对你没有任何感情，只是为了性才和你在一起。你真的以为我会想和你在一起吗？但那又有什么关系呢？反正你也在做同样的事情。"她回答道。

"Bullshit!" he shouted, insulted by her remark. "I never had the intention of using you. I hate what I did to you and I'm grateful you didn't cast me away, but things changed after that. I didn't really understand at first but… I had grown to like you and just wanted you to be happy. I've always cared about you and wanted to make you feel good, I was not taking advantage of you!" he refuted.  
"胡说八道！"他喊道，被她的话激怒了。"我从没想过要利用你。我讨厌我对你所做的事，也很感激你没有抛弃我，但那之后一切都变了。起初我不太明白，但……我已经喜欢上你了，只是希望你幸福。我一直关心你，想让你感觉良好，我没有占你便宜！"他反驳道。

"Don't lie Shinji! Stop spouting out bullshit just so you can get back into my pants! All boys are in a relationship just for the sex around this age. I didn't care though because I was doing the same thing" Asuka shouted back.  
"别撒谎了，真嗣！别再满口胡言，就为了能再爬上我的床！这个年纪的男生谈恋爱都是为了性。我不在乎，因为我也在做同样的事。"明日香回喊道。

"IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE SEX!" Shinji roared. "Asuka is it so hard to believe that I fell for you? I don't care about the sex, if we can stay together, I don't care if we never have sex again!"  
"不仅仅是性！" 真嗣咆哮道，"明日香，很难相信我是真心喜欢你吗？我不在乎性，只要我们能在一起，我不在乎我们是否再也不会有性关系！"

The redhead just stood still, stunned by the ferocity of his words.  
红发女孩只是静静地站着，被他话语中的激烈所震撼。

"Why do you always have to be so difficult? It's not like you couldn't have felt anything. I saw you smile. You were happier. What about the sync tests? Your sync ratio was much higher, was that all nothing?!" he continued.  
"为什么你总是这么难以相处？你并非没有感觉。我见过你微笑。你更快乐了。同步测试呢？你的同步率大幅提高，那一切都是假的吗？！" 他继续说道。

"Don't be so conceited Ikari! It was all because of me and my skill, nothing else! I don't care what you think! The fact of the matter is that I feel NOTHING towards you. You're just a pathetic baka and I don't wanna be with you! Haven't you realised that by now?!" she shouted back at him.  
"别这么自以为是，碇！这一切都是因为我，我的能力，别的什么都没有！我才不在乎你怎么想！事实就是，我对你毫无感觉。你不过是个可悲的笨蛋，我不想和你在一起！难道你到现在还没意识到吗？！" 她朝他大喊道。

"But…" Shinji started, unable to believe what she was saying.  
"但是…" 真嗣开口了，无法相信她所说的话。

"But what? Why would someone like me go out with someone like you? I wish none of this had ever happened!" she shouted furiously. Her words stung her mouth as she spoke and she felt a large pain in her chest; why was she getting so worked up?  
"但是什么？我这样的人为什么要和你这样的人在一起？我真希望这一切从未发生过！" 她愤怒地大喊。话一出口，她就感到嘴里一阵刺痛，胸口也传来剧痛；为什么她会如此激动？

This time he snapped. "I wish I never raped you either! But the rest?! Just what the fuck is wrong with you?! Everyone has their problems, but how can you be such a total bitch?! To think I thought you had a nice side to you! You're nothing but a damn slut!" Shinji replied, infuriated.  
这一次他爆发了。“我真希望我从未侵犯过你！但剩下的那些？！你他妈到底有什么毛病？！每个人都有自己的问题，但你怎能如此彻底的婊子？！我居然还以为你有好的一面！你不过是个该死的荡妇！”真嗣怒不可遏地回击。

Those words hit Asuka hard; his words rang so true, it hurt. She never cared what others said about her, she would just ignore them or insult them; why did Shinji's words impact her so much? _'He can't be right, I don't feel anything for him, I don't care about him at all! Why does this have to be so difficult? Why can't I just shove him away? Why can't… anybody love me?'_ she thought dryly. Her throat felt sore, perhaps from all the shouting or maybe something else. The girl just couldn't deal with it anymore; her mind was such a mess because of him, she needed him to go away.  
这些话对明日香打击很大；他的话如此真实，让她感到痛苦。她从不关心别人对她的看法，她只会忽视或回敬他们；为什么真嗣的话对她影响这么大？‘他不可能是对的，我对他的感觉什么都没有，我根本不在乎他！为什么这件事这么难？为什么我不能把他推开？为什么……没有人能爱我？’她苦涩地想。她的喉咙感到酸痛，或许是喊叫太多，又或许是别的什么。女孩再也无法承受；因为他的缘故，她的思绪一团糟，她需要他离开。

"Just shut up! You have no right to ask what the fuck is wrong with me when you acted like a total psycho" she flared.  
“闭嘴！你没资格问我他妈的有什么问题，当你表现得像个彻底的疯子”她怒气冲冲地说。

The boy instantly fell quiet at her words, unable to retort.  
男孩听到她的话立刻安静下来，无法反驳。

"You said beforehand, I was a bitch and it's true so get used to it! It certainly doesn't make us a perfect couple alright?! Just get the fuck away from me! Ich Liebe Dich!" Asuka yelled.  
“你之前说过，我是个婊子，没错，所以习惯吧！这当然不会让我们成为完美的一对，对吧？！离我远点！我爱你！”明日香大喊道。

Shinji only had so much willpower and he couldn't handle it anymore; the strength behind her words was just too much for him. He should've known this would never last, he should've known she would never accept him. All his increased confidence and boosted self-esteem was all because of Asuka and she had just shoved it down his throat, only making him feel even more insecure about himself. Having been hurt so much, Shinji resorted to what he always did; he ran, ran out of the apartment.  
真嗣的意志力有限，他已经无法承受这一切；她话语中的力量对他来说太过沉重。他早该知道这不会持久，早该知道她永远不会接受他。他所有的自信和自尊提升都源于明日香，而她刚刚将这一切狠狠地塞回他的喉咙，让他感到更加不安全。受到如此多的伤害，真嗣只能采取他一贯的做法；他跑，跑出了公寓。

It would seem Asuka too had only just been holding it together and now that the boy was gone, her knees buckled and she collapsed to the floor. It didn't matter now though, he was gone. He wouldn't see how pathetic she was, how in the end the boy had managed to make it past her defences.  
看来明日香也只是在强撑着，现在男孩走了，她的膝盖一软，瘫倒在地。不过现在这些都不重要了，他已经离开了。他不会看到她有多么可悲，最终那男孩还是突破了她的防线。

"I knew he would run away. I was right. I'm always right" she said, her voice hoarse.  
“我知道他会逃跑。我猜对了。我总是对的。”她沙哑着声音说道。

The redhead felt something trickle down her cheek and she wiped it off with her hand; it was a tear. She couldn't believe it, she was crying. Her eyes welled up and she began to sob, all her bottled-up emotions finally bursting out. Her mind finally processing everything; his betrayal, his violence, his affection, his sweetness, his care, his anger, it was all so overwhelming.  
红发女孩感到有什么东西顺着脸颊滑落，她用手擦去；那是泪水。她不敢相信，自己竟然哭了。她的眼睛盈满了泪水，开始抽泣，所有压抑的情感终于爆发出来。她的思绪终于开始处理这一切：他的背叛、他的暴力、他的柔情、他的甜蜜、他的关怀、他的愤怒，这一切都太过沉重。

_'Be strong Asuka, be strong. This isn't like you at all!'_ she said to herself.  
'要坚强，绫波，要坚强。这根本不像你！' 她自言自语道。

The girl wiped her face with her hand before standing up and going to the bathroom. After entering, she went straight for the sink and washed her face clean, making sure no evidence of her momentary weakness remained.  
女孩用手擦了擦脸，然后站起来走向浴室。进去后，她径直走到洗手池前，彻底清洗了脸庞，确保没有留下一丝脆弱的痕迹。

"Shinji… why do you have to make me feel this way…?" she said out loud.  
“真嗣……你为什么要让我有这样的感觉……？”她大声说道。

She didn't know whether what she did was wrong or right anymore, both of them had been hurt and she felt a little regret about the fight they had had. Asuka didn't want to think about it anymore, she didn't want to think at all. Since it was a Saturday she didn't have to go to school, so she decided it was best to just get to sleep and rest a little before further dealing with this problem.  
她已分不清自己的所作所为是对是错，两人都受了伤，她对那场争执感到些许后悔。明日香不想再思考这些，她什么都不愿去想。既然今天是周六，她不必去学校，于是决定最好先睡一觉，稍作休息，再处理这个问题。

---

A young brown-haired boy was running through the streets of Tokyo-3, he had no destination in mind but he still ran desperately. The young teenager was crying, his tears falling to the ground as he ran. People turned their heads curiously at the sight of the crying boy, wondering what had him so upset. Shinji ignored their looks and just kept running. Even though he was almost out of breath, even though his legs were screaming in pain, he just couldn't stop.  
一个年轻的棕发男孩在第三新东京市的街道上狂奔，他心中并无目的地，却仍拼命奔跑。这位少年泪流满面，泪水随着他的奔跑洒落一地。人们好奇地回头看着哭泣的男孩，想知道是什么让他如此伤心。真嗣无视他们的目光，只是继续奔跑。尽管他几乎喘不过气来，尽管双腿痛得尖叫，他就是停不下来。

_'I should have known. I knew she couldn't really feel anything for me'_ he thought, _'she just used me and then threw me out when I was getting too annoying'_  
“我早该知道。我知道她不可能真的对我有感情。”他心想，“她只是利用我，然后在我变得太烦人时把我甩掉。”

Eventually, Shinji got to the top of the hillside overlooking Tokyo-3 and, due to his fatigue, collapsed onto the ground breathing heavily. He felt so pathetic; she had no reason to like a person like him who ran away all the time, a coward. Nor someone who had so violently abused her, he was even lucky that she had let that go. After recovering from his exertion, the boy looked up and noticed the sun was still rising; it was still quite early in the morning. The immense city glimmered in the sunlight, making it look even more majestic. As he looked out into the sky, Shinji saw Asuka's face smiling and happy.  
最终，真嗣爬上了俯瞰第三新东京市的山坡顶端，由于疲惫不堪，他重重地倒在地上，喘着粗气。他觉得自己真是可悲；她没有理由喜欢像他这样总是逃避、懦弱的人。更不用说他还曾如此粗暴地伤害过她，他能侥幸逃过这一劫已是万幸。恢复了一些体力后，男孩抬头望去，发现太阳仍在升起；时间还很早。巨大的城市在阳光下闪闪发光，显得更加宏伟。当他凝视着天空时，真嗣看到了明日香微笑而快乐的脸庞。

The boy just sighed. _'It was my fault, all my fault. Now I've lost her'_ he thought. The quarrel had Shinji revert to his old self again, blaming himself for everything. _'Well at least I had her for a bit, I guess it's better than nothing'_  
男孩只是叹了口气。'这都是我的错，全都是我的错。现在我失去了她' 他心想。争吵让真嗣又回到了过去的自己，把一切都归咎于自己。'好吧，至少我曾拥有过她一段时间，我想总比什么都没有强'

After a while, Shinji had calmed down and he sat there pondering over recent events, wondering what had sparked this morning's incident; this past week she had been so joyous and she didn't seem to mind their relationship. Maybe it had been going too well? Unable to come to a conclusion, the boy just pushed it out of his mind; that girl was always an enigma.  
过了一会儿，真嗣平静了下来，他坐在那里沉思最近发生的事情，想知道是什么引发了今早的事件；过去这一周她一直很开心，似乎并不介意他们的关系。也许一切进展得太顺利了？无法得出结论，男孩只是将这些念头抛诸脑后；那个女孩始终是个谜。

_'I guess there's nothing else I can do. I'll just go back and pretend none of this ever happened. At least things will go back to how they were, it wasn't so bad before'  
'我想我别无选择。我只能回去，假装这一切从未发生过。至少事情会回到原来的样子，之前也没那么糟糕。'_

Sighing in defeat, Shinji stood up and began his trip back to the apartment. It was a bit of a trek as he had run quite far. As he was physically and emotionally exhausted, he didn't feel like running again and so walked the entire way back to his residence. There were more people up and about now, but this time they paid no attention to him, not that he minded. A part of him wondered what would have happened if he had stubbornly stayed at the apartment; would Asuka have killed him or would she have done something else? He regretted that he had run out on her, but then again, he didn't have much of a choice.  
叹息着认输，真嗣站起身开始返回公寓的旅程。这段路程相当长，因为他跑得相当远。由于身心俱疲，他不想再跑步，于是步行回到了住处。现在街上的人多了起来，但这次他们没有注意到他，他也不介意。他心中有一部分在想，如果他固执地留在公寓里会发生什么；明日香会杀了他还是做别的事情？他后悔自己逃离了她，但话说回来，他当时没有太多选择。

Eventually, the boy arrived at the apartment and he entered the building. Walking up the stairs, Shinji soon made it to his floor and then walked to his door. He found the door unlocked and opened it; Asuka obviously hadn't locked the door after he left. Entering inside, he looked around but didn't see Asuka anywhere. As the front door had been unlocked, he was a little worried and so went and checked her room. As he opened the door to her room, the boy felt relieved as he saw her lying down in her bed.  
终于，男孩到达了公寓并进入了大楼。他走上楼梯，不久就到了自己的楼层，然后走向自己的房门。他发现门没有上锁，便推门而入；显然，在他离开后，明日香并没有锁门。走进屋内，他环顾四周，却没有看到明日香的踪影。由于前门未锁，他有些担心，于是去检查她的房间。当他打开她房间的门时，男孩松了一口气，因为他看到她正躺在床上。

_'She must have still been tired'_ he thought.  
他心想：'她一定还是很累吧。'

"What are you doing here third child?" Asuka asked suddenly, making the boy jump a little; guess she wasn't asleep.  
“你在这里做什么，第三适格者？”明日香突然问道，让男孩吓了一跳；看来她并没有睡着。

"I-I was um… just checking…" he said, trailing off.  
"我-我只是……在确认……" 他说着，声音渐渐弱了下去。

"And where the hell were you all this time?" she asked, sounding annoyed.  
"你这段时间到底死哪儿去了？" 她问道，听起来很恼火。

A little anger surged through the boy again; what the hell did she care? She had asked him to leave, and quite rudely at that.  
男孩心中再次涌起一丝怒气；她到底在乎什么？是她自己让他离开的，而且相当粗鲁。

"I went to that slut Rei's apartment and fucked her" he answered sarcastically.  
"我去了那个婊子丽的小公寓，把她给上了"他嘲讽地回答道。

"I shoulda known, you're just a damn womaniser" she replied, turning her head away in disgust.  
"我早该知道，你不过是个该死的玩弄女人感情的家伙"她回道，厌恶地转过头去。

"You are just unbelievable Asuka. After all that crap you told me about using me, you call _me_ a womaniser? Did you seriously think that I did that?"  
"你真是让人难以置信，明日香。你之前还跟我说什么利用我，现在却叫我玩弄女人感情的人？你真的以为我会那么做吗？"

"It wouldn't be a surprise" she answered.  
"这不会让人意外" 她回答道。

It took all of Shinji's will to just let it go. He had told himself he would try to go back to how they were and he had had enough of arguing with her for today. The boy could see talking to her now would achieve nothing and so turned around and slammed the door shut. Wanting to put his mind at ease, Shinji decided to occupy himself with cooking. Although he had eaten breakfast, it had already been a while and so he decided to make a snack.  
真嗣用尽所有意志力才忍住没再追究。他曾告诉自己要试着回到从前，而且今天已经和她吵够了。男孩明白现在和她谈什么都没用，于是转身用力关上门。为了让自己心安，真嗣决定去做饭。虽然他已经吃过早餐，但已经过去一段时间，所以他决定做个小点心。

Shinji entered the kitchen and began his work, quickly losing himself in the task. Cooking seemed to be the only thing he was good at; he seemed to screw up everything else. It was the only time he didn't feel like such a failure. In the end he was too good at cooking and he didn't have to think much, as such his thoughts soon returned to Asuka. The one thing that he couldn't really grasp was just how angry the redhead had been, it was like there was something much bigger bothering her. Alas, it's not like Asuka was one to share her problems with anyone, let alone him.  
真嗣走进厨房开始忙碌，很快便沉浸在烹饪中。做饭似乎是他唯一擅长的事；其他事情他似乎总是搞砸。只有在做饭时，他才不会觉得自己是个失败者。最终，他在烹饪上太过熟练，以至于不需要多想，他的思绪很快又回到了明日香身上。他始终无法理解红发女孩为何如此愤怒，仿佛有什么更大的烦恼困扰着她。唉，明日香向来不是那种会向人倾诉烦恼的人，更别提是他了。

After Shinji had finished making his snack, he returned to the dining room ready to sit down and eat only to find the girl he had just been thinking about sitting there already; it seemed someone else was also hungry. Asuka looked up at the boy and gave him a menacing look, warning him not to say anything that would piss her off. Shinji noticed that her eyes looked red like she had been crying, but he doubted it.  
在真嗣做完他的小吃后，他回到餐厅准备坐下享用，却发现他刚刚还在想着的女孩已经坐在那里了；似乎还有人也饿了。明日香抬头看着男孩，给了他一个威胁的眼神，警告他不要说任何会惹她生气的话。真嗣注意到她的眼睛看起来红红的，像是哭过，但他对此表示怀疑。

"So, what brings you here?" he asked, not entirely sure what she wanted.  
“那么，是什么风把你吹来了？”他问道，不太确定她想要什么。

"You made me something right?" was her reply.  
“你给我做了什么，对吧？”她回答道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes; she was just as selfish as ever. "Well, I actually made it for myself. A certain someone didn't ask me to make anything for them" he said spitefully.  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼；她一如既往地自私。“好吧，这其实是我为自己做的。某个特定的人可没让我为他们做任何东西。”他带着怨气说道。

"You never think about others, do you?" she remarked.  
“你从不考虑别人，是吗？”她评论道。

Shinji was sure Asuka was intentionally trying to piss him off, but he was not going to get into a fight again, he didn't want to deal with it. "You know what, who cares? You can have my meal. You seem to take everything from me anyway. My dignity, my pride, my sanity, just take that as well, what do I care?" he replied, slamming the food down on the table in front of her.  
真嗣确信明日香是故意想惹他生气，但他不打算再吵架了，他不想处理这些。“你知道吗，谁在乎呢？你可以吃我的饭。你似乎总是从我这里拿走一切。我的尊严，我的骄傲，我的理智，连这顿饭也拿去吧，我还在乎什么呢？”他回答道，将食物猛地摔在她面前的桌上。

The redhead made no response and instead began to eat the meal in front of her. Shinji just gave up; she just couldn't be human. Resigning, he sat down at the table having nothing better to do. The girl ate in silence and Shinji found himself looking over at her. Watching her, he noticed she was avoiding his gaze. Even after all the suffering she had put him through, he still thought she looked beautiful, still thought she must have some kindness in her. He really wanted nothing more than to just go over to her and kiss her and touch her and get lost in the mindless passion they had shared; it seemed he just couldn't let her go.  
红发女孩没有回应，只是开始吃她面前的餐点。真嗣放弃了；她就是无法像个普通人。无奈之下，他坐到桌前，反正也没别的事可做。女孩默默地吃着，真嗣发现自己不时瞥向她。看着她，他注意到她在回避他的目光。尽管她让他经历了那么多痛苦，他仍然觉得她很美，仍然认为她内心一定有善良。他真的只想走过去吻她、抚摸她，迷失在他们曾经共享的无尽激情中；似乎他就是无法放手。

_'Just get over it already Shinji'_ he thought to himself.  
“真嗣，就放下吧”他自言自语道。

Asuka stood up, interrupting Shinji's contemplation. As the girl had finished her meal, she moved over to the kitchen and put her plate into the sink before walking over to her room and closing the door. Shinji sighed and decided he needed something else to help him forget about today. Remembering what he used to do when he felt down, he retired to his room and took out his SDAT player. Lying down on his bed, he pressed the play button and music filled his ears. One thought passed through his mind before he became lost in the melody, _'What did Asuka scream in German? Ihu libe dihu or something, I wonder what that meant'_  
明日香站起身，打断了真嗣的沉思。女孩吃完饭后，走到厨房将盘子放入水槽，随后回到自己的房间并关上了门。真嗣叹了口气，决定需要些别的东西来忘却今天的不快。他记起自己心情低落时会做的事，于是回到房间，拿出他的 SDAT 播放器。躺在床上，他按下播放键，音乐便充盈了他的耳朵。在旋律中迷失之前，他的脑海中闪过一个念头：“明日香刚才用德语喊了什么？Ihu libe dihu 之类的，不知道那是什么意思。”

A weary purple haired woman trudged her way back into her apartment. The work she had done all night through to the morning had been quite demanding and she had been deprived of sleep. The Major wanted nothing more than to get to her room and fall asleep on the bed. As Misato finally opened her door, she entered her residence and shut the door behind her. Upon entering, she soon discovered it was completely silent; both Shinji and Asuka weren't up and about. This past week, the two roommates had been getting along surprisingly well. Usually, they would be fighting, watching TV or eating together, but she could not see them anywhere.  
一位疲惫的紫发女子拖着沉重的步伐回到了自己的公寓。她彻夜工作直至清晨，任务异常艰巨，睡眠严重不足。这位少校现在只想回到房间，倒在床上沉沉睡去。当美里终于打开房门，走进住所并关上门后，她发现屋内一片寂静；真嗣和明日香都不在活动。过去这一周，这对室友相处得异常融洽。通常他们会争吵、一起看电视或吃饭，但现在她却找不到他们的身影。

"I'm home" she called out. Silence answered her. "That's weird" she said to herself.  
“我回来了。”她喊道。回应她的只有沉默。“真奇怪。”她自言自语道。

Thinking they might be in their rooms, the Major went over to Asuka's room first. Opening Asuka's door, Misato's eyes fell upon the girl sleeping on her bed. The Major quickly looked at her watch to make sure she wasn't going crazy.  
美里心想他们可能在各自的房间里，于是先走向了明日香的房间。打开明日香的房门，美里的目光落在床上熟睡的女孩身上。她迅速看了看手表，确认自己没有发疯。

"Still sleeping at this time? What the hell?" she asked herself quietly.  
"还在睡？搞什么鬼？" 她轻声自问。

Not wanting to disturb the redhead, Misato closed the door quietly before moving over to Shinji's room. Opening Shinji's door slowly, Misato peeked into his room and found Shinji with his eyes closed and listening to his SDAT player. After seeing him, she then closed his door without a sound so he wouldn't notice.  
不想打扰红发女子，美里轻轻关上门，走向真嗣的房间。她缓缓打开真嗣的房门，探头一看，发现真嗣闭着眼睛，正听着他的 SDAT 播放器。看到他后，美里无声地关上门，以免被他察觉。

_'That's strange'_ she thought to herself. The past week or so Shinji had stopped listening to his SDAT player, but today he had started again. The Major just sighed. _'It looks like those two had a big fight. Maybe they weren't actually getting along… maybe that's just what I wanted to think so I wouldn't feel guilty about my negligence. I just don't know anymore… and… I don't know what to do…'_  
‘真奇怪’她心想。过去一周左右，真嗣已经不再听他的 SDAT 播放器了，但今天他又开始听了。美里只是叹了口气。‘看来他们俩大吵了一架。也许他们并没有真正和好……也许那只是我希望自己这么想，这样我就不会因为疏忽而感到内疚。我现在真的不知道……也不知道该怎么办……’

Being tired, Misato didn't currently have the energy to help the two make up; she doubted they wanted to be disturbed at the moment anyway. Wanting her mind to rest a little, the Major went to the fridge, took out a beer and gulped it down. Whatever difficulty existed between the two eva pilots, Misato found unable to address. The long hours she had to spend at NERV were partly to blame; she couldn't keep an eye on them. The older woman had tried many times to offer them help, but actions speak louder than words and she figured that with the little time she spent with them, her two wards probably didn't want to bother her, even if they did want her help. Misato really wanted Shinji and Asuka's relationship to improve, but nothing the Major did ever seemed to work, she might even be making things worse. Feeling guilty again, she drank away those painful thoughts with the beer in her hand.  
疲惫不堪的美里，眼下实在没有精力去帮助那两人和解；她甚至怀疑他们此刻并不希望被打扰。为了让自己的思绪稍作休息，美里走向冰箱，取出一罐啤酒，大口喝下。无论两位 eva 驾驶员之间存在何种难题，美里都感到无从下手。她在 NERV 长时间的工作也是部分原因；她无法时刻关注他们。这位年长的女性曾多次试图提供帮助，但行动胜于言辞，她认为由于与他们相处的时间有限，她的两位被监护人可能不想麻烦她，即便他们确实需要帮助。美里真心希望真嗣和明日香的关系能有所改善，但无论她做什么，似乎都无济于事，甚至可能让情况变得更糟。再次感到内疚，她用手中啤酒消解那些痛苦的思绪。

_'If only Kaji was here'_ she thought, _'He would know what to do'_  
'要是加持在这里就好了'，她心想，'他一定知道该怎么做'

But the man was dead; she had shot him, because she was ordered to. Kaji, her only love, had been too careless, snooping around at NERV, discovering things he shouldn't have.  
但那个男人已经死了；是她亲手开枪打死了他，因为那是命令。加持，她唯一的爱人，太过粗心大意，在 NERV 四处探查，发现了不该知道的事情。

_'Damn it Kaji! Why did you have to leave me? I need you'  
'该死的加治！你为什么要离开我？我需要你'_

However, Misato only drank more beer to drown out these thoughts and soon she fell asleep at the table, exhausted from the whole night's work.  
然而，美里只能喝更多的啤酒来淹没这些思绪，不久便在桌子上睡着了，整夜的工作让她筋疲力尽。

### Chapter 5: Starting Over 第五章：重新开始

It was exceptionally quiet in the Katsuragi apartment as all roommates were off in another world. All were unmoving in their positions as they remained in their fantasia. The home also seemed miserable with each occupant feeling downcast; the day's events were weighing down on the two eva pilots especially.  
葛城公寓里异常安静，所有室友都沉浸在另一个世界中。他们一动不动地保持着各自的姿势，停留在幻想之中。家中也显得凄凉，每个住户都感到沮丧；尤其是两位 EVA 驾驶员，当天的事件对他们影响尤为沉重。

The older woman was the first to wake up, opening her eyes and looking around groggily. It didn't take long to see that it was already dark outside and raining heavily. The Major groaned before she finally noticed what had awakened her; it was her cell phone ringing. Disbelief crossed Misato's face as she looked at her mobile, hoping against hope that it was not what she thought it was. Unfortunately, her speculations were right as no sooner had the alarm klaxons come on all over the city.  
年长的女人最先醒来，睁开眼睛，迷迷糊糊地环顾四周。没过多久，她就发现外面已经天黑，雨势滂沱。葛城美里低声呻吟，随后终于注意到是什么唤醒了她；是她的手机在响。她看着手机，脸上露出难以置信的表情，心中暗自祈祷不是她所想的那样。不幸的是，她的猜测没错，警报声很快就在整个城市响起。

"You're fucking kidding me, an angel now?!" Misato swore. The purple haired woman quickly looked at her watch and cursed; it was already past seven in the afternoon. "Not good, not good" she said aloud, standing up.  
“你他妈在逗我，现在又来个使徒？！”美里咒骂道。紫发的女人迅速看了看手表，又咒骂了一声；已经是下午七点多了。“不妙，不妙。”她大声说道，站起身来。

Misato quickly went to the pilot's rooms and opened Asuka's door first. The Major wasted no time in waking the redhead.  
美里迅速前往驾驶员的房间，首先打开了明日香的门。她毫不浪费时间，立刻唤醒了红发的少女。

"Get up Asuka! It's an angel attack!" the older woman said loudly.  
"快起来，明日香！有使徒来袭！" 年长的女性大声说道。

The young girl sat up tiredly. "Huh?" she said sleepily, rubbing her eyes.  
年轻女孩疲惫地坐起身。"嗯？" 她睡眼惺忪地说道，揉着眼睛。

"It's an angel attack, get ready!" Misato announced.  
"是使徒攻击，准备战斗！" 美里宣布道。

Asuka leaped right out of her bed at the mention of the word "angel" and began getting ready. Having the female pilot done, the Major then hurried to Shinji's room and opened his door.  
听到“使徒”这个词，明日香立刻从床上跳了起来，开始准备。女飞行员完成后，玛丽少校急忙赶到真嗣的房间，推开了他的门。

"Shinji, it's an angel attack!" she shouted at him.  
“真嗣，是使徒来袭！”她朝他喊道。

Startled, the boy jumped a bit before taking off his earpieces. "What did you say?" he asked her.  
男孩吓了一跳，稍稍跳了一下，然后摘下耳机。“你说什么？”他问她。

"It's an angel attack" she repeated.  
"这是天使的袭击"她重复道。

The boy's spirit dropped even lower upon hearing this revelation. Shinji did not want to do anything but wallow in self-pity, but he knew this was not the time to act depressed and reluctantly got off his bed; at least this would force his mind to concentrate on something else anyway. Hastily putting on his shoes, he then followed Misato out of his room. Shinji and Misato were soon met by Asuka coming out of her room, looking a little weary. The Major was as reluctant to put these kids into battle today as they were to fight, but she didn't have a choice.  
听到这个消息，男孩的精神更加低落了。真嗣除了沉溺于自怜之外什么都不想做，但他知道现在不是表现沮丧的时候，于是不情愿地从床上爬起来；至少这会迫使他的注意力转移到其他事情上。他匆忙穿上鞋子，然后跟着美里走出了房间。真嗣和美里很快遇到了从房间里出来的明日香，她看起来有些疲惫。美里今天和这些孩子们一样不愿意让他们上战场，但她别无选择。

"Alright we gotta hurry guys, let's go" Misato commanded.  
"好了，我们得快点，走吧"美里命令道。

The trio rushed out the front door, ran down the stairs and entered Misato's car; the two eva pilots both sat in the back on opposite sides. Turning the ignition, the Major changed gear and pushed down on the accelerator, shooting out into the road and driving off towards NERV. Even though they had been in the rain for only a few seconds, the two teens were soaking wet and cold, causing them to shiver inside the car. As the Major had turned on the heater, it was the first time that the two eva pilots preferred to be inside Misato's car rather than outside. Zooming down the road, they almost crashed a few times due to the wet road but reached NERV quickly and in one piece.  
三人急忙冲出前门，跑下楼梯，钻进了美里小姐的车里；两位 EVA 驾驶员分别坐在后座的两边。美里小姐转动钥匙启动引擎，换挡并踩下油门，车子猛地冲上马路，疾驰向 NERV 总部。尽管他们只在雨中停留了几秒钟，两位少年却已浑身湿透，冷得直打哆嗦。由于美里小姐打开了暖气，这是两位 EVA 驾驶员第一次觉得待在美里小姐的车里比外面更舒服。车子在湿滑的路面上飞驰，几次险些失控，但最终他们还是安全快速地抵达了 NERV，毫发无损。

"I've got the kids so open the gate already!" Misato shouted into the intercom.  
“孩子们都在车上了，快开门！”美里对着对讲机大喊。

Instantly, the gate opened and she drove in. Misato then turned around to address the kids.  
大门立刻打开，她驾车驶入。随后，美里转过身来对孩子们说道。

"You guys go straight to the eva cages while I park this car and then come to command for battle strategics" the older woman ordered.  
"你们直接去 EVA 笼子那边，我把车停好就来指挥室讨论战术。"年长的女人命令道。

"Hai" they both replied, unbuckling their seatbelts.  
"明白"他们齐声回答，解开了安全带。

The two adolescents got out of the car, closed their doors and then ran to the elevator, after which Misato drove off further. Shinji then pressed the elevator button and the doors opened. Entering the elevator, Shinji and Asuka pressed the eva cage's floor number and the close-door button respectively. As the doors closed and the elevator began its descent, neither of the occupants said a word to each other; they just leaned against the wall, avoiding each other's gaze. Arriving at their level, the two teens then exited the elevator and headed straight to the changing rooms. Not having much time, the two eva pilots just began changing in front of each other as soon as they arrived, not particularly caring.  
两个少年下了车，关上车门，然后跑向电梯，随后美里继续驾车前行。真嗣按下电梯按钮，门随即打开。进入电梯后，真嗣和明日香分别按下了 EVA 笼子所在楼层的号码和关门按钮。随着门关闭，电梯开始下降，两人都没有说话，只是靠在墙上，避免眼神接触。到达楼层后，两个少年走出电梯，直奔更衣室。时间紧迫，两位 EVA 驾驶员一到更衣室就开始当着对方的面换衣服，并不特别在意。

Just as the two pressed the buttons on their wrists, the other eva pilot came in; she had been sent to check on their progress. The blue haired girl concluded that they were already fully changed into their plugsuits.  
正当两人按下手腕上的按钮时，另一名 EVA 驾驶员走了进来；她被派来检查他们的进度。蓝发女孩断定他们已经完全换好了插入栓服。

"You must report to the eva cages immediately" Rei announced before departing.  
“你们必须立即前往 EVA 格纳库。”绫波宣布后便离开了。

Shinji looked over at the redhead for a moment and was surprised to have their eyes meet. The two looked at each other for what seemed like ages, but in fact was just a couple of seconds, before Asuka turned away and left the changing rooms. The image of her face had had him transfixed; she had looked almost confused. Shaking it off, the boy swiftly followed after her and they rushed to the eva cages. All eva pilots climbed up into their entry plugs with the boy pausing just before he got in to look at Asuka. He only caught a flash of her red hair before it disappeared and he turned his face away; it was exactly how his relationship had turned out. Despite everything, Shinji could not stop longing for the girl and he couldn't understand why; why had he been so serious about her?  
真嗣看向红发女孩，惊讶地发现他们的目光相遇了。两人对视了仿佛许久，实际上只是几秒钟，随后明日香转过身离开了更衣室。她的面容让他着迷；她看起来几乎有些困惑。甩开这些思绪，男孩迅速跟在她后面，他们急忙赶往 EVA 格纳库。所有 EVA 驾驶员都爬进了他们的插入栓，真嗣在进入前停顿了一下，看向明日香。他只瞥见她一闪而过的红发，随后便转过头去；这正是他们关系的写照。尽管如此，真嗣无法停止对女孩的渴望，他不明白为什么；为什么他对她如此认真？

Entering his entry plug, the boy closed the hatch and the capsule inserted itself into his evangelion before filling up with LCL. All three pilots breathed in the liquid before Misato came up on their viewscreen.  
少年进入插入栓，关闭舱门，胶囊随即嵌入他的 EVA 机体，随后 LCL 液体充满整个空间。三位驾驶员在液体中呼吸，紧接着美里出现在他们的显示屏上。

"Mission briefing is as follows" Misato started. "The target is orbiting Earth and is way out of range of any conventional weapons. It has not moved or taken any action so we do not know how it will attack, everyone be careful" she explained.  
“任务简报如下，”美里开始说道，“目标正在绕地球轨道运行，远超常规武器的射程范围。它至今未有任何移动或行动，我们无法预知其攻击方式，请大家务必小心。”她解释道。

The Major paused to look at each pilot's sync ratio and furrowed her brow, trying to make a decision; both Shinji's and Asuka's sync ratios were much lower than they had been the past week. The Commander had ordered a system freeze on Unit 01 though, so she didn't really have much of a choice anyway.  
美里少校停顿了一下，查看每位驾驶员的同步率，眉头紧锁，试图做出决定；过去一周，真嗣和明日香的同步率都大幅下降。虽然司令已经下令冻结 01 号机系统，但她实际上并没有太多选择余地。

"Asuka, you have the highest sync ratio so you take point with the new Positron Rifle Mark II. Shinji, the Commander has ordered a system freeze on your eva, you'll be doing nothing this mission unless everything fails. As for you Rei, you'll act as backup for Asuka with the old Positron Rifle Mark I" Misato finished.  
“明日香，你的同步率最高，所以你拿着新型的阳电子步枪 Mark II 打头阵。真嗣，指挥官命令你的 EVA 系统冻结，除非万不得已，这次任务你无需行动。至于你，绫波，你用旧型的阳电子步枪 Mark I 作为明日香的支援。”美里下达了指令。

"Affirmative" Rei replied.  
“明白。”绫波回应道。

Asuka and Shinji said nothing, but it seemed they understood the orders they were given.  
明日香和真嗣没有出声，但似乎他们已经理解了自己的任务。

"Alright, get ready for launch!" Misato announced, not seeing a reason to delay.  
"好了，准备发射！" 美里宣布道，看不出有任何拖延的理由。

Both Unit 02 and Unit 00 shot up their catapults to the surface; the immense lurching sensation felt by both girls. Reaching the surface in several seconds, the two evangelions then exited their ramps, immediately seeing the angel up in the sky; it looked like a glowing star. Both eva pilots halted as they looked up at the majestic spectacle.  
二号机和零号机同时从弹射器冲向地面；两位少女都感受到了那股巨大的冲击感。几秒钟内到达地面，两台福音战士随即离开坡道，立刻看到了天空中悬浮的天使；它看起来像一颗闪耀的星星。两位福音战士驾驶员停下脚步，抬头凝视着这壮观的景象。

"Get into position" Misato said over the com link at their hesitance.  
"进入位置" 美里通过通讯链接催促她们，对她们的犹豫不决。

Asuka willed her eva over to a nearby weapons armament building and took out the rifle. While Asuka had received her weapon, Rei had also moved to another building and took out the older rifle. The blue haired girl moved further back and assembled her weapon before setting up position. The redhead moved into position before aiming her rifle up into the sky at the angel, waiting for the crosshairs to link up. The computer had to calculate distance, temperature, gravity and all other factors affecting the trajectory, making it take a long time. The outside rain pouring onto the evangelions didn't help. Even though it didn't hurt, she could feel the impact of every raindrop as they landed onto the eva causing great irritation.  
明日香操控着她的 EVA 移动到附近的武器装备大楼，取出了步枪。与此同时，绫波也移动到了另一栋建筑，拿起了那把旧式步枪。蓝发少女继续后退，组装好武器并占据了有利位置。红发少女也迅速就位，举枪对准天空中的使徒，等待着瞄准镜中的十字线对齐。计算机需要计算距离、温度、重力以及其他所有影响弹道的因素，这使得过程异常漫长。外面的雨水不断打在 EVA 身上，更是雪上加霜。尽管雨水并未造成伤害，但她能感受到每一滴雨水落在 EVA 上带来的极大不适。

"Come on, come on!" Asuka said out of frustration.  
“快点，快点！”明日香因焦急而喊道。

Though the redhead usually enjoyed piloting her Unit 02, today her evangelion felt alien. Added to her discomfort was the situation between her and Shinji, which just wouldn't leave her mind; why she found it so difficult to push it from her mind was a mystery to her. The boy had been silent to her ever since she woke up, but she had caught him stealing glances at her and she was at a loss on how to deal with him; something still stirred in her heart when he looked at her, before she had thought it was just sexual excitement, but now she didn't have a clue. Focusing back on the task at hand, the girl gripped her controls a little tighter.  
尽管红发少女通常喜欢驾驶她的二号机，但今天她的福音战士感觉异常陌生。加之她与真嗣之间的情况，总是挥之不去；她为何觉得如此难以将之抛诸脑后，对她来说是个谜。自从她醒来后，男孩对她一直沉默寡言，但她却捕捉到他偷偷瞥向她的目光，这让她不知所措；每当他看向她时，心中仍有什么在涌动，她曾以为那只是性兴奋，但现在她毫无头绪。重新专注于手头的任务，女孩更紧地握住了操纵杆。

Unfortunately for Asuka, the battle would not go as she had expected and just as her crosshairs were about to link up with the angel, a strange light assaulted her.  
对明日香来说不幸的是，战斗并未如她所料进行，正当她的准星即将锁定使徒时，一道奇异的光芒袭击了她。

"What the…?" the redhead let out in confusion.  
“什么鬼…？”红发少女困惑地脱口而出。

A moment later, the young girl felt tremendous pain as it felt like the angel was trying to force its way into her mind. The mind was something no one could or should ever touch and yet she could feel an alien presence shoving itself around in her head, looking through her thoughts and memories, violating her mind. The redhead screamed in anguish as she felt the angel probing her mind; she had to get rid of it. In retaliation, Asuka fired her rifle up at the sky, desperately trying to hit the angel. All her shots missed the angel by mere centimetres and her rifle was soon depleted of ammo.  
片刻之后，少女感到剧烈的疼痛，仿佛天使正试图强行闯入她的意识。心灵是任何人都无法也不应触碰的领域，然而她能感觉到一种异样的存在在她的脑海中横冲直撞，翻阅她的思绪和记忆，侵犯她的心灵。红发女孩痛苦地尖叫着，感受到天使在探查她的内心；她必须摆脱它。作为反击，明日香向天空开枪，拼命试图击中天使。她的所有射击都仅以几厘米之差错过目标，而她的步枪很快就没有子弹了。

"Get out of my head, get out!" she screamed. The young girl clutched her head in agony and struggled against the assault, causing Unit 02 to do the same.  
“滚出我的脑袋，滚出去！”她尖叫道。少女痛苦地抱住头，挣扎着抵抗攻击，导致 02 号机也做出了同样的动作。

Everyone's eyes widened in horror as they heard the girl's screams. The entire bridge crew was in stunned silence, unable to believe what they were seeing and hearing. Shinji was absolutely shocked to hear real cries of pain coming from the redhead and he felt an enormous pit in his stomach. Asuka had already suffered enough from him, she didn't deserve this at all. Despair threatened to overcome him as he realised he was unable to do anything to save her due to his Unit 01 being in system freeze.  
当听到女孩的尖叫声时，每个人的眼睛都惊恐地睁大了。整个舰桥成员都陷入了震惊的沉默，无法相信眼前所见和耳中所闻。真嗣完全震惊了，他听到红发女孩真实的痛苦呼喊，感到胃里一阵翻江倒海。明日香已经因为他受够了苦，她根本不应该遭受这些。绝望感威胁着要吞没他，因为他意识到由于初号机处于系统冻结状态，他无法做任何事情来救她。

"Ritsuko?!" Misato shouted, needing a quick assessment of the situation.  
“律子？！”美里大喊，急需对当前情况做出快速评估。

"It seems the angel is attacking Asuka with some sort of particle wave, it's assaulting the pilot's mind directly!" the doctor said frantically.  
“看来天使正在用某种粒子波攻击明日香，它直接攻击了驾驶员的意识！”医生慌乱地说道。

"Any suggestions? Anything that can stop this attack?!" Misato shouted urgently.  
“有什么建议吗？有什么能阻止这次攻击的吗？！”美里急切地喊道。

"I don't know Misato. It would take too long to analyse and I just don't know where to start and-" Ritsuko started.  
“我不知道，美里。分析需要太长时间，而且我根本不知道从何开始——”律子开始说道。

"Rei fire!" Misato ordered, seeing that the doctor did not have any solution.  
“丽，开火！”美里命令道，看到医生没有解决方案。

Rei had her rifle aimed at the angel and had been waiting for the order to fire. Upon receiving Misato's command, the blue haired girl fired at once, the long energy beam shooting off into the sky. However, the distance was too far and by the time the beam reached the angel it had lost too much energy and the beam was reflected as it hit a series of octagons.  
丽已经将她的步枪对准了使徒，等待着开火的命令。接到美里指挥后，蓝发女孩立刻开火，长长的能量光束射向天空。然而，距离太远，当光束到达使徒时，能量已大幅衰减，光束击中一系列八角形结构后被反射。

"The AT-Field is too strong!" Ritsuko called out.  
“AT 力场太强了！”律子大声喊道。

"Damn it" the Major cursed at the failure.  
“该死”，美里因失败而咒骂道。

"Ah God, I don't want to remember this! Make it stop, make it stop!" Asuka cried out, still under attack.  
“啊，上帝，我不想回忆这些！让它停下，让它停下！”明日香哭喊着，仍在遭受攻击。

The young boy could no longer sit there doing nothing anymore. "Father!" Shinji cried out. "Father, please let me help her!" he pleaded, tears threatening to fall.  
少年再也无法坐在那里无所作为了。“父亲！”真嗣哭喊道，“父亲，请让我帮助她！”他恳求着，泪水几欲夺眶而出。

"Permission denied" the Commander replied coldly. "Unit 01 is too valuable, I cannot take the risk"  
“权限拒绝”指挥官冷冷地回答，“初号机太过珍贵，我不能冒这个险。”

Asuka continued to scream in pain, desperately fighting against her foe.  
明日香继续痛苦地尖叫，拼命与对手抗争。

"At this rate the pilot could receive irreversible mental damage, we need to do something!" Ritsuko announced.  
“照这样下去，驾驶员可能会遭受不可逆的精神损伤，我们必须采取行动！”律子宣布道。

"If not send out Unit 01, what do you suggest Commander?!" Misato shouted furiously.  
“如果不派出零号机，你有什么建议，指挥官？！”美里愤怒地喊道。

"Father please, I have to go help her. Let me go, I can do this!" Shinji pleaded again.  
"父亲，求您了，我必须去帮她。让我去吧，我能做到！" 真嗣再次恳求道。

"Permission denied" the Commander replied again. "Rei, retrieve the lance" he ordered.  
"权限已拒绝" 指挥官再次回答。"丽，去取长矛" 他命令道。

"Hai" was Rei's response before she stood up and went over to the elevator so she could be brought back down to retrieve the lance.  
"明白" 是丽的回应，她随即起身走向电梯，以便被送下去取长矛。

"The Lance?! You can't be serious Commander?!" Misato shouted in disbelief.  
"朗基努斯之枪？！指挥官，你不是认真的吧？！" 美里难以置信地喊道。

"Follow your orders" was all the Commander said in response.  
"执行命令" 指挥官只是这样回应道。

Shinji was enraged at his father; how long would it take for Rei to retrieve the lance and would it even work? All that time Asuka would be suffering under the angel's assault and he would sit there doing nothing; there was no way he was going to allow that. Deciding on a different approach, the young boy opened a com link to Asuka's evangelion.  
真嗣对他的父亲感到愤怒；丽要多久才能取回那把枪，它真的能起作用吗？在这段时间里，明日香将在天使的攻击下受苦，而他却只能坐在那里无所作为；他绝不允许这种情况发生。决定采取不同的策略，少年打开了与明日香 EVA 的通讯链接。

"Asuka, can you hear me?" Shinji asked.  
“明日香，你能听到我说话吗？”真嗣问道。

The young girl shifted as she heard his voice; fortunately, she was still able to differentiate between her mind and reality. "Y-Yes" she replied in pain, unable to hold back her screams.  
听到他的声音，少女微微动了动；幸运的是，她仍能区分自己的内心与现实。“嗯……嗯”她痛苦地回答，无法抑制住自己的尖叫。

Shinji sighed with small relief; he was at least able to talk to her. Taking a deep breath before he spoke, Shinji made sure to be ready to speak with conviction and without stammering; any weakness in his voice would surely cause the redhead to give up.  
真嗣轻叹一声，稍感宽慰；至少他还能和她交谈。深吸一口气后，他确保自己准备好坚定而流畅地说话；任何声音中的软弱无疑会让红发女孩放弃。

"Listen to me Asuka, you have to fight it!" he urged.  
"听我说，明日香，你必须战斗！" 他催促道。

"I-I can't! It hurts s-so much! P-Please h-help me!" the girl replied desperately.  
"我-我做不到！太疼了！请-请帮帮我！" 女孩绝望地回答。

"I'm here Asuka, be strong, you always were" Shinji responded, desperately fighting against his tears.  
"我在这里，明日香，坚强些，你一直都很坚强" 真嗣回应道，拼命忍住泪水。

The male eva pilot hadn't noticed, but the entire bridge crew was listening to their conversation, hoping he could help the poor girl.  
那位男性 EVA 驾驶员并未察觉，但整个舰桥的成员都在倾听他们的对话，希望他能帮助那位可怜的女孩。

"I don't wanna be strong anymore!" she screamed. "I've acted strong all my life, I'm sick of it! In the end I still have to suffer all this, I just can't take the pain anymore" she refuted.  
“我不想再坚强了！”她尖叫道，“我一生都在假装坚强，我已经厌倦了！最终我还是得承受这一切，我再也受不了这种痛苦了。”她反驳道。

"In all my life I have never met a girl with a stronger will, with more determination, with more stubbornness. No matter what, you always stood by your pride even if it hurt you and I've experienced it from you personally. Surely this angel is nothing then right? You can do it Asuka, I believe you can, I know you can!" Shinji replied, surprising even himself.  
“我一生中从未遇到过意志如此坚强、决心如此坚定、如此固执的女孩。无论发生什么，你总是坚守自己的骄傲，即使这会伤害你，我也从你身上亲身体验到了。那么，这个天使又算得了什么呢？你可以做到的，明日香，我相信你，我知道你能行！”真嗣回答道，连他自己都感到惊讶。

Asuka felt something stir inside her as she heard those words, but she was still battling desperately against the angel. She just couldn't see how she could get out of this one, how could his words alone help her? "S-So what Shinji? You're just a p-pathetic wimpy little boy. So what if you believe in me? So what if you give a damn? It doesn't change a-anything…" she retorted.  
听到那些话，明日香内心有所触动，但她仍在与使徒殊死搏斗。她实在看不出自己如何能脱困，他的话怎能帮到她？“那又怎样，真嗣？你不过是个可悲的小男孩。就算你相信我，就算你在乎，那又怎样？什么都不会改变……”她反驳道。

Many emotions swirled around inside the boy as he heard her reply. How could she give up? What could he do? Was there something more he could say? Was it going to end like this?  
听到她的回应，男孩心中涌动着许多情绪。她怎能放弃？他能做些什么？他还能说些什么吗？事情就要这样结束了吗？

"You're wrong Asuka. You're wrong because…" he said trailing off, not knowing what his heart was trying to make him say.  
“你错了，明日香。你错了，因为……”他说着停了下来，不知道自己的心在试图让他表达什么。

"Because what?" she asked.  
“因为什么？”她问道。

_'Because what?'_ It was a good question. What did it mean to her if he believed in her? What was he trying to achieve? What was he getting so worked up about? Why did he feel such a strong need to protect her? Why did he want her to stop suffering? What was this feeling that threatened to overwhelm him? Why did he damn care so much about a stupid girl who just insulted him all the time? What did he want?  
‘因为什么？’这是个好问题。如果他相信她，这对她意味着什么？他在试图实现什么？他在为什么如此激动？为什么他觉得有如此强烈的保护她的需要？为什么他希望她停止受苦？这种即将淹没他的感觉是什么？为什么他他妈的这么在乎一个总是侮辱他的愚蠢女孩？他想要什么？

Realisation struck Shinji as he finally understood something he had been refusing to admit all this time. And so, he answered the girl with the words he knew were true, words that had been true for a long time.  
当真嗣终于明白了一直以来他拒绝承认的事情时，他恍然大悟。于是，他用他知道是真实的、已经真实了很久的话回答了那个女孩。

"Because I… love you Asuka" he said without a hint of deceit.  
“因为我…爱着你，明日香。”他坦诚地说，没有一丝虚假。

A few sharp intakes of breath could be heard at the confession, one of the most shocked people was Misato; she just couldn't comprehend that Shinji had real feelings towards Asuka.  
这番告白让几人倒吸了一口凉气，其中最震惊的莫过于美里；她简直无法理解真嗣对明日香竟然抱有真实的感情。

Asuka too could not believe what Shinji had just admitted, the words just kept repeating in her head. How could it be true? Even after everything she put had him through, how could he feel that way about her? Why did she even care if he felt that way about her?  
明日香同样难以置信真嗣刚刚承认的话，这些话语在她脑海中不断回响。这怎么可能？即使经历了她给他带来的一切，他怎么可能对她有那种感觉？她为什么会在意他是否对她有那种感觉？

The angel now seemed to try to press into her consciousness with even greater persistence than before. The young girl cried out in pain, ashamed at the memories she was being shown. "B-Baka Shinji, why did you fall for someone as h-horrible as me?" she managed to respond with.  
天使现在似乎比以往更加坚持地试图深入她的意识。年轻女孩痛苦地呼喊，对自己被展示的记忆感到羞愧。“笨蛋真嗣，你为什么会爱上像我这样可怕的人？”她勉强回应道。

"You're not a horrible person, you're a special person Asuka, especially to me. How many things have you taught me? How many great things have you accomplished?" Shinji encouraged.  
“你不是个可怕的人，你是个特别的人，明日香，对我来说尤其如此。你教会了我多少东西？你取得了多少伟大的成就？”真嗣鼓励道。

"I've always been beaten by you! Your sync ratio, your number of angel kills. It doesn't matter what you say, I'm going to lose to this angel…" Asuka replied, growing weary.  
“我一直都输给你！你的同步率，你的使徒击杀数。不管你说什么，我都会输给这个天使……”明日香回答，渐渐感到疲惫。

"Don't do this Asuka! You were always stronger than me! I've only been in more angel battles, so that doesn't count. Also, you have a higher sync ratio than me right now and in the end that doesn't define you anyway! Please Asuka! Show this angel that you can't be beaten!" he urged. "Curse at it like you did to me. What was it again? Ihu libe dihu?"  
"别这样，明日香！你一直比我坚强！我只是经历了更多的使徒战斗，这不算什么。而且，你现在同步率比我高，但最终这并不能定义你！求你了，明日香！向这个使徒展示你不可被打败的一面！" 他催促道。"像你对我那样咒骂它。那是什么来着？Ihu libe dihu？"

Asuka's heart thumped upon hearing those words. Instantly, the memory of their fight came flashing back to her and she realised she truly had spoken those words to the young boy. The girl then did something completely unexpected for everyone; she starting laughing. Though it was barely audible, it was definitely a laugh.  
听到这些话，明日香的心跳加速了。瞬间，他们战斗的记忆闪回她的脑海，她意识到自己确实对那个少年说过那些话。然后，女孩做了一件出乎所有人意料的事；她开始笑了起来。虽然声音微弱，但那确实是一个笑声。

"Oh, you really are a baka Shinji. That wasn't a curse, it means 'I love you' in German" Asuka replied, finding a strange amusement in the fact that Shinji thought she had cursed him.  
"哦，你真是个笨蛋真嗣。那不是咒骂，那是德语的'我爱你'。" 明日香回答道，发现真嗣以为她在咒骂他这件事颇为有趣。

Shinji was frozen still; she had said _that_ to him? How he had been a fool, all her behaviour made total sense right now. How could he not have understood? It seemed so obvious now. He knew Asuka would never admit anything like that; he should have just stayed with her. Running off only made it seem like he was running away from her, he should've seen past her instinctive anger; he knew she was like that. The young boy sighed knowing he could not change the past, but was not going to make the mistake a third time; he knew there was still a chance now.  
真嗣僵立在原地；她竟然对他说了那样的话？他真是愚蠢至极，她的一切行为现在看来都完全合理。他怎么会没理解呢？现在这一切似乎都显而易见。他知道明日香永远不会承认那样的事；他本该一直陪着她的。逃跑只会让她觉得他在逃避她，他本该看穿她本能的愤怒；他知道她是那样的性格。少年叹了口气，明白过去无法改变，但不会再犯第三次错误；他知道现在还有机会。

"Fuck it all Asuka! Just forget all the insanity that happened. You're the one I want, now and forever, and no one else. I promise we can start over after this. We will get through this together" he urged.  
“去他妈的明日香！忘了那些疯狂的事吧。你才是我想要的，现在和永远，没有别人。我保证我们可以在这一切之后重新开始。我们会一起度过难关。”他恳求道。

For some reason Asuka felt she could trust Shinji's words, the strength behind his voice showed he wasn't just talking. Her resolve grew and a newfound strength flowed through her body; she wanted to fight back, she wanted to have a chance at happiness. The young girl didn't know exactly what to do, but she knew nothing would happen if she gave up now.  
不知为何，明日香觉得她可以相信真嗣的话，他声音中的坚定表明他不仅仅是在说话。她的决心增强了，一股新生的力量流遍全身；她想要反击，她想要有机会获得幸福。少女并不确切知道该怎么做，但她知道如果现在放弃，就什么都不会发生。

"You mother fucking angel, you're gonna die!" she yelled out in retaliation.  
"你这个该死的混蛋天使，你死定了！"她愤怒地回喊道。

The redhead's face darkened with anger as she mustered all her will to erect her AT-Field, which successfully blocked the wave. The girl, having finally been relieved of the alien presence in her mind, became slightly more relaxed, no longer clutching her head in pain; she could now control Unit 02 without hindrance. The angel up in space was astonished the eva pilot could manage it and so increased the power of its attack. Asuka thought over the situation quickly, deciding how she could possibly fight the angel up in space.  
红发少女的脸因愤怒而阴沉，她集中所有意志力展开了 AT 力场，成功挡住了冲击波。女孩终于摆脱了脑海中的异物，稍微放松了一些，不再痛苦地抱着头；她现在可以毫无阻碍地控制 2 号机。太空中的天使对这位 EVA 驾驶员能做到这一点感到惊讶，于是增强了攻击力度。明日香迅速思考着局势，决定如何可能与太空中的天使战斗。

"I'm so glad you're okay Asuka!" Shinji cried out happily, noticing the redhead was back in control.  
"明日香，你没事真是太好了！"真嗣高兴地喊道，注意到红发少女已经重新掌控了局面。

"It won't last forever Shinji, I need some way to attack the angel!" Asuka replied, sounding a lot calmer.  
"不会永远这样持续下去的，真嗣，我需要某种方法来攻击使徒！" 明日香回答道，听起来镇定许多。

"I think I have a way" Ritsuko suddenly announced.  
"我想我有个办法" 律子突然宣布道。

"I'm up for any suggestion" Asuka said, encouraging the doctor to go on.  
"我支持任何建议" 明日香说，鼓励医生继续说下去。

"Currently your AT-Field is blocking the wave, however, if you invert your AT-Field you could redirect and focus the particle wave. If concentrated enough, the particle wave could turn into a high energy gamma beam and slice right through the angel's AT-Field" Ritsuko explained.  
“目前你的 AT 力场正在阻挡这股波动，但如果你反转 AT 力场，就能重新引导并聚焦粒子波。如果足够集中，粒子波可以转化为高能伽马射线，直接切穿使徒的 AT 力场。”律子解释道。

"I think I understand" Asuka said in response.  
“我想我明白了。”明日香回应道。

The young girl proceeded to invert her AT-Field and began redirecting the angel's weapon right back at it. Sweat began pouring down Asuka's forehead as she concentrated on focusing the particle wave. Pressing her AT-Field together, she focused the particle wave into a tiny concentrated beam and swung it in an upward arc, causing the beam to cut straight through the angel's AT-Field and the angel itself. Up in space the angel exploded, causing a spectacular sight to be seen from the ground as the explosion could be seen in the sky.  
少女随即反转自己的 AT 力场，开始将使徒的武器反向引导回其本身。汗水开始从明日香的额头滴落，她全神贯注地聚焦粒子波。她将 AT 力场压缩，将粒子波汇聚成一道细小的集中光束，并向上挥动，使光束直接切穿了使徒的 AT 力场及其本体。在太空中，使徒爆炸了，从地面望去，天空中的爆炸景象壮观无比。

"Thank you… Shinji…" Asuka managed to say before collapsing from exhaustion; the red evangelion slumped as the young girl went unconscious.  
"谢谢你…真嗣…" 明日香在精疲力尽之前勉强说道，随后红色的福音战士随着少女的昏迷而瘫倒。

There were a few moments of silence before cheering erupted throughout NERV; the angel had been defeated.  
沉默了片刻之后，NERV 各处爆发出欢呼声；天使已被击败。

"Rei, don't bother with the lance" the Commander ordered, sounding a little annoyed.  
"丽，别管那长矛了" 指挥官命令道，语气中带着一丝不悦。

"Hai" Rei responded. “嗨”丽回应道。

Wanting to meet with Asuka as soon as possible, Shinji was ready to get out of Unit 01 and make it to the hospital but soon found that his eva was able to move again; perhaps because there was no angel, the system had come back online. With his movement restored, Shinji walked his evangelion over to the catapult and requested a launch. Before any permission was given, Ritsuko activated the launch and Unit 01 was fired up to the surface. After his short ride, Shinji exited his ramp and moved over to the motionless evangelion. The young boy saw Asuka's entry plug ejecting automatically out of the armour and the LCL being expelled from the capsule. Grabbing the entry plug, he quickly set it down on the ground before exiting his eva and running over to it.  
急于尽快见到明日香，真嗣准备离开初号机前往医院，却发现他的 EVA 又能动了；或许是因为没有使徒，系统重新上线了。恢复行动能力后，真嗣操控着 EVA 走向弹射器并请求发射。未经许可，律子便启动了发射程序，初号机被弹射至地面。短暂飞行后，真嗣离开驾驶舱，走向静止不动的 EVA。少年看到明日香的插入栓自动从装甲中弹出，LCL 也从胶囊中排出。他迅速抓住插入栓，将其放置在地面上，然后离开 EVA，跑向那里。

Shinji grabbed the handles on the hatch and instantly flinched as it was extremely hot. Nonetheless, the boy grabbed them again and turned the handles to open her hatch, burning his hands once again. Upon opening the hatch, he quickly looked inside wanting to make sure Asuka was fine. After seeing the redhead's prone form, he lifted her up and carried her out of the capsule. Checking her over, Shinji decided that the girl seemed okay; she was breathing, her heart was beating and she made a few small noises as he handled her. Moments later, the rescue team arrived and he placed Asuka onto a stretcher they brought out. Getting into the van with her, Shinji watched over the redhead as they were transported to the NERV hospital.  
真嗣抓住舱门的把手，立刻因极高的温度而缩手。然而，他再次握住把手，转动它们打开舱门，又一次灼伤了双手。舱门打开后，他迅速向内望去，想确认明日香是否安然无恙。看到红发少女躺卧的身影后，他抱起她，将她从胶囊中带出。检查一番后，真嗣判断女孩似乎无大碍；她呼吸平稳，心跳正常，在他抱起她时还发出了几声轻微的声响。不久，救援队赶到，他将明日香放在他们带来的担架上。与她一同进入救护车，真嗣在前往 NERV 医院的途中一直守望着红发少女。

The medical team conversed with each other over the status of the female eva pilot and gave instructions to each other for when they arrived but Shinji couldn't hear what they were saying. He had his sole concentration on the girl in front of him; he had admitted his feelings for her and she had returned them, he just couldn't believe it. Shinji hoped Asuka hadn't been injured in any way and prayed she went unconscious just due to exhaustion. The journey to the NERV hospital had been a short and bumpy ride and soon the doors of the van opened up and they wheeled the girl out of the vehicle and into the hospital.  
医疗团队就女性 EVA 驾驶员的状况相互交流，并就到达后的处理给出指示，但真嗣听不清他们在说什么。他的全部注意力都集中在眼前的女孩身上；他已向她坦露心迹，而她也给予了回应，这一切他简直难以置信。真嗣希望明日香没有受到任何伤害，祈祷她只是因为疲惫而昏迷。前往 NERV 医院的旅程短暂而颠簸，很快，救护车的门打开，他们将女孩推出车外，推进了医院。

Shinji followed the medical team as they pushed his roommate through the halls of the hospital to an already prepared room. After arriving to her designated room, they pushed the stretcher inside the room and asked the boy to stay outside. Grudgingly, Shinji accepted their request and sat down on a nearby bench as a few doctors entered her room and closed the door behind them. It didn't take long, however, for the doctors to check and treat the redhead and after only a few minutes they exited the room and told the boy he could see her. The doctors told him she was perfectly fine; she hadn't been physically injured at all and was currently just sleeping. Leaving the young boy alone, the doctors went off down the hallway to other patients that needed attending.  
真嗣跟着医疗团队，他们推着他的室友穿过医院的走廊，前往一间早已准备好的房间。抵达指定房间后，他们将担架推进室内，并要求男孩留在外面。真嗣不情愿地接受了请求，坐在附近的椅子上，几位医生进入她的房间并关上了门。然而，医生们很快完成了对红发女孩的检查和治疗，仅几分钟便走出房间，告诉男孩他可以去看她了。医生告诉他，她一切安好，没有受到任何身体伤害，只是睡着了。留下年轻的男孩，医生们沿着走廊去照顾其他需要治疗的病人。

Shinji swiftly entered the room and soon saw Asuka had been laid onto a soft white bed. The redhead was sleeping soundly, no ill expression on her face, just peacefulness. The boy grabbed a chair, moved over to her side and decided to watch over her until she woke up. His silent supervision was soon interrupted as a very emotional purple haired woman burst into the hospital room. The crying Major ran over to Shinji and hugged him tightly, grateful nothing dreadful had befallen the pilots. Shinji appreciated the comfort and returned the embrace to Misato, calming her down.  
真嗣迅速进入房间，很快看到明日香被安置在一张柔软的白色床上。红发女孩正安稳地睡着，脸上没有一丝不适，只有宁静。男孩搬来一把椅子，移到她身边，决定守候她醒来。他的默默守护很快被一位情绪激动的紫发女子打断，她冲进病房。哭泣的少校跑到真嗣身边，紧紧拥抱他，庆幸驾驶员们没有遭遇不幸。真嗣感激这份安慰，回抱了美里，安抚她的情绪。

Finally, the Tactical Operations Director pulled away from him and wiped her face. "How is Asuka? Is she alright?" Misato asked, concerned.  
终于，战术作战部主任从他身边退开，擦了擦脸。“明日香怎么样？她还好吗？”美里关切地问。

"The doctors said she should pull through just fine" Shinji answered.  
“医生说她应该会没事的。”真嗣回答道。

"That's great news" she replied, relieved. However, the Major's expression was soon replaced with a smirk as she looked at the boy. "Well, there's something else I want to ask you. You see I was quite surprised when I overheard your conversation with Asuka. What was all that stuff you confessed to her about, lover boy?" she asked cheekily.  
“那真是好消息。”她松了口气回答道。然而，少校的表情很快被一丝狡黠所取代，她看着男孩说：“好吧，我还有件事想问你。你知道吗，当我无意中听到你和明日香的对话时，我相当惊讶。你向她坦白的那些事，都是些什么呀，小情人？”她调皮地问道。

Shinji blushed in response to her question. "I think it's best we wait for Asuka to wake up before we discuss it" he replied.  
面对她的问题，真嗣脸红了。“我觉得最好等明日香醒来后再讨论这件事。”他回答道。

"Alright then Shinji" Misato agreed. "You should go change though, you've been in that plugsuit for a while and no doubt the LCL has dried by now. Don't worry about Asuka, I'll watch over her while you're gone" Misato encouraged.  
“那好吧，真嗣。”美里同意了。“不过你应该去换衣服，你穿那件插入栓服已经很久了，LCL 肯定已经干了。别担心明日香，你不在的时候我会照顾她的。”美里鼓励道。

"Ok then. Thanks Misato" Shinji said warmly before exiting the hospital room.  
“好的，谢谢美里小姐。” 真嗣温暖地说道，随后离开了病房。

The boy moved down the corridor and realised he didn't have a change of clothes to dress into. Shinji decided he might as well go back to the NERV changing rooms to change back into his school uniform and get cleaned of LCL. Thus, the male eva pilot walked over to the front counter to request transport back to NERV headquarters. After showing his NERV ID with his pilot status, the vehicle was immediately prepared and Shinji was directed to the car park where he would be picked up.  
男孩沿着走廊走去，意识到自己没有换洗衣物。真嗣决定还是回 NERV 的更衣室换回校服，顺便清洗掉 LCL。于是，这位 EVA 驾驶员走到前台，请求返回 NERV 总部的交通工具。在出示了带有驾驶员身份的 NERV ID 后，车辆立刻准备就绪，真嗣被指引到停车场，他将在那里被接走。

As Shinji left the hospital building, he immediately spotted a standard issue NERV car almost next to the exit of the car park with its engine rumbling; obviously this was his intended transport. The boy quickly went over to the car and opened the back door before entering the car and sitting down. As the driver noticed the boy enter the back, he then sped off towards NERV Headquarters. The driver didn't open conversation with the young boy, he just looked straight ahead and did his job. Shinji didn't mind, talking with NERV employees was always awkward.  
当真嗣离开医院大楼时，他立刻在停车场出口附近看到了一辆标准配置的 NERV 车辆，引擎轰鸣；显然这是为他准备的交通工具。男孩迅速走向车辆，打开后门坐了进去。司机注意到男孩上车后，便加速驶向 NERV 总部。司机没有与少年交谈，只是直视前方，专心驾驶。真嗣并不介意，与 NERV 员工交谈总是有些尴尬。

After they arrived, Shinji exited the car and told the driver to wait here so that he could transport him back to the hospital. The driver nodded in response and turned his engine off while the male eva pilot moved off towards the elevator. The boy entered the elevator and pressed the floor number for the changing rooms and then leaned against the wall as the doors closed and the elevator began its descent. It didn't take too long to arrive at his level and Shinji exited the elevator, heading towards the changing rooms.  
抵达后，真嗣下了车，告诉司机在此等候，以便稍后送他回医院。司机点头回应，熄灭引擎，而这位男性 eva 驾驶员则走向电梯。少年进入电梯，按下更衣室的楼层号码，随后靠在墙上，随着电梯门关闭，开始下降。不久便到达了他的楼层，真嗣走出电梯，朝更衣室走去。

When Shinji arrived at the changing rooms, he quickly stripped off his plugsuit and stepped into the shower to wash himself clean. He found the solitary time quite relaxing as the water poured down all over his body. It was a moment where he didn't have to worry or feel anxious as everything was finally looking up. Soon, Shinji turned off the water and dried himself off before changing into his clothes. Just as he was exiting the changing rooms to go back to the hospital, Rei confronted him. The boy looked curiously at the blue haired girl.  
当真嗣到达更衣室时，他迅速脱下插入栓服，走进淋浴间清洗自己。他发现这段独处时光颇为放松，水流倾泻全身。这是一个无需担忧或感到焦虑的时刻，因为一切终于开始好转。很快，真嗣关掉水，擦干身体，换上衣服。正当他准备离开更衣室返回医院时，绫波拦住了他。少年好奇地看着这位蓝发女孩。

"Ah hello Rei, did you need something?" he asked her.  
“啊，你好，绫波，有什么事吗？”他问她。

"Ikari, I would like to ask you a question. There was something you discussed with Pilot Sohryu that I found incomprehensible" Rei explained.  
"碇君，我想问你一个问题。你和草薙驾驶员讨论的某些内容，我觉得难以理解。" 绫波解释道。

"What's that?" he replied.  
"什么内容？" 他回答道。

"What is 'love'?" she asked.  
"什么是'爱'？" 她问道。

Shinji found her question quite a surprise and just looked at the girl quizzically, trying to think of an answer. "Love is when you really care about someone. Love is when you are happy because the person you love is happy or they are safe. Love is when you wish to be with the person you love forever. This feeling is like that between a mother and her child or a husband and his wife" Shinji answered.  
真嗣发现她的问题颇为意外，只是疑惑地看着女孩，试图想出一个答案。“爱是当你真正关心某人。爱是当你因为所爱的人快乐或安全而感到快乐。爱是当你希望与你爱的人永远在一起。这种感觉就像母子之间或夫妻之间的那种”真嗣回答道。

"I do not understand" Rei said, confused, "I have observed your and Sohryu's behaviour towards each other and it does not fit your definition" Rei explained.  
“我不明白”绫波说，困惑地，“我观察了你和惣流的行为，这与你的定义不符”绫波解释道。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling; even Rei noticed the abnormality of a relationship between him and Asuka. "Well between me and Asuka it's a lot more complicated" he remarked.  
真嗣忍不住轻笑；就连绫波也注意到了他和明日香之间关系的异常。“嗯，我和明日香之间的情况要复杂得多”他评论道。

"Ikari…" she started, hesitating about something.  
"碇君…" 她开口道，有些犹豫。

"Yes?" he encouraged. "嗯？" 他鼓励道。

"If your definition is correct, then that means I love you too" Rei finished.  
"如果你的定义没错，那我也爱你" 绫波说完。

The boy just looked at her utterly shocked.  
男孩只是震惊地看着她。

Noticing the boy's confusion, Rei spoke up again. "I feel at ease when you are safe. I do not wish harm to come upon you. I do not wish to be together, but I am happy you are still alive. I do not really understand this feeling but your definition closely matches it" she clarified.  
注意到男孩的困惑，丽再次开口。“你在身边时我感到安心。我不希望你受到伤害。我不希望我们在一起，但我很高兴你还活着。我不太理解这种感觉，但你的定义与它很接近。”她解释道。

Shinji was truly taken aback by the girl's confession. The conversations between him and her were always quite short and never had they discussed something as deep. The boy wondered what had caused the blue haired girl to open up to him more; perhaps it was just curiosity.  
真嗣被女孩的告白彻底震惊了。他们之间的对话总是很简短，从未涉及如此深层次的话题。男孩想知道是什么让蓝发女孩对他敞开了心扉；也许只是出于好奇。

"Thank you for your attention Ikari" Rei remarked at the boy's silence.  
"谢谢你的关注，真嗣。" 绫波对男孩的沉默评论道。

"No problem at all Rei. And just call me Shinji, that's what people who love each other do" Shinji replied smiling.  
"没什么，绫波。直接叫我真嗣就好，相爱的人都是这么做的。" 真嗣微笑着回答。

"Very well Ika- Shinji" Rei acknowledged. "I must take my leave" she announced bowing, before walking off down the corridor.  
"好的，真嗣。" 绫波点头道。"我得走了。" 她宣布着鞠了一躬，然后沿着走廊离开了。

As the girl walked off, Shinji noticed Rei had also changed out of her plugsuit. He decided he might as well bring Asuka a change of clothes; after all, she would probably be able to leave the hospital soon as she didn't seem to have any injuries. Reentering the changing rooms, Shinji went and grabbed the pile of clothes that Asuka had left behind when she changed into her plugsuit just before the angel battle.  
女孩离开后，真嗣注意到丽也换下了她的插入栓服。他决定还是给明日香带一套换洗衣服；毕竟，她看起来没有受伤，可能很快就能出院了。真嗣再次进入更衣室，拿起明日香在天使战斗前换上插入栓服时留下的那堆衣物。

With Asuka's clothes in hand, Shinji made his way back to the elevator and back up to the surface. The male eva pilot found the car exactly where he had left it and so entered the back again and told the driver to drive back to the hospital. As soon as they arrived, the boy exited the car and rushed off back into the hospital to Asuka's room, wanting to see if she was up already. Stopping at her door, he opened it to see Misato still looking over the redhead.  
手里拿着明日香的衣服，真嗣回到电梯，返回地面。男性 eva 驾驶员发现车子还停在他离开的地方，于是再次进入后座，告诉司机开车回医院。一到医院，男孩就急忙跑回明日香的病房，想看看她是否已经醒了。在她的房门前停下，他打开门，看到美里还在照看红发少女。

"She awake yet?" he asked, standing in the doorway.  
“她醒了吗？”他站在门口问道。

Misato turned to face him. "No, not yet" she replied.  
美里转过身面对他。“不，还没有”她回答道。

"Alright" Shinji replied back, entering the room and closing the door behind him.  
“好吧”真嗣回应着，走进房间并关上了身后的门。

The boy walked over to a nearby table and placed Asuka's clothes on it before taking a chair and sitting down near Asuka's bed. Shinji then took the redhead's hand and held it as he watched over her, hoping she would wake up soon.  
男孩走到附近的一张桌子旁，将明日香的衣物放在上面，然后搬了一把椅子坐在她的床边。真嗣握住红发少女的手，守望着她，希望她能尽快醒来。

Misato looked over at the boy, surprised by his actions. _'This will take some getting used to'_ she thought.  
美里瞥了一眼那个男孩，对他的举动感到惊讶。'这需要一些时间来适应'，她心想。

---

Alone in a room, a boy with glasses was in front of a computer. A flurry of key presses could be heard as the teenage boy typed furiously on a keyboard, trying to get some information. The day's events had left him curious as to what had happened at NERV; he didn't get a chance to see the angel and he also wanted to see if there was anything he could find out about the pilots. Adrenalin pumped through the bespectacled boy's veins as he knew making any mistakes could be disastrous. After retrieving the information he wanted, he quickly removed all traces of himself before severing the connection.  
独自一人在房间里，一个戴眼镜的男孩坐在电脑前。键盘敲击声急促而密集，这位少年正疯狂地敲打着键盘，试图获取一些信息。今天发生的事情让他对 NERV 的情况充满好奇；他没能看到使徒，同时也想了解一些关于驾驶员的信息。肾上腺素在戴眼镜的男孩体内涌动，他知道任何错误都可能导致灾难性的后果。在获取所需信息后，他迅速清除所有痕迹，然后断开了连接。

---

Only a few hours had passed when Asuka stirred and slowly began to sit up. The movement Shinji felt caused him to look up at the young girl; her hand had gripped his tightly before letting go.  
仅仅几个小时过去，明日香开始动弹，缓缓坐起身来。真嗣感受到她的动作，抬头看向这位少女；她的手曾紧紧抓住他的手，随后松开了。

"Asuka?" Shinji said, wondering if she was still asleep as her eyes were closed. Misato also looked up at the young girl when she heard Shinji say her name.  
"明日香？" 真嗣说道，想知道她是否还在睡觉，因为她的眼睛是闭着的。美里听到真嗣说出她的名字时，也抬头看向那个年轻女孩。

The redhead herself gradually opened her eyes and looked around tiredly. "Hmmm, where am I?" she asked, puzzled.  
红发少女本人渐渐睁开眼睛，疲惫地环顾四周。"嗯，我在哪里？"她困惑地问道。

Shinji could not hide his excitement as he quickly jumped onto her bed. "Asuka!" Shinji cried out before kissing her hard on the lips.  
真嗣无法掩饰自己的兴奋，他迅速跳上她的床。"明日香！"真嗣喊道，随即用力吻上了她的唇。

The boy wrapped his arms around her tightly, happy that everything was alright. Asuka was shocked at first, being kissed as soon as she woke up left her confused, but she soon realised what was happening and kissed Shinji back eagerly. Comforting her lover, the redhead moved her hand up and down his back soothingly. Eventually, they parted and Shinji began stroking her hair.  
男孩紧紧地抱住她，庆幸一切都安然无恙。明日香一开始感到震惊，刚醒来就被亲吻让她有些困惑，但她很快意识到发生了什么，便热情地回吻了真嗣。红发的她用手轻抚着他的背，安慰着她的爱人。最终，他们分开，真嗣开始轻抚她的头发。

"Thank God you're ok" Shinji exclaimed happily.  
“谢天谢地你没事。”真嗣高兴地喊道。

"What'd you expect from the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley?" she said boastfully.  
“你还能指望伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷有什么表现呢？”她自豪地说。

The boy chuckled and grinned at her. "That's right. How could I forget?" he replied, hugging her.  
男孩轻声笑了起来，对着她咧嘴一笑。“没错，我怎么可能忘记呢？”他回答道，拥抱着她。

The Major, however, just stood there with her mouth open; the exchange she had just witnessed was one of the largest surprises she had ever had. She knew they had confessed love but it was just a few hours ago, she didn't expect them to go straight for kissing. Not only that, they had done it so casually and with skill; it looked as if they had been kissing each other for a while now. Adding this to their strange behaviour over the past week and some of the things said during their conversation, Misato decided she needed some questions answered.  
然而，玛丽亚少校只是站在那里，嘴巴张得大大的；她刚刚目睹的这一幕是她迄今为止遇到的最大惊喜之一。她知道他们已经表白了爱意，但那不过是几个小时前的事，她没想到他们会直接亲吻。不仅如此，他们还做得如此随意且熟练；看起来他们已经亲吻彼此有一段时间了。再加上过去一周他们的奇怪行为以及对话中的一些话语，美里决定她需要一些问题得到解答。

"Alright, what is going on here?" the older woman asked seriously.  
“好吧，这里到底发生了什么？”这位年长的女士严肃地问道。

"Misato?!" Asuka said jumping; she hadn't realised Misato was in the room. "Err… I was um" she stumbled, unable to think of an excuse.  
“美里？！”明日香惊跳起来；她没意识到美里在房间里。“呃……我刚才，嗯”她结巴着，想不出借口。

"We have a lot to explain" Shinji interrupted. The young girl just looked at Shinji with a strange look. Noticing her gaze, the boy turned to face the redhead. "Asuka, you do realise everyone was listening in on our conversation during the angel battle" he stated.  
“我们有很多要解释的”真嗣打断道。少女只是用一种奇怪的眼神看着真嗣。注意到她的目光，男孩转向红发女孩。“明日香，你该知道大家在天使战斗时都在听我们的对话”他陈述道。

Understanding crossed her face instantly and she blushed. "Oh" was her only response.  
她立刻明白了，脸颊泛红。“哦”是她唯一的回应。

Noticing their reluctance to give any details, the Major spoke up first. "Seeing as you guys don't want to say anything, I'll just ask the questions. First off, what the hell was with that kiss?" Misato asked. "You only _just_ confessed yet you jumped into smooching without hesitation, I was fully expecting to see Asuka yell at you. Plus, no one can kiss that well the first time"  
注意到他们不愿透露细节，少校率先开口。“既然你们不想说，那我就直接问了。首先，那个吻是怎么回事？”美里问道。“你才刚刚表白，就毫不犹豫地亲上了，我还以为会看到明日香对你大吼大叫呢。而且，没人第一次接吻就能那么熟练。”

"This isn't our first time" Shinji replied.  
“这不是我们第一次” 真嗣回答道。

"Oh? So how many times _have_ you kissed?" the Major inquired.  
“哦？那你们接吻过多少次了？”少校追问道。

"Several times" he answered.  
“好几次”他回答道。

"What?" Misato said, shocked at his response.  
“什么？”美里对他的回答感到震惊。

"Look Misato" Asuka started, wanting to get this out of the way as soon as possible. "A week or so ago, well Shinji and I… well we um… we had sex" she finished, blushing slightly.  
“听着，美里”明日香开始说道，想尽快把这件事说清楚。“大约一周前，嗯，真嗣和我……嗯，我们呃……我们发生了关系”她结结巴巴地说完，脸上泛起微微的红晕。

"WHAT?!" Misato repeated louder.  
"什么？！" 美里重复道，声音更大了。

"Calm down Misato" Shinji said quickly.  
"冷静点，美里。" 真嗣迅速说道。

"It's alright, I'm not getting pregnant and it's all fine. Anyway, the reason we've kissed so many times is because ever since our first time we've been screwing each other frequently" Asuka said bluntly.  
"没事的，我不会怀孕的，一切都好。话说回来，我们之所以接吻这么多次，是因为自从第一次之后，我们就经常在一起做爱。" 明日香直截了当地说。

Shinji blushed at the redhead's comment. _'She always did get straight to the point'_ he thought.  
真嗣听到红发女孩的话，脸红了。'她总是这么直截了当' 他想。

"So, you two, out of all people, have been having sex right under my nose?" Misato asked.  
“所以，你们俩，居然在我眼皮底下偷偷做这种事？”美里问道。

"Pretty much" Asuka replied.  
“差不多吧”明日香回答。

"But how does that make sense…? I suppose it explains your odd behaviour over the past week quite a bit, but I cannot fathom you two becoming a couple at all. There definitely must be more to it than that, especially considering you Asuka" Misato remarked. baffled.  
"但那怎么可能说得通…？我想这确实解释了你过去一周的古怪行为，但我实在无法理解你们俩怎么会成为一对。这其中肯定还有更多隐情，尤其是考虑到你，明日香。" 美里评论道，感到困惑。

"What is that supposed to mean?" Asuka asked angrily.  
"那是什么意思？" 明日香生气地问道。

"You yourself cannot deny how difficult of a person you can be Asuka" Misato retorted.  
"你自己也不能否认你有多难相处，明日香。" 美里反驳道。

At this, the redhead stayed silent.  
听到这话，红发女孩沉默了。

"There were times when you were really angry at Shinji. At the sync test last week, in the conversation you had with Shinji, it sounded as if he had done something to you. Just previously in the angel battle, Shinji mentioned starting over. I really have put up with you keeping secrets from me long enough, what could possibly be worse than telling me you had sex?" Misato said, growing increasingly more annoyed.  
"有时候你真的对真嗣很生气。上周的同步测试中，你和他谈话时，听起来好像他对你做了什么。就在刚才与使徒的战斗中，真嗣提到了重新开始。我已经忍受你对我隐瞒太久了，还有什么比告诉我你们发生了关系更糟糕的事吗？" 美里说道，越来越恼火。

"Misato, Asuka just had a serious angel battle, she still needs some rest" Shinji said with finality.  
"美里，明日香刚刚经历了一场激烈的使徒战斗，她还需要休息" 真嗣坚决地说道。

The Major sighed in defeat. "No, you're right. I'm sorry Asuka. It's just the stress of everything that's happened lately has been really hard on me. I suppose that's all I need to know at the moment anyway, we can discuss the details later" Misato said resignedly.  
玛丽少校无奈地叹了口气。“不，你说得对。对不起，明日香。最近发生的一切让我压力很大，真的很艰难。我想我现在只需要知道这些，细节我们可以稍后再讨论。”美里无奈地说道。

At this, both eva pilots sighed in relief.  
听到这话，两位 EVA 驾驶员都松了一口气。

"So Shinji, is she a screamer?" Misato asked jokingly.  
“那么，真嗣，她会尖叫吗？”美里开玩笑地问道。

"Misato!" they both shouted.  
"美里！" 他们齐声喊道。

"Relax, I was kidding. It's just good to see you both happy for once" the older woman said smiling. "Although I am curious about one thing, I asked Ritsuko to do a test on both of you and I know for sure Ritsuko would have discovered if you had been sleeping with someone Asuka, yet she never said anything" Misato remarked.  
"放松，我开玩笑的。只是难得看到你们俩这么开心。" 年长的女人笑着说。"不过我确实好奇一件事，我让律子对你们俩做了个测试，我敢肯定如果你们有谁和别人睡过，律子一定会发现，但她从未提起过。" 美里评论道。

"Mhm, Ritsuko did find out, but I said I'd tell her who my partner was if she didn't report it to anyone. Ritsuko decided it was better than going through all the trouble of finding out who my partner was so she agreed to my deal" Asuka explained.  
"嗯，律子的确发现了，但我告诉她，如果她不向任何人报告，我就告诉她我的伴侣是谁。律子觉得这样比费尽周折找出我的伴侣更省事，所以她同意了我的条件。" 明日香解释道。

"So she knew? Damn you Ritsuko. I was really worried about you guys" Misato replied.  
"所以她知道了？该死的，律子。我真的很担心你们。" 美里回答道。

"Don't blame it on her Misato, I made her promise" Asuka reassured.  
"别怪她，美里，是我让她保证的。" 明日香安慰道。

"Well, I suppose it would be embarrassing for me to find out, I mean it's still just sinking in now. God damn this is just weird" Misato said perplexed.  
"嗯，我想如果是我发现的话，确实会很尴尬，我是说我现在才刚刚接受这个事实。天哪，这真是太奇怪了。" 美里困惑地说。

"You're telling me" Asuka teased.  
“你是说真的？”明日香打趣道。

"Shut up Asuka" Shinji said annoyed.  
“闭嘴，明日香。”真嗣有些恼火地说。

The redhead just laughed in response. The boy could not help smiling as he saw Asuka's joyful expression. Just previously she had been battling for her sanity and it was such a refreshing feeling to see her in such a cheerful mood. Suddenly, all the suffering he had been put through seemed liked nothing now that he had Asuka.  
红发女孩只是笑着回应。看到明日香快乐的表情，男孩忍不住也笑了。就在不久前，她还在为保持理智而战斗，现在看到她如此愉快的心情，真是令人耳目一新。突然间，他所经历的所有痛苦，现在有了明日香，似乎都变得微不足道了。

Grinning mischievously, Shinji tackled the redhead on the bed and pinned her arms down. The boy wasted no time as he began kissing her everywhere; on her lips, her neck and her hair. The young girl moaned in pleasure as the boy continued his actions.  
带着顽皮的笑容，真嗣扑向床上的红发女孩，将她的手臂按住。男孩毫不犹豫地开始亲吻她，从嘴唇到脖子再到头发。年轻女孩在男孩的举动下发出愉悦的呻吟。

"Shinji, not now! Misato's watching!" Asuka exclaimed, struggling underneath the boy.  
“真嗣，现在不行！美里在看着呢！”明日香在男孩身下挣扎着喊道。

"I don't mind" Misato said cheekily.  
“我可不介意。”美里俏皮地说道。

"How many times have I heard you say that Asuka? You even said that at school" Shinji said amused.  
"这话我听你说过多少次了，Asuka？你甚至在学校的时侯也这么说过。" 真嗣笑着说。

"You made out in school?" Misato asked, a little shocked.  
"你们在学校里亲热了？" 美里有些惊讶地问。

"Much more than that too" Shinji answered, laughing.  
"远不止那样呢。" 真嗣笑着回答。

"Shut _up_ Shinji!" Asuka shouted, giving him a menacing glare.  
"闭嘴，真嗣！" 明日香大喊，恶狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

Letting go of Asuka's arms, the boy just continued kissing her lovingly. Shinji then slipped his tongue into her mouth and they began their tongue duel. Misato just watched absolutely astonished at how they could kiss so aptly. The redhead won their duel this time and increased her attack, pressing forward her advantage. After a while, the two teenagers parted slowly and Asuka lay back down on her bed.  
放开明日香的手臂，男孩只是继续深情地吻着她。真嗣随后将舌头滑入她的口中，他们开始了舌尖的较量。美里只是目瞪口呆地看着他们如何如此娴熟地接吻。这次红发女孩赢得了较量，并加强了攻势，扩大了优势。过了一会儿，两个青少年慢慢分开，明日香躺回了自己的床上。

"Ok enough of that already, I want to get some more rest" Asuka said, yawning.  
"好了，够了，我想再休息一会儿。" 明日香说着，打了个哈欠。

"Don't you always want more? Since when does Asuka need rest?" Shinji asked teasingly.  
"你不是总想要更多吗？什么时候轮到明日香需要休息了？" 真嗣打趣地问道。

"Just piss off asshole, I need sleep" Asuka rebuked, pulling her covers around her tightly.  
"滚一边去，混蛋，我需要睡觉" 明日香反驳道，紧紧裹住她的被子。

The Major, who had watched the entire exchange, couldn't stop herself from laughing; this relationship was just comical.  
玛丽少校目睹了整个对话，忍不住笑出声来；这种关系真是滑稽。

"Can I at least sleep here with you Asuka?" Shinji asked a little more pleadingly. Asuka just raised her eyebrows at him. "I'll be alone at home and-" he continued.  
"至少我可以和你一起睡在这里吗，明日香？" 真嗣带着一丝恳求的语气问道。明日香只是挑了挑眉毛看着他。"我一个人在家会很孤单，而且——" 他继续说道。

"Alright fine" Asuka said interrupting him.  
"好吧，好吧" 明日香打断了他。

The redhead lifted up the covers of the bed and let Shinji slip inside next to her. The boy then wrapped his arms the girl, embracing her warmly.  
红发的少女掀起床上的被子，让真嗣滑进她身旁。男孩随即用双臂环抱住女孩，温暖地拥抱着她。

"I'm quite sure you two don't want me joining you two so I'm going to go back to my apartment to sleep. That means I'll be leaving you two alone, I hope I can trust you two to behave" Misato announced warningly.  
"我很确定你们俩不希望我加入，所以我要回公寓睡觉了。这意味着我会让你们俩单独相处，希望我能相信你们俩会规矩点。" 美里警告性地宣布。

"Don't worry Misato, I'll keep Shinji in line" Asuka replied, smirking.  
"别担心美里，我会看好真嗣的" 明日香回答，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

The Major gave the two a quick look before moving over to the door. "Alright then, I guess that's goodnight. Goodbye you two and no funny business, I mean it" Misato commanded, before opening the door and closing it behind her.  
美里少校快速地看了两人一眼，然后走向门口。"好吧，那我想是晚安了。再见你们俩，别搞什么花样，我是认真的" 美里命令道，然后打开门，在她身后关上了门。

The purple haired woman leaned against the door and smiled; maybe she wasn't such a dreadful guardian after all. The joy she felt knowing those two children were finally on good terms with each other was indescribable. Caring for her wards was part of her job but as she got to know the two, she had come to love them as her children. Misato knew that those two children definitely deserved happiness and was glad that had finally gotten it.  
紫发女子倚在门边微笑；或许她并非那么可怕的监护人。得知那两个孩子终于和睦相处，她内心的喜悦难以言表。照顾这些被监护人是她的职责，但随着对他们的了解加深，她已将他们视如己出。美里知道，这两个孩子绝对值得拥有幸福，并为此感到欣慰，他们终于得到了这份幸福。

The Major straightened up and walked over to nurse's office. She told them no one was to enter or disturb the room holding Asuka. After making sure they understood, Misato left the hospital and entered her car. Driving off to the apartment, she decided she would come back in the morning to pick them up.  
少校挺直身姿，走向护士办公室。她吩咐任何人不得进入或打扰关押明日香的房间。确认他们理解后，美里离开医院，进入自己的车中。驱车前往公寓，她决定明早再来接他们。

Omake: 番外：

"Ah hello Rei. Did you need something?" Shinji asked her.  
“啊，丽，你好。你有什么事吗？”真嗣问她。

"Ikari, I would like to ask you a question. There was something you discussed with Pilot Sohryu that I found incomprehensible" Rei explained.  
“碇，我想问你一个问题。你和绫波丽飞行员讨论的有些内容，我觉得难以理解。”丽解释道。

"What's that?" he replied.  
“是什么？”他回答。

"What is love? Oh baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me, no more" she started.  
"什么是爱？哦宝贝，别伤害我。别再伤害我了" 她开始唱道。

The boy just looked at Rei confused as she started singing.  
男孩困惑地看着丽，当她开始唱歌时。

"Oh baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me, no more" she continued.  
"哦宝贝，别伤害我。别再伤害我了" 她继续唱着。

Shinji could not find the words to speak as he saw the blue haired girl start dancing to the song as she sang.  
真嗣看着蓝发女孩随着歌声开始跳舞，却找不到言语来表达自己的心情。

"What is love? Yea-eh…ah oh ah…I don't know why you're not here, I give you my love but you don't care…"  
“什么是爱？耶-诶…啊哦啊…我不知道你为何不在，我给了你我的爱，你却不在乎…”

At this, the boy promptly went over to Rei and kicked his foot through her body. Various metal parts scattered across the floor and the Rei-shaped robot collapsed to the floor stuttering, still trying to sing, her mechanical limbs flailing helplessly as it tried to dance.  
听到这里，男孩立刻走向绫波，一脚穿透了她的身体。各种金属零件散落一地，绫波形状的机器人瘫倒在地，断断续续地试图继续唱歌，机械四肢无助地挥舞着，试图继续跳舞。

"Replace THAT father, you annoying bastard!" Shinji screamed.  
“换掉那个父亲，你这个讨厌的混蛋！”真嗣尖叫道。

End Notes: Yay, they finally got together! The angel fight was somewhat interesting, but it's hard to think of a plausible way to kill an angel in orbit without using the lance. Well maybe someone has a better idea, I'm sure I could think of one if I thought about it for a while.  
尾注：耶，他们终于在一起了！天使之战有些意思，但很难想出一个合理的方法在不使用长矛的情况下杀死轨道上的天使。也许有人有更好的主意，我相信如果我多想一会儿，我也能想出一个来。

Extra Notes: I originally wrote  
额外注释：我最初写的是

_If you don't get the omake don't worry, my sense of humour is always strange. Rei is actually singing a song called 'What is Love?' by Haddaway. When I was rewriting this, that song came into my head as soon as she said "What is love?" and I was like 'YEAH I'LL MAKE THAT INTO AN OMAKE!'  
如果你没看懂番外篇，别担心，我的幽默感向来古怪。丽实际上在唱一首名为《什么是爱？》的歌，由哈达威演唱。当我重写这段时，她一说“什么是爱？”，这首歌就立刻在我脑海中响起，我便想：‘对，我要把它做成番外篇！’_

But at this point in time, the song has already become a meme so I'm sure everyone gets it.  
但到了这个时候，这首歌已经变成了一个网络迷因，所以我相信大家都懂的。

Author's Notes: I originally wrote  
作者的话：我最初写的是

_I can't believe you guys want_ _**more**_ _sex. I had cut out a whole sex scene in an earlier chapter because I thought there was too much. But hey if you want more sex, I'll give you more. It's a little more kinky than usual, but I don't think it's over the top._  
真不敢相信你们还想看更多性爱场面。我之前删掉了一整段性爱场景，因为我觉得太多了。但如果你们想要更多，我会满足你们。这次会有点超出常规，但我觉得并不过分。

But otherwise enjoy, lots of discussion takes place in this chapter (guess the name of the chapter gives that away).  
除此之外，尽情享受吧，这一章有很多讨论（猜猜章节名是不是已经透露了这一点）。

A note to say this is the second rewrite of chapter 6.  
一则说明：这是第六章的第二次重写。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story.

### Chapter 6: Confessions and Discussions  
第六章：告白与讨论

The sun shone through the window into the hospital room with the white walls and floor reflecting the light, illuminating the room. The increasing brightness caused the female occupant to stir, her sleep interrupted. The redhead stretched her arms as she groaned sleepily and slowly began to open her eyes. She could feel two arms wrapped around her and then remembered that Shinji had stayed with her in the hospital; it would seem he had not awoken yet though. Not wanting to get out of his warm embrace, the girl yawned tiredly and closed her eyes, relaxing back into him. Her morning would not go as planned, however, as the redhead suddenly felt a strong urge calling her to the bathroom. Asuka let out an annoyed noise as she realised she was in exactly the same situation as yesterday. She quickly pried his arms off her and attempted to get off the bed only to get pulled back.  
阳光透过窗户洒进医院病房，白色的墙壁和地板反射着光线，照亮了整个房间。越来越亮的亮度让女主人公开始动弹，她的睡眠被打断了。红发女孩伸了伸懒腰，睡意朦胧地呻吟着，慢慢睁开眼睛。她能感觉到两臂环绕着她，然后想起了真嗣在医院里陪着她；不过他似乎还没醒。不想离开他温暖的怀抱，女孩疲惫地打了个哈欠，闭上眼睛，放松地靠回他身上。然而，她的早晨计划注定要泡汤，因为红发女孩突然感到一股强烈的冲动召唤她去洗手间。明日香发出一声懊恼的声音，意识到自己正处在和昨天一模一样的境地。她迅速挣脱他的手臂，试图下床，却被拉了回来。

The redhead sighed in irritation. "God damn it Shinji, I don't want a repeat of this" she said aloud.  
红发女孩不耐烦地叹了口气。“该死的真嗣，我可不想再来一次了。”她大声说道。

The boy, once again, did not stir. _'Note to self; go to the toilet before you go to sleep with Shinji'_ she thought. Unfortunately, Asuka could not just slip out of his hold because her breasts were too large; he was holding her around the waist after all. Never in her life had Asuka regretted having large breasts till now. Deciding not to elbow him again, she instead dug her nails into his arm causing him to instantly release her. The redhead used that moment to jump out of the bed, just in case he somehow grabbed her again. Finally free, Asuka hurried over to the toilet connected to the room and relieved herself. After finishing, the girl returned to the bed and lay down next to Shinji again. The boy placed his arms around her waist again and pulled her towards him with Asuka closing her eyes as she relaxed into the him.  
男孩又一次毫无反应。‘记得睡前先去趟厕所，尤其是和真嗣一起睡的时候。’她心想。不幸的是，明日香无法轻易从他的怀抱中脱身，因为她的胸部太大了；毕竟他是搂着她的腰的。她这辈子从未像现在这样后悔过自己拥有丰满的胸部。决定不再用肘击他，她转而用指甲掐进他的手臂，让他立刻松开了手。红发女孩趁机跳下床，以防他再次抓住她。终于自由了，明日香急忙跑到房间里的厕所解决问题。结束后，女孩回到床上，再次躺在了真嗣旁边。男孩又一次将手臂环绕在她的腰间，将她拉向自己，明日香闭上眼睛，放松地依偎在他怀里。

Her break didn't last long though as the redhead's eyes shot open when she felt his hand on her breast.  
然而，她的安宁并未持续太久，当她感觉到他的手放在她的胸部时，红发女孩的眼睛猛地睁开了。

"A pervert even in sleep" Asuka whispered, rolling her eyes. She couldn't be bothered fighting right now and just allowed his hand to stay there.  
"连睡觉都不老实" 明日香低声说道，翻了个白眼。她现在懒得反抗，任由他的手停留在那里。

It wasn't the end though as the boy began to gently massage her breast while his other hand slowly moved down to her lower region; at that moment, she knew he was awake.  
但这还没完，男孩开始轻轻按摩她的胸部，而另一只手则慢慢向下移动到她的下身；那一刻，她知道他是醒着的。

"Baka, don't even try" Asuka warned.  
"笨蛋，别想耍花招" 明日香警告道。

Shinji laughed at her remark, before stopping his actions. "How'd you know I was awake?" he asked.  
真嗣听到她的话笑了起来，随后停下了动作。“你怎么知道我醒了？”他问道。

"You wouldn't be so bold in your sleep" Asuka explained.  
“你在睡梦中可不会这么大胆。”明日香解释道。

Shinji then scratched his head before answering. "Heh well I'm awake now and we're all alone. Are you sure you don't want to use this chance to do something?" he asked mischievously.  
真嗣挠了挠头，然后回答道：“嘿，我现在醒着，而且我们独处一室。你确定不想趁这个机会做点什么吗？”他调皮地问道。

"I'm quite sure I don't want to have sex in a hospital. Didn't you hear what Misato said anyway?" Asuka refuted.  
"我非常确定我不想在医院里做爱。你难道没听到美里说了什么吗？" 明日香反驳道。

"Ok fine" Shinji said resignedly.  
"好吧，好吧" 真嗣无奈地说。

The boy wasn't going to just lie next to his girlfriend and do nothing though and so he began nuzzling her neck and tickling her stomach softly.  
尽管如此，男孩并不打算只是躺在女朋友旁边什么都不做，于是他开始轻轻地蹭她的脖子，轻挠她的肚子。

The redhead just groaned. "For God's sake, you'll never be happy with just laying down. You just have to do something don't you?" she let out, annoyed.  
红发女孩只是呻吟了一声。“看在上帝的份上，你就不能安安静静躺着吗？你总是得做点什么，不是吗？”她不耐烦地说道。

"Well of course, it's so much fun playing with you. How can I resist the most beautiful girl in the world?" he asked playfully.  
“当然啦，和你玩多有趣啊。我怎么能抗拒世界上最美丽的女孩呢？”他调皮地问道。

"If you can't resist me, then you can't resist obeying my commands either. So get out of the bed right now" Asuka replied, growing tired of his teasing.  
“如果你无法抗拒我，那么你也同样无法抗拒服从我的命令。所以现在就从床上起来。”明日香回答道，对他的戏弄感到厌倦。

"As you wish" he replied, pulling her out of the bed with him and pushing her up against the wall.  
"如你所愿" 他回答道，将她从床上拉起，推到墙边。

Asuka just sighed in irritation. "The bed was warm Shinji" she stated.  
明日香只是恼怒地叹了口气。"床很暖和，真嗣" 她陈述道。

"Well let's keep you warm then" he replied cheekily.  
"那我们就让你保持温暖" 他调皮地回答。

Before the redhead could protest, Shinji brought his lips down onto hers and kissed her hungrily. Reaching down, he began fondling her ass all the while kissing her.  
在红发女孩来得及抗议之前，真嗣便将他的唇压在她的唇上，饥渴地吻着她。他伸手向下，开始抚摸她的臀部，同时继续亲吻她。

"Mmmpff" was all that could be heard from Asuka as Shinji's mouth covered hers. The young girl struggled a little, but was far too sleepy to make any real effort.  
从明日香那里只能听到"嗯嗯呜呜"的声音，因为真嗣的嘴覆盖了她的。少女挣扎了一下，但实在太困了，无法做出真正的反抗。

Fortunately, the redhead was soon saved from her "torment" when the door to their room opened. "Getting a good feel Shinji?" Misato asked as she walked into the room.  
幸运的是，红发女孩很快从她的"折磨"中被解救出来，当他们房间的门打开时。"感觉不错吧，真嗣？"美里一边走进房间一边问道。

Upon hearing his guardian's voice, Shinji instantly moved off of Asuka. "Ah Misato I was… um…" he replied scratching his head, unable to think of an excuse.  
听到监护人的声音，真嗣立刻从明日香身上移开。“啊，美里小姐，我刚才……呃……”他挠着头，想不出借口。

"I can't believe you're such a naughty little boy Shinji, what did I tell you just last night?" Misato teased.  
“真不敢相信你这么调皮，真嗣，昨晚我才跟你说过什么？”美里打趣道。

"Sorry Misato" the boy replied, smiling sheepishly.  
“对不起，美里小姐。”男孩尴尬地笑着回答。

"You just can't rely on men to keep their word you know" Asuka said, annoyed.  
“你就是不能指望男人守信，你知道的。”明日香带着恼意说道。

The Major chuckled at the redhead's comment before responding. "Yeah yeah, I know. Well anyway I've come to take you guys home" Misato announced. At this, both eva pilots looked at her surprised; Asuka had only been here one night. "I've already checked Asuka out so she can leave" Misato explained, noticing their faces.  
美里少校对红发少女的话轻声一笑，然后回应道：“是啊是啊，我知道。总之，我是来接你们回家的。”听到这话，两位 EVA 驾驶员都惊讶地看着她；明日香才刚在这里待了一晚。“我已经办好明日香的出院手续了，她可以离开。”美里解释道，注意到他们的表情。

"What? Every time I even get just a scratch, I have to stay for at least _three_ days" Shinji whined.  
“什么？每次我哪怕只是擦破点皮，都得至少住上三天。”真嗣抱怨道。

"Well, that's because I'm not a crybaby" Asuka remarked.  
"嗯，那是因为我不是个爱哭鬼。" 明日香说道。

"I'm not a crybaby!" Shinji replied defiantly.  
"我不是爱哭鬼！" 真嗣反驳道，语气中带着倔强。

"Children please, I'm not going to stand here all day. Let's go already" Misato snapped, growing tired of their bickering.  
"孩子们，拜托了，我可不想在这里站一整天。我们走吧" 美里不耐烦地打断了他们的争吵。

"I am _not_ going home in a hospital gown!" Asuka retorted.  
"我才不要穿着医院的病号服回家！" 明日香反驳道。

"That's really not my problem, we don't have any of your clothes for you to change into" Misato replied.  
"那真的不是我的问题，我们没有你的衣服让你换上" 美里回答道。

"Actually we do Misato, I brought back Asuka's clothes after I came back from the changing rooms remember?" Shinji reminded Misato.  
"实际上我们有，美里，我记得我从更衣室回来时带回了明日香的衣服，对吧？" 真嗣提醒美里。

Recollection crossed the Major's face as she remembered the boy bringing in some clothes and placing them on the table. "Ah yeah, you left them on the table" Misato replied.  
回忆掠过美里少校的脸庞，她记起那个男孩拿着一些衣服进来，放在桌子上。“啊，对了，你把它们放在桌子上了。”美里回答道。

"Good boy" Asuka said, patting Shinji's head.  
“好孩子。”明日香说着，拍了拍真嗣的头。

"See? I can be useful Asuka" Shinji replied, sticking his tongue out at her. "Now, as a reward I'll just-" he started, before having a hospital gown thrown at him.  
“看吧？我也能派上用场，明日香。”真嗣回答，向她吐了吐舌头。“现在，作为奖励，我就——”他刚开口，就被一件医院病号服扔了过来。

"Since you like being useful, you can get rid of that for me" Asuka said sweetly.  
"既然你喜欢有用，那就帮我处理掉那个吧" 明日香甜甜地说道。

The boy didn't mind at all; Asuka standing naked in front of him was good enough of a reward.  
男孩一点也不介意；明日香赤裸地站在他面前已经是足够的奖励了。

"What are you doing Asuka?! Shinji's right next to you!" Misato said alarmed at the redhead stripping in front of the boy.  
"你在干什么明日香？！真嗣就在你旁边！" 美里惊慌地看着红发女孩在男孩面前脱衣服。

"Misato, we've had sex remember? As such, I've seen her naked many times already. She doesn't care" Shinji explained before cupping Asuka's breast with one hand.  
"美里，我们有过性关系，记得吗？所以我已经看过她裸体很多次了。她不在乎" 真嗣解释道，然后用一只手握住了明日香的一只乳房。

Having been taken by surprise, Asuka blushed deeply at the contact before smacking him across the face.  
被突如其来的举动吓了一跳，明日香因接触而脸颊通红，随即一巴掌扇在了他的脸上。

"Shinji, if you do another public display, I swear I'll kill you!" Asuka growled. "Hand over my clothes so I can get changed already. Being naked around you seems to just increase your stupidity" she snapped.  
"真嗣，如果你再在公共场合这样展示，我发誓我会杀了你！" 明日香咆哮道。"把我的衣服给我，我好换上。在你面前裸体似乎只会增加你的愚蠢" 她厉声说道。

"Alright alright" Shinji replied, chuckling.  
“好了好了。”真嗣笑着回答。

Misato didn't know whether to laugh at Asuka or just stand there shocked at what Shinji had just done to her. It seemed the latter prevailed as the Major stood there unmoving, her face carrying a surprised expression.  
美里不知道是该笑明日香，还是就那么震惊地站在那里，对真嗣刚刚对她做的事感到不可思议。似乎后者占了上风，美里站在那里一动不动，脸上带着惊讶的表情。

The boy seemed to notice her expression and spoke up. "Don't worry about her Misato. As much as she says doesn't like it, she actually loves it" Shinji said cheekily.  
男孩似乎注意到了她的表情，开口说道：“别担心她，美里。她虽然嘴上说不喜欢，其实心里很享受的。”真嗣调皮地说。

"Shinji! Don't make me repeat myself!" Asuka shouted angrily at him.  
"真嗣！别让我重复自己！" 明日香生气地对他喊道。

This time, the male eva pilot promptly went over to the table and dropped the hospital gown on it before picking up the clothing he had brought from the changing rooms. Shinji quickly moved back over to Asuka and kneeled down in front of her mockingly, before handing over the clothes to her.  
这次，男性 eva 驾驶员迅速走到桌前，将医院长袍扔在上面，然后拿起从更衣室带来的衣服。真嗣迅速回到明日香身边，戏谑地跪在她面前，然后将衣服递给她。

"As you commanded" he said playfully.  
"如您所愿" 他调皮地说道。

"You're really asking to get injured Shinji" Asuka said, rolling her eyes at his behaviour.  
"你真是自找苦吃，真嗣" 明日香说道，对他的行为翻了个白眼。

The redhead wasted no time in putting on her undergarments, wanting nothing more than to have some clothes on her.  
红发女孩毫不犹豫地穿上她的内衣，只希望能尽快穿上衣服。

"I think you look just fine in only your underwear" Shinji commented.  
"我觉得你只穿内衣就很好看" 真嗣评论道。

The young girl just ignored him and grabbed her skirt, putting it on. Asuka was soon confused though as she could not find where the upper half of her clothes were.  
那年轻女孩只是无视了他，抓起自己的裙子穿上。但不久后，明日香就感到困惑，因为她找不到上衣的另一半。

"Where's my shirt Shinji?" the redhead asked.  
“我的衬衫呢，真嗣？”红发女孩问道。

"I didn't give it to you?" he replied.  
“我没给你吗？”他回答道。

Asuka shook her head in response. Shinji looked back at the table and noticed only the hospital gown; he must not have picked it up, dropped her shirt on the way back when he was carrying it back to the hospital or left it in the car.  
明日香摇了摇头作为回应。真嗣回头看向桌子，只发现了医院的病号服；他一定是没拿，可能在回来的路上不小心掉了，或者忘在车里了。

"Either I dropped it by accident or I didn't pick it up, sorry Asuka" Shinji explained.  
“要么是我不小心掉了，要么是我没拿，对不起，明日香。”真嗣解释道。

Asuka glared at the boy with both anger and suspicion. "Always so useless" she said, annoyed. "Well at least this is better than the hospital gown"  
明日香带着愤怒和怀疑瞪着男孩。“总是这么没用。”她不悦地说，“不过至少这比医院的病号服好。”

"You can take my coat" Misato offered, taking off her red jacket.  
"你可以穿我的外套" 美里提议道，脱下了她的红色夹克。

"At least someone can think" the redhead said as she took the jacket and put it on. "Ok let's go already. I'm sick of this place"  
"至少有人能动动脑子" 红发女孩说着接过夹克穿上。"好了，我们快走吧。我受够这个地方了"

The three roommates left the room and head down the corridor towards the exit. With Asuka having already been checked out by the Major, the trio just went straight out. Upon exiting, Asuka shivered a little from the cold as she wasn't wearing a shirt; the jacket didn't cover her enough. Shinji held the redhead close to him in an attempt to keep her warm. Walking quickly over to Misato's car, they all got into the car and closed their doors. Turning on the engine, Misato then turned on the heater. The Major then reversed out of her parking spot and exited the car park, heading towards their apartment.  
三位室友离开了房间，沿着走廊向出口走去。由于明日香已经被美里少校检查过，三人直接走了出去。一出门，明日香因寒冷而微微颤抖，她没穿衬衫，夹克遮盖得不够。真嗣紧紧搂住红发女孩，试图让她暖和些。他们快步走向美里的车，所有人都上了车并关上车门。美里启动引擎，然后打开了暖气。少校随后倒车离开停车位，驶出停车场，朝着他们的公寓驶去。

"So do your friends at school know about your relationship?" Misato asked while driving.  
"那么，你在学校的朋友们知道你们的关系吗？" 美里一边开车一边问道。

"No, it would be a bit difficult with the way things are at the moment" Asuka replied.  
"不，现在这种情况有点难说出口。" 明日香回答道。

"Ok, so this was a secret to everyone. Though I'm sure you understand that as your guardian _I_ at least need to know what happened. When we get back home, we're gonna have a talk as I need some explanations, so prepare yourself now. I don't want you doing anything in my house either so we might have to work out something there too" Misato explained.  
"好吧，看来这是对所有人保密的事。不过我相信你明白，作为你的监护人，至少我需要知道发生了什么。等我们回家后，我们得好好谈谈，我需要一些解释，所以现在就做好准备。我也不希望你在我的房子里做任何事，所以我们可能还得在那方面达成一些共识。" 美里解释道。

Both eva pilots sighed; they had both been dreading this moment.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员同时叹了口气；他们俩都一直害怕这一刻的到来。

They arrived at the apartment all too soon and Misato parked the car on their street. Exiting the car, Shinji picked Asuka up and carried her bridal style, before closing the door with his foot. The redhead had been taken by surprise and did not struggle in case he dropped her.  
他们到达公寓的速度快得令人不安，美里把车停在了他们住的街道上。下车后，真嗣抱起明日香，以新娘抱的方式，然后用脚关上了车门。红发女孩被这突如其来的举动吓了一跳，没有挣扎，生怕他会把她摔下来。

"Just what are you doing Shinji?" Asuka asked, irritated.  
“你到底在干什么，真嗣？”明日香不悦地问道。

"Carrying my beautiful girlfriend" he replied.  
"抱着我漂亮的女朋友" 他回答道。

"I can walk just fine thank you. Why must you aggravate me so?" the redhead asked, sighing.  
"我走得很好，谢谢。你为何总要惹我生气呢？" 红发女孩叹息着问道。

"Because you're so adorable when you're aggravated" he teased.  
"因为你生气的时候太可爱了" 他打趣道。

Asuka pinched his ear in response. "I'm also violent when I'm aggravated, are you sure it's a good idea to tempt me?" she asked, narrowing her eyes at him.  
明日香回应地捏了捏他的耳朵。“我生气时也很暴力，你确定要惹我吗？”她眯起眼睛看着他问道。

The boy gave a weak laugh and continued to carry her. Ignoring her warning, Shinji moved his face down to hers and kissed her.  
男孩虚弱地笑了笑，继续抱着她。无视她的警告，真嗣将脸凑近她的，轻轻吻了她。

"Traitor!" someone shouted out all of sudden, causing the two teens to part instantly.  
“叛徒！”突然有人大喊一声，让两个少年立刻分开了。

As Shinji looked over to the source of the voice, he saw Kensuke waiting outside their apartment. _'Shit! I don't think we can explain our way out of this one'_ he thought.  
当真嗣循声望去，他看到健介在他们公寓外等着。'该死！我觉得这次我们没法解释清楚了' 他心想。

"This is your fault Shinji" Asuka said to him quietly.  
“这都是你的错，真嗣。”明日香轻声对他说。

"I know" Shinji replied. “我知道。”真嗣回答道。

The male eva pilot let Asuka down as Kensuke walked up to them.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员让明日香下来，这时健介走向他们。

"Since when did you get together with the demon?!" Kensuke asked.  
“你们什么时候在一起的，和那个魔女？！”健介问道。

"She's not a demon" Shinji replied.  
“她不是魔女。”真嗣回答道。

"How can you say that? You are the butt of all her jokes and insults Shinji!" Kensuke said in disbelief. The bespectacled boy then turned to face Asuka. "You must be tempting him! Look at your attire! You're just using your body to get to him! Seduction is a weapon women use all the time!"  
"你怎么能这么说？你可是她所有笑话和侮辱的靶子，真嗣！" 眼镜少年健介难以置信地说道。随后他转向明日香，"你肯定是在诱惑他！看看你的穿着！你只是在利用身体接近他！诱惑是女人常用的手段！"

"Mind not coming to ridiculous conclusions without knowing anything?!" Asuka snapped.  
"别在不了解任何情况的情况下就妄下结论，行不行？！" 明日香厉声反驳。

"Well _you_ tell me what's going on then! You insult him at every given moment Sohryu and now I see him carrying you AND you're _kissing_" Kensuke rebuked.  
"那你倒是告诉我发生了什么！你每时每刻都在侮辱他，惣流，现在我看到他抱着你，你还亲他" 健介反驳道。

"It's complicated, I didn't expect this would happen either" Asuka replied.  
"情况很复杂，我也没料到会这样" 明日香回答道。

"What do you mean?" Kensuke asked.  
"你什么意思？" 健介问道。

"I don't have to explain it to you. What me and Shinji do doesn't concern you" Asuka refuted before turning away and pulling Shinji with her.  
"我没必要向你解释。我和真嗣的事与你无关" 明日香反驳后转身拉着真嗣离开了。

The military otaku was not about to give up though and he moved in front of the redhead. "It _does_ concern me!" he shouted. "Shinji is my friend and I can't help but worry about what's happening to him"  
这位军事宅男并未打算放弃，他走到红发少年面前。“这确实让我担心！”他大声说道，“真嗣是我的朋友，我无法不担心他现在的情况。”

The purple haired woman was growing anxious, but she didn't want to be rude and tell him off. "Listen Mr. Aida, Shinji is fine. Even though I am also confused about this ordeal as well, I am pretty sure Shinji is willingly with Asuka" she explained, giving him a warm smile.  
紫发女子越来越焦虑，但她不想失礼地赶他走。“听着，相田先生，真嗣没事。虽然我也对这件事感到困惑，但我很确定真嗣是自愿和明日香在一起的。”她解释道，给了他一个温暖的微笑。

The bespectacled boy almost melted under the older woman's smile, but his friendship with Shinji overrode his crush on the Major. "So they _are_ together!" Kensuke let out.  
戴着眼镜的男孩几乎在这位年长女性的微笑下融化了，但与真嗣的友谊战胜了他对这位少校的迷恋。“所以他们在一起了！”健介松了一口气。

"Nice one Misato" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“干得不错，美里。”明日香讽刺地说道。

"Look Kensuke, I appreciate your concern but it's unnecessary. I'm quite alright. Asuka hasn't done anything at all" Shinji reassured.  
“看吧，健介，我理解你的关心，但这真的没必要。我很好，明日香什么都没做。”真嗣安慰道。

"Well then, what's the problem with telling me?" Kensuke rebuked. Silence followed as there wasn't really an easy way to answer that question. Noticing their silence, he spoke up again. "You may trust her but I still don't, even if she hasn't done anything to you yet. Asuka could easily be fooling you!" Kensuke continued.  
“那好吧，告诉我有什么问题呢？”健介反驳道。一阵沉默，因为确实没有简单的方式来回答这个问题。注意到他们的沉默，他又开口了。“你可能信任她，但我仍然不信任，即使她现在还没对你做什么。明日香很可能在欺骗你！”健介继续说道。

The situation was getting quite out of hand; some people had started looking over at the commotion and none of them wanted people to start swarming them. "Please calm down Kensuke, you're making a scene. We've got school tomorrow, we can talk then" Shinji said, trying to persuade him.  
情况变得相当失控；有些人已经开始朝这边骚动看过来，他们都不希望人群开始涌向他们。“请冷静下来， Kensuke，你在制造骚动。我们明天还要上学，到时候我们可以谈。” Shinji 说道，试图说服他。

"If you can talk to me tomorrow, you can talk to me today! It just sounds like you're hiding something!" Kensuke shouted even louder.  
“如果你明天能和我谈，今天就能谈！听起来你只是在隐瞒什么！” Kensuke 更大声地喊道。

"Ok fine, just come with us! We're about to have a discussion about this with Misato, you're not the only one who's confused. You can hear us out yourself" Shinji said, giving in.  
“好吧，那就跟我们来吧！我们正要和 Misato 讨论这件事，你不是唯一一个感到困惑的人。你可以亲自听听我们的讨论。” Shinji 让步道。

"What?! You can't be serious Shinji!" Asuka said, opposing the idea. "He'll just tell everyone at school!"  
"什么？！你不是认真的吧，真嗣！" 明日香反对这个主意，"他只会把学校里的人都告诉！"

"We are wasting time just standing around here!" Misato announced, growing annoyed.  
"我们站在这里浪费时间！" 美里宣布，越来越不耐烦。"

Seeing only one compromise, the male eva pilot turned to his friend. "Listen Kensuke, we'll let you in on only one condition" Shinji said, looking at his friend seriously. "You _must_ promise not to mention this to Touji, Hikari or anyone else at school. Nothing about what you just saw or what you are going to hear"  
看到只有一个妥协方案，男性 eva 驾驶员转向他的朋友。"听着，健介，我们只会在一个条件下让你参与进来" 真嗣认真地看着他的朋友说，"你必须承诺不向铃木、光或者学校里的任何人提起这件事。关于你刚才看到的和你即将听到的，一个字都不能提"

"You can't trust him with that!" Asuka refuted. "He'll just agree now and then go yapping off later!"  
"你不能相信他！" 明日香反驳道，"他现在答应得好好的，转头就会到处乱说！"

"He's my friend. If he promises me, then I'll trust him" Shinji replied, eyeing the redhead.  
"他是我的朋友。如果他向我承诺，那我就相信他。" 真嗣回答，目光投向红发女孩。"

"Fine, but it's your fault if anything happens!" the redhead growled before crossing her arms over her chest and staring down at the military otaku.  
"好吧，但要是出了什么事，可都是你的错！" 红发女孩咆哮着，双臂交叉在胸前，低头瞪着那位军事宅。"

"Kensuke, this is your only chance" Shinji prompted.  
"健介，这是你唯一的机会" 真嗣催促道。

Kensuke hesitated as he could feel Asuka's intense gaze wearing down on him. Pushing his glasses up to his nose, he then looked up at Shinji. "I accept your condition, I promise not to tell anyone about this" he said, agreeing to their request. "But don't think for a second that I support this relationship"  
健介犹豫着，他能感觉到明日香锐利的目光正穿透着他。他推了推眼镜，然后抬头看向真嗣。"我接受你的条件，我保证不会告诉任何人这件事" 他说道，同意了他们的请求。"但别以为我会支持这段关系"

"That's fine" Shinji said in response.  
"那没关系" 真嗣回应道。

"Now that you've finally cleared everything up, can we go in already? No more prolonging" Misato said impatiently.  
"既然你终于把一切都解释清楚了，我们现在可以进去了吗？别再拖延了" 美里不耐烦地说道。

"Hold your horses Misato, it's not like we knew Kensuke would be here" Asuka snapped.  
"别急，美里，我们又不知道健介会在这里" 明日香厉声说道。

"Let's not start another fight" Shinji quickly said, "And Misato, this won't be easy for us so don't rush us"  
"我们别再吵了" 真嗣迅速说道，"而且美里，这对我们来说不容易，所以别催我们"

"Sorry sorry" Misato apologised. "But you must understand my position, so can we please just get inside?" she entreated.  
“对不起对不起。”美里道歉道，“但你必须理解我的立场，我们能不能先进去再说？”她恳求道。

Asuka sighed. "Alright, let's get this over with already"  
明日香叹了口气。“好吧，让我们赶紧解决这件事。”

Thus, the four of them entered the apartment building and got into the elevator. After pressing the button for their floor, the elevator doors closed and the elevator began its ascent. It didn't take long for the elevator to arrive at their level and the four of them got out before heading over to their door. Misato opened the door and let the other three in before getting in herself and closing the door behind her.  
于是，四人进入了公寓楼，搭乘电梯。按下楼层按钮后，电梯门关闭，开始上升。不久，电梯到达了他们的楼层，四人走出电梯，朝他们的房门走去。美里打开门，让其他三人先进去，然后自己也跟着进去，并关上了门。

"I think we should all sit down at the dining table to discuss this" Misato suggested.  
"我觉得我们应该都坐到餐桌旁来讨论这件事。" 美里提议道。

The three teens all nodded in response and went over to the dining table before sitting down. The Major went into the kitchen and brought back two glasses of water before setting them down in front of Shinji and Asuka and sitting down at the table herself. There was complete silence as both eva pilots were hesitant to start; neither knowing where to begin or what to say. The purple haired woman waited patiently before breaking the silent pause.  
三个少年都点头回应，走到餐桌前坐下。美里少校走进厨房，拿回两杯水，放在真嗣和明日香面前，然后自己也在桌旁坐下。两人都犹豫不决，不知道从何说起，餐桌上一片寂静。紫发女子耐心等待，终于打破了沉默。

"Well first things first, when did this relationship begin? What caused it?" Misato asked gently.  
"首先，这个关系是什么时候开始的？是什么引发的？" 美里温和地问道。

Asuka sighed before speaking up. "I well…" she began. The redhead took the glass of water in front of her and drank some of the liquid before clearing her throat and starting again. "It happened a week or so ago. I was shouting at Shinji to make dinner for me and I was just… really angry that day, so I began to taunt and insult him as well"  
明日香叹了口气，然后开口说道：“我嘛……”她开始讲述。红发女孩拿起面前的水杯，喝了几口水，清了清嗓子，重新开始。“那是一周左右前的事了。我当时正对着真嗣大喊，让他给我做晚饭，那天我真的很生气，所以就开始嘲讽和侮辱他。”

"Typical" Kensuke said instantly.  
“典型的” 真希斗立刻说道。

"Shhh" Misato said, silencing the boy. "Please continue Asuka" she encouraged.  
“嘘” 美里说，让男孩安静下来。“请继续，明日香” 她鼓励道。

"At first it was nothing out of ordinary, he was just doing his usual sorry act, but with more taunts he seemed to get quite annoyed and I goaded him even further. I was just so… pissed off by his fake personality and so I told him to stop pretending to be such a good boy and that he was just like his father, manipulating everyone around him" Asuka continued and then paused.  
"起初这没什么不寻常的，他只是在表演他那套惯常的道歉戏码，但随着更多的嘲讽，他似乎变得相当恼火，而我更是火上浇油。我只是对他那虚伪的个性感到如此……愤怒，所以我告诉他别再装成一个好孩子了，他就像他父亲一样，操纵着身边的每一个人" 明日香继续说道，然后停顿了一下。

"I can see Shinji getting upset over your insults as he is nothing like the Commander, but I fail to see what this has to do with your relationship" Misato said, puzzled.  
"我能看到真嗣因为你的侮辱而感到难过，他根本不像司令，但我看不出这和你们的关系有什么关系" 美里困惑地说道。

"Let me finish" Asuka replied, annoyed.  
"让我说完" 明日香不耐烦地回答道。

"Ok sorry" Misato apologised.  
“好吧，抱歉。”美里道歉道。

"Well you're right about Shinji, only he got quite mad. That was the first time I had ever seen him that furious. He also had a knife in his hand from washing the dishes, so I started backing away. That was when he… he um…" Asuka said, trailing off.  
“嗯，你说的对，关于真嗣，他确实非常生气。那是我第一次见他那么愤怒。他手里还拿着洗碗用的刀，所以我开始后退。就在那时，他……他呃……”明日香说着，声音渐渐小了下去。

"He what?" Misato prompted, feeling a little uncomfortable as to where this was heading.  
“他怎么了？”美里追问，感到有些不安，不知道这话题会引向何方。

Asuka opened and closed her mouth but could not find it within herself to say it and stayed silent. Her arms were shaking as she recalled that day, there was no way should could say it out loud.  
明日香张了张嘴，却发现自己无法说出口，只得保持沉默。她的手臂因回想起那天而颤抖，她绝不可能大声说出来。

Shinji noticed her condition and reluctance and decided to say it for her as he was the one who did it anyway. "I raped her" he said quietly.  
真嗣注意到了她的状况和犹豫，决定替她说出来，毕竟是他做的。“我强奸了她。”他轻声说道。

Two pairs of jaws immediately dropped to the floor.  
两对下巴立刻掉到了地上。

"You WHAT?!" Misato shouted in disbelief, wanting to make sure she had heard right.  
"你说什么？！" 美里难以置信地喊道，想要确认自己没有听错。

"I raped her… I violently assaulted her and then… raped her" Shinji said louder.  
"我强奸了她……我暴力侵犯了她，然后……强奸了她" 真嗣提高了声音说道。

At this point, both Shinji and Asuka had their heads downcast; it was obviously something they both did not want to recall. A long silence had stretched out as the other two digested the information; it just didn't appear at all possible to them. In the end there really _was_ something worse than admitting they had sex after all.  
此时，真嗣和明日香都低垂着头；显然，这是他们俩都不愿回忆的事情。长时间的沉默蔓延开来，另外两人在消化这个信息；这完全超出了他们的想象。最终，确实有比承认他们发生性关系更糟糕的事情。

"Shin-man… I know Asuka's bad but you… you did _that_ to her?" Kensuke asked, unable to believe it.  
"真嗣…我知道明日香不好，但你…你对她做了那种事？" 健介问道，难以置信。

"Yeah… I did…" Shinji answered, trailing off, unable to say anything else; he didn't want his friend to think badly of him but he wasn't going to give any excuses for what he had done either.  
"是的…我做了…" 真嗣回答，声音渐渐低下去，无法再说更多；他不想让朋友对他有坏印象，但也不打算为所做的事找任何借口。

Misato now felt bad towards Asuka as she realised all the stuff she had said and thought about her had been false accusations as all along, it had been Shinji who was the culprit. Immediately, guilt tore through the Major; it had happened in her own residence while she was out, her own negligence was at fault. Although to be fair, she would never in her life had expected something like this to happen.  
美里现在对明日香感到内疚，因为她意识到自己之前所说的和所想的一切都是错误的指控，而真正的罪魁祸首一直是真嗣。立刻，愧疚感撕裂了美里；这一切发生在她自己的住所，而她当时不在，是她的疏忽导致的。虽然公平地说，她一生中从未预料到会发生这样的事情。

"I don't understand Shinji… why… how could you?" Misato asked, utterly shocked; her eyes watering and tears threatening to form in her eyes.  
"我不明白，真嗣……为什么……你怎么能这样？" 美里问道，完全震惊了；她的眼睛湿润，泪水似乎随时可能涌出。

The male eva pilot looked away before answering. "I-I ask myself that same question all the time. I knew I had done something unforgivable as soon as it was over. I knew it was something I should never ever do before I even did it, but all I could think of at the time was… how much she deserved it. I don't… I don't think I'll ever fully understand what made me go through with it" Shinji admitted.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员移开了视线，然后回答道。"我-我一直在问自己同样的问题。我知道一旦事情结束，我就做了不可原谅的事。我知道那是我永远不该做的事，但在当时，我满脑子想的都是……她有多么应得。我不……我不认为我会完全明白是什么驱使我这么做的" 真嗣承认道。

"Shinji… rape is a _very_ serious offence; you go to jail for that. What you did was absolutely horrible! If Asuka had told me what had happened, I would have punished you severely" Misato said seriously. "In fact, I still think you should be punished harshly, what you did was inexcusable and the damage you caused Asuka is irreversible" Misato continued angrily.  
"真嗣……强奸是非常严重的罪行；你会因此入狱的。你所做的事绝对可怕！如果明日香告诉我发生了什么，我会严厉惩罚你" 美里严肃地说。"事实上，我仍然认为你应该受到严厉的惩罚，你所做的事是不可原谅的，你对明日香造成的伤害是不可逆转的" 美里愤怒地继续说道。

"Don't think I don't know!" Shinji replied, his voice cracking. "I was just so stupid and blinded by rage. There is absolutely no excuse for what I did! Even though I regretted what I did as soon as it was over, I was also scared of what you would think of me. I just… couldn't bring myself to tell you Misato" he said, his head hanging in shame.  
"别以为我不知道！" 真嗣回答，声音有些颤抖。"我只是太愚蠢，被愤怒蒙蔽了双眼。我做的事没有任何借口！尽管我一做完就后悔了，我也害怕你会怎么看我。我只是……无法鼓起勇气告诉你，美里。" 他说着，羞愧地低下了头。

"Did you ever once think about how _Asuka_ felt?!" Misato shouted, standing up.  
"你有没有想过明日香是什么感受？！" 美里喊道，站了起来。

"Of course I did!" Shinji replied, tears running down his cheeks. "That's why I've been feeling terribly guilty ever since" he continued, unable to look into Misato's face.  
"当然有！" 真嗣回答，泪水顺着脸颊流下。"正因为如此，自从那以后我一直感到非常内疚。" 他继续说，不敢直视美里的脸。

The Major then leaned on the table, using her hands as support. "The _only_ reason I haven't separated you two yet is because Asuka wants to stay with you. But mark my words Shinji, if that hadn't been the case, I wouldn't have been able to restrain myself!" she said, slamming the table with her hands.  
玛丽少校随后靠在桌子上，双手作为支撑。“我之所以还没有把你们俩分开，唯一的原因是明日香想和你在一起。但记住我的话，真嗣，如果不是这样，我早就无法克制自己了！”她边说边用手猛拍桌子。

"That's enough Misato. Believe me when I say he knows well enough. I completely understand your concern but I'm already over what happened" Asuka reassured, calming down the older woman.  
“够了，美里。相信我，他很清楚。我完全理解你的担忧，但我已经放下了那件事。”明日香安慰道，让年长的女性平静下来。

The Major sat back down and sighed; even though her anger was justified, she knew there wasn't much point in taking it out so hard on him now. Seeing that Shinji hadn't spoken one word to defend himself and was currently looking at his feet, she decided to give him a little break and turned to face Asuka; she was more concerned about the incident's effect on the redhead anyway.  
少校坐回原位，叹了口气；尽管她的愤怒有理，但她知道现在对他发这么大火没什么意义。看到真嗣一言不发，只是低头看着自己的脚，她决定给他一点喘息的机会，转而面对明日香；毕竟，她更关心的是这次事件对红发女孩的影响。

"Yeah, sorry it's just… this an extremely serious matter. Speaking of which… how did you take it Asuka?" Misato gently asked her. "Of course, you don't have to tell us if you don't want to" she added.  
"嗯，抱歉，只是……这是一件非常严重的事情。说到这个……你是怎么看待的呢，明日香？" 美里温柔地问她。"当然，如果你不想说，可以不用告诉我们" 她补充道。

"I… I don't feel comfortable talking about that in front of Kensuke" Asuka replied.  
"我……我不太想在真嗣面前谈论这个" 明日香回答道。

"Are you suggesting that I leave?" Kensuke asked.  
"你是想让我离开吗？" 真嗣问道。

The redhead simply nodded in response.  
红发少女只是简单地点了点头作为回应。

"But you promised to explain to me what was going on" Kensuke instantly replied.  
“但你答应过要向我解释发生了什么”，健介立刻回答道。

"Well… this is very personal. All you wanted to know was what happened and if Shinji was ok. You now know that he… well you know what… and now we are a couple, that's basically the gist of what's happened. As Shinji was not the victim, I think you realise now that I didn't do anything bad to get him" Asuka shot back.  
“嗯……这是非常私人的事情。你只想知道发生了什么以及真嗣是否安好。你现在知道他……嗯，你知道的……而现在我们是一对，基本上这就是发生的事情的要点。既然真嗣不是受害者，我想你现在明白我没有对他做任何坏事来得到他。”明日香反击道。

The bespectacled boy paused for a moment at her response before speaking up. "But I still want to know the full story" Kensuke replied.  
戴眼镜的男孩在她回答后停顿了一下，然后开口道：“但我还是想知道完整的故事。” 健介回答说。

"You don't have any right to know everything about us!" Asuka retorted.  
“你没有权利知道我们的一切！” 明日香反驳道。

"But that's what we agreed on" Kensuke refuted.  
“但那是我们说好的” 健介反驳道。

"Mr. Aida" Misato interrupted. "I'm sure you realise how difficult it must be for Asuka to admit what had happened. Surely you can respect her privacy and not make it any harder for her" she said firmly.  
"相田先生" 美里打断道。"我相信你明白这对明日香来说承认发生了什么有多困难。你肯定能尊重她的隐私，不让她更难受吧" 她坚定地说。

The otaku noticed the look in the Major's eyes and sighed. "Okay, I understand" he replied, standing up from the table. "But before I go, you haven't yet told me when you actually became a couple"  
这位御宅族注意到了少校眼中的神情，叹了口气。"好吧，我明白了" 他回答道，从桌旁站起身来。"但在我离开之前，你还没告诉我你们到底是什么时候成为一对的"

"I suppose that would have been yesterday, during the angel battle, when we finally came to terms with our feelings. The umm… stress of the battle made us both confess to each other" Asuka answered. "Now could you step out of the room?"  
"我想那应该是昨天，在天使战斗中，当我们终于正视自己的感情时。嗯……战斗的压力让我们彼此坦白了心意" 明日香回答。"现在你能离开房间吗？"

"Where to?" Kensuke asked.  
“去哪儿？” 真嗣问道。

"You can use my room" Shinji answered without looking up.  
“你可以用我的房间。” 真嗣回答，没有抬头。

"Okay" he replied. "When can I come back though?"  
“好的。” 他回答，“不过我什么时候能回来呢？”

"We will call you back later" Misato answered.  
“我们稍后再回电。”美里回答道。

Kensuke then turned around and walked over to Shinji's room, before entering it and closing the door behind him.  
健介随后转身走向真嗣的房间，进门后随手关上了门。

Asuka waited for a few seconds after hearing the door shut to begin speaking. "What did you want to know Misato?" she asked.  
听到关门声几秒钟后，明日香才开始说话。“美里，你想知道什么？”她问道。

"Just… how you dealt with what happened, I've only heard Shinji's side" Misato answered.  
“只是…关于那件事你是怎么处理的，我只听真嗣说过他的版本。”美里回答道。

"When he started to… you know… I fought as hard as I could against him, but he had initially overpowered me and I couldn't stop him. I felt… pathetic being unable to do anything while he did whatever he wanted with my body. After a while, I couldn't fight back anymore and just gave in" she confessed. "After it was over well… I just grew even angrier with him. I almost killed him with the knife he had brandished earlier, but stopped myself. I didn't do anything to him if that's why you're asking"  
“当他开始…你知道的…我竭尽全力反抗他，但他一开始就制服了我，我无法阻止他。我感觉…自己很无能，任由他对我为所欲为。过了一段时间，我再也无力反抗，只能屈服。”她坦白道，“事后…我对他的愤怒更甚。我差点用他之前挥舞的刀杀了他，但还是克制住了自己。如果你问的是这个，我没有对他做任何事。”

"I see… so did he do anything else against your will? Did he hurt you?" Misato asked, her voice full or concern. "You don't have to go into details" she added.  
“我明白了…那他还有没有强迫你做其他事？他伤害你了吗？”美里问道，声音中充满了关切。“你不必细说。”她补充道。

"He did hurt me before and during… he cut me and tried to strangle me as well as just roughly handling me in general, but nothing else afterwards. Just like he said, right after he did it, he regretted it. He even tried apologising to me later in the night, though that just annoyed me" Asuka answered.  
"他确实在之前和过程中伤害了我…他割伤了我，试图掐死我，还粗暴地对待我，但之后就没有了。就像他说的，做完之后，他立刻就后悔了。那天晚上他甚至试图向我道歉，尽管那只是让我更恼火。" 明日香回答道。

"He felt regret over assaulting you and that annoyed you?" Misato asked, a little confused.  
"他对你施暴后感到后悔，这让你感到恼火？" 美里有些困惑地问道。

"Well of course!" Asuka replied instantly. "It annoyed the hell out of me that he would inflict all that abuse on me and then try to apologise it off as if it wasn't entirely his fault or something you can easily pardon. It pissed me off that he was not accepting the consequences of his actions"  
"当然啦！" 明日香立刻回应道。"他对我施加那么多虐待，然后试图用道歉来弥补，好像这不是他的错或者可以轻易原谅似的。他不愿意承担自己行为的后果，这让我非常愤怒。

"How did you respond to this Shinji?" Misato said, turning to face the boy.  
“你是怎么回应真嗣的？”美里转过身来面对着男孩说道。

Finally, Shinji lifted his head up again to speak. "Asuka's words impacted on me deeply and I saw the truth in her words. I did my best to make up with her, since not only did I do something detestable, but we are together for so many aspects of life, daily interaction would be difficult now. I persisted in talking to her, trying to fully comprehend how I had hurt her. It was a very confusing moment for me then as I could not fathom any path forward even though I knew I had to do _something_. Asuka eventually gave me a detailed account of how much I had hurt her… I came to understand just how horrible a thing I had done and just wanted to make her feel better. In the end I decided to… well… give her oral sex" Shinji answered.  
最终，真嗣再次抬起头来开口道：“明日香的话深深触动了我，我看到了她话语中的真相。我尽力去弥补她，不仅因为我做了可恶的事，而且我们在生活中的许多方面都紧密相连，日常互动现在变得困难。我坚持与她交谈，试图完全理解我如何伤害了她。那时对我来说非常困惑，因为我无法想象任何前进的道路，尽管我知道我必须做些什么。明日香最终详细地告诉我我伤害她有多深……我逐渐明白我做了多么可怕的事情，只想让她感觉好些。最后我决定……嗯……给她口交。”真嗣回答道。

"Right after that ordeal?! Was that really the best idea?" Misato said, looking warily at him.  
“在那场磨难之后立刻就做？！那真的是最好的主意吗？”美里不安地看着他问道。

"I didn't even have _any_ idea what I should do, let alone the best idea. At the time it made sense, and Asuka seemed to want something like that. Also, I don't want to make any excuses for any of my actions but… I had been a little drugged up and this might have influenced the magnitude of my decisions a little. Everything was still my fault though… there wasn't anyone controlling or forcing me. I guess it's true when they say that while you're angry you can become capable of doing things you will truly regret" Shinji replied.  
"我甚至不知道该做什么，更别提最好的主意了。当时那样做似乎有道理，而且明日香似乎也想要那样。另外，我不想为我的任何行为找借口，但……我确实有点被药物影响，这可能稍微影响了我的决策力度。尽管如此，一切仍然是我的错……没有人控制或强迫我。我想他们说的没错，当你生气时，你可能会做出一些真正让你后悔的事情。" 真嗣回答道。

"I'm not sure I totally understand. You were drugged?" Misato asked.  
"我不太确定我完全理解了。你是说你被下了药？" 美里问道。

"Yeah, someone had done it to me, it was mainly just hormones. We don't know who or how yet" Shinji answered.  
"是的，有人对我下了药，主要是一些激素。我们还不知道是谁，也不知道是怎么做到的。" 真嗣回答道。

The Major paused for a second and then turned back to the redhead. "Let's not get off topic though. I still want to know how Asuka felt about everything afterwards. Considering both of your responses just now, with Asuka saying 'nothing else afterwards' and Shinji admitting to… touching you again, I want to hear your perspective Asuka" Misato requested.  
玛奇少校顿了一下，然后转向红发女孩。“不过，我们不要偏离主题。我仍然想知道明日香事后对这一切的感受。考虑到你们刚才的回答，明日香说‘之后什么也没发生’，而真嗣承认……再次触碰了你，我想听听你的看法，明日香。”美里请求道。

"Well… I was answering your question about if he did anything else against my will, which he didn't. At that point, he had already done so much to me it just didn't matter anymore. I just wanted to feel good, wanted to forget all the pain and so I allowed him to. And besides… I had already formulated a plan in my mind then to get my revenge on Shinji. I was going to take advantage of the situation and use him to relieve all my sexual frustration and then dump him off later. Considering I couldn't change what had happened, I thought it was the perfect plan to get back at him" Asuka admitted.  
“嗯……我是在回答你关于他是否还做了其他违背我意愿的事，他没有。在那时，他已经对我做了那么多，一切都无所谓了。我只想感觉好些，想忘记所有的痛苦，所以我允许了他。而且……那时我已经在心里制定了一个计划，要向真嗣复仇。我打算利用这个情况，用他来释放我所有的性压抑，然后再甩掉他。考虑到我无法改变已经发生的事，我认为这是报复他的完美计划。”明日香坦白道。

The male eva pilot himself was surprised to hear this confession and looked over at the redhead. "But Asuka… you couldn't mean that from the beginning you had planned to-" he started.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员本人听到这番坦白后感到惊讶，转头看向红发女孩。“但明日香……你不可能从一开始就计划要……”他开始说道。

"Don't be so surprised Shinji" Asuka said, interrupting him. "Just as strongly as you regretted having done it to me, I felt anger towards you for having done it to me. Did you think I would just accept what had happened so easily Shinji? You know what I'm like, it should be obvious how I would react" she told the boy.  
""别这么惊讶，真嗣。" 明日香打断了他。"正如你后悔对我所做的那样强烈，我也对你对我所做的事感到愤怒。你以为我会轻易接受发生的一切吗，真嗣？你知道我是什么样的人，我会有什么反应应该是显而易见的。" 她对少年说道。

"But if you just wanted revenge Asuka, why didn't you just tell me what happened then?" Misato asked. "I would have been on your side. I would have punished Shinji harshly"  
"但如果明日香你只是想要报复，为什么不直接告诉我发生了什么？" 美里问道。"我会站在你这边。我会严厉惩罚真嗣的。

"I've always kept things to myself and dealt with my problems myself, this was no different. I didn't want you to find out because… my pride had already been hurt enough and a part of me felt like I had it coming too. I also thought that my plan was much better for revenge as no one would ever find out what had happened as I knew Shinji wouldn't say anything. And hell… I even enjoyed the sex too; it was a great relief from my umm… sexual desires" Asuka answered.  
""我一直习惯自己解决问题，这次也不例外。我不想让你知道是因为……我的自尊已经受到了足够的伤害，而且我的一部分感觉自己也是咎由自取。我也认为我的计划更适合报复，因为没有人会发现发生了什么，我知道真嗣不会说出去。而且……我甚至也享受了性爱；那是对我……性欲的一种极大释放。" 明日香回答道。

"But Asuka, after what he did to you, how could you enjoy that?" Misato asked, taken aback.  
“但明日香，他那样对你之后，你怎么还能享受那种事呢？”美里问道，感到十分意外。

"Well, it was like… in my mind I justified our 'relationship' by making Shinji initiate everything so I didn't have to take responsibility for anything. This was to make the break off easier. As long as I used the excuse that Shinji was the only one making advances, he had nothing on me and we would never have a real relationship" Asuka explained.  
“嗯，在我心里，我通过让真嗣主动发起一切来合理化我们的‘关系’，这样我就不必承担任何责任。这是为了让分手更容易。只要我用真嗣是唯一主动的一方作为借口，他就无法指责我，我们永远不会真正建立关系。”明日香解释道。

Both Shinji and Misato just stared at the girl, shocked to hear this confession.  
真嗣和美里都盯着女孩，听到这番坦白感到震惊。

"Does that mean that everything was just part of your plan?" Shinji asked, unable to believe it.  
"那意味着一切只是你计划的一部分吗？" 真嗣问道，难以置信。

"I know what you're thinking Shinji, but it's not true. I don't think anything ever goes according to plan. There were so many things that happened which I could not control like Misato being home, only one bra left in the wash and of course me falling in love with you" Asuka replied, smiling slightly. "That had probably been the biggest problem in my plan I think"  
"我知道你在想什么，真嗣，但事实并非如此。我不认为任何事情都能按计划进行。有很多事情我无法控制，比如美里在家，洗衣机里只剩一件胸罩，当然还有我爱上你" 明日香回答道，微微一笑。"那大概是我计划中最大的问题了"

"Hold on a minute, you've skipped quite a bit. From what you had said earlier Asuka, I can only see this leading to ruin" Misato interrupted.  
"等等，你跳过了很多。根据你之前说的，明日香，我只觉得这会走向毁灭" 美里打断道。

"Well it did" Asuka replied.  
"嗯，确实如此" 明日香回答道。

"So then how _did_ you guys get together?" Misato asked, confused.  
"那你们是怎么走到一起的呢？" 美里困惑地问。

"I don't think we completely know ourselves" Asuka answered.  
"我想我们自己也不完全清楚" 明日香回答说。

The Major sighed before deciding that maybe hearing Shinji's version of the story would help. "Well, what was this 'relationship' like from your perspective Shinji?" Misato said, turning to face the boy.  
玛丽叹了口气，决定或许听听真嗣的版本会有所帮助。“那么，从你的角度来看，这段‘关系’是什么样的呢，真嗣？”美里说着，转向面对男孩。

The boy was no longer looking down at the ground and addressed Misato normally. "After the first night, I started to see Asuka in a different light. It was like… something inside of me stirred, feelings I never knew were there had been awoken. Although I had been disgusted at myself for raping her, I couldn't help myself showing her affection. I just wanted to make her feel good, I just wanted her to feel happy and so I gave her physical attention regularly" Shinji answered.  
男孩不再低头看着地面，正常地回答美里。“在第一晚之后，我开始以不同的眼光看待明日香。就像是……我内心有什么东西被触动了，那些我从未意识到的感情被唤醒了。尽管我对自己强奸她感到厌恶，但我无法控制自己向她表达爱意。我只是想让她感觉好些，我只是想让她感到快乐，所以我经常给予她身体上的关注。”真嗣回答道。

"Why did you continue though? I'm sure Asuka must have protested or given some sign she didn't want to be with you" Misato asked the boy.  
“但你为什么继续呢？我确信明日香一定抗议过或表现出她不想和你在一起的迹象。”美里问男孩。

"Yeah, she did mention it several times but she would still eventually let me and I did have sex with her a few times. Now I understand why, but back then it seemed to me like Asuka was just making excuses. It seemed to me like she was just pretending she didn't have any feelings because of her stubbornness. But putting that aside, I also continued because Asuka began to show me a side of her she didn't show anyone else… I think it was then that I realised I had always cared about her and wanted to stay with her" Shinji explained.  
“是啊，她确实提过几次，但最终还是会让我，我也确实和她有过几次。现在我明白了为什么，但当时在我看来，明日香似乎只是在找借口。我觉得她只是因为固执而假装没有感情。但抛开这些不谈，我也继续下去，因为明日香开始向我展示她不向任何人展示的一面……我想就是在那时，我意识到我一直关心她，想和她在一起。”真嗣解释道。

"I still don't understand how this led to our current situation" Misato said, unable to piece together how their relationship had formed. "You must be leaving something out, you even said that your relationship was led to ruin! How did you fall in love with him Asuka? And how did you come to the realisation of it? What sparked you two to finally get together?"  
“我还是不明白这怎么导致了我们现在的局面。”美里说，无法拼凑出他们的关系是如何形成的。“你肯定漏掉了什么，你甚至说过你们的关系导致了毁灭！你是怎么爱上他的，明日香？你是怎么意识到这一点的？是什么让你们俩最终走到一起的？”

"You're really hooked Misato" Asuka replied, chuckling. "Do you really need to know everything?" she asked.  
“你真是上钩了，美里。”明日香笑着回答，“你真的需要知道所有细节吗？”她问道。

"I just want to completely understand what happened" Misato replied. "Speaking of which… Kensuke also does. Are you willing to call him back now?"  
"我只是想彻底了解发生了什么" 美里回答道。"说到这个… 真希也想要知道。你现在愿意把他叫回来了吗？"

"Yeah, I guess" Asuka replied.  
"嗯，我想可以" 明日香回答。"

"I'll get him" Shinji said, standing up from the table and moving over to his room.  
"我去叫他" 真嗣说着，从桌旁站起身，走向自己的房间。"

Shinji knocked on his door and it opened a few seconds later. "You can come back to the table now Kensuke" he told him.  
真嗣敲了敲门，几秒钟后门开了。“你现在可以回桌了，健介。”他对他说。

"Alright" Kensuke replied.  
“好的。”健介回答道。

The two boys then returned to the dining table and sat down.  
两个男孩随后回到餐桌旁坐下。

"So, where are we up to in the discussion then?" Kensuke asked.  
"那么，我们讨论到哪儿了？" 真希波问道。

"We're up to how Asuka fell in love with Shinji" Misato answered, a slight teasing smile on her face.  
"我们正说到明日香是如何爱上真嗣的。" 美里回答，脸上带着一丝戏谑的微笑。

"Oh this I gotta hear!" Kensuke replied eagerly.  
"哦，这我可得好好听听！" 真希波急切地回应道。

"Don't get so excited you moron!" Asuka snapped.  
"别这么激动，你个白痴！" 明日香厉声说道。

"Please just continue on Asuka" Misato said, interrupting them.  
"请继续说，明日香。" 美里插话道，打断了他们。

"Alright fine" Asuka replied, sighing. "Why did I fall in love with him…? Well to be honest I don't really know… perhaps because I came to the realisation that he understood me better than anyone else or maybe because he treated me as a person and not just a girl with good looks. It was most likely many things. After the initial incident he did everything to make sure I was ok, would show courage and not back down from my abuse when he wanted to help me. The sync test we had recently shows what I mean pretty well" Asuka confessed. "My respect for him grew as he took responsibility for what he had done. Whenever I had a problem, not once did he ever rub it in my face or take advantage of it. Even after our 'breakup,' though he was extremely angry at me, he still respected my decision"  
"好吧，好吧。" 明日香叹了口气回答，"我为什么会爱上他…？老实说，我也不太清楚…也许是因为我意识到他比任何人都更理解我，或者是因为他把我当作一个有血有肉的人，而不仅仅是一个外表出众的女孩。这可能是很多因素的综合。在最初的事件之后，他尽一切努力确保我没事，会在我需要帮助时勇敢面对我的怒火，从不退缩。我们最近的同步测试很好地说明了这一点。" 明日香坦白道，"我对他的敬意随着他对自己行为的负责而增长。每当我遇到问题，他从未借此嘲讽我或占我便宜。即使在我们'分手'后，尽管他对我的愤怒难以平息，他依然尊重我的决定。

"You 'broke up'? I thought you never became a couple though" Misato remarked, confused.  
"你'分手'了？我以为你们从未成为一对呢" 美里评论道，感到困惑。

"I suppose it is all a little confusing, but with us having sexual relations with each other we did form some sort of relationship. Maybe I led Shinji on a little too much, because he must have thought we were a couple. But as I said previously, my initial plan was to take revenge on him… that was why I had allowed it to go on" Asuka explained.  
"我想这一切确实有点令人费解，但既然我们有过性关系，那我们确实形成了一种关系。也许我对真嗣的引导有点过头了，因为他肯定以为我们是情侣。但正如我之前所说，我最初的计划是向他复仇……这就是为什么我允许这一切继续下去" 明日香解释道。

At this comment Kensuke raised his eyebrows, not clearly understanding what she meant. Noticing his confused look, Shinji mouthed "don't worry" to him and Kensuke nodded in response.  
听到这话，剑介扬起了眉毛，不太明白她的意思。注意到他困惑的表情，真嗣无声地对他说"别担心"，剑介点头回应。

"Anyway, getting back to the 'breakup,' I had told myself that he was growing too attached and so I went and told him that we were to stop and that I had just been using him the whole time. However, I realise now that it was only because I was scared of having a real relationship with him. Of course, Shinji got rather angry and we got into a fight" Asuka continued.  
"总之，回到那个‘分手’的话题，我当时告诉自己他太过依赖了，所以我去找他，告诉他我们要停止这一切，我一直只是在利用他。然而，我现在意识到那只是因为我害怕与他建立真正的关系。当然，真嗣非常生气，我们吵了一架。" 明日香继续说道。

"What happened in this fight?" Misato asked.  
"这场争吵发生了什么？" 美里问道。

"What do you think usually happens in a fight?" Asuka asked rhetorically. "We pretty much just shouted abuse at each other. Shinji called me a slut, which from his perspective made sense, and I think I called him a loser or something for thinking I would want to be together with him. Though no matter how much I insulted him he didn't back down, he refused to admit I felt nothing for him and so I err… pretty much told him to fuck off and leave me alone. I'm not entirely sure why but I also shouted 'I love you' in German at him which Shinji obviously thought was just some German curse" Asuka explained.  
"你觉得吵架时通常会发生什么？" 明日香反问道。"我们基本上就是互相辱骂。真嗣骂我是荡妇，从他的角度来看这说得通，我想我骂他是个失败者，因为他居然认为我会想和他在一起。尽管我怎么侮辱他，他都没有退缩，他拒绝承认我对他的感情是假的，所以我……基本上是让他滚开，别再来烦我。我也不太清楚为什么，但我还用德语对他大喊‘我爱你’，真嗣当然以为那只是某种德语的诅咒。" 明日香解释道。

"So, what did you do Shinji?" Misato said, turning to face Shinji again.  
"那么，你做了什么，真嗣？" 美里说着，再次转向真嗣。

"I just couldn't take it anymore… her words had really hurt me. No matter how hard I tried, she just kept pushing me away so I just… ran away like she told me to" Shinji answered.  
"我真的受不了了……她的话真的伤到我了。无论我怎么努力，她总是把我推开，所以我就像她说的那样……逃走了" 真嗣回答道。

"You should know by now that running away doesn't solve anything Shinji" Misato said in response.  
"你现在应该知道，逃避解决不了任何问题，真嗣" 美里回应道。

"I know. That's why I returned to the apartment. I couldn't run away from what had happened and I knew that it was _her_ decision in the end if she wanted to be with me" Shinji replied.  
“我知道。所以我回到了公寓。我无法逃避已经发生的事，我也明白最终是否愿意和我在一起是她自己的决定。”真嗣回答道。

"And what happened when you came back then, Shinji?" Misato asked, dying to find out how it had all turned out.  
“那你回来后发生了什么，真嗣？”美里问道，迫切想知道这一切是如何收场的。

"The front door was unlocked so I went in to check on her. Although when I found her in her room, I discovered she was still hostile and, even though I wanted to make up with her, I just blew up and left her room. I couldn't believe how she was behaving like such a selfish, for lack of a better word, bitch. Even later on, she came out of her room just to steal a meal I had made for myself. Although I had noticed her eyes were red, I momentarily thought that she had been crying" Shinji explained.  
“前门没锁，所以我进去查看她的情况。虽然当我找到她时，发现她依然充满敌意，尽管我想和她和好，但我还是失控了，离开了她的房间。我无法相信她表现得如此自私，找不到更合适的词来形容，简直像个泼妇。甚至后来，她走出房间只是为了偷走我为自己准备的一顿饭。尽管我注意到她的眼睛红红的，我一时还以为她在哭泣。”真嗣解释道。

The redhead gave Shinji a slight nod, making sure Kensuke wouldn't notice. Shinji raised his eyebrows at her and she just shrugged, before he continued on. "I was damn pissed at her behaviour but I was just too emotionally exhausted to get into another fight with her and so I let her have her way. I wanted nothing more than to just rest from the day's events and so I went back to my room and listened to my SDAT Player" Shinji finished.  
红发女孩轻轻点了点头，确保真希波不会注意到。真嗣对她扬了扬眉毛，她只是耸耸肩，然后他继续说道：“我对她的行为真是气得要命，但我当时情绪已经筋疲力尽，实在不想再和她吵一架，所以就随她去了。我只想从今天的事情中解脱出来好好休息，于是我回到房间，听起了我的 SDAT 播放器。”真嗣说完。

Predicting the Major's next question, Asuka spoke up after Shinji had finished. "I too wanted to rest after the day's events and so I went to sleep in my room. Next thing we know there's an angel attack and well you know the rest" Asuka concluded.  
预料到少校接下来会问的问题，真希波在真嗣说完后开口了。“那天之后我也想休息，所以就回房间睡觉了。结果下一刻我们就遭遇了使徒袭击，剩下的你们都知道了。”真希波总结道。

Misato just let out a sigh. They had found love at the age of fourteen; something she hadn't been able to do all her life and when she finally did, her lover died. "What an unbelievable turn of events" the Major remarked. "But it explains everything that happened so well. Also… I believe I owe you an apology Asuka, I had thought all along that you had done something to Shinji. Not to mention my negligence in letting such awful things happen to you in my residence. I will admit that I was wrong" she said, holding her hand out to the girl.  
美里只是叹了口气。他们在十四岁时找到了爱情；这是她一生中从未能做到的事，而当她终于做到时，她的爱人却去世了。“真是难以置信的转折”美里少校感慨道，“但这很好地解释了一切发生的事情。而且……我相信我欠你一个道歉，明日香，我一直以为你对真嗣做了什么。更不用说在我的住所里让你遭受了那么多可怕的事情。我承认我错了。”她说着，向女孩伸出手。

"Apology accepted Misato" Asuka replied, shaking the older woman's hand.  
“接受你的道歉，美里。”明日香回答，握住了年长女性的手。

With the discussion finally over everyone stood up from the table, wanting to stretch a little. Kensuke, however, remained seated, a pondering look on his face.  
讨论终于结束后，大家都从桌边站起身来，想要伸展一下。然而，健介却依然坐着，脸上带着沉思的表情。

"There's still one thing I don't understand. Why were you so afraid of having a relationship with him Asuka?" Kensuke said, finally speaking after the long talk.  
"还有一件事我不明白。为什么你那么害怕和他建立关系呢，明日香？" 在长时间的谈话后，真嗣终于开口说道。

"Yeah actually he does have a point, I never did really understand why that was" Shinji agreed.  
"确实，他说得有道理，我从来没真正理解过为什么会是那样" 真嗣表示同意。

"That's… something I don't want to talk about right now" Asuka replied grimly.  
"那……是我现在不想谈的事情" 明日香沉重地回答。

Shinji looked at the young girl confused, ready to get her to explain it to him but Misato put her hand on his shoulder and shook her head.  
真嗣困惑地看着那个年轻女孩，准备让她解释清楚，但美里把手放在他的肩膀上，摇了摇头。

"Maybe another day Shinji" Asuka replied, looking away.  
“或许改天吧，真嗣。”明日香回答道，目光移向别处。

The male eva pilot could see there was a deep secret that was still hurting her, something that must have happened in her past. He suddenly remembered that night when she had been crying in her sleep and wondered if it was related.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员可以看出，她心中隐藏着一个深重的秘密，这秘密仍在伤害着她，一定是她过去发生过的事情。他突然想起了那个晚上，她曾在睡梦中哭泣，不知道这两者是否有关联。

Walking over to the young girl, he leaned in close to her. "Was it about your mother?" Shinji whispered into her ear.  
他走向那个年轻女孩，俯身靠近她。“是因为你妈妈吗？”真嗣在她耳边低语。

Asuka looked at him a little surprised before nodding and saying nothing else. Shinji could see now was not the time to press the issue and decided he would find out another day.  
明日香有些惊讶地看着他，然后点了点头，没再说什么。真嗣明白现在不是追问的时候，决定改天再了解情况。

With everything said and done, the two eva pilots finally felt relieved at having gotten it off their shoulders.  
一切都说开了，两位 EVA 驾驶员终于感到如释重负，心中的重担得以卸下。

"Man, who woulda thought that you two, out of all people, had sex and became a couple" Kensuke remarked, getting Shinji's and Asuka's attention.  
"天哪，谁会想到你们俩，居然会走到一起还成了情侣。" 真希波的话引起了真嗣和明日香的注意。

"Man, I can't believe I confessed all that in front of you" Asuka replied. "Don't forget your promise stooge, no one is to know about this" she warned.  
"天哪，我真不敢相信我居然在你面前坦白了那么多。" 明日香回应道，"别忘了你的承诺，这件事谁也不许知道。" 她警告说。

"Don't worry, I'll keep my silence. If I was in the same situation, I would have asked you to do the same" Kensuke assured.  
"别担心，我会守口如瓶的。如果我处在同样的境地，我也会要求你这么做。" 真希波保证道。

There was a moment of silence between the classmates while Misato went to the sofa and sat down to relax; the Major just wanted to rest a little and slowly absorb everything she had heard.  
同学们之间出现了一阵沉默，Misato 走到沙发旁坐下放松；少校只是想稍作休息，慢慢消化她所听到的一切。

"Though you know, everyone had noticed you two had been acting differently recently" Kensuke started. The two roommates looked at the bespectacled boy with curious faces. "That's why we came over unexpectedly last week, to see if we could catch you off guard. We would never have thought it was something like this though"  
“不过你知道，大家都注意到你们俩最近行为有些不同寻常。”Kensuke 开口说道。两位室友好奇地看着戴眼镜的男孩。“所以我们上周突然造访，想看看能否让你们措手不及。但我们绝没想到会是这样的事情。”

"What gave you the idea that we were acting strange? I mean you brought over Hikari too, you must have had some really strong evidence" Asuka asked curious.  
“你们怎么觉得我们行为奇怪呢？我是说，你还带上了 Hikari，你们肯定有非常确凿的证据吧。”Asuka 好奇地问道。

"Well, it mostly because of the way you two were behaving during our lunch together and because of that day when you both disappeared at lunch without telling us where you went. Asuka, you had told Hikari that you were with Shinji discussing NERV business with the Principal, while Shinji told us that he had done a teacher's errand. We could easily see that one of you had lied and found it to be quite suspicious" Kensuke answered.  
“嗯，主要是因为你们俩在我们一起吃午饭时的行为，还有那天你们俩在午饭时突然消失，没告诉我们去哪儿了。明日香，你告诉光你和真嗣在和校长讨论 NERV 的事务，而真嗣却告诉我们他去帮老师跑腿了。我们很容易看出你们中有人在撒谎，这让我们觉得很可疑。” 健司回答道。

The redhead just smacked her forehead in annoyance. "Well of course _Shinji_ would be stupid enough to blow our cover" she remarked.  
红发女孩懊恼地拍了拍额头。“当然，真嗣那家伙蠢到会暴露我们的行踪。”她评论道。

"Hey!" Shinji shot back. “嘿！”真嗣反驳道。

"Don't be so smug Asuka, the reason I am here today is because of _your_ slipup" Kensuke retorted.  
"别那么得意忘形，明日香，我今天来这里就是因为你的疏忽。" 真嗣反驳道。

"What do you mean?" Asuka asked back.  
"你什么意思？" 明日香反问道。

"When we came over, it was to see if we could find the reason for your strange behaviour. The other two couldn't see anything unusual though and so we left. However, _I_ had noticed one thing; Asuka, you told us Shinji was listening to music yet he was the one who had answered our knock and opened the door" Kensuke explained.  
"我们过来是想看看能否找出你行为古怪的原因。其他两人没发现什么异常，所以我们离开了。不过，我注意到了一件事；明日香，你告诉我们真嗣在听音乐，但他却是那个应门并开门的人。" 真嗣解释道。

"Ah crap…" Asuka said, trailing off.  
"啊糟糕……" 明日香说着，声音渐渐低了下去。

"Well of course _Asuka_ would be stupid enough to blow our cover" Shinji said mockingly.  
"当然啦，明日香蠢到会暴露我们" 真嗣嘲讽地说。

"It was your fault for calling out in the first place you dummkopf!" Asuka refuted.  
"一开始喊出声就是你的错，你这个笨蛋！" 明日香反驳道。

"What _were_ you two doing when we knocked? Or what about the lunch time when you two disappeared?" Kensuke inquired.  
“我们敲门时你们俩在干什么？还有那次午餐时间你们俩消失的时候呢？” 真希询问道。

"None of your damn business!" Asuka shouted back. "And even if you _had_ noticed my slipup, I still don't see how that brought you here today" she said, changing the subject.  
“关你屁事！” 明日香回吼道。“就算你注意到了我的疏忽，我还是不明白这怎么把你今天带到这里来了。” 她转移了话题。

Kensuke glanced back at Misato resting on the couch, making sure she was out of earshot before speaking up quietly.  
真希瞥了一眼躺在沙发上休息的美里，确保她听不到后才轻声开口。

"Well, I decided to contact a 'friend' I have at NERV over a secure connection to check out if there was anything unusual reported about you two. I also asked to view the angel battle to see if anything happened to you guys, after which I watched the video recordings. In actual fact I came here because I wanted to see if you were both ok, especially considering what I had seen" Kensuke answered.  
"嗯，我决定通过一个安全连接联系我在 NERV 的‘朋友’，看看有没有关于你们俩的异常报告。我还请求查看天使战斗的录像，想确认你们是否安然无恙，之后我观看了视频记录。实际上我来这里是因为我想确认你们俩是否都还好，尤其是考虑到我所看到的情况。" 真希回答道。

"You were concerned about _me_? As if!" Asuka replied.  
"你在担心我？别开玩笑了！" 明日香回应道。

"Wait a minute" Shinji started. "If you saw the battle, why didn't know about us then? We had said a lot over communications"  
"等一下" 真嗣开始说道。"如果你看了那场战斗，为什么当时不知道我们的事？我们在通讯中说了不少话。"

"I only had the video recording, that's just what the cameras on the surface could see, there was no sound or communications. I don't believe your communications are recorded at all, for good reason I suspect" Kensuke explained.  
"我只拿到了视频录像，那只是地表摄像头能看到的画面，没有声音或通讯记录。我怀疑你们的通讯根本就没有被记录下来，出于某种合理的考虑。" 真希解释道。

"Ah I see" Shinji replied, understanding.  
"啊，我明白了" 真嗣回答，表示理解。

"I'm more concerned about this spy at NERV, who is this 'friend'?" Asuka asked suspiciously.  
"我更担心 NERV 里的这个间谍，这个'朋友'是谁？" 明日香怀疑地问道。

"I can't tell you. I don't want him to lose his job. So please don't ask me that, he just knows about my enthusiasm, he never gives me important information"  
"我不能告诉你。我不想他丢了工作。所以请别再问我了，他只是知道我对这些的热情，他从没给我过重要信息"

Asuka sighed in response. "Fine then" she conceded. "If you go back on your word and tell others about us, then the same happens here" she threatened.  
明日香叹了口气回应。"好吧"她让步道。"如果你食言告诉别人我们的秘密，那这里也会出问题"她威胁道。

"Understood" Kensuke agreed.  
"明白了" 健介同意道。

"In any case, as much as I'd like to stay and chat, I really do need to put on a shirt. You two can talk to each other more while I go to my room. I'll be back quick" Asuka announced before walking off to her room.  
"无论如何，虽然我很想留下来聊聊，但我真的需要穿上一件衬衫。你们俩可以趁我回房间的时候多聊聊。我会很快回来的" 明日香宣布后，便走向她的房间。

Kensuke watched the redhead go out of sight before addressing his friend. "I kinda feel depressed you know, everyone has a girl now" he said, sighing.  
健介看着红发女孩消失在视线之外，然后转向他的朋友。"我有点感到沮丧，你知道吗，现在每个人都有女朋友了" 他叹息道。

"What do you mean?" Shinji asked.  
"你是什么意思？" 真嗣问道。

"Think about it Shinji. You got Asuka and Touji pretty much has Hikari while I'm still all alone" Kensuke answered, sounding slightly disheartened.  
“想想吧，真嗣。你有了明日香，而剑介和光也差不多在一起了，而我却还是孤身一人。” 健介回答道，语气中略带沮丧。

Upon hearing his comment, the male eva pilot chuckled slightly. "Come on Kensuke, there are some joys to being single too you know, enjoy it while you can" he jokingly teased.  
听到他的话，男性 eva 驾驶员轻声笑了笑。“别这样，健介，单身也有单身的好处，你知道的，趁还能享受就享受吧。”他开玩笑地调侃道。

"Well I can see what you mean, especially considering Asuka" Kensuke joked back.  
“嗯，我能理解你的意思，尤其是考虑到明日香。”健介回以玩笑。

Shinji couldn't help laughing a little at that comment before responding. "Hmm you know, you could always go for Rei I suppose. I could recommend you to her" he suggested, half-serious.  
听到那句话，真嗣忍不住轻笑了一声，然后回应道：“嗯，你知道的，你也可以考虑一下绫波。我可以把你推荐给她。”他半开玩笑地说。

"Ayanami? Well, she _is_ cute but… she doesn't really say much and probably doesn't even know me anyway" Kensuke replied.  
“绫波？嗯，她确实很可爱，但是……她不怎么说话，而且可能根本就不认识我。”健介回答道。

"Perhaps all she needs is someone to express herself to. You might be the one to bring the words out of her Kensuke" Shinji said, continuing his teasing. "I mean just yesterday, Rei came up to me and told me she loved me so-"  
“也许她只是需要一个能倾诉的人。健介，你可能会是她愿意开口的那个人。”真嗣继续调侃道，“我是说，就在昨天，绫波还走到我面前，告诉我她爱我……”

"What?!" a loud voice said, interrupting him.  
"什么？！"一个响亮的声音打断了他。

The two boys jumped before turning to face the source of the voice; it was none other than Asuka and she didn't look too pleased.  
两个男孩吓了一跳，随即转身面对声音的来源；不是别人，正是明日香，而且她看起来不太高兴。

"What's wrong Asuka?" Shinji asked hesitantly.  
"怎么了，明日香？"真嗣犹豫地问道。

"You never told me that Rei said she loved you!" Asuka snapped.  
"你从没告诉过我丽说她爱你！" 明日香厉声说道。

"Ah well…" Shinji started, scratching his head sheepishly "It happened just yesterday, so there really wasn't a chance to tell you, besides I forgot"  
"嗯，这个……" 真嗣开口道，尴尬地挠了挠头，"事情就发生在昨天，所以真的没机会告诉你，而且我也忘了。"

"So, what happened?" Asuka asked, annoyed.  
"那么，到底发生了什么？" 明日香不耐烦地问。

"Nothing really. It was just after the angel battle when she came up to me and asked me what love was. After I told her what it meant, she replied saying that she loved me. I was also a bit surprised by the conversation" Shinji answered.  
“没什么特别的。就在天使之战后，她走到我面前，问我什么是爱。我告诉她爱的含义后，她回答说她爱我。我当时也有点惊讶。” 真嗣回答道。

"What did she mean by that? What does she want with you?" the redhead asked, her eyes narrowing suspiciously on him.  
“她那是什么意思？她想从你这里得到什么？” 红发女孩问道，目光怀疑地盯着他。

"Well, she just said she cared about me; her description was something similar to a sibling's relationship" Shinji answered. "She doesn't want to take me away from you if that's what you're worried about" he added jokingly.  
“嗯，她只是说她关心我；她的描述有点像兄妹之间的关系。” 真嗣回答。“如果你担心她会把我从你身边带走，那大可不必。” 他打趣地补充道。

"Baka!" Asuka replied, smacking him across the face. "Are you suggesting that I would be jealous over that slut flirting with you?! Get real!"  
"笨蛋！" 明日香回道，一巴掌打在他脸上。"你是在暗示我会因为那个荡妇跟你调情而吃醋吗？！别开玩笑了！"

"Relax Asuka, it was just a joke" Shinji said, chuckling nervously. "Even if she did want to take me away from you, I'm sure you know that I think you're the best"  
"放松点，明日香，那只是个玩笑" 真嗣说，紧张地笑了笑。"就算她真想把我从你身边抢走，我相信你也知道我心里你是最棒的"

"Yeah yeah" Asuka said, sounding slightly irritated. "I don't know why you get me so worked up over nothing" she muttered.  
"是是是" 明日香说，听起来有点不耐烦。"我不知道你为什么总是能把我惹得这么火大，就为了点小事" 她嘀咕道。"

The male eva pilot moved behind the young girl and embraced her warmly around the waist before giving her a quick peck on the cheek. The redhead grunted in annoyance but did nothing to move away from the boy. At Asuka's compliance, Shinji began to nuzzle her neck causing her to blush a little.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员从背后靠近那位年轻女孩，温情地环抱住她的腰，随即在她脸颊上轻吻了一下。红发少女不满地哼了一声，却并未试图挣脱男孩的怀抱。看到明日香顺从的态度，真嗣开始在她脖颈间轻蹭，令她微微脸红。

"What is with you and doing public displays?!" Asuka said, turning around and pushing him away.  
“你这是怎么了，非得在大庭广众下秀恩爱吗？！”明日香转过身，推开了他。

However, Shinji grabbed the young girl's hands and pulled her towards him, bringing her into a kiss. He then brought his arms down around her waist to hold her close to him as he kissed her. Though the redhead still had a blush on her cheeks, she did not stop the boy and instead returned his affection. Kensuke just looked at the two of them surprised; even after hearing everything, it still seemed so bizarre. The otaku just looked around awkwardly, not really wanting to interrupt or say anything while they were smooching. Misato saw the events that had transpired between the classmates and coughed loudly to disrupt their kiss. At this, the two eva pilots parted instantly with Shinji still holding onto her.  
然而，真嗣抓住了少女的手，将她拉向自己，两人随即拥吻在一起。他双手环住她的腰，紧紧拥抱着她。尽管红发少女脸上仍带着红晕，但她并未阻止男孩，反而回应了他的情感。健介惊讶地看着他们，即便早已听闻一切，这一幕依旧显得如此不可思议。这位宅男尴尬地环顾四周，并不想打断他们，也不知该说什么，只能眼睁睁看着他们亲吻。美里目睹了同学间的这一幕，故意大声咳嗽，试图打断他们的吻。听到这声，两位 EVA 驾驶员立刻分开，真嗣依然紧握着她的手。

"There you go alright? Now stop pestering me already Shinji" Asuka complained. The male eva pilot refused to let her go as Asuka tried to move away from him.  
"好了，行了吧？别再烦我了，真嗣。" 明日香抱怨道。男性 eva 驾驶员拒绝放开她，尽管明日香试图从他身边离开。

"You guys really are into each other" Kensuke commented, causing the redhead to turn to face the bespectacled boy, still in Shinji's hold.  
"你们俩真的互相喜欢啊" 剑介评论道，这让红发女孩转向面对戴眼镜的男孩，仍然在真嗣的怀抱中。

"This is all one-sided believe me" Asuka said, sighing.  
"这都是我单方面的想法，相信我" 明日香叹息道。

"What do you mean it's 'all one-sided'?" Shinji asked, smirking. "You love it all" he said, moving his mouth down onto her shoulder, kissing her tenderly.  
“你说的‘全都是单方面的’是什么意思？”真嗣笑着问，“你明明喜欢得不得了。”他说着，嘴唇沿着她的肩膀缓缓下移，温柔地吻着她。

"God, you are such a baka! Just stop doing this in front of other people already!" Asuka shouted in annoyance.  
“天哪，你真是个笨蛋！别再在别人面前这样了！”明日香恼怒地喊道。

The military otaku just chuckled at their behaviour earning another surprised glance at the boy from the other two. "You two really do act like a married couple, I guess there really was nothing to worry about" Kensuke remarked.  
那个军事宅男只是对他们这种行为轻声笑了起来，这让另外两人又惊讶地看了他一眼。“你们俩真的就像一对夫妻一样，看来真的没什么好担心的。”健介评论道。

"I don't wanna hear that from you, I-!" Asuka started.  
"我可不想听你说这个，我-！" 明日香开口道。

"You really do love him Asuka, right?" Kensuke asked sincerely, interrupting the girl.  
"你真的很爱他，明日香，对吧？" 真嗣认真地问，打断了女孩。

The redhead halted for a moment before turning her face away. "Y-yeah… so what?" Asuka answered, blushing.  
红发女孩顿了一下，然后别过脸去。"嗯…是啊…那又怎样？" 明日香回答，脸颊泛红。

"Then I guess I'll just have to accept this relationship… good luck you two… honestly" Kensuke replied.  
"那么我想我只能接受这段关系了……祝你们好运……说实话" 真嗣回答道。

"Thanks Kensuke!" Shinji said in response.  
"谢谢你，真嗣！" 真希说。

"Oh and Shinji-" Kensuke started before he was interrupted by his cell phone ringing.  
"哦，还有真希——" 真嗣刚开口就被他的手机铃声打断了。

Curiously, the bespectacled boy checked his phone before recollection crossed his face as he saw the caller ID. Kensuke quickly pressed the _**accept call**_ button before holding his cell phone to his ear.  
好奇之下，戴眼镜的男孩在看到来电显示后，脸上闪过一丝回忆的神情。 Kensuke 迅速按下了接听键，然后将手机贴在耳边。

"Yeah hello Touji, it's me" Kensuke said into his phone.  
“喂，你好，是我” Kensuke 对着手机说道。

"Yeah, I'm sorry about taking so long, I just… got held up a bit, I'll be there right away"  
“嗯，抱歉让你久等了，我刚刚……有点耽搁了，我马上就到”

"Mhm. Once again sorry for making you wait and don't worry, I'll be there. Goodbye" Kensuke finished, before hanging up.  
"嗯，再次为让你久等道歉，别担心，我会到的。再见" 说完，健介挂断了电话。

Both Shinji and Asuka looked at the otaku curiously, wondering what was going on.  
真嗣和明日香都好奇地看着这位御宅族，想知道发生了什么事。

"Oh I told Touji I would meet with him after I checked up on you guys. As the conversation had taken really long, Touji had just called to ask where I was" Kensuke said in response to their faces.  
"哦，我告诉过斗司会在检查完你们之后和他见面。因为谈话时间拖得很长，斗司刚刚打电话来问我在哪里" 健介回应着他们的表情说道。

"So, you have to go now?" Shinji asked.  
"那么，你现在就得走了？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah" Kensuke answered, nodding. "I'll just tell Touji the angel battle has worn you out or something. I won't mention your relationship"  
"嗯" 健介点头回答，"我就跟东治说天使战斗把你累坏了之类的。我不会提到你们的关系。"

"You're a good friend. Goodbye and have fun!" Shinji said, letting go of Asuka and shaking his friend's hand.  
"你真是个好朋友。再见，玩得开心！" 真嗣说着，放开了明日香，与朋友握手道别。

"You too, I'll see ya later then Shinji. Goodbye!" Kensuke replied before the two boys walked to the front door.  
"你也是，那回头见，真嗣。再见！" 说完，健介和真嗣一起走向前门。

Shinji opened the front door and Kensuke stepped through the doorway.  
真嗣打开前门，健介跨过门槛。

"Bye" Kensuke simply said while waving.  
"拜拜" 健介简单地挥手道别。

"Bye!" Shinji replied and closed the door.  
“再见！” 真嗣回答后关上了门。

Shinji turned around and went over to the dining table and sat down, finally able to relax. The redhead moved over to Shinji before wrapping her arms around him.  
真嗣转过身，走到餐桌旁坐下，终于能够放松了。红发女孩走到真嗣身边，然后张开双臂抱住了他。

"Oi, why are you acting all stressed out Shinji? Wasn't _I_ the one who went through all the hardships?" Asuka teased. "That was far more embarrassing for me you know"  
“喂，你干嘛这么紧张啊，真嗣？不是我经历了所有困难吗？” 明日香调侃道，“你知道那对我来说更尴尬的。”

"Yeah I know, but that wasn't an easy thing to admit in front of him either" Shinji replied.  
“是啊，我知道，但在他面前承认这一点也不容易。” 真嗣回答道。

"But in the end, everything turned out fine right? It's nice to see you've finally grown some balls after all" Asuka said, smirking.  
“但最终，一切都变得很好对吧？看到你终于有点胆量了，真不错。” 明日香说着，微微一笑。

"But you already know that Asuka" Shinji replied, grinning.  
“但你已经知道这一点了，明日香。” 真嗣笑着回答。

"You sick bastard! Why do you always have to-" Asuka started.  
"你这个变态！为什么你总是要——" 明日香开口道。

"So, your friend is gone and you two are already back at the table, that's good" Misato said, interrupting them.  
"看来，你的朋友走了，你们俩又回到桌边了，这挺好" 美里打断他们说。

The two teenagers turned to face the Major; she had gotten up from the couch and was standing right beside the dining table.  
两个少年转向面对着少校；她已经从沙发上起身，正站在餐桌旁。

"First things first Shinji, I didn't want to do this while your friend was here" she started, before moving over to the boy as Shinji just looked up at her curiously. When she was right next to him, she slapped him hard across the face.  
“首先，真嗣，你朋友在这儿的时候我不想这么做。”她开口说道，随即走向男孩，真嗣好奇地抬头看着她。当她站到他身边时，她狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。

The surprise and force of the impact almost caused the boy to fall over in his chair as he cried out in pain; he was only prevented because Asuka had her arms around him. He looked up nursing his cheek, which was bleeding, realisation dawning on him about what Misato was doing.  
突如其来的冲击力和疼痛几乎让男孩从椅子上摔下来，他痛苦地叫出声来；幸好明日香用双臂抱住了他，他才没有倒下。他抬头抚摸着流血的脸颊，意识到美里正在做什么。

Asuka quickly released her hold on the boy and looked up at her guardian. "Misato?!" Asuka shouted. "What are you doing?!"  
明日香迅速松开男孩，抬头看向她的监护人。“美里？！”明日香喊道，“你在干什么？！”

"Quiet Asuka! Rape isn't something you can just get away with, this boy has committed a heinous offence" Misato replied angrily.  
“安静的明日香！强奸可不是你能轻易逃脱的罪行，这孩子犯下了令人发指的罪行。”美里愤怒地回答。

"Asuka, it's fine! Don't worry about me, this pales in comparison to what I deserve" Shinji said standing up from his chair, reassuring her.  
“明日香，没关系！别担心我，这跟我应得的相比微不足道。”真嗣从椅子上站起来，安慰她。

"Asuka doesn't have any intention of pressing charges, but even so Shinji, I can't turn a blind eye" Misato continued.  
“明日香没有打算提起诉讼，但即便如此，真嗣，我不能视而不见。”美里继续说道。

"Misato please, I understand where you're coming from, I do" Asuka started. "But it's ok, I've forgiven him. He definitely feels remorse for his actions"  
"美里，请听我说，我理解你的立场，我真的理解" 明日香开始说道。"但没关系，我已经原谅他了。他肯定对自己的行为感到懊悔"

"It's not good enough!" Misato retorted, her eyes watering. "My poor Asuka, what he did to you…" she started, before shaking her head and regaining control of her emotions. "What he did to you is not something that can be excused with just remorse. Shinji, you are going to spend some time in a cell at NERV, reflecting on your actions" she finished.  
"这还不够！" 美里反驳道，眼中泛着泪光。"我可怜的明日香，他对你所做的一切……" 她开口说道，然后摇了摇头，重新控制住自己的情绪。"他对你所做的一切，不是仅凭懊悔就能原谅的。真嗣，你将在 NERV 的牢房里度过一段时间，好好反省你的行为" 她最后说道。

"Yes Misato" Shinji responded without hesitation.  
"是，美里" 真嗣毫不犹豫地回应道。

"Wait just a second!" Asuka started. "If you must do this, can you please postpone it? We only just got together. I don't mean to undermine you Misato but… I think it'll be better if we get to spend some time together first" Asuka entreated.  
"等一下！" 明日香开口道，"如果你非得这么做，能不能推迟一下？我们才刚刚在一起。我不是想削弱你的权威，美里，但……我觉得我们先花点时间相处会更好" 明日香恳求道。

"Yes, I understand. I wasn't going to take him today; you guys need to rest after all that's happened. I will take him to NERV sometime this coming week" Misato replied.  
"好的，我理解。我今天本来就没打算带他去；你们经历了这么多，确实需要休息。我会在下周找个时间带他去 NERV" 美里回答道。

The young girl sighed in relief. "Thank you, Misato. And also, thank you for your… concern" she said honestly.  
年轻女孩松了口气，"谢谢你，美里。还有，谢谢你的……关心" 她真诚地说道。

"I care about both of you so much" Misato responded, hugging Asuka warmly, before turning to Shinji and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder.  
"我非常关心你们两个" 美里回答道，热情地拥抱了明日香，然后转向真嗣，把手放在他的肩膀上以示安慰。

"Thank you, Misato" Shinji replied sincerely.  
"谢谢你，美里" 真嗣真诚地回应。

At last, the heavy atmosphere from the discussions and the confrontation from Misato had been lifted.  
终于，讨论中的沉重气氛和美里的对峙带来的紧张感被消除了。

"Let me get something for that Shinji…" Asuka said looking at the wound on his face; Misato had put a lot of strength behind that.  
"让我来帮你处理一下，真嗣……" 明日香看着他脸上的伤口说道；美里那一巴掌可是用了不少力气。

"No it's ok, I can do it myself Asuka" Shinji protested straight away.  
"不用了，我自己可以的，明日香" 真嗣立刻抗议道。

"I insist!" the redhead refuted.  
"我坚持！" 红发的少女反驳道。

"Ok…" the boy reluctantly agreed.  
“好吧……”男孩不情愿地答应了。

The young girl went off to the medical cabinet and took out some disinfectant, cotton balls and band aids, before returning back to the boy. Shinji obediently stood still as Asuka carefully cleaned his wound and dabbed some disinfectant on it with the cotton balls, before applying a band aid over it.  
年轻女孩走向医药柜，取出一些消毒剂、棉球和创可贴，然后回到男孩身边。真嗣乖乖地站着不动，明日香小心翼翼地清理他的伤口，用棉球蘸上消毒剂涂抹，最后贴上创可贴。

Misato smiled a little as she watched the redhead fuss over the boy. Truth is she hadn't wanted to hit him _that_ hard, but when she thought about what Asuka went through in that moment, she couldn't hold back. At the very least, Shinji was accepting his punishment dutifully and she could tell he was repenting for his actions. Noticing that the redhead had finished up with Shinji, she walked over to them for one last talk. The two teens looked at her curiously.  
美里微微一笑，看着红发女孩忙于照顾男孩。事实上，她并不想打得太重，但当她想到明日香那一刻所经历的，她无法克制自己。至少，真嗣在认真接受惩罚，她能感觉到他在为自己的行为忏悔。注意到红发女孩已经处理完真嗣的伤口，她走过去进行最后一次谈话。两个少年好奇地看着她。

"We still need to discuss your 'activities' children" Misato announced.  
"我们还需要讨论你们的'活动'，孩子们。" 美里宣布道。

"Oh really?" Asuka smirked. "Are you jealous because you're not getting any?" Asuka teased.  
"哦，真的吗？" 明日香嘲讽地笑了。"你是不是因为自己得不到而嫉妒啊？" 明日香调侃道。

"Shut it Asuka! Be serious" Misato snapped. "You're still both teenagers and it would largely benefit you if you didn't just fuck each other senseless"  
"闭嘴，明日香！认真点。" 美里厉声说道。"你们俩都还是青少年，如果不只是盲目地沉溺于肉体关系，对你们会有很大好处的。"

"You're such a prime example Misato" Asuka continued tauntingly.  
"你真是个典型例子，美里" 明日香继续嘲讽地说道。

"This is for your own good" Misato continued, ignoring Asuka's remark. "I know what it's like, believe me. But it'll be much better for you if you limit it or don't do it at all until you're older. Unfortunately, I'm busy at NERV, so I can't really keep an eye on you, but I'm asking you as your guardian to listen to me" Misato finished.  
"这是为你好" 美里继续说，无视明日香的话。"我知道那是什么感觉，相信我。但如果你限制它或者根本不做，直到你长大一些，对你来说会好得多。不幸的是，我在 NERV 很忙，所以我不能真正盯着你，但我以你监护人的身份请求你听我的话" 美里说完。

"Is that all then?" Asuka replied, not really caring.  
"就这些吗？" 明日香回答，并不真正在意。

"I'm being serious here Asuka! Don't dismiss what I'm saying" the Major retorted. This time the redhead did not respond. "There is one more thing I need to ask too"  
"我是认真的，明日香！别忽视我的话" 少校反驳道。这次红发女孩没有回应。"还有一件事我需要问你"

"What's that?" Asuka asked.  
"什么事？" 明日香问道。

"You told me you wouldn't get pregnant Asuka. I assume that means you're using protection, but I haven't seen any condoms, pill packets or anything for that matter. What the hell are you using?" Misato asked.  
"你告诉我你不会怀孕的，明日香。我猜这意味着你在使用避孕措施，但我没看到任何避孕套、药片包装或其他任何相关的东西。你到底在用什么？" 美里问道。

"Why should we tell you?" Asuka shot back.  
"我们为什么要告诉你？" 明日香反驳道。

"I need to know" Misato replied.  
"我需要知道。" 美里回答。

"What, so you can use it yourself?" Asuka said, grinning.  
"怎么，这样你就可以自己用了？" 明日香笑着说。

The Major blushed slightly. "Stop it already Asuka! That is not the reason, I just need to know if it's reliable" she rebuked.  
玛丽少校微微脸红。“够了，明日香！这不是原因，我只是需要知道它是否可靠。”她反驳道。

"It's reliable Misato, that's all you need to know" Asuka answered.  
“米莎托，它很可靠，这就是你需要知道的全部。”明日香回答。

The older woman was growing tired of the redhead's behaviour; her stubbornness was back in full. Then again, it wasn't anything worth getting worked up over and she needed to go back to NERV now; the aftermath of the angel battle had to be dealt with after all.  
这位年长的女性对红发女孩的行为越来越感到疲惫；她的固执又回来了。不过，这并不是什么值得大惊小怪的事，她现在需要回到 NERV；毕竟，天使战斗的后果还需要处理。

"Well unfortunately our discussion has to end here, I can't postpone any longer. With the angel attack, I have mountains of work to finish. I was only granted a small break today and must go back to NERV now" Misato announced.  
"遗憾的是，我们的讨论只能到此为止了，我不能再拖延了。由于天使的袭击，我有堆积如山的工作要完成。今天我只被批准了短暂的休息，现在必须返回 NERV 了" 美里宣布道。

"Good luck with your work Misato" Shinji replied warmly.  
"祝你工作顺利，美里" 真嗣温暖地回应。

"Doesn't sound like your job is fun at all Misato" Asuka teased.  
"听起来你的工作一点也不好玩嘛，美里" 明日香打趣道。

"Yeah yeah, I guess no one feels sorry for me" Misato complained, walking towards the front door.  
“是是，我想没人会同情我。”美里抱怨着，朝前门走去。

"I'm sure you can handle it" Asuka remarked.  
“我相信你能应付得来。”明日香说道。

Misato arrived at the front door and opened it before turning around. "Well I'm off then, goodbye now. Please try to behave alright?" Misato implored.  
美里走到前门，打开门后转过身来。“那我走了，再见。请尽量乖一点，好吗？”美里恳求道。

"We will Misato, goodbye" Shinji replied.  
“我们会想你的，美里，再见。”真嗣回答道。

At this, the Major exited her residence and closed the door behind her before locking it.  
听到这话，美里少校离开了她的住所，关上门并锁好。

The two eva pilots turned to face each other at the same time and then looked away, blushing slightly; Misato's comments had got them both being self-conscious to the fact that they were now alone together. Shinji himself had kind of wanted to have some fun with Asuka now that they were a couple, but he didn't want to betray his guardian's trust either. Unable to resolve this dilemma, the boy moved off in the direction of the kitchen to prepare some food; after all, they both hadn't eaten for quite a while.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员同时转向对方，然后又略带羞涩地移开目光；美里的调侃让他们都意识到现在只有他们两个人独处。真嗣自己其实有点想和明日香一起玩乐，毕竟他们现在是一对，但他也不想辜负监护人的信任。无法解决这个难题，男孩走向厨房准备食物；毕竟，他们俩已经很久没吃东西了。

"I'm going to make some food now, you're hungry right Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“我现在去做点吃的，你饿了吧，明日香？” 真嗣问道。

"Huh? Oh yeah… sure" Asuka replied before sitting down at the dining table.  
“嗯？哦，是啊……当然。” 明日香回答后，坐在餐桌旁。

Shinji watched as the redhead laid her head down on the wooden surface, her expression looking bored, before he entered the kitchen. He then went and opened the fridge, finding more than enough ingredients to make a decent meal. Taking out what he needed, he began preparing a meal for himself and the redhead. As Shinji cooked, he began humming quietly to himself. The boy now felt a lot more at ease than he had yesterday; it seemed just about everything had been resolved. With all his ill deeds having been confessed and still being together with Asuka, he felt like he could finally settle down. He could still feel the sting of the wound on his cheek, but he figured it would serve as a good reminder for his actions.  
真嗣看着红发女孩将头靠在木质桌面上，表情显得无聊，然后他走进厨房。他打开冰箱，发现有足够的食材做一顿像样的饭。拿出所需的东西后，他开始为自己和红发女孩准备饭菜。真嗣一边做饭，一边轻声哼唱。现在他感觉比昨天放松多了；似乎一切都解决了。所有的坏事都已坦白，还能和明日香在一起，他觉得自己终于可以安定下来了。他仍能感觉到脸颊上的伤口隐隐作痛，但他认为这会是一个很好的提醒，提醒他的行为。

It didn't take too long for Shinji to finish preparing the food and he took the finished meals from the kitchen and placed them down on the dining table. At once, the redhead grabbed her meal and began shoving it down her throat; she really was as hungry as he had been.  
没过多久，真嗣就准备好了食物，他从厨房端出做好的饭菜，摆放在餐桌上。红发女孩立刻抓起自己的那份，狼吞虎咽起来；她的确像他一样饿坏了。

"Misato really hit you hard" Asuka commented as she was eating.  
“美里这次真的把你打惨了。”明日香边吃边评论道。

"Definitely, I was quite surprised at the time" he responded, "But she was more than justified in doing so. Thanks for coming to my aid though Asuka" he said gratefully.  
“确实，当时我挺惊讶的。”他回应道，“但她那么做完全有理由。不过，还是谢谢你来帮我，明日香。”他感激地说。

"Mm" she replied. "嗯" 她回答道。

Even though Shinji _was_ starving, he still took his time to eat his meal; a fact that Asuka was slowly growing annoyed by. The redhead didn't say anything, but Shinji could sure as hell feel the intense stare he was getting from her; it almost seemed like she wanted him to finish so she could do something. Shinji couldn't help forming a smile as he purposefully ate even slower than before. Asuka didn't take too kindly to the fact that he was enjoying tormenting her and quickly connected a foot to his knee.  
尽管真嗣饿得要命，他还是慢条斯理地吃着饭；这一点让明日香渐渐感到恼火。红发的她没有说什么，但真嗣能明显感觉到她那灼热的目光；她似乎希望他能快点吃完，好去做些什么。真嗣忍不住露出微笑，故意比之前吃得还要慢。明日香对他在享受折磨她的事实并不买账，迅速用脚踢了他的膝盖。

"Oww, what was that for Asuka?" Shinji exclaimed.  
"哎哟，明日香，你这是干什么？" 真嗣惊呼道。

"I don't know what you're talking about, perhaps you're starting to imagine strange things while you're spacing out instead of eating" Asuka replied, her face irritated.  
"我不知道你在说什么，也许你走神的时候开始胡思乱想了，而不是在吃饭。" 明日香回答道，脸上带着不悦。

The boy sweat dropped at her comment and made sure to finish the rest of his meal so as not to anger her any further. Upon consuming his food, Shinji's hunger was now satisfied and so he stood up from the table. Taking his and Asuka's plates plus the glasses they had left there, he entered the kitchen and deposited it all into the sink. As he returned to the dining room, he found Asuka standing next to the table, a strange look on her face.  
男孩听到她的话后汗颜，确保吃完剩下的饭菜以免再惹她生气。吃完食物后，真嗣的饥饿感得到了满足，于是他从桌旁站起身来。拿起自己和明日香的盘子以及他们留下的杯子，他走进厨房，将所有东西都放进水槽。当他回到餐厅时，发现明日香站在桌旁，脸上带着奇怪的表情。

"Something up, Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
"怎么了，明日香？" 真嗣问道。

"I don't know Shinji… we are here together all alone you know…" Asuka said, trailing off.  
"我不知道，真嗣……我们在这里，孤零零的两个人……" 明日香说着，声音渐渐低了下去。

"But Misato said not to-" Shinji started.  
"但美里小姐说不要——" 真嗣开口道。

"And you're going to listen to Misato now? After all those times, you're not going to go ahead because _Misato_ said it?" Asuka asked; it was evident in her voice how ridiculous she thought it was.  
"你现在还要听美里的话吗？经历了那么多回，就因为美里这么说了，你就不敢前进了？" 明日香问道；她的语气中明显透露出她觉得这有多荒谬。

"I know she's not a great example, but she has lots of experience and she's our guardian Asuka" Shinji replied.  
"我知道她不是个好榜样，但她经验丰富，而且是我们守护者明日香" 真嗣回答道。

"Even so, I know you still want to do it" Asuka shot back.  
"即便如此，我知道你还是想这么做" 明日香反驳道。

Shinji just stayed silent in response.  
真嗣只是沉默以对。

The redhead just sighed. "You know Shinji… have you ever thought about what would've happened if you never… forced me?" she asked.  
红发女孩只是叹了口气。“你知道的，真嗣……你有没有想过，如果你从未……强迫我，会发生什么？”她问道。

"I… I haven't really thought about it" Shinji answered.  
“我……我确实没怎么想过”真嗣回答道。

"What would we be like? Would we still get together? Did we miss our chance in becoming a couple normally?" Asuka asked.  
“我们会是什么样子？我们还会在一起吗？我们是不是错过了正常成为情侣的机会？”明日香问道。

"I guess we'll never know…" Shinji replied.  
"我想我们永远不会知道了…" 真嗣回答道。

Something flashed across the redhead's face and Shinji couldn't help but think it was regret.  
红发少女的脸上闪过一丝情绪，真嗣不禁觉得那是后悔。

"I don't want to lose what we have right now but I can't help but think… why did it have to happen this way?" Asuka announced.  
"我不想失去我们现在拥有的，但我忍不住想…为什么事情会变成这样？" 明日香宣布道。

"It didn't have to… unfortunately, I made it happen that way…" Shinji answered.  
"其实不必……不幸的是，我让它那样发生了……" 真嗣回答道。

"You know what I mean… why didn't things happen differently?" she replied.  
"你明白我的意思……为什么事情没有以不同的方式发生？" 她回应道。

"I don't know…" he said, not really knowing what she wanted; it wasn't like Asuka to dwell on the past like this.  
"我不知道……" 他说，并不真正知道她想要什么；像这样沉湎于过去，不像明日香的风格。

"When we made love Shinji, it made me forget what had happened momentarily, made me feel like none of that mattered" Asuka started. The boy just looked at the girl with wide eyes, unable to say anything back. "What do you feel Shinji?" she asked.  
"当我们做爱时，真嗣，那一刻让我暂时忘记了发生的一切，让我感觉那些都不重要了" 明日香开始说道。男孩只是睁大眼睛看着女孩，无法回应什么。"你感觉怎么样，真嗣？" 她问道。

"I feel… that I can make you happy" Shinji answered.  
"我感觉…我能让你快乐" 真嗣回答道。

"God you're so corny!" Asuka snapped, a small smile forming on her face masked by her anger.  
"天啊，你真是老土！" 明日香厉声说道，脸上虽带着怒意，却掩不住那抹微笑。

"But it's true!" Shinji replied. "I don't like it when you're down"  
“但这是真的！”真嗣回答，“我不喜欢你这样消沉。”

"Yeah yeah, whatever" Asuka said in response before walking off.  
“是是是，随你怎么说。”明日香回应道，然后走开了。

The redhead's journey was soon halted as Shinji pulled her back to him, planted a deep kiss on her lips and wrapped his arms around the girl; seeing the girl looking so downcast overrode his feelings of betraying Misato after all. Asuka returned the kiss, holding Shinji close to her as well. The two teens parted and momentarily looked at each other before Shinji began to pull off her shirt. The two eva pilots kissed each other repeatedly as the boy moved the two towards the dining table. Shinji then removed the redhead's bra and let it fall to the floor, exposing her top half completely. Pushing the girl down onto the table, Shinji then moved his mouth down onto her nipples, sucking them teasingly. Asuka moaned as the boy continued his actions on her sensitive breasts and she felt herself growing quickly aroused.  
红发少女的脚步很快被真嗣拉了回来，他深深地吻上了她的唇，双臂环绕着她；看到她如此沮丧，他最终还是压下了对美里背叛感的情绪。明日香也回吻着，紧紧抱住真嗣。两个少年分开片刻，对视了一眼，随后真嗣开始脱下她的衬衫。两位 EVA 驾驶员不断亲吻，真嗣将两人移向餐桌。接着，他解开了明日香的胸罩，让它滑落到地上，完全露出了她的上半身。真嗣将她推倒在桌上，然后低头含住她的乳头，挑逗地吸吮。明日香呻吟着，随着真嗣在她敏感的乳房上继续动作，她感到自己迅速兴奋起来。

The boy could not hold himself back any longer as he began to fondle her breasts roughly with his hands, while his mouth kissed her all over her body. The erotic moans Asuka let out had quickly caused a tent in his pants, so he unzipped his pants and pulled them down to relieve the pressure. The only thing blocking his goal now was her panties. Sensing what he wanted to do, the girl lifted her legs up and he pulled her underwear off with her skirt, revealing her glistening vagina. After the redhead's undergarment had been removed, Shinji wasted no time in stimulating her most sensitive area with his fingers, causing the girl to cry out in pleasure. In between Asuka's legs, the boy could not help but be mesmerised by the faces the redhead was making as he continued to pleasure her. Shinji's hand was all covered in the girl's excitement as he worked his fingers into her, reaching her most sensitive spots and making her moan aloud in accordance.  
男孩再也无法抑制自己，双手粗暴地抚摸着她的胸部，同时嘴巴在她全身各处亲吻。明日香发出的色情呻吟声迅速让他的裤子顶起了一个帐篷，于是他拉开拉链，脱下裤子以缓解压力。现在唯一阻挡他目标的，只剩下她的内裤。感觉到他的意图，女孩抬起双腿，他便连同裙子一起扯下了她的内裤，露出了她闪闪发光的私处。红发女孩的内衣被脱掉后，真嗣毫不迟疑地用手指刺激她最敏感的区域，让女孩发出愉悦的叫声。在明日香的双腿间，男孩不禁被红发女孩随着他继续取悦她而做出的表情所迷住。真嗣的手上沾满了女孩的兴奋，他深入她的体内，触及她最敏感的点，让她大声呻吟。

Removing his hand, Shinji then positioned his cock at the girl's entrance. Asuka herself wrapped her legs around the boy, her eyes gazing at him. Grabbing the girl's shoulders for support, Shinji shoved himself inside her, causing Asuka to cry out erotically. The feeling of her tight canal never ceased to amaze the boy; it just felt so incredible. Continuing his thrusting, Shinji could feel Asuka's legs tightening around him and her cries growing louder. Her breasts jiggled constantly with each thrust and the girl's face was contorted with ecstasy. The redhead slowly became wilder as Shinji continued fucking her; all the other times she had forced herself not to participate, but with all her feelings now confessed she no longer held back. The boy was greatly surprised to see Asuka being so aggressive. The redhead bucked her hips with every thrust, pushing him deeper inside, while also fondling her own breast and running her other hand through the boy's hair. Shinji found her increased involvement quite to his liking.  
松开手，真嗣将他的阴茎对准了女孩的入口。明日香自己用双腿缠绕住男孩，目光凝视着他。抓住女孩的肩膀以支撑，真嗣猛地插入她体内，让明日香发出诱人的呻吟。她紧致的通道所带来的感觉从未停止让真嗣惊叹；那种感觉实在是太美妙了。继续他的抽插，真嗣能感受到明日香的双腿在他身上收紧，她的叫声也越来越大。每一次撞击，她的乳房都随之颤动，女孩的脸上洋溢着极乐的表情。随着真嗣继续操她，红发女孩逐渐变得更加狂野；以往她总是强迫自己不参与，但现在所有的感情都已坦白，她不再压抑。真嗣对明日香如此主动感到非常惊讶。红发女孩随着每一次撞击扭动臀部，将他推得更深，同时抚摸着自己的乳房，另一只手穿过男孩的头发。真嗣发现她更加投入的表现非常合他的意。

It wasn't surprising that Asuka was close to the edge already and Shinji could tell; her cries were growing increasingly louder. Thus, the boy doubled his efforts in plunging into her as he tried to bring her over faster. It didn't take long for the redhead to cum and she shook violently, screaming Shinji's name in orgasm. As Asuka climaxed, Shinji could not hold himself back any longer and he ejaculated inside her. Shinji could feel the blood pumping through his body and the heavy sweat that covered him; he certainly felt invigorated. The boy stepped back after Asuka had calmed down, but his rest was short-lived. The redhead unexpectedly jumped up and sent Shinji reeling back into a chair. The boy just looked up at her curiously, wondering what she was doing.  
并不意外的是，明日香已经接近极限，真嗣能从她愈发响亮的呻吟中察觉到这一点。于是，男孩加倍努力地深入她，试图更快地带她达到高潮。没过多久，红发女孩便达到了高潮，她剧烈颤抖着，在高潮中尖叫着真嗣的名字。随着明日香达到顶峰，真嗣再也控制不住自己，在她体内射精。真嗣能感受到血液在体内奔涌，以及覆盖全身的沉重汗水；他确实感到精神焕发。在明日香平静下来后，男孩退后一步，但他的休息并未持续太久。红发女孩突然跳起，将真嗣撞回到椅子上。男孩只是好奇地抬头看着她，不知道她要做什么。

To his amazement, Asuka grabbed his stiff rod and began pumping it up and down. Shinji was fully erect in next to no time and the girl then proceeded to impale herself on his cock and began plunging it in and out of her. The redhead brought her arms around the boy's neck and pulled her closer to him, kissing him hungrily. Shinji could feel her moan in his mouth every time her pussy swallowed his cock. Asuka then moved one hand down his back while the other one placed his hand on her breast. Taking the hint, the boy began to gently massage the girl's chest and kiss her back just as passionately. Though personally Shinji preferred to be the one on top, he didn't mind not doing all the work for once. Shinji groaned in pleasure as Asuka began to press down on his member with each thrust; this was the first time Asuka actually went out of her way to please him. The two teens momentarily parted and looked at each other as Asuka continued her work. Shinji could feel the redhead's hot breath across his face as she moaned erotically and the warmth emanating from her body as she pressed close to him. The look of rapture on her face was unlike any he had seen before.  
令他惊讶的是，明日香抓住了他僵硬的肉棒，开始上下抽动。真嗣几乎立刻就完全勃起了，接着女孩便将自己套在他的阴茎上，开始来回抽插。红发少女将双臂环绕在男孩的脖颈上，将他拉近，饥渴地亲吻着他。每次她的蜜穴吞吐他的肉棒时，真嗣都能感受到她在自己口中的呻吟。明日香随后将一只手移到他的背上，另一只手则引导他的手放在她的乳房上。领会到她的暗示，男孩开始温柔地按摩女孩的胸部，并以同样的热情回吻她。尽管个人而言真嗣更喜欢处于上方，但他并不介意这次不必承担所有的工作。随着明日香每一次挺身压下他的肉棒，真嗣愉悦地呻吟着；这是明日香第一次真正费心取悦他。两个少年暂时分开，对视着，而明日香继续她的动作。真嗣能感受到红发少女灼热的气息拂过他的脸庞，她淫荡的呻吟声，以及她紧贴着他时身体散发出的温暖。她脸上那陶醉的表情是他前所未见的。

"I love you Asuka" Shinji said ardently, reassuring her.  
“我爱你，明日香。”真嗣热切地说道，安抚着她。

At this point in time, the redhead arched her back and finally orgasmed again. In response, Asuka just increased her pace, shoving his cock in as deep as she could while she was orgasming. Shinji made sure to hold her in case she fell backwards; she was moving about quite a deal. The boy found Asuka's behaviour to be unbelievably arousing and so shot his cum up her pussy. After this, the redhead finally halted, the girl's heavy breathing was all that could be heard. Shinji's heart was pounding heavily and he was already growing tired. However, the girl wasn't finishing there as she moved off the boy and brought her hand down onto his cock once more. Asuka fondled his testicles and moved her hand up and down his shaft getting him erect once again. Shinji then found himself wondering when she was going to take a break as she once again penetrated herself with his cock. Shinji groaned as his member took the repeated attention; it was starting to become painful as well.  
此时此刻，红发女孩挺直了背，终于再次达到了高潮。作为回应，明日香只是加快了节奏，将他的阴茎尽可能深地插入自己体内，同时还在高潮中。真嗣确保抱住她以防她向后倒下；她动得相当厉害。男孩发现明日香的行为令人难以置信地兴奋，于是射精进入了她的阴道。之后，红发女孩终于停了下来，只能听到她沉重的呼吸声。真嗣的心跳得厉害，他已经开始感到疲惫。然而，女孩并没有就此结束，她从男孩身上移开，再次将手放在他的阴茎上。明日香抚弄着他的睾丸，上下移动她的手，使他再次勃起。真嗣不禁想知道她何时会休息，因为她再次用他的阴茎插入自己。真嗣呻吟着，他的阴茎经受了反复的关注；也开始感到疼痛。

Whereas Asuka seemed to have unlimited energy, Shinji was slowly losing his stamina. It was inevitable that the boy would eventually lose all control if this continued. It didn't help that the girl was being overly erotic. The sight of her covered in sweat, her breasts bouncing up and down, her face moaning every time she engulfed his member was just too much for Shinji and he burst inside her, this being the first time they did not orgasm together.  
尽管明日香似乎有着无穷的精力，真嗣却在慢慢失去体力。如果这种情况继续下去，男孩最终失去控制是不可避免的。女孩过于色情的行为也无济于事。她浑身是汗，胸部上下弹跳，每次吞没他的下体时都会发出呻吟的脸，这对真嗣来说太过分了，他在她体内爆发了，这是他们第一次没有同时达到高潮。

Shinji decided he needed to take control of the situation again and stood up abruptly, forcing Asuka to grab onto Shinji so she didn't fall over. The redhead looked at the boy curiously, an annoyed expression on her face.  
真嗣决定他需要再次掌控局面，突然站了起来，迫使明日香抓住真嗣以免摔倒。红发女孩好奇地看着男孩，脸上带着恼怒的表情。

"I haven't cum yet Shinji, why did you stop?" Asuka asked, irritated.  
“我还没射呢，真嗣，你为什么停下？”明日香不悦地问道。

"Because I can't keep up, let me rest a little" Shinji answered, smirking.  
“因为我跟不上，让我休息一下。” 真嗣回答道，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

"Come on, I was so close!" Asuka replied back.  
“来吧，我就差一点了！” 明日香回敬道。

In response, the boy placed the girl back onto the table and moved in between her legs. Before she could do anything, Shinji grabbed her legs and locked them in place before going down on her pussy with his mouth. The redhead could not hold back her cries of ecstasy as the boy probed her super hot and sticky vagina with his tongue. The male eva pilot savoured the taste of her pussy as he delved as deep as he could inside her. Shinji's nose occasionally brushed her clit as he gave her oral sex, causing her to jerk every now and then. Shinji found his head being forcefully pressed into the girl's lower region as she held him tightly around the head. He could feel how taut the redhead's legs were and how wet the girl was; her juices were all over his face.  
作为回应，男孩将女孩放回桌子上，移到她的双腿之间。在她能做出任何反应之前，真嗣抓住她的双腿并固定住，然后俯身用嘴去亲吻她的私处。红发女孩无法抑制住自己的欢愉尖叫，因为男孩用舌头探索她那超级热且黏稠的阴道。男性 eva 驾驶员品尝着她的私处，尽可能深入地探入。真嗣的鼻子偶尔会触碰到她的阴蒂，在给她口交时，这让她不时地抽搐。真嗣感觉到自己的头被女孩用力按在她的下体，她紧紧地抱住他的头。他能感受到红发女孩双腿的紧绷和女孩的湿润；她的体液遍布他的脸庞。

Seeing how much Asuka was struggling, Shinji knew she wanted her release and so he assaulted her clitoris. The boy sucked her little nub viciously, while occasionally flicking it with his tongue, causing the redhead to finally go over the edge. The girl screamed loudly as she came and her body trembled with each wave of pleasure. Shinji made sure to hold her legs tightly as he continued to lick, suck and attack her pussy. His face was getting drenched in the girl's fluids as he tried his best to drink her. After she came down from her climax, Asuka pushed Shinji's head away from her, having had enough for the moment.  
看到明日香挣扎得如此厉害，真嗣知道她渴望释放，于是他攻击了她的阴蒂。男孩凶猛地吸吮着她的小豆豆，偶尔用舌头轻弹它，让红发女孩终于越过了边缘。女孩尖叫着达到高潮，她的身体随着每一波快感颤抖。真嗣确保紧紧抓住她的腿，同时继续舔舐、吸吮并攻击她的私处。他的脸被女孩的体液浸湿，他尽力吞咽。在高潮过后，明日香推开了真嗣的头，暂时已经足够了。

The boy moved away from the redhead and sat down on the chair. Shinji noticed the girl was panting heavily and it took a while before she sat up and moved off the table. Asuka's legs were shaking as she stood up and she accidentally tripped over before Shinji caught her.  
男孩离开红发女孩，坐在椅子上。真嗣注意到女孩呼吸沉重，过了一会儿她才坐起来，从桌子上下来。明日香站起来时双腿颤抖，不小心绊了一下，被真嗣及时扶住。

"Watch it there" Shinji said, grinning.  
“小心点”真嗣笑着说。

"I'm fine" Asuka said. brushing him off.  
"我没事" 明日香说道，不耐烦地打发他。

The redhead moved away from the boy and entered the kitchen. She returned with a glass full of water and drank the contents before setting the empty glass down on the table.  
红发女孩从男孩身边走开，进了厨房。她拿着一杯水回来，喝完里面的水后，将空杯子放在桌上。

"You know I was pretty amazed actually. You were so full of energy this time. What was up with that?" Shinji asked as he saw the girl return.  
"你知道吗，我其实挺惊讶的。这次你精力这么充沛，怎么回事？" 真嗣问道，看着女孩回来。

"You didn't like it or something?" Asuka asked, annoyed.  
"你不喜欢还是怎么的？" 明日香问道，显得有些不耐烦。

"Of course I did! I was just wondering where it came from, you never did anything like that before" Shinji answered.  
"我当然喜欢！我只是好奇它是从哪儿来的，你以前从没做过这样的事" 真嗣回答道。

The redhead just sighed. "What does it matter? If you don't appreciate my efforts, I just won't do it again" she replied.  
红发女孩只是叹了口气。"这有什么关系？如果你不欣赏我的努力，那我以后就不再做了" 她回应道。

"God you can be so annoying sometimes Asuka" Shinji said, sticking his tongue out at her.  
"天哪，你有时候真是烦人，明日香。" 真嗣说着，向她吐了吐舌头。

"Honestly, is it such a big deal if I do something like this?! I was just making up for all the other times where I pretty much just sat back and did nothing" the redhead replied back angrily.  
"说实话，我这么做有那么严重吗？！我只是弥补之前那些时候，我基本上只是坐着什么都没做" 红发女孩生气地回敬道。

"Relax Asuka I _am_ grateful, I was just curious is all" Shinji said in response.  
"放松点，明日香，我很感激，我只是好奇而已" 真嗣回应道。

"Yeah yeah" Asuka said, rolling her eyes. "So why did you _really_ stop me?" Asuka asked.  
“是是是”明日香翻了个白眼，“那你到底为什么拦住我？”明日香问道。

"What, do you think I took Viagra or something? You really were wearing me down" Shinji answered.  
“什么，你以为我吃了伟哥还是怎么的？你真的让我受不了了”真嗣回答道。

"Hmpf, I thought you could last longer than that" Asuka said mockingly.  
“哼，我还以为你能坚持得更久呢”明日香嘲讽地说。

"Yeah yeah, sorry for not meeting your expectations" Shinji said sarcastically. "But I doubt you could survive constant, repeated attention either" he added.  
"是是，抱歉没达到你的期望" 真嗣讽刺地说道。"但我怀疑你也无法承受这种持续不断的关注" 他补充道。

"I can last longer than you for sure. I reckon I could _easily_ handle anything you throw at me, in fact I'm pretty sure _you'll_ get tired before me any day" Asuka said defiantly.  
"我肯定能比你坚持得更久。我估计我能轻松应对你抛给我的任何挑战，事实上我相当确定你会在我之前累倒" 明日香挑衅地说。

"So, who was it who fell asleep after having sex the other day, twice, hmm?" Shinji asked teasingly.  
"那么，是谁前几天做完爱后睡着了，还两次，嗯？" 真嗣戏谑地问道。

The redhead blushed slightly before responding. "That was just because I had barely eaten anything both days, I was tired before you even started, especially with all _that_ day's events. It's not my fault you insisted having intercourse on days when I was exhausted" Asuka retorted.  
红发女孩微微脸红后回应道：“那只是因为我这两天几乎没吃什么东西，在你开始之前我就已经很累了，尤其是那天发生的所有事情。你非要在这种我筋疲力尽的日子里坚持做那事，又不是我的错。”明日香反驳道。

Shinji chuckled slightly at her justification; it seemed as though the gloomy face Asuka had on earlier had now completely disappeared. "Hah then prove it. Show me you can handle _anything_ I throw at you, otherwise it's just empty words Asuka" Shinji challenged half-jokingly.  
真嗣对她这番辩解轻声笑了笑；看来明日香之前那副阴沉的脸色现在已经完全消失了。“哈，那就证明给我看。展示你能应付我抛给你的任何挑战，否则那只是空话，明日香。”真嗣半开玩笑地挑战道。

"You're on baka!" Asuka replied instantly.  
“你等着瞧，笨蛋！”明日香立刻回应道。

Shinji was a little surprised the redhead accepted this challenge, but decided to see how it would play out anyway; after all, it appeared like she was back to her usual self. "Ok, just don't complain later" he said smugly.  
真嗣对红发女孩接受这个挑战感到有些惊讶，但还是决定看看事情会如何发展；毕竟，她似乎又恢复了往常的样子。“好吧，只是别事后抱怨”他得意地说。

"As if I could lose" Asuka rebuked.  
“好像我会输似的”明日香反驳道。

At this, the boy abruptly picked Asuka up before carrying her over to her room.  
听到这话，男孩突然抱起明日香，把她带到她的房间。

"I can walk you know! Why do you always do this?!" Asuka remarked, annoyed.  
"我知道我能走！你为什么总是这么做？！" 明日香抱怨道，显得有些恼火。

"Because I can" Shinji simply replied.  
"因为我可以" 真嗣简单地回答。

Asuka just sighed in response.  
明日香只是叹了口气作为回应。

Opening her door, Shinji entered the girl's room before laying her down on her bed. After letting her down, the boy stood up and turned around.  
打开房门，真嗣走进了女孩的房间，然后将她轻轻放在床上。安置好她后，男孩站起身，转过头来。

"Where are you going?" Asuka asked curiously.  
“你要去哪儿？”明日香好奇地问道。

"Just wait here, I'll be right back" Shinji replied. "You'll see what you got yourself into Asuka" he added, smiling.  
“就在这儿等着，我马上回来。”真嗣回答道，“你会明白自己卷入了什么，明日香。”他笑着补充。

The redhead watched the boy as he exited her room, not liking his smile one bit.  
红发女孩注视着男孩离开她的房间，一点也不喜欢他那笑容。

Shinji went back to the dining room, put the chair back into place and wiped the table clean with a cloth. The boy had a rough idea of what he could do with Asuka, but he needed some means to prevent her from halting him in any way. As Shinji looked at the cloth he was holding, he suddenly formed a plan in his head; the perfect scheme to prove the girl wrong. The boy deposited the used cloth into the washing basket before retrieving two new ones and returning to Asuka's room. As Shinji re-entered her room, Asuka looked up at him curiously. The girl in question was lying back on her bed; she hadn't bothered covering herself at all as she was still quite warm from their previous activities.  
真嗣回到餐厅，把椅子放回原位，并用一块布将桌子擦干净。男孩对如何对付明日香有了大致的想法，但他需要一些方法来防止她以任何方式阻止他。当真嗣看着手中的布时，他突然在脑海中形成了一个计划；一个完美的方案来证明女孩是错的。男孩将用过的布放入洗衣篮，然后取出两块新布，回到明日香的房间。当真嗣再次进入她的房间时，明日香好奇地抬头看着他。她躺在床上，完全没有遮掩自己，因为之前的活动让她仍然感到很热。

"You're not planning on cleaning my room or something are you?" Asuka asked, puzzled.  
“你不是打算打扫我的房间吧？”明日香疑惑地问。

"Heh yeah right, these are just to ensure your cooperation" Shinji said in response.  
"呵呵，说得真好听，这些只是为了确保你的合作。" 真嗣回应道。

"What on earth do you mean?" the redhead asked, confused.  
"你到底是什么意思？" 红发女孩困惑地问。

"Well, you _did_ say you could handle _anything_ right? I'm just going to tie your arms to the bed with these so you don't go back on your word" he answered, holding the cloths up.  
"嗯，你不是说过你能应付一切吗？我只是要把你的手臂绑在床上，这样你就不会食言了。" 他举起布条回答道。

"You gotta be kidding right? Why do you have to tie my arms? I've already said I won't stop you" Asuka retorted.  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧？为什么要绑住我的手臂？我已经说过我不会阻止你了" 明日香反驳道。

Shinji didn't think she'd agree straight away, but he knew he would lose against her if he didn't do this so he tried to convince her.  
真嗣没想到她会立刻同意，但他知道如果不这么做，自己肯定会输给她，所以他试图说服她。

"Then there's nothing to be afraid of is there? If you're not going to stop me then it doesn't matter if your arms are tied now does it?" Shinji argued.  
"那么就没有什么好害怕的了，不是吗？如果你不打算阻止我，那么现在绑住你的手臂也无所谓，对吧？" 真嗣争辩道。

"I could say the same thing, if I'm not going to stop you, then it doesn't matter if my arms _aren't_ tied either" Asuka countered.  
"我也可以这么说，如果我不打算阻止你，那么我的手臂是否被绑也无所谓" 明日香反驳道。

"Come on Asuka, the challenge _did_ specify _anything_. That includes me tying your arms up. Just consider it a safety measure to prevent you from injuring me" Shinji persuaded.  
"拜托，明日香，挑战确实没有具体说明。这包括我绑住你的手臂。就当是为了防止你伤到我而采取的安全措施吧" 真嗣劝说道。

The redhead paused for a bit as she thought about the proposal. "Oh fine whatever, it's not like it makes a difference" Asuka replied, throwing her hands up in the air. "I trust you won't do anything funny though right?" Asuka warned.  
红发女孩停顿了一下，思考着这个提议。"好吧，随便了，反正也没什么差别" 明日香回答，双手一挥。"不过我相信你不会做什么奇怪的事吧？" 明日香警告道。

"Of course" Shinji answered honestly.  
“当然。” 真嗣诚实地回答。

"Alright, go ahead and do it" Asuka said reluctantly.  
“好吧，去做吧。” 明日香不情愿地说。

The boy went and took the redhead's right arm and tied it to one end of the bed and then did the same with her left arm, leaving her completely vulnerable. Asuka couldn't help but feel a little scared and excited at the same time as she realised the only thing she could do now was shout in protest. Shinji moved his hand under her armpit and tickled her gently. The redhead instantly laughed in response and tried her best to close her arms but found it impossible.  
男孩走过去，抓住红发女孩的右臂，将其绑在床的一端，然后对她的左臂做了同样的事情，使她完全处于无助状态。明日香不禁感到既害怕又兴奋，她意识到现在唯一能做的就是大声抗议。真嗣将手伸到她的腋下，轻轻地挠她痒。红发女孩立刻笑了起来，尽力想合拢双臂，却发现这是不可能的。

"Come on Shinji, you just said you wouldn't do anything funny!" Asuka shouted angrily between laughs.  
“来吧，真嗣，你刚刚不是说不会做什么奇怪的事吗！”明日香一边笑一边生气地喊道。

"I was just testing" Shinji replied, chuckling.  
“我只是试试看”真嗣笑着回答。

The redhead glared at him in response. "You know Shinji… if I win this challenge, I am going to tie _you_ up and do anything I want to you alright?" Asuka replied venomously.  
红发的她瞪了他一眼。“你知道吗，真嗣……如果我赢了这场挑战，我就要把你绑起来，对你为所欲为，好吗？”明日香恶狠狠地回答。

The boy sweat dropped at her threat and hoped he really could pull it off. "It's only fair I suppose" Shinji agreed.  
男孩在她威胁下汗颜，希望自己真的能应付得来。“我想这很公平” 真嗣同意道。

Asuka let out a breath as she prepared herself. "I don't how you convinced me to do this Shinji…" Asuka said, trailing off.  
明日香深吸一口气，准备就绪。“我不知道你是怎么说服我做这件事的真嗣……” 明日香说着，声音渐渐低了下去。

"Honestly I don't know either" Shinji replied, smirking. "Guess I'll get started then" he said slowly moving down towards her.  
“老实说我也不清楚” 真嗣回答，嘴角微扬。“那我就开始吧” 他缓缓地向她靠近。

The boy planted a kiss on the girl's lips and they shared a passionate kiss before Shinji parted and began stroking her lower lips with his fingers. At once, the redhead began to quiver from the contact and she let out a small moan. He then began to slowly kiss his way down her body all the while gently stroking her slit. Even though Shinji knew that Asuka hated it when he teased her, he also knew she could endure it; he was doing this purely to annoy her. He was soon proven right when the girl groaned in irritation as he moved his mouth down to her stomach and tickled her lightly with his tongue. Shinji could see her arms tensing up, but her bounds restrained her well. Ever so slowly, he moved further down to her mound of red hair only to move back up to her stomach, all the while lightly stroking her lower region with his fingers.  
男孩在女孩的唇上轻轻一吻，两人随即共享了一个热情的吻，随后真嗣分开，开始用手指轻抚她的下唇。顿时，红发女孩因这接触而颤抖，发出了一声轻微的呻吟。接着，他缓缓地吻遍她的全身，同时温柔地抚摸着她的私处。尽管真嗣知道明日香讨厌他这样逗弄她，但他也知道她能忍受；他这么做纯粹是为了惹恼她。很快，他的猜测得到了证实，当他的嘴移到她的腹部并用舌头轻轻挑逗时，女孩因恼怒而呻吟。真嗣能看到她的手臂紧绷，但她的束缚很好地限制了她。他极其缓慢地向下移动到她那丛红发，却又回到她的腹部，同时用手指轻抚她的下体。

"All you're doing is pissing me off even more Shinji" Asuka said angrily, not too impressed with his teasing.  
“你这么做只会让我更生气，真嗣。”明日香生气地说，对他的逗弄并不感冒。

At this, Shinji just pushed three fingers up her wet cunt as far as he could, causing the girl to suddenly cry out and arch her back. But instead of thrusting them into her, the boy just slightly wriggled his fingers while inside her, much to the redhead's frustration. While Shinji worked on her pussy, his other hand caressed her breasts. The boy rolled her nipples between his fingers and playfully flicked and pinched them. Asuka wanted nothing more than to smack the boy so he would stop his ridiculous teasing, but she found it impossible to do so as her arms were tied. The boy planted wet kisses all over the girl's chest as he continued playing with her, making sure to tickle the valley between her breasts with his tongue.  
听到这话，真嗣便将三根手指深深探入她湿润的私处，女孩顿时惊叫出声，背部弓起。然而，他并未进一步深入，只是在她体内轻轻扭动手指，令红发少女倍感挫败。在真嗣玩弄她的下体时，另一只手则抚摸着她的乳房。他手指捻弄着她的乳头，时而轻弹，时而轻捏，玩得不亦乐乎。明日香恨不得一巴掌扇过去，让他停止这荒唐的挑逗，但她的双手被绑，根本无法动弹。男孩在她胸前留下一个个湿吻，继续逗弄她，还不忘用舌头轻触她双峰间的沟壑，逗得她痒痒的。

Just when Asuka was going to shout at him, Shinji moved the hand playing with her chest down to her vagina and began to tenderly play with her clit. The redhead shuddered as he made contact with her sensitive bud and she found herself squirming a little as he rubbed and flicked it. The girl wished he would move the fingers inside her cunt even just a little bit, but he just kept them stoic with an irritating wiggle every now and then. Shinji then began pressing down hard on her clit once in a while, making the girl jerk violently. Asuka was already growing tired of the boy's actions, but she knew it wasn't anything she couldn't endure; if he kept doing this, she would win for sure.  
就在明日香准备对他大喊时，真嗣将原本在她胸前把玩的手移到了她的阴部，开始温柔地拨弄她的阴蒂。红发少女因触及敏感的部位而颤抖，随着他揉搓和轻弹，她发现自己不由自主地扭动着。女孩希望他能稍微将手指伸入她的阴道，但他只是固执地停留在表面，偶尔令人恼火地轻晃一下。接着，真嗣时不时用力按压她的阴蒂，让少女猛地一震。明日香已经开始厌倦男孩的动作，但她知道这不过是她能忍受的；如果他继续这样，她肯定会赢。

It was then that Shinji brought his lips down to her private region and caressed her clitoris with his tongue. The redhead moaned in pleasure as she felt his hot, wet tongue stimulate her most sensitive spot. Now that she was finally getting some real attention, she could feel herself getting closer to the edge. However, Shinji had other ideas for her and stopped sucking her clit as soon as she was about to orgasm, much to Asuka's dismay. He then removed his fingers from her soaking cunt and brought them to his mouth, licking the girl's juices off them. His fingers had been so long inside her now that her pussy felt a little empty when he removed them.  
就在那时，真嗣将唇瓣贴近她的私密地带，用舌尖轻抚她的阴蒂。红发女孩在感受到他那温热湿润的舌尖刺激她最敏感的部位时，不禁愉悦地呻吟出声。如今终于得到了些许真正的关注，她能感觉到自己正逐渐逼近高潮的边缘。然而，真嗣对她另有打算，就在她即将达到高潮之际，他突然停止了对她阴蒂的吮吸，这让明日香大失所望。随后，他抽出浸满她爱液的手指，送至嘴边，舔舐着上面的女孩体液。他的手指在她体内停留了许久，以至于抽出时，她的私处感到一丝空虚。

Shinji then brought his erect cock to her entrance and rubbed her slit with it. For Asuka it was just pure torture; after having been so close to cumming and now having Shinji rub his cock against her vagina was just too much. All he had to do was push it inside her and she would orgasm, but he continued to tease her and she could not bring herself over the edge. The redhead was now openly showing signs of discomfort as she growled in frustration. She could easily handle constant and repeated attention as long as she got to cum, but denying Asuka her release was something she hated and could not handle; it seemed Shinji knew this.  
真嗣随后将他勃起的阴茎对准她的入口，用它摩擦她的阴唇。对于明日香来说，这纯粹是折磨；在如此接近高潮之后，现在真嗣用他的阴茎摩擦她的阴道，实在是太过分了。他只需推进去，她就会达到高潮，但他继续挑逗她，她无法让自己越过那条线。红发女孩现在明显表现出不适，她因沮丧而低吼。她可以轻松应对持续不断的关注，只要她能高潮，但剥夺明日香的高潮是她所憎恨且无法忍受的；似乎真嗣知道这一点。

"You… you bastard Shinji, is this what you had planned the whole time?" Asuka asked furiously.  
“你……你这个混蛋真嗣，这就是你从一开始就计划好的吗？”明日香愤怒地问道。

"I don't know what you're talking about" Shinji said innocently.  
“我不知道你在说什么”真嗣无辜地说道。

"This isn't fair at all Shinji!" Asuka complained. "Untie my arms already"  
"这根本不公平，真嗣！" 明日香抱怨道，"快解开我的手"

"You can't turn back on your word now Asuka" was all Shinji said.  
"你现在不能反悔了，明日香" 真嗣只是这么说道。

The redhead just groaned as she was slowly growing more aggravated; there was nothing more she wanted now than to just orgasm. Asuka wished she could even just finger herself, but her bound arms prevented her from doing so; Shinji really had her this time. Just to rub it in her face, the boy stimulated his cock with his hands and shot his semen all over the girl's stomach. Asuka just gave him a look of disgust at his actions; she knew he was taunting her. Added to that, she now had the feeling of a warm and sticky fluid on her abdomen and there was nothing she could do about it.  
红发女孩只是呻吟着，她越来越烦躁；现在她最渴望的就是达到高潮。明日香希望自己至少能用手指自慰，但被绑住的手臂阻止了她这样做；真嗣这次真的把她制住了。为了让她的挫败感更甚，男孩用手刺激着自己的阴茎，将精液射在了女孩的肚子上。明日香只是厌恶地看了他一眼，她知道他在挑衅她。更糟糕的是，她现在感到腹部有一种温暖而粘稠的液体，而她对此无能为力。

Shinji then stopped all his actions and brought his lips down to her face. The redhead would not give him the satisfaction of kissing her and she turned her head away as he came closer. Shinji just chuckled at her behaviour and kissed her neck instead, using his tongue to tickle the hollows in her neck. After he was certain her body had calmed down, he thrust his three fingers up her vagina again and the girl cried out erotically. As he began to pump his fingers in and out her, the redhead's face looked almost grateful; it seemed she had been waiting for her release the whole time. But Shinji wasn't going to give it to her, just as she was about to go off, he halted his actions. The redhead did not want to lose her chance of orgasming and quickly tried moving up and down on his fingers to stimulate herself, but Shinji quickly removed his fingers from her wet cunt. Asuka just looked up at the boy in disbelief; her pussy was aching for a climax.  
真嗣随即停止了所有动作，将唇瓣贴近她的脸庞。红发女孩不愿让他得逞，亲吻她时她扭头避开。真嗣对她的反应轻笑一声，转而在她的脖颈上落下一吻，用舌头轻触她颈间的凹陷。确认她的身体已平静下来后，他再次将三根手指插入她的阴道，女孩发出诱人的呻吟。随着他开始抽插手指，红发女孩的脸上几乎流露出感激之情；似乎她一直在等待这一刻的释放。但真嗣并不打算让她如愿，就在她即将达到高潮时，他停下了动作。红发女孩不愿错失高潮的机会，迅速开始上下移动身体，试图自我刺激，但真嗣迅速从她湿润的下体抽出手指。明日香难以置信地抬头看向男孩；她的私处渴望着高潮的来临。

"For God's sake, just let me cum Shinji!" Asuka shouted out, her voice sounding almost desperate.  
“看在上帝的份上，真嗣，就让我高潮吧！”明日香喊道，声音近乎绝望。

"You can handle _anything_ Asuka, is that right?" Shinji mocked.  
“你什么都能承受，对吧，明日香？”真嗣嘲讽道。

"Damn you can be a prick sometimes Ikari!" Asuka retorted.  
"该死的，碇，你有时候真是个刺头！" 明日香反驳道。

"Hey, _you_ accepted this challenge you know" Shinji countered.  
"嘿，是你接受了挑战的，你知道的" 真嗣回击道。

"But you're cheating!" Asuka protested.  
"但你这是作弊！" 明日香抗议道。

"Don't make excuses Asuka" Shinji teased.  
"别找借口了，明日香。" 真嗣打趣道。

"I don't care what you wanna call it, just let me orgasm!" Asuka replied anxiously.  
"我才不在乎你怎么称呼它，快让我高潮！" 明日香焦急地回应。

"Alright I'll let you orgasm… on one condition" Shinji proposed.  
"好吧，我会让你高潮……但有一个条件。" 真嗣提议道。

Asuka's eyes narrowed on the boy suspiciously. "What do you want?" she asked.  
明日香狐疑地眯起眼睛盯着那个男孩。“你想干什么？”她问道。

"Because you lost the challenge, you will be my slave all of tomorrow and you will do anything I say" Shinji answered.  
“因为你输了比赛，明天你得当我的奴隶，我说什么你都得做。”真嗣回答道。

"How can I accept such a ridiculous proposal?!" Asuka instantly refuted.  
“我怎么能接受这么荒唐的提议？！”明日香立刻反驳道。

"Oh well" Shinji replied, once again beginning his playful stimulation.  
“唉，算了。”真嗣回答道，再次开始他那调皮的挑逗。

The redhead gritted her teeth as he continued his work. Despite not having orgasmed at all since he had started this, she was starting to feel a bit sore now. Her head was spinning as all the pleasure she was getting was being counteracted by the prolonged feeling of being unsatisfied. Asuka didn't know how much longer she could last this type of attack, but she didn't want to give in to his demands either; she was really cornered this time. The girl decided it was better to have Shinji stop rather than continue and so she kicked his hand away and closed her legs tightly. It was a futile effort really; it's like not like it really prevented him from stimulating her lower region.  
红发女孩咬紧牙关，随着他的动作继续。尽管自他开始以来她一次高潮都未曾有过，但此刻她开始感到有些酸痛。她的头在旋转，所有得到的快感都被持续的未满足感所抵消。明日香不知道自己还能在这种攻击下坚持多久，但她也不想屈服于他的要求；这次她真的陷入了困境。女孩决定最好让真嗣停下来，而不是继续下去，于是她踢开了他的手，紧紧并拢双腿。这实际上是徒劳的；这并不意味着他真的无法刺激她的下体。

Shinji, however, found this act of defiance to be quite amusing. In response he moved his erect cock just over her entrance, prodding it gently as if asking for entry. Asuka just bit her lip, knowing he was just teasing her; as soon as she opened her legs, he was going to play with her again. But having the object of her desire constantly trying to push its way into her was just an unbearable torment for the girl and she eventually gave in and opened her legs for him. The redhead was proven right as Shinji moved in between her legs as soon as she opened them, making it impossible for her to close them again. Asuka just looked up at the boy glaring, making sure he knew how much shit she would give him after this.  
然而，真嗣觉得这种反抗行为颇为有趣。他回应着，将自己的勃起阴茎移至她的入口上方，轻轻触碰，仿佛在请求进入。明日香只是咬着嘴唇，知道他只是在逗弄她；一旦她张开双腿，他就会再次戏弄她。但对于这个女孩来说，心中的渴望之物不断试图闯入，实在是难以忍受的折磨，最终她屈服了，为他张开了双腿。正如红发少女所料，真嗣一等她张开双腿，便立刻移到她两腿之间，让她无法再合拢。明日香只是抬头瞪着男孩，确保他明白事后她会如何教训他。

Though the boy found her stare to be quite frightening, he still proceeded to continue with his playful torment and moved his fingers back inside her vagina as her arms were bound. The redhead just moaned in protest, not wanting anymore of his teasing.  
尽管男孩觉得她的目光相当吓人，他还是继续进行他的戏弄，将手指重新伸入她被绑住的双臂之间的阴道。红发少女只是抗议地呻吟，不想再忍受他的逗弄。

"God Shinji, I can't stand it anymore, please just let me cum" Asuka pleaded.  
“天啊，真嗣，我再也受不了了，请让我高潮吧”明日香恳求道。

"I told you the condition" Shinji replied.  
"我告诉过你那个条件了" 真嗣回答道。

"You damn asshole" Asuka shouted back, refusing to admit defeat.  
"你这个混蛋" 明日香回喊道，拒不承认失败。

At this, Shinji only increased his torture. He slid his fingers around her swollen clitoris and thrust his fingers inside her wet pussy before removing them for a while and doing it again. The redhead was so wet she had soaked the bed sheets below her quite considerably. The girl kept thinking that if she endured just a little longer Shinji would stop or let her cum. Unfortunately, even after a long while, he never did and Asuka was growing desperate, she wanted nothing more than to just have her release; she didn't care about losing anymore.  
听到这话，真嗣只是加剧了他的折磨。他滑动手指围绕她肿胀的阴蒂，然后插入她湿润的阴道，过一会儿又抽出来重复这个动作。红发女孩湿透了，床单被她浸湿了一大块。她一直想着只要再忍耐一会儿，真嗣就会停下来或者让她高潮。不幸的是，即使过了很久，他也没有这么做，明日香变得越来越绝望，她只想得到解脱；她不再在乎输赢了。

"Alright Shinji, I fucking agree. I'll be your damn slave tomorrow, just let me cum already" she let out reluctantly.  
“好吧，真嗣，我他妈同意了。明天我就当你的该死奴隶，快让我射出来吧。”她不情愿地喊道。

"You are one stubborn girl Asuka" Shinji replied, amazed at how long it took for her to give up.  
“你真是个倔强的女孩，明日香。”真嗣回答，惊讶于她花了这么长时间才放弃。

The redhead was too tired to fight with him anymore and just stuck her tongue out at him. Relief soon washed over her face as Shinji penetrated her with his cock. Asuka quickly wrapped her legs around him, as if to make sure he wouldn't run away. The redhead's cries of pleasure were unlike any she had let out before as the boy thrust as hard as he could into her; she was finally receiving her long-awaited reprieve. Just as Asuka was about to orgasm, she held onto him tighter with her legs and looked into the boy's face, pleading for him not to stop. Shinji kept his word however and went through all the way, pushing her over the edge. The girl then orgasmed with phenomenal energy; all the built-up pleasure was released in a massive torrent.  
红发女孩已经太累了，不想再和他争辩，只是对他吐了吐舌头。当真嗣用他的阴茎插入她时，她脸上很快露出了释然的表情。明日香迅速用双腿缠住他，仿佛要确保他不会逃跑。红发女孩发出的愉悦呻吟是她以前从未有过的，男孩用力地在她体内冲刺；她终于得到了期待已久的解脱。就在明日香即将达到高潮时，她用双腿更紧地抱住他，凝视着男孩的脸，恳求他不要停下。然而，真嗣遵守了诺言，一直持续到她达到顶峰。女孩随后以惊人的能量达到了高潮；所有积压的快感如洪水般释放出来。

"Oh God! YEEESSSSSS!" Asuka screamed.  
"哦天哪！耶耶耶耶耶！" 明日香尖叫道。

It was an incredible sight for Shinji as he watched the redhead convulsing fiercely. Amazingly, the boy had triggered a multiple orgasm, something Shinji thought he'd never see. Asuka came again and again, crying out loud in pleasure every time, her body jolting with every wave of pleasure that hit her. Shinji's cock suffered repeated clenching as Asuka climaxed continuously and he exploded inside her. Slowly releasing her pent-up energy, the girl eventually came down from her orgasm. As soon as she had stopped, Shinji could see her breathing heavily, her eyes looking almost glazed over; she had obviously never felt anything as intense as that before. Seeing that it was over, Shinji moved off the girl and untied her arms. As the redhead let her arms down, the boy noticed her arms were trembling.  
对真嗣来说，这是一幕不可思议的景象，他看着红发女孩剧烈地抽搐。令人惊讶的是，男孩引发了一次多重高潮，这是真嗣以为自己永远不会看到的。明日香一次又一次地达到高潮，每次都大声呼喊着快感，她的身体随着每一波快感的冲击而颤抖。随着明日香持续不断地高潮，真嗣的阴茎反复被紧握，最终他在她体内爆发了。慢慢地释放出积压的能量，女孩最终从高潮中平息下来。她一停下来，真嗣就能看到她呼吸急促，眼神几乎呆滞；显然她以前从未感受过如此强烈的体验。看到一切都结束了，真嗣从女孩身上移开并解开了她的手臂。当红发女孩放下手臂时，男孩注意到她的手臂在颤抖。

"H-Holy s-shit that was i-insane" Asuka let out before looking at Shinji menacingly.  
"我-我靠，那-那太疯狂了" 明日香喘息着，然后恶狠狠地看向真嗣。

"D-Don't look at me like that, you did get something out of it after all" Shinji replied nervously.  
"别那样看着我，你毕竟还是从中得到了些什么的。" 真嗣紧张地回答道。

"Oh ha, forgive me for not being grateful" Asuka shot back sarcastically.  
"哦哈，原谅我没有感激涕零。" 明日香讽刺地回击。

"Come on Asuka, it wasn't that bad was it?" he said, attempting to quell the girl's wrath.  
"拜托，明日香，没那么糟糕吧？" 他说着，试图平息女孩的怒火。

"Even _you_ know you're full of it Shinji" the girl snapped. "But don't worry, you're in luck today. I am totally destroyed right now but… I _will_ get you back for this later Shinji"  
“就连你也知道自己满嘴胡言，真嗣。”女孩厉声道，“不过别担心，你今天走运了。我现在完全崩溃了，但……我迟早会为此报复你的，真嗣。”

"I can't wait" Shinji said, chuckling weakly before lifting the girl up and embracing her warmly.  
“我等着呢。”真嗣轻声笑着，声音有些无力，随后将女孩抱起，紧紧拥入怀中。

Asuka didn't have any strength left in her to resist him, besides, it was a little comforting after all that she had undergone. Shinji looked up at the clock in the girl's room and saw how late in the afternoon it was; even taking the discussion they had into account, they must have been fooling around for quite a while.  
明日香已经没有力气再反抗他了，再说，经历了那么多之后，这拥抱也让她感到些许安慰。真嗣抬头看向女孩房间里的时钟，发现已是下午时分；即便算上他们之前的讨论，他们也一定已经嬉闹了好一阵子。

"Now get lost Shinji, I want to rest" Asuka ordered.  
"快滚开，真嗣，我想休息了" 明日香命令道。

"Are you sure you want to sleep covered in sweat, my semen and God knows what else?" Shinji asked. "Your bed sheets are messed up too" he added.  
"你确定要满身是汗、我的精液还有天知道什么东西的情况下睡觉吗？你的床单也乱七八糟的" 真嗣问道，"他补充道。

"And whose fault is that Shinji?" Asuka asked irritably before sighing. "Just go get some new sheets while I go have a shower"  
"那是谁的错，真嗣？" 明日香不耐烦地问道，然后叹了口气。"你去拿些新床单，我去洗个澡"

The redhead then stood up unsteadily before heading over to the bathroom to wash herself. Shinji watched the weary girl exit her room and let out the breath he was holding in; he had gotten off easy for the moment. Not wanting to waste any more time, he pulled off the girl's bed sheets and exited her room. Moving over to the laundry, Shinji deposited the dirty sheets into the washing machine and then got some new bed sheets. Returning to Asuka's room, the boy fixed the fresh sheets onto her bed before going to the bathroom to check on the girl. As he approached the bathroom, the boy heard the sound of running water and he tested the door to see if it was locked. Shinji found himself being able to open the door and so he entered the bathroom. Upon entering, he noticed Asuka leaning against the wall as the hot water poured all over her.  
红发女孩随后摇摇晃晃地站起身，走向浴室清洗自己。真嗣注视着疲惫的女孩离开房间，这才松了口气；他暂时算是逃过一劫。不想再浪费时间，他扯下女孩的床单，离开了她的房间。走到洗衣区，真嗣将脏床单放入洗衣机，然后取了一些新床单。回到明日香的房间，男孩铺好新床单，随后去浴室查看女孩的情况。当他走近浴室时，听到了水流声，他试着推了推门，看是否上锁。真嗣发现门没锁，便走了进去。一进门，他就看到明日香靠在墙上，热水倾泻在她身上。

Though Shinji found her position slightly amusing, he thought it was best to ensure she was ok and entered the shower cubicle. The boy lifted her up slightly and Asuka looked up at him confused.  
尽管真嗣觉得她的姿势有些滑稽，但他认为确保她没事更为重要，于是走进了淋浴间。男孩轻轻将她扶起，明日香抬头看着他，一脸困惑。

"What are you doing in here?" the girl asked, a little surprised.  
“你在这里做什么？”女孩有些惊讶地问道。

"You don't want to have a shower together?" Shinji teased.  
"你不想一起洗澡吗？" 真嗣逗弄道。

"Why would I?" Asuka replied, annoyed.  
"我为什么要那样做？" 明日香不悦地回答。

"Here, I'll help you wash up" Shinji said, ignoring her question.  
"来，我帮你洗洗" 真嗣说着，无视了她的疑问。

"Whatever" she replied tiredly.  
“随便吧。”她疲惫地回答。

Shinji then proceeded to wash Asuka's whole body, wiping all traces of their excitement off of her. Shinji loved the reaction Asuka gave when he washed her private areas; it seemed her body was still in shock over what had happened. After he finished washing her and himself, the boy turned off the water and the redhead yawned tiredly, clearly showing her fatigue. Thus, the boy exited the shower cubicle and took a towel which he used to dry both him and Asuka with. After they were dry, Shinji picked up the girl and carried her back to her room; Asuka didn't see a point in struggling as she was exhausted anyway.  
真嗣接着开始清洗明日香全身，擦去她身上所有的兴奋痕迹。真嗣喜欢明日香在他清洗她私密部位时的反应；她的身体似乎仍因刚才发生的事而震惊。洗完她和自己后，男孩关掉水，红发女孩疲惫地打了个哈欠，显然已经筋疲力尽。于是，男孩走出淋浴间，拿起一条毛巾，用来擦干两人。擦干后，真嗣抱起女孩，把她送回房间；明日香觉得挣扎也没意义，反正她已经累坏了。

He then laid her down on her bed and pulled the covers over her. The redhead stretched lazily before Shinji joined her under the covers.  
然后他让她躺在床上，拉过被子盖好。红发女孩慵懒地伸了个懒腰，随后真嗣也钻进被窝，和她躺在一起。

"Shinji… I just wanna sleep now" Asuka said sincerely.  
"真嗣…我现在只想睡觉" 明日香真诚地说道。

"Relax, I won't do anything" Shinji reassured.  
"放松，我不会做什么的" 真嗣安慰道。

"You'd better not" she said sleepily.  
"你最好别" 她困倦地说。

The boy then kissed her gently on the cheek, before wrapping his arms around the redhead and laying his head on her chest. Asuka rested her arms around Shinji before dozing off and the two of them fell asleep in each other's arms.  
男孩随后轻轻吻了她的脸颊，然后环抱着红发女孩，将头靠在她的胸前。明日香将手臂环绕在真嗣周围，不久便打起了盹，两人就这样相拥而眠。

---

A purple haired woman was currently crying silent tears as she entered her office. It wasn't the fact that she had entered her office that had caused her to become upset, no, it was the instantly visible mountain of paper on her desk. It seemed all the paperwork had insidiously made its way into the Major's office; a fact Misato was not too happy about. It wouldn't have been as bad if it wasn't for the fact that she had just finished a whole stack and gone for a small break only to come back and find even more. It always seemed like whenever she was almost finished, more miraculously appeared.  
一位紫发女子正默默流泪地走进她的办公室。让她感到难过的并非进入办公室这件事，不，而是桌上那显而易见的文件山。所有文件似乎都悄无声息地堆积到了美里少校的办公室；对此，美里并不太高兴。如果不是她刚完成一整堆文件并短暂休息后回来发现更多，情况或许没那么糟糕。每当她几乎要完成时，总会有更多的文件奇迹般地出现。

"How do they always manage to find their way into my office?" Misato said out loud before sighing.  
“它们究竟是怎么总能找到进入我办公室的路？”美里大声说道，随后叹了口气。

The Major then entered her office without closing her door and just stared at the documents, hoping that if she stared hard enough it would just disappear.  
少校随后没有关门就走进了她的办公室，只是盯着文件，希望如果她盯得足够用力，文件就会消失。

"I just want to burn it all!" she shouted out loud. "I bet Ritsuko never has to deal with this shit!"  
“我真想把它们全烧了！”她大声喊道，“我打赌律子从来不用处理这些破事！”

"Putting up with you is more than enough Misato" a voice said from behind the Major.  
“忍受你已经够多了，美里。”一个声音从少校身后传来。

The purple haired woman quickly spun on her heel to see the amused face of the blonde doctor.  
紫发女子迅速转身，看到了金发医生那带着笑意的脸庞。

"Ah hey Ritsuko, how's it going?" Misato replied sheepishly.  
“啊，嘿，律子，最近怎么样？”美里有些尴尬地回应道。

"I'm fine Misato, but I'm not so sure about you. What was all that shouting about?" the doctor asked, smiling a little.  
“我很好，美里，但你看起来就不一定了。刚才那阵喊叫是怎么回事？”医生微笑着问道。

The Major hung her head like a little child and pointed behind her to the two, storey high stacks of paper on her desk. "I don't wanna do it!" she said immaturely, stomping her feet.  
玛吉尔少校像个小女孩一样垂下头，指着她桌子上两层楼高的纸堆。“我不想做！”她幼稚地说，跺着脚。

Ritsuko just laughed at her friend's behaviour before responding. "Yeah, you always hated paperwork"  
律子只是笑着回应她朋友的行为。“是啊，你一直讨厌文书工作。”

"If there's someone who enjoys doing it, give it to him instead!" Misato snapped.  
“如果有谁喜欢做这个，就让他来做吧！”美里厉声说道。

"I think you need to take a rest Misato" Ritsuko said, smirking.  
"我觉得你需要休息一下，美里" 律子说着，嘴角微微上扬。

"I already took a break and came back to find even more had 'materialised'," Misato replied, annoyed.  
"我已经休息过了，回来却发现更多工作‘凭空出现’了，" 美里回答，显得有些烦躁。

"Come on let's go have a talk, it'll be a relaxing break and the workload might even decrease when you come back" Ritsuko said, attempting to persuade her friend.  
"走吧，我们去聊聊，这会是个放松的休息时间，而且你回来时工作量说不定还会减少呢" 律子试图说服她的朋友。

"Unfortunately, despite it being able to magically appear the reverse does not hold true!" Misato remarked.  
"遗憾的是，尽管它能神奇地出现，反过来却并非如此！" 美里评论道。

The blonde woman chuckled again before exiting the office. "Well it's your choice Misato, but we haven't had a good talk in a while. I'd appreciate it if you came" she offered.  
金发女子再次轻笑，随后离开了办公室。"好吧，这是你的选择，美里，但我们已经很久没有好好谈过了。如果你能来，我会很感激的" 她提议道。

"Alright alright, I'm coming" Misato said, accepting the doctor's offer.  
"好吧好吧，我来了" 美里说，接受了医生的邀请。

The purple haired woman exited her office and closed the door behind her before the two of them walked off with Ritsuko in the lead. The two friends walked in silence as they made their way to the NERV cafeteria. Misato was really tired as it was quite late at night and she wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep, so it was probably in her best interest to drink some caffeine.  
紫发女子走出办公室，随手关上门，随后两人在赤木律子的带领下离开。两位朋友一路沉默地走向 NERV 的食堂。美里真的很疲惫，因为夜已深，她只想好好睡一觉，所以喝点咖啡可能对她最有利。

Arriving at the cafeteria, the two of them sat down at a table and ordered some coffee. They relaxed in their seats while they waited for their beverages to arrive. The two women looked at each other for a bit before the blonde woman spoke up.  
到达食堂后，两人找了张桌子坐下，点了些咖啡。她们在座位上放松等待饮品送达。两位女士对视片刻，随后金发女子开口。

"So Misato, how are the children?" Ritsuko asked.  
“那么美里，孩子们怎么样了？”赤木律子问道。

Misato paused momentarily, recalling the discussion earlier, before responding. "They are fine I suppose, just before I came back to NERV I had them explain to me their behaviour over the last week. They at least seemed relieved at having told someone about their relationship. I really can't tell how they're feeling at this point but I can see that they are genuinely happy with each other" Misato answered.  
美里顿了顿，回忆起之前的对话，然后回答道：“我想他们还好吧，就在我回 NERV 之前，我让他们解释了过去一周的行为。至少，他们似乎松了一口气，终于有人知道了他们的关系。我真的说不准他们现在的心情，但我看得出他们彼此真的很幸福。”美里答道。

At this point, a waitress brought over their two drinks and Misato picked hers up and began to sip it.  
这时，服务员端来了他们的两杯饮料，美里拿起自己的那杯开始小口啜饮。

"So, what did they confess?" Ritsuko asked, curious.  
“那么，他们坦白了什么？”律子好奇地问。

"Hmmm I'm sorry but that's quite private… all I can say is that they had a rough beginning. I'm so glad they're both ok and happy with each other, but still sad at what happened between them…" she said vaguely. "But you should know anyway, considering that you knew about this relationship before me" Misato replied.  
"嗯，抱歉，这挺私密的……我只能说他们的开始很艰难。我很高兴他们现在彼此安好且幸福，但仍为他们之间发生的事感到难过……" 她含糊地说道。"但你应该知道的，毕竟你比我更早知道这段关系" 美里回答道。

"Asuka didn't tell me anything other than that she was having sex with Shinji, she didn't even tell me what protection she was using" Ritsuko remarked.  
"明日香除了告诉我她和真嗣有性关系外，什么都没说，她甚至没告诉我她在用什么保护措施" 律子评论道。

"You too huh? I wonder what they're being so secretive about, just what the hell are they using? There's no sign of anything at my apartment, so I'm stumped" Misato said, speculating in her mind what it could be.  
"你也是吗？我真想知道他们在隐瞒什么，他们到底在用什么？我的公寓里没有任何迹象，我完全摸不着头脑" 美里说，心里猜测着可能是什么。

"Well they are definitely using something, Asuka is surprisingly fertile and she would most certainly be pregnant by now if they weren't using anything" Ritsuko commented.  
“他们肯定用了什么措施，明日香出奇地容易怀孕，如果他们没采取任何措施，她现在肯定已经怀孕了。”赤木律子评论道。

"How do you even know Shinji has… 'released it inside her'?" Misato asked quietly.  
“你怎么知道真嗣他……‘释放’在里面了？”美里轻声问道。

"I'm quite sure he has ejaculated inside Asuka's vagina, I found the 'evidence' when I did my physical examination of her" Ritsuko replied loudly.  
“我很确定他在明日香体内射精了，我在给她做身体检查时发现了‘证据’。”赤木律子大声回答。

The Major blushed. "Not so loud Ritsuko!" she said quickly.  
美里少校脸红了。“别那么大声，律子！”她迅速说道。

"I don't see why _you're_ embarrassed Misato, but you do have a point. I almost forgot that we should be quiet about their sexual relations. It could be a potential legal issue with the US as their age of consent is 16. As Asuka is a US citizen, it's a minefield I don't want to deal with" Ritsuko explained.  
“我不明白你为什么害羞，美里，但你说的有道理。我差点忘了我们应该对他们的性关系保持低调。这可能会成为与美国法律的潜在问题，因为他们的同意年龄是 16 岁。由于明日香是美国公民，这对我来说是个我不想碰的地雷区。”律子解释道。

"Does Asuka know about this?" Misato asked.  
“明日香知道这件事吗？”美里问道。

"Yes, I told her and Shinji about it" the doctor answered.  
“是的，我跟绫波和真嗣提过这件事。”医生回答道。

"Alright good to know, I might bring this up with them again" Misato replied.  
“好的，知道了，我可能还会再跟他们谈起这个。”美里回答。

"In any case, back to our original matter. I wanted to know if the children will still have good sync ratios or if their relationship will hinder it" Ritsuko asked.  
“无论如何，回到我们最初的话题。我想知道孩子们的同步率是否会保持良好，还是他们的关系会影响到这一点。”律子问道。

"Is that all you think about? How this benefits NERV?" Misato asked, annoyed.  
"你就只想着这能给 NERV 带来什么好处吗？" 美里不悦地问道。

"You don't always have the Commander down your back now do you?" Ritsuko shot back.  
"你现在可没有司令在你背后盯着了吧？" 律子反唇相讥。

"Well I'm pretty sure their sync ratios will be fine, as I said before they are genuinely happy with each other" Misato answered.  
"我敢肯定他们的同步率不会有问题，就像我之前说的，他们是真心相爱的。" 美里回答道。

"That's good to hear. I suppose this relationship is also good for them considering what they've been through. Although you have to wonder how two totally opposite people fell for each other?" Ritsuko mused.  
“那挺好的。考虑到他们经历过的那些事，这段关系对他们来说也是件好事。不过你得想想，两个完全相反的人是怎么走到一起的呢？”律子沉思道。

"You know what they say, 'opposites attract'," Misato joked.  
“你知道他们怎么说，‘异性相吸’嘛，”美里开玩笑说。

"We can hardly apply laws of science onto human interaction" Ritsuko remarked.  
“我们很难将科学定律应用到人际交往上。”律子评论道。

"Well in a way they are also quite similar" Misato replied, yawning.  
"从某种程度上说，他们也颇为相似。" 美里回答道，打了个哈欠。

"You must be really tired Misato. You've had to deal with all this work and everything with the kids too" Ritsuko said, a little sympathetic.  
"你一定很累吧，美里。既要处理所有这些工作，还要照顾孩子们。" 律子略带同情地说。

"Yeah, it has been a little hectic recently, and it's still not done yet" Misato replied, remembering the work still in her office.  
"是啊，最近确实有点忙乱，而且还没完呢。" 美里回答，想起了办公室里还未完成的工作。

"I'll tell you what. I'll give you a day off tomorrow right after you finish your work tonight. Who knows, you might finish by early morning" Ritsuko said optimistically.  
"我告诉你吧。今晚你完成工作后，明天给你放一天假。谁知道呢，你可能会在清晨前完成。" 律子乐观地说道。

"There's no way I can finish it by the morning, but thanks for the day off anyway Ritsuko" Misato said gratefully.  
"我绝不可能在早上之前完成，不过还是谢谢你的假期，律子" 美里感激地说。

"You never know Misato" Ritsuko replied, smiling.  
"你永远不知道的，美里" 律子微笑着回答。

The Major just looked at her friend curiously before standing up from the table. "Well, see ya then Ritsuko" Misato announced.  
玛丽少校只是好奇地看着她的朋友，然后从桌旁站起身来。“那么，再见了，律子。”美里宣布道。

"Goodbye" the doctor replied.  
“再见。”医生回答道。

Leaving her empty coffee cup on the table, Misato turned around and head back to her office grudgingly. Walking down the empty, poorly lit corridor only added to the woman's dreariness. Upon arriving at her office, she walked into it and sighed miserably before looking up.  
美里把空咖啡杯留在桌上，转身不情愿地走回办公室。走在空荡荡、光线昏暗的走廊上，更增添了她的忧郁。到达办公室后，她走了进去，沮丧地叹了口气，然后抬头看去。

The Major could not help rubbing her eyes and making sure she was seeing things properly; there was only one stack of paperwork left on her desk. Misato was sure there had been two stacks before she had left with Ritsuko, or maybe her memory wasn't as good as it used to be? A little sceptical, the Major looked under her desk and around her office to see where it had disappeared, but found nothing.  
玛丽尔少校不禁揉了揉眼睛，确认自己是否看错了；她的办公桌上只剩下了一堆文件。美里确信在她和律子离开之前有两堆文件，或者也许是她的记忆力不如从前了？带着一丝怀疑，少校低头看了看桌子底下，又环顾了办公室四周，想找出文件消失的地方，但却一无所获。

"I don't how you did it, but thank you Ritsuko!" Misato said aloud before getting back to work.  
“我不知道你是怎么做到的，但谢谢你，律子！”美里大声说道，然后继续工作。

With her workload cut significantly, the Major was sure she would be getting home much earlier. Added to that, Ritsuko had given the day off; she could finally get some long-awaited rest. And so, the purple haired woman looked forward to the next day, wondering how things would turn out with her two wards.  
由于工作量大大减少，少校确信她会早早回家。再加上，律子给了她一天假；她终于可以得到期待已久的休息了。于是，这位紫发女子期待着明天，好奇她的两个监护人会有怎样的发展。

End notes: You might not be a fan of tying up people, but you would think Shinji, after being henpecked continuously by Asuka, would try this right? Regardless this chapter was mainly for all those people who wanted more lemons, happy?  
尾注：你可能不喜欢捆绑别人，但你会想，被明日香不断唠叨的 Shinji 难道不会尝试一下吗？不管怎样，这一章主要是为了满足那些想要更多柠檬情节的人，开心吗？

Extra Notes: This was probably one of the hardest chapters to rewrite. The original chapter 6 was just so bad, I had to change quite a bit, I am endeavouring this time to get everything rewritten properly. I can't believe this chapter is almost 18000 words, yikes.  
额外笔记：这可能是重写中最困难的一章。原第六章实在太糟糕了，我不得不做了很多改动，这次我努力要把所有内容都重写得恰当。真不敢相信这一章将近 18000 字，哎呀。

Author's Notes: Honest reviews, good or bad are all appreciated. In the past someone left a review with the message 'This is a pointless waste of time and space,' which I suppose just isn't helpful in any way :D. You are free to criticise the story and give feedback but flooding is pointless, ironically.  
作者的话：无论是好评还是差评，诚实的评论我都欢迎。曾经有人留下这样的评论：‘这是在浪费时间和空间，毫无意义。’我想这无论如何都算不上有帮助吧 :D。你可以批评故事并提供反馈，但无意义的刷屏则是讽刺地毫无意义。

Someone else in the past once asked about why Ritsuko doesn't know about LCL acting as a contraceptive. To which I said that it was because she never thought about it other than its use in the evangelion.  
过去还有人问过为什么律子不知道 LCL 有避孕作用。我回答说，这是因为她除了在福音战士中的用途外，从未考虑过它的其他用途。

There's a bit of WAFF in this chapter.  
这一章有些温馨的片段。

A note to say this is the second rewrite of chapter 7. (Though it's practically the same as the first rewrite)  
特别说明，这是第七章的第二次重写。（虽然实际上和第一次重写几乎一样）

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.

### Chapter 7: Today You're Mine  
第七章：今天你是我的

The shrill sound of an alarm clock went off in the Katsuragi apartment, signifying that the morning had come. It was no surprise that the noise stirred the two resting teens from their deep slumber. The sleepy redhead shot her arm out from underneath the covers to stop the alarm clock. When the alarm was stopped, the girl relaxed her arm and shifted a little. It was then that the boy rose from his wonderful spot slowly and rubbed his eyes tiredly; he was trying to fathom why the alarm clock had been set to go off today. Asuka sat up gradually and looked at the boy, also slightly confused. It suddenly clicked in their minds at exactly the same time; it was Monday.  
一阵尖锐的闹钟声在葛城公寓中响起，宣告着早晨的到来。这声音毫不意外地唤醒了两位沉睡中的少年。睡眼惺忪的红发少女从被窝下伸出胳膊，按停了闹钟。闹铃停止后，女孩放松了手臂，稍稍挪动了一下。这时，男孩才缓缓从他舒适的枕头上坐起，疲惫地揉着眼睛，试图理解为何今天闹钟会响起。明日香也逐渐坐起身，略带困惑地看着男孩。突然间，他们同时恍然大悟：今天是星期一。

"No way! Today is Monday" Shinji whined.  
“不会吧！今天是星期一” 真嗣抱怨道。

"Best we start getting ready for school then" Asuka replied happily with a grin.  
“那我们最好开始准备上学了” 明日香开心地笑着回答。

The male eva pilot turned to look at the redhead feeling cheated.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员转头看向红发女孩，感觉被欺骗了。

"You knew today was Monday, didn't you? That's why you gave in yesterday and agreed to be my slave for today. Jeez, I can't believe you can deceive me _even_ in a situation like that" Shinji said disbelievingly.  
“你明明知道今天是星期一，对吧？所以你昨天才屈服，同意今天当我的奴隶。天哪，我真不敢相信你连那种情况下都能骗我。”真嗣难以置信地说。

"You should know by now, I'm just that much more superior than you" she said, sticking her tongue out at him.  
“你应该早就知道，我就是比你强那么多。”她一边说，一边向他吐舌头。

The boy wanted nothing more than to wipe that smug grin off her face; how was it that he was always outsmarted by this girl?  
那男孩最渴望的就是抹去她脸上那得意的笑容；他怎么总是被这个女孩智胜一筹？

"You're not getting away with this so easily though" Shinji replied, not wanting to lose his chance; he still had her for some of the day.  
"你可别想这么轻易就逃脱" 真嗣回答道，不想错失机会；他还有她一整天的时间。

"You'd best hurry, school is starting soon" Asuka mocked.  
"你最好快点，学校马上就要开始了" 明日香嘲讽道。

Shinji quickly thought about something nasty he could do with her. Not having much time to decide what to do, he just chose to go with the first thought that had come into his head, even though he knew it was pretty stupid.  
真嗣迅速想了一些可以对她做的坏事。由于没有太多时间决定做什么，他只是选择了脑海中第一个冒出来的念头，尽管他知道这相当愚蠢。

"Alright _slave"_ Shinji emphasised, "Come with me to the dining room" he ordered getting out of her bed, still completely naked.  
“好吧，奴隶” 真嗣强调道，“跟我去餐厅” 他命令着，从她的床上起身，仍然一丝不挂。

"Whatever" Asuka replied.  
“随便” 明日香回答道。

The girl stretched and got out of her bed, also completely nude, before following Shinji as he walked to the dining room. When they arrived, the boy motioned towards the dining table as if instructing her to go next to it.  
女孩伸了个懒腰，一丝不挂地下了床，跟着真嗣走向餐厅。到达后，男孩示意她走向餐桌，仿佛在指示她站到旁边。

"Get onto the table and spread open your legs" Shinji dictated.  
“上桌，把腿张开。”真嗣命令道。

"You can't be serious-" Asuka started.  
“你不是认真的吧——”明日香开口道。

"Do not question me slave!" Shinji interrupted; a small smile on his face.  
"别质疑我，奴隶！" 真嗣打断道，脸上带着一丝微笑。

The redhead just rolled her eyes at him and went along with his command. Asuka got up onto the dining table and then spread her legs open in front of him. The boy's cock twitched as the girl promptly obeyed him, the sight of her spread legs was also quite arousing and his cock was fully erect in next to no time. The redhead just looked at him curiously, unable to work out what exactly he wanted to do. Shinji wasted no time in moving his fingers down to her lower lips to stimulate her. Asuka moaned accordingly, enjoying the pleasure. Shinji continued his actions until he believed she was wet enough.  
红发女孩只是对他翻了个白眼，然后顺从了他的命令。明日香站上餐桌，然后在他面前张开双腿。男孩的阴茎因女孩迅速服从的动作而抽动，她张开的双腿景象也相当撩人，他的阴茎很快便完全勃起了。红发女孩好奇地看着他，不明白他到底想做什么。真嗣毫不犹豫地用手指滑向她的阴唇，刺激她。明日香随之呻吟，享受着快感。真嗣继续他的动作，直到他认为她已经足够湿润。

After Asuka was ready, the boy moved in between her open legs and pushed himself inside her. The redhead was still a little tired from the exertion yesterday, but she had agreed to let him do whatever he wanted and so didn't resist him. She couldn't help crying out in pleasure as he penetrated her, though it was much quieter than usual. Asuka found her position a little uncomfortable as Shinji didn't support her at all, forcing her to prop herself up with her elbows. Every time he thrust into her, she felt her elbows rubbing painfully against the hard table. The redhead found herself yawning more than moaning and just wished she would hurry up and orgasm already.  
在明日香准备好后，男孩移到她张开的双腿之间，将自己推入她的体内。红发女孩仍因昨日的劳累而有些疲惫，但她已同意让他随心所欲，因此并未抗拒。尽管比平时安静许多，她还是忍不住在快感中发出呻吟。明日香觉得这个姿势有些不舒服，因为真嗣完全没有支撑她，迫使她用肘部撑起自己。每次他深入她体内时，她都感到肘部在坚硬的桌面上摩擦得生疼。红发女孩发现自己打哈欠的次数多于呻吟，只希望快点达到高潮。

It only took a few more minutes of Shinji plunging into her to bring her over the edge and the girl gave a small cry as her body climaxed. The boy soon followed suit and shot his cum up her pussy, making sure to cum inside her. After he finished depositing his load, Shinji moved off the redhead. As the redhead began to close her legs, the boy stopped her and shook his head.  
仅仅几分钟后，真嗣的猛烈冲刺便将她推向了高潮，女孩发出一声低吟，身体达到了顶峰。男孩紧随其后，射入她的私处，确保精液留在她体内。完事后，真嗣从红发女孩身上移开。当她开始合拢双腿时，男孩阻止了她，并摇了摇头。

"Wait here a moment and don't move" Shinji instructed.  
“在这里等一会儿，别动。”真嗣命令道。

"What on earth are you planning?" Asuka asked, perplexed.  
"你到底在计划什么？" 明日香问道，一脸困惑。

"What did I say before? Don't question me" Shinji replied, pretending to sound annoyed.  
"我之前怎么说的？别质疑我。" 真嗣回答，假装听起来很恼火。

"You're enjoying this _way_ too much" the redhead said sighing, remaining still on the table.  
"你对此太享受了" 红发女孩叹息道，依旧静静地躺在桌上。

The girl watched the boy suspiciously as he walked into the kitchen, speculating about what he was going to do. A few noises could be heard from the kitchen and Asuka wondered if he was looking for something. After a few minutes of waiting on the table, completely naked with her legs spread open, the boy returned with a spoon and a cup. Asuka could not help raising her eyebrow at him.  
女孩怀疑地看着男孩走进厨房，猜测着他要做什么。厨房里传来几声响动，明日香疑惑他是否在找什么东西。在桌子上等了几分钟，全身赤裸，双腿张开，男孩拿着勺子和杯子回来了。明日香忍不住对他挑了挑眉。

"What are you going to do?" Asuka asked, genuinely confused.  
“你要干什么？”明日香问道，真的感到困惑。

"Just don't move" was all Shinji said in response.  
“别动” 真嗣只是这样回应道。

The boy moved right between the redhead's legs before bringing the spoon over to the girl's pussy and pushing it inside. Asuka grunted in discomfort at having a cold metallic object placed up her vagina. The redhead tried to understand Shinji's actions, but was at a loss; she assumed that maybe he was trying to enact one of his perverted fantasies. However, what Shinji did next was utterly baffling; he began scooping their sexual secretions into the cup. Asuka found herself wiggling uncomfortably as the spoon scraped her vaginal walls as he scooped her juices and his semen into the cup until he was sure he had gotten everything. The girl finally relaxed when he removed the utensil from her pussy and moved back to the kitchen. Seeing as Shinji hadn't said anything and her curiosity was killing her, Asuka got down from the table and entered the kitchen to see what he was doing.  
男孩径直走到红发女孩的双腿之间，将勺子伸向她的私处并推了进去。明日香因一个冰冷的金属物体插入自己的阴道而发出不适的呻吟。她试图理解真嗣的行为，却感到困惑；她猜测他可能在实施某种变态的幻想。然而，真嗣接下来的举动完全令人费解；他开始将他们的性分泌物舀入杯中。明日香感到不安地扭动着，随着勺子刮擦她的阴道壁，他将她的体液和他的精液舀入杯中，直到确信已全部收集完毕。当真嗣终于将勺子从她私处移开并回到厨房时，女孩才放松下来。见真嗣一言不发，而她的好奇心又驱使着她，明日香从桌子上下来，走进厨房想看看他在做什么。

Asuka turned to look at the boy when she arrived and was surprised to see him adding various ingredients to the cup; mostly butter, milk and eggs. A look of horror could be seen on the redhead's face as she watched Shinji place the mixture he had created into the waffle maker.  
明日香走进厨房，转向男孩，惊讶地看到他在向杯中加入各种食材；主要是黄油、牛奶和鸡蛋。当她看着真嗣将他调制好的混合物放入华夫饼机时，红发女孩的脸上露出了惊恐的表情。

"What the hell are you doing?!" Asuka asked, shocked.  
"你到底在搞什么鬼？！" 明日香震惊地问道。

"What does it look like? I'm making breakfast of course" Shinji replied innocently, turning on the machine.  
"看起来像什么？当然是在做早餐" 真嗣无辜地回答，打开了机器。

"That's disgusting!" Asuka said appalled.  
"那太恶心了！" 明日香厌恶地说道。

"I'm sure you will enjoy your breakfast this morning" Shinji replied sarcastically.  
"我相信你今早的早餐会非常享受" 真嗣讽刺地回答道。

"I refuse to eat it!" she retorted.  
"我拒绝吃它！" 她反驳道。

"You can't possibly refuse a meal that your master has cooked especially for you" Shinji said mockingly.  
"你不可能拒绝主人特意为你烹饪的饭菜" 真嗣嘲讽地说。

The redhead narrowed her eyes at the boy loathingly. "Manipulative bastard" she mumbled.  
红发女孩厌恶地眯起眼睛盯着那个男孩。“操纵人心的混蛋”她低声咒骂。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling at her response before a small smirk made its way onto his face. "You know, the waffles will take a little bit to cook. Why don't we get dressed while we're waiting, after all, we wouldn't want Misato to walk in on us like this" he suggested.  
真嗣忍不住轻笑出声，随即嘴角微微上扬。“你知道吗，华夫饼还要一会儿才能做好。我们何不趁这会儿穿上衣服呢，毕竟，我们可不想让美里在这种情况下撞见我们。”他提议道。

"That's the first good idea you've had today" Asuka said venomously. "I think I'll take any opportunity not to be naked around you"  
“这是你今天第一个好主意”明日香恶狠狠地说。“我想我会抓住任何不在你面前赤裸的机会”

"A slave that doesn't want to please her master… how troublesome indeed" Shinji said playfully.  
“一个不想取悦主人的奴隶……真是麻烦啊。”真嗣戏谑地说道。

"Oh just shut up with that already" Asuka snapped, before storming off to her room.  
“哦，别再说了！”明日香厉声打断，随即气冲冲地走向自己的房间。

The boy just grinned slightly before moving off to his room as well; he was finding this much more entertaining than he thought it would be. After entering his bedroom, Shinji opened his wardrobe and took out his school uniform before changing into it. Having dressed up, he then exited his room and returned to the kitchen to check up on the waffles. After checking the dish, he decided only a few more minutes were required before they were ready.  
男孩微微一笑，随后也走向自己的房间；他发现这比他预想的要有趣得多。进入卧室后，真嗣打开衣柜，取出校服换上。穿戴整齐后，他回到厨房检查华夫饼的状况。检查过后，他觉得再过几分钟就该好了。

It was then that Asuka, fully dressed in her school uniform, returned to the kitchen and leant against the bench top. Shinji noticed the girl come in and turned to face her.  
就在那时，穿着校服的明日香回到了厨房，靠在操作台上。真嗣注意到女孩进来，转身面对她。

"Your breakfast will be ready very soon" Shinji announced.  
“你的早餐马上就好。”真嗣宣布道。

"I am just bursting with anticipation" Asuka replied sarcastically.  
“我真是迫不及待了呢。”明日香讽刺地回答。

"That's excellent! You'll be the first to try it" Shinji replied back.  
"太好了！你将是第一个尝试的人" 真嗣回答道。

The redhead decided it was better she keep her mouth shut and remained silent. It didn't take long at all for the waffles to finish cooking and Shinji opened the machine to take them out, placing them onto a plate. The girl then moved back into the dining room and sat down at the table as the boy brought the plate of waffles over to Asuka.  
红发女孩决定最好还是保持沉默。没过多久，华夫饼就烤好了，真嗣打开机器取出华夫饼，放在盘子上。女孩随后回到餐厅，坐在桌前，男孩则将装有华夫饼的盘子端给了明日香。

"Go ahead and have a bite of this wonderful meal" Shinji insisted.  
"来，尝一口这美味的餐点" 真嗣坚持道。

"I couldn't possibly eat this food. I would rather my master would not worry about me and eat this all for himself" Asuka retorted.  
“我绝不能吃这食物。我宁愿我的主人不为我担心，自己把这些全吃了。”明日香反驳道。

"But I care about my slave so much that I simply must insist that you eat this, you wouldn't refuse a gift from your master, would you?" Shinji replied.  
“但我实在太关心我的奴隶了，我必须坚持让你吃这个，你不会拒绝主人的礼物吧？”真嗣回答。

Asuka knew that he had much more of an advantage in this game and that she would not be able to win this battle. Sighing, the redhead reached out and grabbed one of the waffles on the plate. Just as she was about to take a bite, the front door opened.  
明日香知道在这场游戏中他占有更大的优势，而她无法赢得这场战斗。叹了口气，红发女孩伸手抓起盘子里的一块华夫饼。就在她准备咬一口时，前门打开了。

"I'm home!" Misato called out.  
"我回来了！" 美里大声喊道。

"Welcome back!" Asuka called back in response, hoping that maybe the Major could save her.  
"欢迎回来！" 明日香回应道，希望这位少校或许能救她一命。

The purple haired woman approached the dining room when she heard the redhead's reply and noticed the smell of cooked food.  
紫发的女子听到红发少女的回答后走向餐厅，闻到了烹饪食物的香味。

"Mmmm what's smells so good?" Misato asked, her mouth watering.  
"嗯，什么东西这么香？" 美里问道，口水直流。

"That would be these excellent waffles that Shinji made, why don't you eat some Misato?" Asuka suggested, hoping the Major would eat all of them.  
"那是真嗣做的美味华夫饼，美里你不来点吗？" 明日香提议道，希望少校能把它们全吃光。

Accepting Asuka's invitation, Misato sat down at the table as well. "I haven't had waffles in ages, great idea Shinji!" she replied, eagerly grabbing a handful of them and wolfing them down in ravenous hunger.  
接受了明日香的邀请，美里也坐到了桌前。"我好久没吃过华夫饼了，真嗣你真棒！" 她回答道，急切地抓起一把，狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。

Shinji looked a little shocked as his guardian ate the waffles he had prepared.  
真嗣看起来有些震惊，因为他的监护人吃掉了他准备的华夫饼。

"Damn these are good! There's just something about them that tastes delicious, something familiar actually and I can't quite place it, but whatever extra ingredients you used are just perfect" the Major said happily.  
“该死，这些真好吃！就是有种熟悉的美味，我一时想不起来，但无论你用了什么特别的配料，都恰到好处。”少校开心地说道。

The redhead suppressed a laugh at the older woman's comment before turning to face Shinji and smiling in triumph. "You seem to like these waffles a great deal Misato, why don't you have all of them" she offered, handing Misato the waffle she had in her hand.  
红发女子忍住笑意，对年长女性的评论作出反应，然后转向真嗣，带着胜利的微笑说：“美里，你似乎很喜欢这些华夫饼，不如全吃了吧。”她边说边把手中的华夫饼递给美里。

Shinji, however, was not about to let Asuka get away. "But you haven't tried one yet Asuka. Surely, you're hungry?" he asked her, a slight grin forming on his face.  
然而，真嗣并不打算让明日香就这样逃掉。“可是你还没尝过呢，明日香。你肯定饿了吧？”他问她，脸上露出一丝微笑。

"I'm not going to eat them all if you haven't had any, go ahead and eat some too Asuka. I know how much you love waffles" Misato replied.  
“如果你还没吃过，我可不会把它们全吃光，你也来吃点吧，明日香。我知道你有多喜欢华夫饼。”美里回答道。

The young girl glared daggers at the boy before reclaiming her waffle. So as not to cause any suspicion, Asuka was forced to take a bite of the morsel. As she began to chew, the redhead was pleasantly surprised to find that the added "ingredients" indeed made it taste interesting, it wasn't bad at all. _'It doesn't matter what's in these anymore now that I've taken a bite, these taste really good!'_ she thought, before taking a few more and eating them contentedly.  
少女瞪了男孩一眼，然后夺回了自己的华夫饼。为了不引起怀疑，明日香不得不咬了一口。当她开始咀嚼时，红发女孩惊喜地发现，那些额外的“配料”确实让味道变得有趣，一点也不差。‘既然我已经咬了一口，现在这些华夫饼的味道真的很棒！’她想着，又吃了几口，满意地享用起来。

The Major noticed the redhead beginning to finish off the rest of the food and quickly intervened. "Are you not going to save any for Shinji?" she asked.  
玛吉尔注意到红发女孩开始扫荡剩下的食物，迅速插话道：“你不打算给真嗣留点吗？”她问道。

"Why?" Asuka shot back, mouth full of food.  
“为什么？”明日香反问道，嘴里塞满了食物。

"Yeah good point, better if there's more for us" Misato replied jokingly.  
“是啊，有道理，还是我们多吃点好。”美里开玩笑地回答。

"Misato, what do you mean by that?" Shinji said, sounding a little hurt.  
“美里，你这话是什么意思？”真嗣说道，听起来有些受伤。

"Relax Shin-chan I was kidding" the Major replied grinning, handing him one of his waffles.  
“放松点，真嗣君，我开玩笑的。”美里少校笑着回答，递给他一块华夫饼。

The boy received the offered food and took a bite, surprise covering his face as he did so; it would seem they really were delicious. Shinji no longer hesitated and took a few more waffles, still amazed at how good they actually tasted.  
男孩接过递来的食物，咬了一口，脸上露出惊讶的表情；看来这些华夫饼真的很美味。真嗣不再犹豫，又拿了几块，依然对它们的美味感到惊奇。

"Shinji, you gotta make these again sometime" Misato announced cheerily.  
"真嗣，你得找个时间再做一次这些" 美里欢快地宣布道。

Both Shinji and Asuka choked momentarily on their food at their guardian's comment; it was highly unlikely they would ever make them again, most likely because the redhead would never allow it again. Silence followed for a bit too long and Shinji knew he shouldn't have delayed his answer.  
听到监护人的评论，真嗣和明日香都差点被食物噎住；他们几乎不可能再做一次了，很可能是因为红发少女绝不会再允许。沉默持续得太久，真嗣知道自己不该拖延回答。

"Y-yeah sure" Shinji said after the awkward silence.  
"呃，当然可以" 真嗣在尴尬的沉默后说道。

The older woman looked at the boy strangely before brushing it off. Misato then yawned quite audibly and Shinji noticed just how tired she looked. The boy recalled her words yesterday and realised she had not come home till now since yesterday.  
年长的女人奇怪地看了男孩一眼，然后不以为意地挥了挥手。美里随后大声地打了个哈欠，真嗣注意到她看起来有多疲惫。男孩回想起她昨天的话，意识到她从昨天到现在一直没有回家。

"You look really tired Misato" Shinji commented, concerned.  
“你看起来真的很累，美里。”真嗣关切地说道。

"You look half-dead" Asuka remarked.  
“你看起来半死不活的。”明日香评论道。

"Yeah I am, I think all the coffee I drank is wearing off" Misato replied with another yawn. "Though thankfully I have the day off today"  
"是啊，我想我喝的那些咖啡劲儿快过去了" 美里打着哈欠回答道。"不过幸好今天我休息"

"Well then you don't need to worry about us Misato, just go get some sleep" Shinji requested.  
"那你就别担心我们了，美里，去睡一觉吧" 真嗣请求道。"

"Yeah I think I will, you chu make shhure you get to shhool" their guardian replied, her speech a little mumbled from yawning at the same time.  
"嗯，我想我会去的，你们要确保去上学" 他们的监护人回答，因为同时打哈欠，说话有点含糊。"

"We will" Shinji assured.  
“我们会去的。”真嗣保证道。

Their guardian stood up and blinked her eyes groggily, before moving off to her bedroom. Misato thought about this morning's interactions with her wards and decided today was definitely not the day to enact her punishment, she would let Shinji have this day; besides she was way too tired. The older woman promptly entered her room to go to sleep.  
他们的监护人站起身，睡眼惺忪地眨了眨眼，然后走向自己的卧室。美里回想起今早与孩子们的互动，决定今天绝不是实施惩罚的日子，她会让真嗣拥有这一天；况且她实在太累了。这位年长的女性随即进入房间准备睡觉。

The male eva pilot looked at his watch when Misato was out of sight and realised that he still needed to make their lunches as school would start soon.  
当美里离开视线后，男性 eva 驾驶员看了看手表，意识到他还需要为上学即将开始的他们准备午餐。

"I better start preparing our lunches now" Shinji announced to Asuka.  
"我还是现在开始准备我们的午餐吧" 真嗣对明日香宣布道。

"Yeah, I'd rather not have to eat at the cafeteria again" Asuka replied.  
"是啊，我可不想再去食堂吃了" 明日香回答。

"The slave should actually be making the food for the master" he said cheekily.  
"奴隶应该为主人准备食物才对" 他调皮地说。

The redhead just gave Shinji a menacing look in response.  
红发女孩只是回给了真嗣一个威胁的眼神。

"B-But of course I'm such a loving and generous master that I am willing to make the lunches myself" he said quickly.  
“当然，我是个充满爱心又慷慨的主人，我愿意亲自做午餐。”他迅速说道。

"I'll go get my bag" was all she said.  
“我去拿我的包。”她只说了这么一句。

Shinji watched Asuka walk to her room before turning his attention back to the kitchen. He quickly got to work and began preparing their lunches for school. The girl soon returned to the kitchen and dropped her bag onto the floor, seeing as her roommate was still making their lunches. Noticing that Asuka had entered the kitchen, Shinji momentarily stopped what he was doing and turned to face her.  
真嗣看着明日香走向她的房间，然后又将注意力转回到厨房。他迅速开始忙碌，着手准备他们上学的午餐。女孩很快回到厨房，将书包扔在地上，看到室友还在做午餐。注意到明日香进入厨房，真嗣暂时停下手中的活，转身面对她。

"Go get my bag as well" he commanded.  
“去把我的包也拿来”他命令道。

"Asshole! You shoulda told me before" the redhead complained.  
“混蛋！你该早点告诉我的”红发女孩抱怨道。

"Don't talk back slave!" Shinji retorted.  
"别顶嘴，奴隶！" 真嗣反驳道。

Deciding it was better she just let it go, Asuka mumbled something under her breath before going off to Shinji's room to get his bag as well.  
决定还是就此罢休，明日香低声咕哝了几句，然后去真嗣的房间拿他的书包。

Shinji just smiled; being able to talk back to Asuka without getting injured was quite fun. He also knew that he shouldn't get too carried away, if anything the redhead excelled at getting revenge. At that thought, the boy made sure to quickly finish preparing their bentos.  
真嗣只是笑了笑；能和明日香顶嘴而不受伤真是太有趣了。他也知道不能太过分，毕竟红发女孩擅长报复。想到这里，男孩赶紧准备好了他们的便当。

The girl returned to the kitchen with Shinji's bag, her face looking displeased. Shinji wisely chose not to say anything when she dropped the bag on his foot and instead just continued finishing their lunches as if nothing had happened. Soon the boy had completed their bentos and as such handed Asuka her lunch. The redhead placed her bag over her shoulder before moving off to the door without waiting for the boy.  
女孩带着真嗣的包回到厨房，脸上带着不悦的表情。真嗣明智地选择保持沉默，当她把包扔到他脚上时，他只是继续完成他们的午餐，仿佛什么都没发生。不久，男孩完成了他们的便当，并递给明日香她的午餐。红发女孩把包挎在肩上，不等男孩就径直向门口走去。

"Wait a second!" Shinji ordered.  
“等一下！”真嗣命令道。

Bound by her deal with the boy, Asuka was forced to stop in her tracks. "What?" she asked annoyed, turning to face him.  
由于与男孩的约定，明日香被迫停下脚步。“什么事？”她不耐烦地转过身来问道。

The boy placed his lunch inside his bag before moving over to the girl and closing the distance between their lips. As he planted his kiss, Shinji wrapped his arm around the girl's waist and pulled her closer. He parted after a while and looked into the girl's eyes, grinning. The redhead just raised an eyebrow back at him.  
男孩将午餐放入书包后，便走向女孩，缩短了两人唇间的距离。当他吻上时，真嗣用一只手臂环住女孩的腰，将她拉得更近。片刻后，他分开并凝视着女孩的眼睛，咧嘴一笑。红发女孩只是挑了挑眉回应他。

"You weren't going to leave without giving me a kiss, were you?" he asked.  
“你不会就这样不给我一个吻就走吧？”他问道。

"Retard" she replied shortly before turning around and heading towards the front door.  
“傻瓜。”她简短地回答，随即转身向门口走去。

Chuckling nervously, Shinji then quickly followed after her as she opened the door and exited their residence. Locking the door behind him, he then grabbed Asuka's hand and led her down the stairs.  
紧张地轻笑一声，真嗣随即快步跟在她身后，随着她打开门离开了住所。他锁上门后，抓住明日香的手，领着她走下楼梯。

"You know, it wasn't very nice making Misato eat those waffles" Shinji told Asuka as they exited their building.  
“你知道吗，让美里吃那些华夫饼可不太好。”真嗣边说边和明日香走出大楼。

The redhead just started snickering.  
红发少女只是开始窃笑。

"It's not funny Asuka" Shinji said, clearly not amused.  
"这不好笑，明日香。" 真嗣说道，显然并不觉得有趣。

"Oh yeah? Didn't you hear her say, 'there's just something about them that tastes delicious, something familiar actually and I can't quite place it,' I mean she just _has_ to be a whore" she replied, still sniggering.  
"哦，是吗？你没听到她说，‘它们就是有种美味的感觉，实际上很熟悉，但我就是说不出来，’我是说她肯定是个荡妇" 她回答道，仍然窃笑着。

"Yeah, just like you" he said, sticking his tongue out at her.  
"对啊，就像你一样" 他说着，向她吐了吐舌头。

"Excuse me" The redhead huffed at his comment, "I only fuck one person" she countered.  
"不好意思" 红发女孩对他的评论哼了一声，"我只和一个人上床" 她反驳道。

The boy smiled at her response, "I was just kidding!" he said defending himself. Still holding Asuka's hand, he started walking faster, pulling his girlfriend along with him.  
男孩对她的话笑了笑，"我只是在开玩笑！" 他辩解道。仍然握着明日香的手，他开始加快步伐，拉着他的女朋友一起走。

"Are you in a hurry to get to school or something?" Asuka questioned.  
"你这么急着去学校还是怎么的？" 明日香问道。

"It'd be good to explain our new relationship as quickly as possible don't you think?" Shinji answered.  
"尽快解释我们的新关系，你不觉得这样很好吗？" 真嗣回答道。

"You're not talking about revealing that we're boyfriend and girlfriend to the class, are you?" Asuka asked immediately, halting for a moment.  
"你不是在说要在班上公开我们是男女朋友吧？" 明日香立刻问道，停顿了一下。

"Isn't that the best thing to do?" Shinji replied.  
"这不是最好的办法吗？" 真嗣回应道。

"Didn't we just tell Kensuke yesterday not to tell anyone about it at school because it would cause problems?" Asuka refuted.  
"我们昨天不是才告诉 Kensuke 不要在学校告诉任何人这件事，以免引起麻烦吗？" 明日香反驳道。

"Not even just that we're together…?" he asked.  
"不仅仅是我们在交往的事…？" 他问道。

"That'll lead to questions… I think it's better we just be silent about it for now" she answered.  
"那会引起很多问题…我觉得我们还是暂时保持沉默比较好" 她回答道。

"Yeah, I suppose you're right…" he replied and they started walking again. "So… how will the situation at school be then?" he asked.  
"是啊，我想你说的对……" 他回答道，两人又开始走动。"那么……学校的情况会怎样呢？" 他问道。

"Easy. We act how we've always acted at school; like we aren't together" she answered.  
"简单。我们在学校就表现得和平时一样；好像我们没有在一起" 她回答说。

"Back to getting ridiculed and insulted huh?" Shinji said with a sigh.  
"又要被嘲笑和侮辱了，是吧？" 真嗣叹了口气说。

"You should be used to it by now, besides it's not so bad if you just ignore my insults" Asuka replied.  
"你应该已经习惯了，再说了，如果你不理会我的侮辱，其实也没那么糟糕。" 明日香回答道。

"It's not just insults though" he answered back, laughing. "But I suppose I should be used to it, after all you still do it to me even now" he joked.  
"不仅仅是侮辱。" 他笑着回敬道，"不过我想我应该习惯了，毕竟即使现在你还是这样对我。" 他开玩笑地说。

The redhead punched the boy in response. "Well excuse me! You're the one who acts like a moron, otherwise I wouldn't need to do anything" she said angrily. "I suppose confessing my love, fucking you senseless and being your slave today just isn't enough?"  
红发女孩回应地给了男孩一拳。"好吧，原谅我！是你自己表现得像个傻瓜，否则我根本不需要做这些。" 她生气地说，"难道说我爱你、让你神魂颠倒、今天还做你的奴隶还不够吗？

"Jeez I was kidding… we won't mention the relationship alright?" Shinji assured.  
“天哪，我开玩笑的……我们不提那关系，好吗？”真嗣保证道。

"Hmpf" was all Asuka said before letting go of the boy's hand and moving in front of him.  
“哼”是明日香唯一的回应，她松开了男孩的手，走到他前面。

The boy just resigned to his fate and walked the rest of the way to school in silence with Asuka in the lead. It didn't take long for the two eva pilots to reach the front gates of the school, after which, they entered the school building. Shinji was focused on the girl in front of him as they walked, speculating about what was on her mind.  
男孩只好认命，默默地跟在明日香后面走完去学校的路。两位 EVA 驾驶员很快就到达了学校的前门，随后进入了教学楼。真嗣一路上专注地看着前面的女孩，猜测她心里在想些什么。

The redhead suddenly slowed her pace, almost making Shinji trip over as he tried not to bump into her.  
红发女孩突然放慢了脚步，差点让真嗣绊倒，因为他尽力不撞到她。

"Don't slow down so suddenly Asuka" Shinji said impatiently, lightly pushing her forward by her backside.  
“别突然慢下来，明日香。”真嗣不耐烦地说，轻轻推了推她的后背催促她前进。

"There's a damn yoghurt spill on the ground baka, I don't wanna step in it" Asuka replied.  
“地上有该死的酸奶洒了，笨蛋，我不想踩到它。”明日香回答道。

Unfortunately for them, there was another person present who could see Shinji's hand firmly pressed against the redhead's buttocks.  
遗憾的是，在场还有另一个人能清楚地看到真嗣的手正紧紧按在红发少年的臀部上。

"What's this?! Shinji is groping the demon's ass?!" the person proclaimed.  
“这是怎么回事？！真嗣在摸恶魔的屁股吗？！”那人大声说道。

The male eva pilot quickly removed his hand and turned to see Touji looking at him, his face shocked. _'Shit! I totally forgot we're in school'_ Shinji thought.  
男性 eva 驾驶员迅速抽回手，转身看到东治正震惊地看着他。'该死！我完全忘了我们还在学校' 真嗣心想。

The boy's thoughts were soon interrupted, however, by a jarring blow to the jaw. It would seem the redhead had elbowed him in the face; hard.  
然而，男孩的思绪很快被一记猛烈的下巴打击打断。看来是红发女孩用肘部狠狠地击中了他的脸。

"What the hell do you think you're doing Ikari?! If you ever touch me again you will regret the day you were born!" Asuka shouted at Shinji, glaring furiously at him.  
“你到底在搞什么鬼，碇？！如果你再敢碰我，你会后悔来到这个世界上的！”明日香对着真嗣大喊，怒气冲冲地瞪着他。

_'Man that hurt'_ Shinji thought, nursing his jaw.  
“真疼啊。”真嗣心里想着，揉着下巴。

The jock came over to his injured friend to inspect the damage. "Wow Shinji, she hit ya real hard, I think it's gonna bruise" he remarked.  
那个运动员走过来检查他受伤朋友的情况。“哇，真嗣，她打得你真狠，我看要青一块了。”他评论道。

"Yeah, I didn't even mean to do that…" Shinji replied weakly, his mouth in pain.  
“是啊，我根本没想那么做……”真嗣虚弱地回答，嘴巴因疼痛而扭曲。

"Don't worry, it's normal for guys to want to touch a girl's ass… you just chose the wrong girl" Touji replied.  
“别担心，男人想摸女孩屁股很正常……你只是选错了对象。”冬二回答道。

"Shut up you hentai!" Asuka said snarling. "Don't give that boy any ideas!"  
"闭嘴，你这个变态！" 明日香咆哮道，"别给那男孩灌输奇怪的想法！"

"Hey I'm just educating my poor disadvantaged friend here. Because of ya strict controlling, Shinji here has been deprived of all the normal things a teen boy _should_ perform" Touji retorted.  
"嘿，我只是在教育我这位可怜的、被剥夺了正常青少年生活的朋友。都是因为你那严格的控制，真嗣在这里错过了所有青少年该做的事情。" 冬二反驳道。

Shinji himself smiled inwardly at that comment; he was 100 percent certain he had done far more than Touji ever had.  
听到这话，真嗣自己暗自笑了；他百分之百确定自己做的事情远比冬二多得多。

"Don't corrupt this baka any further! Unlike you other stooges, at least he practises some restraint. Don't ruin my good work!" Asuka refuted.  
"别再玷污这个笨蛋了！不像你们这些跟班，他至少还有些自制力。别毁了我的好成果！" 明日香反驳道。

"What he wants to do is not up to you, ya damned demon" Touji argued. "And what's with the band aid on his face, did you do that to him as well?"  
"他想做什么不是你说了算，你这该死的恶魔" 冬二争辩道。"他脸上的创可贴是怎么回事，也是你弄的吗？"

"No you numbskull, how dare you assume such a thing" Asuka snapped.  
"不，你这个蠢货，你怎么敢这么想" 明日香厉声道。

"I'm right here guys, I _can_ speak for myself" Shinji said timidly, trying to interrupt their bickering.  
“我就在这儿，伙计们，我可以自己说。”真嗣怯生生地说道，试图打断他们的争吵。

"You stay out of this" both Touji and Asuka said at the same time.  
“你别掺和” 东治和明日香异口同声地说。

The male eva pilot just sweat dropped at the two. _'I don't think this argument is about me anymore…'_  
男性 eva 驾驶员只是汗颜地看着两人。‘我觉得这争论已经不关我的事了……’

Fortunately for Shinji the school bell rang, preventing any further quarrelling between the two rivals.  
幸好学校的铃声响起，救了真嗣一命，阻止了两位对手之间进一步的争吵。

"Let's just go to class" Shinji said, interrupting their stare down.  
“我们还是去上课吧。”真嗣打断了他们的对峙，说道。

The two aggressive classmates turned away from each other and began to walk towards their classroom, both of them making a defiant grumble. A strange thought entered Shinji's mind as he saw their behaviour. _'With the amount those two argue, you would think that they got along really well…'_  
这两位好斗的同学彼此转身，开始向教室走去，两人都带着不服气的咕哝声。看着他们的行为，真嗣心中闪过一个奇怪的想法：‘就他们俩这争吵的频率，你可能会以为他们其实相处得很好……’

Shaking his head, Shinji followed the other two to the classroom. Upon entering their room, the three of them went to their seats and sat down. Their teacher came in shortly, preventing him from any possible discussion with his friends, before Hikari stood up to say "Rise! Bow! Sit!"  
"摇了摇头，真嗣跟着另外两人走向教室。一进教室，三人各自回到座位坐下。他们的老师很快走了进来，阻止了他与朋友们可能的交谈，随后光子站起来喊道：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！””

As the class began, the teacher, surprisingly, did not start on his usual ramble but instead stood up to make an announcement.  
随着课程开始，老师出乎意料地没有开始他惯常的长篇大论，而是站起来宣布一件事。

"Everyone, I'm sure you all know that we have a school play to present soon. As such, the first half of school today will instead be used to start practising this play" the teacher declared.  
“各位，相信大家知道我们不久后要上演一出校园剧。因此，今天上午的前半段时间将用来开始排练这部戏剧。”老师宣布道。

The entire class cheered; they were all grateful for not having to endure another mind-numbing lecture.  
全班欢呼起来；他们都很庆幸不用再忍受另一场令人昏昏欲睡的讲座。

"We will start straight away. Everyone, go down to the stage room now except Miss Horaki. Remember, no running and don't wander off anywhere" the old man instructed.  
“我们马上开始。所有人，除了堀木小姐，现在都去舞台室。记住，不要跑，也不要到处乱逛。”老人指示道。

"Yes sir!" the class replied before getting up from their seats and piling out of the classroom.  
“是，先生！”班级齐声回答，随即从座位上起身，涌出教室。

As the students exited the room, Shinji made sure to follow closely behind his girlfriend. The students became all tightly packed together as they made their way to the school stage room. As such, the male eva pilot found himself right behind the redhead and he moved his head forward a bit to whisper in her ear.  
学生们陆续离开教室，真嗣紧跟在女友身后。他们前往学校舞台室的路上，学生们挤成一团。就这样，这位男性 EVA 驾驶员发现自己正好站在红发女孩后面，他微微前倾，凑到她耳边低语。

"You know I believe I deserve some compensation for that elbow earlier, it really hurt" Shinji told Asuka quietly.  
“你知道的，我觉得刚才那一下肘击我应该得到点补偿，真的很疼。”真嗣轻声对明日香说。

"It's clearly your fault for groping my ass in school" Asuka whispered back.  
“在学校摸我屁股，显然是你的错。”明日香低声回敬道。

"Even so, you could have hit me a lot softer" he replied.  
"即便如此，你本可以打得轻一点" 他回答道。

"I made it look more authentic" she justified.  
"我这么做是为了让它看起来更真实" 她辩解道。

"I'm _so_ grateful that you made sure it looked and _felt_ real" he replied sarcastically.  
"我真是感激不尽，你确保了它看起来和感觉上都如此真实" 他讽刺地回应。

"Stop complaining about it already" she whispered, growing annoyed.  
"别再抱怨了" 她低声说道，开始感到不耐烦。

Shinji moved his hand down to her side in response.  
真嗣将手移到她的腰侧作为回应。

"What are you doing Shinji?" she asked.  
"你在做什么，真嗣？" 她问道。

The male eva pilot did not reply but instead began to gently tickle her side.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员没有回答，而是开始轻轻地挠她的侧腰。

"I would ask that you refrain from doing anything stupid, you were just caught and it would be real suspicious if you were caught again!" the redhead continued, keeping her voice low.  
“我请求你不要做任何蠢事，你刚刚才被抓到，如果再被抓到就真的太可疑了！”红发女孩继续说道，压低了声音。

Shinji then grabbed hold of the girl's hand that was resting by her side. "Surely holding your hand is a meagre compensation for what you did" he replied.  
真嗣随后抓住了女孩垂在身旁的手。“握住你的手，对你所做的事来说，补偿实在微不足道。”他回答道。

The redhead sighed as the boy gripped her hand. "Whatever" was all she said in reply, grasping his hand as well.  
红发女孩叹了口气，男孩紧握着她的手。她只是淡淡地回了句“随便”，同时也握紧了他的手。

"Don't worry Asuka, there's much more in store for you at lunchtime" Shinji informed.  
“别担心明日香，午饭时间还有更多惊喜等着你呢。”真嗣告诉她。

The redhead could not turn around to glare at the boy and instead opted to stomp on his foot. It took all of Shinji's willpower not to jump or cry out in pain as her heel crushed his toe. The boy let Asuka have her victory for now and resolved to get her back later; after all, at lunch she was all his.  
红发女孩无法转身瞪着男孩，于是选择了踩他的脚。明日香的高跟鞋跟碾压他的脚趾，真嗣竭尽全力才忍住没有跳起来或痛呼出声。男孩暂时让明日香占了上风，决心以后再找机会报复；毕竟，午饭时她就是他的了。

Once the group of students had reached the stage room, the crowd began to disperse and Shinji was forced to release the redhead's hand and move away. Despite her defiance, Asuka had held his hand warmly the whole time. The class entered the stage room and clustered around the front of the stage, talking excitedly about the play. Standing behind the group of students, the teacher called for silence and everyone turned their heads to face him. The class rep was standing next to him and both of them were holding a big stack of paper.  
当学生们到达舞台房间后，人群开始散去，真嗣不得不放开红发女孩的手，移步离开。尽管她表现出抗拒，但明日香一直温暖地握着他的手。班级进入舞台房间，聚集在舞台前，兴奋地讨论着戏剧。站在学生群后面，老师呼唤大家安静，所有人都转头看向他。班长站在他旁边，两人都拿着一大叠纸。

"Does everyone know their roles for the play?" the teacher asked.  
“大家都清楚自己在剧中的角色吗？”老师问道。

A big chorus of "yes sir" was heard in reply.  
随即响起了一阵响亮的“是的，老师”的回应声。

"That's good to hear, but if you are confused about your part just come and speak to me after. I have the list of roles with me" the old man declared. "Now we need to get this started so we will begin by reading the first scene of the play, please get a copy of the script from Miss Horaki or myself. Let's also try to enact it after"  
"听到这个消息很好，但如果你对自己的角色有疑问，结束后可以来找我。我手头有角色清单。" 老人宣布道，"现在我们需要开始了，我们先来读剧本的第一幕，请从堀木小姐或我这里拿一份剧本。之后我们也试着表演一下。"

"Hai!" all the students replied.  
"明白！" 所有学生齐声回答。

The entire class each took a copy of the script of the play from the class rep and the teacher and begun to read through the first scene. As Shinji and Asuka were the main characters they had to learn many lines. The first scene included them both and they were studying the section vigorously.  
全班同学各自从班级代表和老师那里拿到了剧本，开始阅读第一幕。由于真嗣和明日香是主角，他们需要记住很多台词。第一幕包含了他们两人的部分，他们正努力地研究这一段。

The play was set in medieval Europe and it was a story about romance. Shinji was a knight who diligently followed his code of chivalry, while Asuka was a princess being brought to his country as an arranged marriage for the king. The first scene involved the princess being brought by a carriage with an escort. Other classmates made up Asuka's guards. The students all got ready to begin reciting their lines, there wasn't enough time left to practise the actions so it was just going to be speech.  
这部剧设定在中世纪的欧洲，讲述了一个关于浪漫的故事。真嗣是一位恪守骑士精神的骑士，而明日香则是一位被安排嫁给国王的公主。第一幕中，公主乘坐马车在护卫队的护送下来到了这个国家。其他同学扮演明日香的卫兵。学生们都准备好了开始念台词，由于没有足够的时间练习动作，所以只能进行口头表演。

Soon, the teacher gave the signal to begin and Asuka spoke up.  
不久，老师发出了开始的信号，明日香开始说话。

"What a lovely day it is today" the princess said to her cohorts. As they weren't doing actions and they didn't have any props, it was difficult to tell what was happening. The princess was talking to the men outside the carriage through the open door.  
“今天真是个好天气啊。”公主对她的同伴们说道。由于没有动作表演和道具，很难判断发生了什么。公主正通过敞开的门与马车外的男士们交谈。

"Aye my lady" they replied back.  
“是的，我的女士。”他们回答道。

"How long till we reach the castle of Galatia?" she asked.  
“我们还要多久才能到达加拉提亚城堡？”她问道。

"Only three more days my Lady, we are very close to a town called Petermby, we will have a rest there soon" her guide answered.  
“再过三天，我的女士，我们离彼得姆比镇很近了，很快我们将在那里休息。”她的向导回答道。

"Good to hear, this carriage is getting quite unbearable" she replied.  
"听到这话真好，这辆马车实在让人难以忍受" 她回答道。

"I apologise for your discomfort my lady" the rider said humbly.  
"对于您的不适，我深感抱歉，夫人" 骑手谦卑地说。

"It is no fault of your own that this terrain is merciless, be at ease" the princess remarked.  
"这地形无情并非你的过错，请安心" 公主说道。

At this point, the princess was meant to close the door of the carriage and remain inside. This is where Shinji entered the scene; in the play he was to be trailing behind the carriage on a horse as he noticed it.  
按照剧情，此时公主应该关上马车的门，留在车内。正是在这里，真嗣登场了；在剧中，他本应骑着马跟在马车后面，并注意到它。

"Those are no ordinary guards escorting that carriage… perhaps it's an emissary?" the knight said to himself. "I will ride by it and ensure its safety"  
“那些护送马车的可不是普通的卫兵……或许是使者？”骑士自言自语道，“我会骑马靠近它，确保其安全。”

It was now that the carriage ahead of the knight would be stopped by a suspicious person. It was none other than Touji playing this character.  
就在这时，骑士前方的马车被一个可疑的人拦下了。此人正是扮演这一角色的东治。

"I'm very sorry, but you must stop this carriage" the suspicious man demanded.  
"非常抱歉，但你必须让这辆马车停下来" 这位可疑的男子要求道。

The carriage would come to a stop and the rider would address the man blocking the road.  
马车会停下来，骑手会向挡在路上的男子说话。

"Is something wrong good sir?" the rider asked.  
"有什么问题吗，先生？" 骑手问道。

"Yes… your journey ends here! ATTACK!" the man shouted, unsheathing a sword.  
"是的……你的旅程到此为止了！攻击！" 那人大喊着，拔出了剑。

Here several brigands would launch an attack on the carriage. As the knight sees the carriage stop followed by men coming out of the forest to assault it, he rides his horse forward to help them.  
这里，几个强盗会向马车发起攻击。当骑士看到马车停下，随后有人从森林中冲出来袭击时，他骑马向前去帮助他们。

"Faster my friend, I must go help them" the knight urged his horse.  
"快点，我的朋友，我必须去帮助他们" 骑士催促着他的马。

The focus returns to the princess in the carriage who is confused about what is happening.  
焦点再次回到车厢中的公主身上，她对正在发生的事情感到困惑。

"What is going on men?" the princess asked, opening the carriage door.  
“这是怎么回事，各位？”公主问道，打开了车厢门。

The guide would quickly enter the carriage and close the door.  
向导会迅速进入车厢并关上门。

"I cannot believe it myself but we are being attacked my Lady! We've already lost four men and things do not seem to be going our way" the guide explained hurriedly.  
"我简直不敢相信，但我们确实遭到了攻击，夫人！我们已经失去了四名士兵，形势似乎对我们不利。" 向导急忙解释道。

The princess paused for a moment before speaking up. "I will go outside and deal with our assailants. I do not wish any more of my men to die" she announced.  
公主停顿了一下，然后开口说道："我会出去对付那些袭击者。我不希望再有我的士兵牺牲。" 她宣布道。

"But your highness, it is not safe!" the guide implored.  
"但是殿下，这太危险了！" 向导恳求道。

"I give the orders here! I will go out" she commanded.  
"这里我说了算！我要出去" 她命令道。

"Yes, your highness" the guide said, resigning.  
"是的，殿下" 向导无奈地说道。

It was now that the princess would step out of the carriage and momentarily stop the fighting.  
就在这时，公主将走出马车，暂时制止战斗。

"Stop this barbaric behaviour, I have not done anything to warrant being attacked" the princess announced.  
"停止这种野蛮行为，我并未做任何该受攻击的事。" 公主宣布道。

"Ah, so you must be the princess" the lead brigand verified.  
"啊，那你一定是公主了。" 为首的强盗确认道。

"I am, and what of it? Surely you understand how foolish it is to attack royalty" the princess replied.  
"没错，我就是公主，那又如何？你肯定明白攻击王室是多么愚蠢的行为。" 公主回答道。

"Not foolish if you think of the potential profit. It is quite simple really. I capture you and then sell you as ransom. I'm sure you understand, so to make this easier for everyone please just cease resisting" the brigand explained.  
"并非愚蠢，若考虑到潜在的利益。其实很简单。我抓住你，然后把你作为赎金卖掉。我相信你明白，为了大家方便，请不要再抵抗了" 强盗解释道。

"I think you overestimate yourself. I refuse to give into those demands" she said defiantly.  
"我认为你高估了自己。我拒绝接受这些要求" 她倔强地说。

"It is unfortunate of you to say that. A shame that these men now have to die" the leader said disappointedly.  
"你这么说真是遗憾。可惜，这些人现在不得不死了" 首领失望地说。

At this point, the knight would charge in on his horse.  
此时此刻，骑士会骑着他的马冲锋陷阵。

"In the name of justice, I will fight you bandits! You will not get away with this" the knight called out.  
“以正义之名，我要与你们这些强盗战斗！你们休想逃脱！”骑士高声呼喊。

"Get him!" the leader shouted.  
“抓住他！”首领大喊道。

The knight would then grab the princess and hoist her onto his horse and run off.  
骑士随即抓住公主，将她举上马背，疾驰而去。

"What about my men? Turn back! I command you!" the princess shouted at him in outrage.  
“我的部下怎么办？掉头！我命令你！”公主愤怒地对他喊道。

"Do not worry my Lady, I sent for reinforcements. I only grabbed you so they would not use you as a hostage" the knight explained.  
“请放心，我的女士，我已经请求了增援。我之所以只带走您，是怕他们把您当作人质。”骑士解释道。

"I could have handled myself fine, thank you very much" she spat back.  
"我自己完全能应付，非常感谢" 她反唇相讥。

"Forgive me but you are a lady, you could easily have been harmed" the knight replied.  
"请原谅，但您是位女士，很容易受到伤害" 骑士回答道。

"I will not suffer your insults! Let me off at Petermby, I will consult your lord and have you flogged!" the princess shouted.  
"我绝不容忍你的侮辱！在彼得姆比让我下车，我要找你的主人告状，让你受鞭刑！" 公主喊道。

"Who are you to have so much authority?" he asked.  
"你凭什么拥有如此大的权力？" 他问道。

"You don't even know who I am?! I am Princess Sankt. I have come to your country to marry your King" she answered.  
"你甚至不知道我是谁？！我是桑克特公主。我来贵国是为了嫁给你们的国王" 她回答道。

"I apologise your highness, I was ignorant. I will make sure you get safely to Petermby then. That is my duty as a knight" the knight replied.  
"我为我的无知向您道歉，公主殿下。我会确保您安全抵达彼得姆比。作为一名骑士，这是我的职责" 骑士回答道。

"Very well, I will suffer your company till we reach the town, I hope for your sake my men are well" the princess said venomously.  
“很好，我会忍受你的陪伴直到我们到达城镇，希望对你来说我的手下们安然无恙。”公主恶狠狠地说道。

The knight would then stay silent and bring the princess to the town and let her off. While the two of them are waiting for Sankt's men to return, the knight strikes up a conversation.  
骑士随后保持沉默，将公主带到城镇并让她离开。当两人等待桑克特的手下归来时，骑士开始搭话。

"Your highness, if it is not too forward of me, I would like to make a suggestion" the knight said, beseeching the princess.  
“殿下，如果我不算冒昧的话，我想提个建议。”骑士恳求道，向公主说道。

"Speak" was all she said.  
"说" 她只说了这一个字。

"I have put much thought into this and I believe it would be far safer for you to travel to the King with me" the knight suggested.  
"我对此深思熟虑过，我认为你与我一同前往国王那里会安全得多" 骑士提议道。

"Why would I willingly suffer your company any longer? As soon as my men arrive, I will continue the journey with _them_" the princess replied.  
"我为何要自愿忍受与你同行的煎熬？一旦我的人马到达，我将和他们继续旅程" 公主回答道。

"I implore you your highness, the roads are not as safe as they used to be. A lone horse rider brings far less attention than a carriage with an escort. We can escape easily and I know this country's terrain quite well. My only wish is for you to arrive safely to the castle and I swear as a knight that I will do my best to do so" the knight replied, kneeling down in front of the princess.  
"我恳求您，殿下，道路已不如往昔安全。单独骑马比有护卫的马车更不易引人注意。我们可以轻易逃脱，我对这片土地的地形相当熟悉。我唯一的愿望是确保您安全抵达城堡，我以骑士的名义发誓，将竭尽全力做到这一点" 骑士回答道，跪在公主面前。

The princess would then pause to think about his offer.  
公主随后停顿，思考他的提议。

"Rise sir knight" she commanded.  
"起身吧，骑士先生" 她命令道。

"Yes, my Lady" the knight said, standing up.  
“是的，我的女士。”骑士说着，站起身来。

"I see the merit in your proposal, I will discuss it with my men. Though I believe your plan to be quite sensible" the princess explained.  
“我明白你的提议有其价值，我会与我的部下商讨。尽管我认为你的计划相当合理。”公主解释道。

"Thank you my Lady" the knight replied.  
“谢谢您，我的女士。”骑士回答道。

"What is your name sir knight?" the princess asked.  
"请问骑士先生尊姓大名？"公主问道。

"I am Sir Jonathan" the knight answered.  
"在下是乔纳森爵士"骑士回答道。

Asuka instantly burst out laughing at Shinji's response.  
明日香立刻被真嗣的回答逗得大笑起来。

"What was that miss Sohryu? You're not supposed to laugh" the teacher said with a frown.  
"那是怎么回事，惣流小姐？你不该笑的。" 老师皱着眉说。

"Sorry Sensei I couldn't help it, I just thought it sounded so funny" Asuka answered.  
"对不起，老师，我忍不住，只是觉得那听起来太滑稽了。" 明日香回答道。

"We had done our lines perfectly up until then Asuka, why ruin it?" Shinji said, a little annoyed.  
"我们之前的台词都表现得完美无缺，明日香，为什么要搞砸呢？" 真嗣有些不悦地说。

"You try hearing that and keeping a straight face" Asuka replied giggling. "Besides it's no big deal" she added.  
"你试试听到这个还能保持严肃脸。" 明日香笑着回答，"再说了，这也没什么大不了的。"她补充道。

"Well as class time is almost over, I suppose it doesn't matter this time miss Sohryu. But try to do it properly next time" the teacher replied.  
"既然快下课了，我想这次就无所谓了，绫波同学。但下次请认真点。" 老师回答道。

"Hai" the redhead said in reply.  
"嗨" 红发女孩回应道。

"Alright class that's it for today, next practice session we'll have the costumes and props ready. We'll being doing setting up and actions then too" the teacher announced.  
"好了，同学们，今天就到这里。下次练习课我们会准备好服装和道具，到时候还会进行场景布置和动作练习。" 老师宣布道。

Just as the teacher finished talking, the bell rang for lunch and the students rushed out of the stage room. Shinji was sure to take hold of Asuka's hand before she got a chance to run off and the girl glared back at him.  
老师话音刚落，午餐铃声响起，学生们纷纷冲出舞台室。真嗣及时抓住了明日香的手，不让她跑掉，女孩回头瞪了他一眼。

"Today's lunch will be spent with just you and me Asuka" Shinji explained after seeing her look.  
"今天午餐时间就只有你和我，明日香。" 真嗣解释道，看到她的表情后。

"Why did I agree to be your slave…?" Asuka mumbled, clearly regretting her decision.  
"我为什么要答应做你的奴隶…？" 明日香喃喃自语，显然对自己的决定感到后悔。

"Beats me Asuka, but I'll sure make use of your promise while I can. We should go tell the others we won't be with them this lunch" Shinji replied.  
"我也不知道，明日香，但我会充分利用你的承诺。我们应该去告诉其他人，这顿午饭我们不和他们一起了。" 真嗣回答道。

"Asshole" the redhead murmured before going over to Hikari.  
"混蛋。" 红发少女低声骂了一句，然后走向了光。

Shinji then moved over to his friends and told them both that he would not be with them at lunch as he was going to discuss something with the teacher. They both asked why he had a band aid on his face and he just explained that it was from an accident in the kitchen. After explaining it all to them, his two friends moved off and Shinji turned around to see if Asuka was ready. Seeing Hikari walking away from the redhead, he then motioned to Asuka for her to follow him; the girl had no choice but to comply. Shinji led Asuka back to the old storeroom they had used before. He took a quick look to see if anyone was around before entering the storeroom. After Asuka got inside, he closed and locked the door before moving over to the redhead.  
真嗣随后走向他的朋友们，告诉他们他午餐时间不会和他们在一起，因为他要和老师讨论一些事情。他们俩都问他脸上为什么贴着创可贴，他只是解释说那是厨房事故造成的。向他们解释完一切后，他的两个朋友离开了，真嗣转过身来，看看明日香是否准备好了。看到光子从红发女孩身边走开，他向明日香示意让她跟着他；女孩别无选择，只能服从。真嗣带着明日香回到了他们以前用过的旧储藏室。他迅速环顾四周，确认没有人后才进入储藏室。明日香进去后，他关上门并锁好，然后走向红发女孩。

"Now just relax and enjoy this Asuka, there's no need to be so edgy" Shinji told her after seeing her anxious face.  
“现在放松点，享受就好，明日香，没必要这么紧张。”看到她焦虑的表情后，真嗣对她说。

"Well, there must have been a reason you wanted me to be your slave today and I just don't know what you're going to do to me, of course I'm worried" Asuka retorted.  
“好吧，你今天肯定有理由要我做你的奴隶，而我只是不知道你会对我做什么，我当然会担心。”明日香反驳道。

Shinji smirked a little at her response. "There isn't enough time during lunch for me to try anything grand" he replied.  
真嗣对她的话微微一笑。“午餐时间太短，我可没机会做什么大动作。”他回答道。

"That's true" she said, sighing in relief.  
“确实如此。”她松了口气，叹道。

This time, the boy chuckled before reaching under her skirt with his hand. Slipping his hand into her panties, Shinji then began to rub the girl's pussy. Asuka instantly tensed up and grabbed his arm, glancing up at him with a vexed look.  
这次，男孩轻笑一声，伸手探入她的裙下。他的手滑进她的内裤，开始揉搓女孩的阴部。明日香立刻紧张起来，抓住他的手臂，抬头看他，一脸恼怒。

"I don't want my panties to get wet…" the redhead said, sounding a little embarrassed, "Take them off first" she added quietly.  
"我不想让我的内裤湿掉……" 红发女孩有些害羞地说道，"先把它们脱掉吧" 她轻声补充道。

Shinji found her request to be quite cute and went ahead and removed her white undergarment before pocketing it. He then returned to his playful stimulation of her crotch and the girl moaned softly. The boy slowly backed her up against the wall and thrust his fingers into her.  
真嗣觉得她的请求相当可爱，便照做了，脱下她的白色内衣并将其放入口袋。随后，他回到她两腿间调皮的挑逗，女孩轻轻地呻吟着。男孩慢慢地将她逼到墙边，手指探入其中。

"What… are you going to do?" Asuka asked between moans.  
"你……打算做什么？" 明日香在呻吟间问道。

"No questions allowed slave and I think it's high time you started calling me master" Shinji replied teasingly, moving off of her for the moment.  
"不许提问，奴隶，我想你该开始叫我主人了" 真嗣戏谑地回答，暂时从她身上移开。

"No way!" Asuka refuted. "不可能！" 明日香反驳道。

"That should have been 'no way _master._' Say 'sorry master' right now!" Shinji instructed.  
"那应该是‘不可能，主人。’现在就说‘对不起，主人！’" 真嗣命令道。

Ironically enough, these two words were probably the most difficult words for Asuka to say and she had to say them _together_.  
讽刺的是，这两个词可能是明日香最难说出口的，而且她必须同时说出来。

"Sorry… master" she finally said; it had been extremely arduous for the redhead to vocalise those words.  
“对不起……主人”她终于说道；对于这位红发女孩来说，发出这些词极其艰难。

Shinji felt his cock twitch when he heard that; he couldn't believe how arousing Asuka could be. Though he would have liked to have a little more fun, he knew there wasn't much time left and thus decided to get straight to it.  
听到这话，真嗣感到自己的下体一颤；他无法相信明日香竟能如此撩人。虽然他本想再多玩一会儿，但他知道时间不多了，于是决定直接进入正题。

"Open your legs!" he ordered.  
"张开腿！" 他命令道。

The redhead did so reluctantly, exposing her to attack. Shinji then picked her up and wrapped her legs around his waist such that she was resting on his hips. The boy pushed his cock up her vagina, already wet from his previous actions, and the girl could do nothing to stop it. Asuka reasoned that if she was going to have sex she might as well enjoy it and cried out in pleasure with each thrust. Shinji continued to shove himself inside her and the redhead held onto him tightly even though she was backed up against the wall. Asuka's erotic noises stirred up the boy, every single time she produced one.  
红发女孩不情愿地照做了，将自己暴露在攻击之下。真嗣随即抱起她，让她双腿环绕在他的腰间，就这样靠在他的臀部上。男孩将他的阴茎插入她已经因先前行为而湿润的阴道，女孩无力阻止。明日香心想既然要做爱，不如好好享受，于是随着每一次的挺进，她都发出愉悦的叫声。真嗣继续深入她体内，红发女孩紧紧抱住他，尽管她背靠着墙。明日香发出的每一声色情呻吟都让男孩更加兴奋。

"God, I love all those noises you make" Shinji announced.  
"天啊，我喜欢你发出的所有声音。" 真嗣宣布道。

"You pervert" Asuka managed to reply with.  
“你这个变态。”明日香勉强回了一句。

"I didn't tell you to stop though!" he said quickly.  
“我可没让你停下来！”他迅速说道。

To emphasise his point, Shinji began to pound even harder into her, only increasing her moans. Truth be told, he rather preferred just making her feel good; he wasn't actually planning to have any sort of repeat of yesterday's actions. But he did enjoy keeping her submissive at the moment, besides "master" had a nice ring to it.  
为了强调他的观点，真嗣开始更加用力地撞击她，这让她的呻吟声愈发高涨。说实话，他更喜欢只是让她感觉良好；他并没有打算重复昨天的事情。但他确实享受此刻让她保持顺从的感觉，而且“主人”这个词听起来也不错。

"Damn this feels so GOOD!" Asuka cried out erotically, "I'm already really close Shinji!"  
“该死，这感觉太棒了！”明日香色情地喊道，“我已经很接近了，真嗣！”

At her announcement the boy burst inside her, unable to hold himself back any longer. Asuka soon followed and orgasmed intensely, digging her nails into his back and biting him hard on the shoulder. Shinji didn't flinch at all but instead just continued to thrust into her till she came down from her orgasm. The boy then let down her legs and leant on the wall, exhausted from the exertion. The redhead herself was also leaning back on the wall, trapped between Shinji's two arms, perspiration covering both of them.  
听到她的宣告，男孩在她体内爆发，再也无法自控。明日香紧随其后，强烈地达到了高潮，用指甲深深扎进他的背，用力咬住他的肩膀。真嗣丝毫未动，反而继续在她体内冲刺，直到她从高潮中平复。随后，男孩放下她的双腿，靠在墙上，因用力过度而疲惫不堪。红发女孩自己也靠在墙上，被真嗣的双臂困住，两人都汗流浃背。

Finally, the pain in Shinji's shoulder kicked in and he instinctively relieved the pressure on his shoulder by retracting his arm. Unfortunately, he did it too quickly and found himself colliding into the unsuspecting girl.  
最终，真嗣肩膀的疼痛袭来，他本能地通过收回手臂来缓解压力。不幸的是，他动作太快，发现自己撞上了毫无防备的女孩。

"Ouch Shinji, what are you doing?" Asuka asked, annoyed.  
"哎哟，真嗣，你在干什么？" 明日香不悦地问道。

"It's actually your fault for becoming a vampire" he retorted, trying to sound serious.  
"其实变成吸血鬼是你的错" 他反驳道，试图显得严肃。

"What the hell are you talking about?!" Asuka replied, completely baffled by his accusation.  
"你到底在说什么鬼话？！" 明日香完全被他的指控搞糊涂了。

"Well, you seem to be sucking my blood" he answered.  
"嗯，你似乎在吸我的血" 他回答道。

The redhead suddenly felt the taste of blood in her mouth and she looked over at his body and noticed his shoulder was bleeding. Asuka was a little shocked as she had not intended to bite him at all; thankfully, it wasn't a serious wound.  
红发女孩突然感觉到嘴里有血的味道，她转头看向他的身体，注意到他的肩膀在流血。明日香有些震惊，因为她完全没有打算咬他；幸运的是，这并不是严重的伤口。

"I'm sorry Shinji" she replied, truly apologetic for having bitten him involuntarily.  
"对不起，真嗣" 她回答道，真心为无意中咬了他而道歉。

The boy found her apology quite surprising, almost thinking there was an ulterior motive.  
男孩对她的道歉感到相当意外，几乎以为她别有用心。

"Why are you behaving submissive all of a sudden?" Shinji asked curiously.  
“为什么你突然变得这么顺从？”真嗣好奇地问。

"Hey! _You're_ the one who wanted me to be your slave!" she retorted snidely.  
“嘿！是你自己要我当你奴隶的！”她尖刻地反驳道。

"But it's so much more fun when you resist" he joked.  
"但当你反抗时，乐趣可就大得多了" 他打趣道。

The redhead sighed. "Shinji…" she started.  
红发女孩叹了口气。 "真嗣…" 她开口道。

"You keep referring to me by my first name! I've told you before, address me as 'master'," Shinji instructed immediately.  
"你总是用我的名字称呼我！我之前就告诉过你，要称呼我为'主人'，" 真嗣立刻纠正道。

"_Master_" she said dryly. "I wish for you to stop making me call you master"  
"主人"她干巴巴地说道。"我希望你别再让我叫你主人了"

"But I _am_ your master today" he replied teasingly.  
"但今天我是你的主人"他打趣地回答。

"Honestly Shinji, you're asking to get injured" Asuka warned.  
"说真的，真嗣，你这是在找打"明日香警告道。

"You already _have_ injured me, you keep talking back to me and called me by my first name again, your disobedience will be punished" the boy said, smiling.  
"你已经伤害了我，你还一直顶嘴，又直呼我的名字，你的不服从将会受到惩罚" 男孩笑着说。

The redhead just groaned, wondering what she had gotten herself into this time. Shinji couldn't help but find Asuka's aggravation to be quite adorable and thus went ahead and kissed her. After parting from the girl, the boy noticed that Asuka was quite hesitant to speak now; he assumed she was afraid he was going to ask something embarrassing of her. He wondered how she was dealing with the situation and momentarily questioned if he should continue; it wasn't like he wanted her to actually suffer.  
红发女孩只是呻吟了一声，不知道这次自己又陷入了什么麻烦。真嗣忍不住觉得明日香的烦恼相当可爱，于是上前吻了她。分开后，男孩注意到明日香现在相当犹豫要不要说话；他猜想她可能是害怕他会问一些尴尬的问题。他好奇她是怎么应对这种情况的，一时之间怀疑自己是否应该继续；他并不想让她真的受苦。

"It's not that bad is it Asuka?" he asked her, trying to see how she was coping.  
"没那么糟糕吧，明日香？" 他问她，试图了解她的感受。

"Not so bad is it?! You're taking advantage of me and making all those pompous remarks" she burst out. "But don't worry, I'll keep my word. Though I will NEVER call you master again after today"  
"还不算太糟吧？！你占我便宜，还满口大话" 她突然爆发。"不过别担心，我会遵守承诺。但今天之后，我绝不会再叫你主人了"

"I didn't think you would ever call me master regardless" Shinji replied teasingly. It seemed the redhead wasn't in any anguish. "So… about your punishment, you aren't to wear any underwear for the rest of the day, including your bra"  
"我本来就没指望你会再叫我主人" 真嗣打趣地回答。看来红发女孩并没有任何痛苦。"那么…关于你的惩罚，今天剩下的时间里，你不许穿任何内衣，包括胸罩"

"You can't ask that of me! Are you crazy?!" she shouted at him in disbelief.  
"你不能这样要求我！你疯了吗？！" 她难以置信地对他大喊。

"Well, I suppose it is a bit much. I'll let you keep your bra on, but your panties stay in my pocket" he compromised.  
"嗯，我想这有点过分了。我会让你保留胸罩，但你的内裤得留在我口袋里" 他妥协道。

"Just fabulous" she said sarcastically.  
"真是棒极了" 她讽刺地说道。

In response to her comment, the boy nuzzled her neck lovingly while his hand stroked her hair. Shinji brought his lips down to hers and the two kissed fervently. Asuka brought her arm around his waist and pulled him closer to her while she continued to kiss him deeply.  
对于她的评论，男孩爱怜地蹭了蹭她的脖子，同时手轻抚着她的头发。真嗣将嘴唇贴近她的，两人热烈地亲吻。明日香伸出胳膊环住他的腰，将他拉得更近，继续深情地吻着他。

"We should start heading back to class" Shinji said after parting.  
"我们该回教室了" 真嗣在分别后说道。

The girl stood back and pulled down her skirt as far as it could go; making sure it covered her exposed region well.  
女孩退后一步，尽可能地拉下裙子；确保它很好地遮住了暴露的部位。

"You know I can't actually tell you're not wearing them" Shinji observed.  
"你知道我其实看不出你没穿它们" 真嗣观察道。

"Yeah? What if the wind blows up my skirt? What if some pervert looks under my skirt or trips me over?" Asuka listed.  
"是吗？万一风吹起我的裙子怎么办？万一哪个变态偷看我的裙底或者绊倒我呢？" 明日香列举道。

"Are you kidding Asuka? I don't think anyone would ever dare to do that to _you_. Besides I'll be with you just to make sure" he reassured.  
"你在开玩笑吧，明日香？我觉得没人敢对你这么做。再说了，我会陪着你，确保一切安全。" 他安慰道。

"I feel _so_ much better now" she replied sarcastically.  
"我现在感觉好多了" 她讽刺地回答。

Shinji then remembered his shoulder had bled and that some of the blood had gotten on his shirt. Taking this into account, he decided he needed to clean himself up at the restroom before going back to class.  
这时，真嗣想起了自己的肩膀曾流血，有些血迹沾到了衬衫上。考虑到这一点，他决定在回教室前先去洗手间清理一下。

"Ok Asuka, I have to make a quick trip to the toilets to clean off this blood. Do you want to go back to the classroom yourself or come with me?" Shinji asked the redhead.  
“好吧，明日香，我得赶紧去洗手间清洗一下这些血迹。你是自己回教室还是跟我一起去？”真嗣问红发女孩。

"I don't have a choice at the moment, I am not walking around alone without any underwear" Asuka replied.  
“我现在别无选择，没穿内裤我可不会一个人到处走。”明日香回答道。

"Then let's go" Shinji replied back.  
"那我们走吧" 真嗣回答道。

Thus, the two eva pilots exited the storeroom and began their trek to the male toilets. Asuka felt awkward walking around without her underwear and she subconsciously kept her legs closer together while walking. The two teens reached a pair of stairs and just as Shinji was about to start walking up, Asuka held him back.  
于是，两位 EVA 驾驶员离开了储藏室，开始向男厕所进发。明日香因为没有穿内裤而感到尴尬，她不自觉地走路时双腿靠得更近。两个少年到达了一对楼梯前，就在真嗣准备开始上楼时，明日香拉住了他。

"I-I gotta go first so that you can cover me from behind" the redhead said, embarrassed.  
"我-我得先去，这样你可以在后面帮我掩护" 红发少女尴尬地说。

The boy couldn't help a slight smile forming on his face and he stood still, letting his girlfriend go first. As Asuka walked up the stairs, Shinji looked up at her to see if she was rightly concerned and sure enough got a good view of her bare backside. The redhead turned around as she noticed Shinji wasn't next to her and caught him staring up her skirt.  
男孩忍不住嘴角微微上扬，他静静地站着，让女朋友先行。当明日香走上楼梯时，真嗣抬头看她是否真的担心，果然看到了她裸露的背部。红发女孩转身发现真嗣没有跟在她旁边，正好抓到他盯着她的裙子看。

"You are a total baka! The whole point of me going first was for you to cover me, what if someone came now?! You just don't think!" the girl yelled at Shinji, blushing whilst keeping her skirt down as much as she could.  
“你真是个大笨蛋！我先走是为了让你掩护我，万一现在有人来了怎么办？！你就是不动脑子！”女孩对真嗣大喊，脸红的同时尽量把裙子往下拉。

"Sorry, sorry" Shinji quickly replied, hurrying up the stairs to cover her from behind.  
“对不起，对不起。”真嗣迅速回答，急忙上楼从后面掩护她。

"And don't say sorry!" she shouted smacking him. It was clear that she was quite mad at the boy.  
"别再说对不起了！" 她喊道，拍了他一下。显然，她对那个男孩非常生气。

"I w-was just… I mean… I w-wasn't trying t-to-" Shinji stuttered.  
"我...我只是...我的意思是...我...不是故意要..." 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

The redhead sighed, calming herself down. "I am trusting you Shinji, please take this a little more seriously. I am only going through with this because of you, remember that" she said, looking at him in the eyes sternly.  
红发女孩叹了口气，平复了自己的情绪。"我相信你，真嗣，请认真一点对待这件事。我之所以这么做，完全是因为你，记住这一点" 她严肃地盯着他的眼睛说。

"I understand" Shinji replied sheepishly.  
“我明白了。”真嗣有些尴尬地回答。

"Good" the redhead replied back, before turning around and continuing up the stairs.  
“很好。”红发女孩回应道，随即转身继续上楼。

The boy followed closely behind, making sure that if anyone were to look up from the bottom of the steps, they would not be able to see under her skirt. Upon reaching the top of the stairs, the two eva pilots then head over to the male restroom. Asuka stood outside while Shinji went inside to wash off the blood as best he could. Leaning against the wall, the redhead waited impatiently for her boyfriend to finish.  
男孩紧随其后，确保如果有人从楼梯底部抬头看，也无法看到她的裙底。到达楼梯顶端后，两位 EVA 驾驶员走向男洗手间。明日香站在外面，而真嗣进去尽可能地清洗掉血迹。红发女孩靠在墙上，不耐烦地等待着她的男友。

In the quiet atmosphere of the school corridor, the sudden sound of a rumbling stomach was heard. Asuka found herself cursing her stupid roommate; she questioned why he had bothered making them bentos if they weren't going to have enough time to eat them and thus go hungry. Frustrated as she was, there simply wasn't enough time to satisfy her hunger and so she just continued to wait there impatiently, grumbling every now and then.  
在校园走廊的静谧氛围中，突然传来一阵咕噜咕噜的肚子叫声。明日香暗自咒骂她那愚蠢的室友；她不明白，既然他们没有足够的时间吃便当，为什么他还要费心准备，结果让他们饿肚子。尽管她感到沮丧，但确实没有足够的时间来填饱肚子，于是她只好不耐烦地继续等待，时不时地咕哝几句。

It didn't take too long for Shinji to finish up and sure enough, the door to the male restroom opened with the boy walking out.  
没过多久，真嗣就结束了，果然，男厕所的门打开了，男孩走了出来。

"Sorry for taking so long Asuka but the blood had dried a bit, making it take a little effort to wash out" he explained. "Can you still see it?" he asked.  
“抱歉让你们等了这么久，明日香，但血迹有点干，花了点力气才洗掉。”他解释道。“你还能看到吗？”他问道。

The girl moved over to the boy to check out his shirt and determined that there wasn't anything noticeable anymore. "Yeah, it's fine now" she answered.  
女孩走近男孩，检查他的衬衫，确定已经没有什么显眼的地方了。“嗯，现在没事了。”她回答道。

"Well I guess we should get back to class then, the bell is about to ring" Shinji replied.  
“好吧，我想我们该回教室了，铃声马上就要响了。”真嗣回答说。

"Yeah and thanks to that, we didn't get to eat our lunches" Asuka complained whilst glaring at Shinji, making sure he knew it was his fault.  
“是啊，都怪这个，我们都没能吃上午饭。”明日香抱怨着，同时瞪着真嗣，确保他知道这是他的错。

"We can always eat them at home. Besides, I satisfied a far more important 'hunger'," he joked.  
"我们回家再吃也行。再说了，我满足了一个更重要的‘饥饿’。"他开玩笑道。

"You're always so full of it!" Asuka spat, before turning around, throwing her hands up in the air and walking away.  
"你总是这么满嘴跑火车！"明日香啐了一口，然后转过身，双手一挥，气呼呼地走开了。

Shinji followed after his girlfriend and they made their way back to their classroom. Unfortunately for Asuka, a small crack on the floor, coupled with the awkward way she was walking, caused her to trip and lose her balance, falling backward. Instinctively, she grabbed onto the closest object nearby, which happened to be Shinji, and pulled both of them to the floor. The redhead landed on her ass, while Shinji fell on top of the girl, having been pulled by his arm, and banged his head against hers, the sharp pain from the collision felt by both of them. To prevent himself from crushing the girl, the boy had braced himself with his hands on either side of the girl, though one hand now clutched his head in pain. The two opened their eyes after a few seconds and realised how close they were; their faces were only inches apart.  
真嗣跟在女友身后，两人一起返回教室。不幸的是，明日香走路姿势别扭，加上地板上的一道小裂缝，让她绊了一下，失去平衡向后倒去。她本能地抓住了身边最近的东西，恰好是真嗣，结果两人一起摔倒在地。明日香一屁股坐在地上，而真嗣被她拽着胳膊，压在她身上，两人的头还撞在了一起，剧烈的疼痛让双方都皱起了眉头。为了避免压到明日香，真嗣用双手撑在她两侧，但其中一只手因为疼痛而捂住了头。几秒钟后，两人睁开眼睛，意识到彼此靠得有多近；他们的脸相距不过几英寸。

"Just what are you two doing? It's almost class time" a voice called out to the two.  
“你们俩在干什么呢？快上课了。”一个声音向两人喊道。

The two eva pilots turned their heads to see Hikari and they both blushed when they realised their position; Asuka had her legs sprawled on the floor, with Shinji on top of her, his hand bracing himself on the floor and their faces so close it might have looked like they were about to kiss. The redhead was thankful that she had pulled Shinji down with her though, otherwise her bare nether region would have been exposed to the world.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员转过头，看到光，两人都脸红了，意识到他们的姿势；明日香双腿张开躺在地上，真嗣压在她身上，手撑着地板，他们的脸靠得如此之近，看起来就像是要接吻一样。红发女孩庆幸自己把真嗣拉了下来，否则她的私处就会暴露在众人面前了。

"Oh, hey Hikari, I just accidentally tripped is all" Asuka replied, shoving Shinji off her and quickly standing up, making sure she could not see underneath her skirt.  
“哦，嘿，光，我只是不小心绊倒了而已。”明日香回答道，把真嗣推开，迅速站起来，确保别人看不到她的裙底。

Unfortunately, Shinji had stood up and held his hand out to help her up at the same time and as she stood up quickly, the boy momentarily made contact with the redhead's chest. Asuka, however, only pushed his hand away in response. Hikari didn't fail to notice the lack of reaction on the redhead's part.  
不幸的是，真嗣站了起来，同时伸出手想帮她起身，而她迅速站起来时，男孩短暂地碰到了红发女孩的胸部。然而，明日香只是推开了他的手作为回应。光并没有错过红发女孩那缺乏反应的一幕。

"So, what were you two doing during lunch together?" Hikari asked, looking at the two suspiciously.  
“那么，你们俩午饭时在一起做什么呢？”光怀疑地看着两人问道。

"What are you implying Hikari? We just bumped into each other while on our way back to class, I have no idea what this baka was doing during lunch" Asuka answered.  
“你这是什么意思，光？我们只是在回教室的路上偶然相遇，我根本不知道这个笨蛋午饭时在做什么。”明日香回答道。

"S-She's right" Shinji agreed nervously.  
"她说的没错" 真嗣紧张地同意道。

"I see, I guess that makes sense" the ponytailed girl replied. Hikari then looked over at the boy who was timidly staring down at his feet. "Though considering how I found you two, I'm glad to see that Shinji over here is still alive" Hikari teased.  
"我明白了，这么说也有道理" 马尾辫女孩回答。光随后看向那个怯生生盯着脚下的男孩。"不过考虑到我找到你们俩的情况，我很高兴看到真嗣这家伙还活着" 光调侃道。

"Well, it was an accident, I mean… I wouldn't kill him for my mistake. This baka wasn't trying to touch my breast-I mean um… it's no big deal" the redhead replied awkwardly; she didn't know why she was stumbling over her words so much.  
"嗯，这是个意外，我的意思是……我不会因为我的错误杀了他。这个笨蛋不是故意要摸我的胸部——我是说，呃……没什么大不了的" 红发女孩尴尬地回答；她不知道为什么自己说话这么结巴。

The class rep giggled at her friend's response. "Also, how did you hurt yourself Shinji? That wound on your face is recent right?" Hikari asked with a hint of concern, pointing to the band aid.  
班长被朋友的回答逗笑了。“还有，你怎么受伤的，真嗣？你脸上的伤口是最近才有的吧？”光子带着一丝关切问道，指着创可贴。

"Oh, it was just an accident in the kitchen, nothing serious" he answered.  
“哦，那只是厨房里的小意外，没什么大不了的。”他回答道。

"Good to hear that it's nothing serious" Hikari replied, before urging the two eva pilots over. "Come on then, enough standing around already, we need to get to class" she ordered.  
“听到没什么大碍就好。”光子回应道，随后催促两位 EVA 驾驶员过来。“好了，别再站着了，我们得去上课了。”她命令道。

Sure enough, the bell rang as soon as the brown-haired girl had finished her sentence. Both Shinji and Asuka followed the other girl back to their classroom and went to their seats. As soon as the redhead sat down on her seat, she instantly jumped back up.  
果然，棕发女孩话音刚落，铃声就响了起来。真嗣和明日香跟着另一个女孩回到教室，各自坐到座位上。红发女孩一坐下，立刻又跳了起来。

"Aiiiee!" she called out.  
“哎呀！”她惊叫道。

The sudden cry caught everyone's attention and the entire class looked at the girl questioningly. Asuka cursed herself for her own stupidity and quickly thought of an excuse.  
这突如其来的叫声吸引了所有人的注意，全班同学都疑惑地看向她。明日香暗骂自己的愚蠢，急忙想找个借口。

"There was a… thumbtack on my seat" she lied, giving everyone a glare.  
“我的座位上有……一个图钉。”她撒谎道，向众人投去愤怒的目光。

Soon they all turned away from Asuka and she made sure to slowly sit down this time; she wasn't wearing any underwear and plopping down on her cold seat had been quite unpleasant.  
很快，他们都转过身去，不再看明日香。这次她小心翼翼地坐下，确保动作缓慢；她没穿内裤，猛地坐在冰冷的座位上实在很不舒服。

_'Damn that baka Shinji, I have to sit down on this stupid seat with nothing on'_ the girl thought angrily. Despite all the torment she had received from the boy, her body would still get excited when she thought about what he would do next. Surmising that he still hadn't done what he had planned ever since the bet, the redhead was also a little apprehensive about what was going to happen. _'I just hope it's not too degrading this time'_  
“该死的笨蛋真嗣，我得光着屁股坐在这破座位上。”女孩气愤地想。尽管遭受了男孩的种种折磨，但每当想到他接下来会做什么，她的身体还是会感到兴奋。红发女孩推测，自从那次打赌以来，他还没有实施他的计划，这让她对即将发生的事情也有些忐忑。“我只希望这次不要太羞辱人。”

Asuka's deliberations were soon interrupted by the teacher walking into the classroom and Hikari did her routine "Rise! Bow! Sit!" before the class began. The teacher then commenced his lecture on… the Second Impact again. This time, however, the teacher turned around to write on the blackboard while he was talking.  
明日香的心思很快被走进教室的老师打断，光莉照常在课前执行了“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”的流程。随后，老师开始讲授……又是第二次冲击。不过这次，老师边讲边转过身去在黑板上写字。

_'I'm beginning to suspect that NERV is paying this old geezer to keep talking about this rubbish'_ the redhead thought, irritated.  
“我开始怀疑 NERV 是不是在付钱给这老头，让他一直讲这些废话。”红发少女心烦意乱地想。

Added to the boredom of the teacher's harangue, the frustration of sitting down without any underwear, especially when she was still hot from the activities during lunch, was driving Asuka crazy. It seemed the conditions had awakened a strong desire and she wanted nothing more than for Shinji to pull her out of this dull class and make love to her endlessly. Her conflicting thoughts were soon distracted when a message came up on her laptop.  
除了老师冗长乏味的讲课，没有穿内衣坐着的不适感，尤其是在午餐活动后仍感燥热的情况下，让明日香几近疯狂。似乎这些条件唤醒了她强烈的欲望，她现在只想让真嗣把她从这无聊的课堂中拉出去，无休止地与她缠绵。当笔记本上弹出一条消息时，她矛盾的思绪很快被分散了注意力。

_**Shinji: Was that jump at the beginning of the class really because of a thumbtack?  
真嗣：上课开始时的那次跳跃真的是因为图钉吗？**_

The redhead looked at the object of her distress with a glare before typing a reply.  
红发女孩瞪了一眼让她困扰的物品，然后开始打字回复。

_**Asuka: You should know, considering that YOU were the one who told me not to wear any panties. Do you know how uncomfortable it is sitting on this freezing cold seat?  
明日香：你应该知道，毕竟是你告诉我不要穿内裤的。你知道坐在这冰冷的座位上有多不舒服吗？**_

_**Shinji: Sorry about that, the thought never crossed my mind. Want me to warm you up ;)?  
真嗣：抱歉，我没想到这一点。需要我帮你暖暖吗 ;)？**_

_**Asuka: You know, right now I wouldn't mind.  
明日香：你知道吗，现在我倒是不介意。**_

Asuka shifted uncomfortably in her chair before typing her next message.  
明日香在椅子上不安地挪动了一下，然后开始输入她的下一条消息。

_**Asuka: God damn it, one look under my desk and it's any boy's dream.  
明日香：该死的，只要看一眼我的桌子底下，简直就是每个男孩的梦想。**_

_**Shinji: Just pray no boy is perverted enough today to try to look at your panties.  
真嗣：祈祷今天没有哪个男孩变态到想偷看你的内裤吧。**_

_**Asuka: Good luck. 明日香：祝你好运。**_

_**Shinji: You discredit your ability to cast fear on every male in this room.  
真嗣：你低估了自己让房间里每个男性都感到恐惧的能力。**_

_**Asuka: You're such a prick.  
明日香：你真是个混蛋。**_

_**Shinji: :P. 真嗣：:P。**_

The redhead shifted again before looking over at her roommate. The girl's eyes widened as from behind she could see a small sliver of her panties sticking out of his pocket. She quickly began typing a message to send to him before anyone could notice, but alas the jock sitting next to the boy had already noticed. Asuka cursed as Touji reached over and pulled the object out, revealing the pair of panties. Shinji, of course, had noticed something being pulled out of his pocket and turned to face Touji, instantly freezing. Many people had seen the jock procure the item from Shinji's pocket and were now looking at them both curiously.  
红发女孩再次挪动了一下，然后看向她的室友。女孩的眼睛睁大了，因为她从后面看到他口袋里露出了一小截内裤。她迅速开始打字准备发消息给他，以免被别人注意到，但遗憾的是，坐在男孩旁边的运动员已经注意到了。明日香暗骂一声，当东治伸手将那物品拽出，露出一双内裤时，真嗣当然注意到了口袋里有东西被取出，转头面对东治，立刻僵住了。许多人已经看到运动员从真嗣口袋里拿出了物品，现在都好奇地看着他们俩。

"What the hell are you doing?" Shinji whispered to Touji, blushing deeply.  
“你到底在干什么？”真嗣低声对东治说，脸红得厉害。

"Maybe I should be asking _you_ that" Touji answered.  
“或许我该问你才对”东治回答道。

_'Shit'_ Asuka thought. She racked her brain for a way to help the boy.  
'该死' 明日香心想。她绞尽脑汁想找个办法帮助那个男孩。

"Just give it back" Shinji quickly whispered.  
"快还回去" 真嗣迅速低声说道。

"I think I deserve an explanation first; I mean it's still warm. Was someone else wearing it?" Touji replied.  
"我觉得我应该先得到一个解释；我是说，它还是温的。难道有人刚穿过它吗？" 东治回答道。

The class was growing increasingly suspicious as more people noticed what was happening and looked to the male eva pilot expectantly. The redhead herself was just completely baffled as to how the teacher had not noticed anything yet and was still facing the blackboard; was he really that deaf? Taking a risk, Asuka quickly stood up and swiftly moved over to the two boys, grabbing the panties off Touji.  
随着越来越多的人注意到正在发生的事情并期待地看向那位男性 eva 驾驶员，班级里的怀疑情绪愈发浓厚。红发少女本人也完全困惑于老师为何至今还未察觉任何异样，他依旧背对着黑板；难道他真的那么聋吗？冒险一试，明日香迅速站起身，敏捷地走向两个男孩，从真嗣手中夺过内裤。

"Honestly you perverts, arguing over a pair of some poor girl's panties" the redhead said, sounding disgusted.  
“说真的，你们这些变态，为了一条可怜女孩的内裤争吵”，红发少女说道，语气中带着厌恶。

Shinji and Touji just looked up at the girl speechless and Asuka returned their look with an evil smile. She then handed her panties back to Shinji.  
真嗣和真希波只是无言地抬头看着女孩，明日香回以一个邪恶的微笑。随后，她将自己的内裤递还给了真嗣。

"You be sure to return those, before you get into trouble" Asuka continued, sneering.  
“你可得记得还回去，别惹上麻烦。”明日香继续嘲讽道。

Shinji hastily stuffed them back into his pocket, blushing profusely. "Thanks Asuka" he replied weakly.  
真嗣慌忙将它们塞回口袋，满脸通红。“谢谢你，明日香。”他虚弱地回应。

The redhead then returned to her seat and everything went back to normal as if nothing had happened. The teacher hadn't turned back around from the board till Asuka sat down, effectively missing the entire event that had passed by. Shinji could feel the eyes of everyone on him and he just held his head in his hands embarrassed; this would take a while to die down.  
红发少女随即回到自己的座位，一切恢复如常，仿佛什么都没发生过。老师直到明日香坐下才转过身来，完全错过了刚才发生的那一幕。真嗣感到所有人的目光都集中在他身上，他只能尴尬地用手捂住脸；这阵风波恐怕还要持续一段时间。

---

Eventually, the school bell rang and Shinji sighed in relief; he wanted nothing more than for the other students to stop looking at him. As his classmates exited the room, many of the girls cast awkward glances at the boy. _'Great'_ he thought, _'now everyone thinks that I'm a panty thief.'_  
终于，学校的铃声响起，真嗣松了一口气；他只希望其他同学不要再盯着他看。当同学们陆续离开教室时，许多女生都尴尬地瞥了男孩一眼。'太好了'他想，'现在大家都以为我是偷内衣贼了。'

Shinji then stood up and exited the classroom himself, however any chance to be left alone was soon lost as his two friends came up to him, their faces looking eager to ask him questions.  
随后，真嗣站起身来，自己也走出了教室，然而任何想要独处的机会很快都消失了，因为他的两个朋友走过来，脸上满是急切想要问问题的表情。

"And to think I was beginning to get worried about the redhead controlling you. I just knew you were a real boy Shin-man" Touji exclaimed.  
“我还以为那个红发女孩在控制你呢。我就知道你是个真正的男子汉，真-哥们”东治兴奋地说道。

"Please don't start with this" Shinji implored.  
“请别这样开始” 真嗣恳求道。

"I'm sorry Shinji, but having panties in your pocket is just too incriminating" Kensuke replied.  
“对不起，真嗣，但口袋里有内裤实在太可疑了” 肯斯克回答。

"Damn right. So, tell us how they got there" Touji demanded.  
“没错。那么，告诉我们它们是怎么到那儿的” 冬二追问道。

"It's really not important" Shinji said, trying to dissuade them.  
“这真的不重要” 真嗣说道，试图劝阻他们。

"You're not getting out of this Shinji, we won't let you go until you tell us" Touji replied, holding the boy in place.  
“你别想逃避，真嗣，不告诉我们你别想走” 冬二回答，把男孩固定住。

The male eva pilot quickly ran through his brain for possible excuses, but none really seemed believable. He honestly wanted to divulge the fact that it was due to a challenge between him and Asuka, but then they would know she wasn't wearing any panties. Shinji looked up at his two friends and saw them staring at him expectantly.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员迅速在脑海中搜寻可能的借口，但似乎没有一个听起来可信。他真心想透露这是因为他和明日香之间的挑战，但那样他们就会知道她没穿内裤。真嗣抬头看着他的两个朋友，看到他们正期待地盯着他。

"I err… was doing the laundry at home and… well…" he said pausing, trying to think of what to say next.  
"我...在家洗衣服的时候...呃..." 他停顿了一下，试图想出接下来该说什么。

"What, are you saying those are the demon's panties?" Touji said, recoiling a bit.  
"什么，你是说那些是恶魔的内裤吗？" 冬二说着，稍微后退了一点。

"No! They're Misato's!" Shinji blurted out before he could think about it.  
"不！是美里小姐的！" 真嗣脱口而出，没来得及多想。

Both his friend's eyes widened before the two grinned at him.  
他的朋友双眼都睁大了，随后两人对着他咧嘴一笑。

"Ah, if that's all it is, you need not say anymore. We both understand completely" Touji said, still grinning stupidly.  
“啊，如果只是这样，你就不必多说了。我们俩完全明白。” 冬二说道，依旧傻笑着。

Shinji was sure the jock had completely misunderstood everything.  
真嗣确信这位运动健将完全误解了一切。

"No, I was just doing the laundry and-" Shinji started quickly.  
“不，我只是在做洗衣和——” 真嗣急忙开口。

"Relax Shinji, you don't need to defend yourself in front of us, it's totally fine" Touji interrupted.  
“放松点，真嗣，在我们面前你不需要辩解，完全没问题的。” 冬二打断了他。

At this point Shinji gave up; they weren't even listening to him anymore.  
此时真嗣放弃了；他们甚至不再听他说话了。

"We both love Misato, so we fully understand the reason" Kensuke added. "Although I'm kinda annoyed, you're progressing with her and we aren't"  
"我们都爱美里，所以我们完全理解这个原因" 真希波补充道。"虽然我有点不爽，你和她进展顺利而我们却没有"

"Man, you're so lucky!" Touji said, smacking Shinji's back.  
"伙计，你真是太幸运了！" 东治说着，拍了拍真嗣的背。

Shinji just stayed quiet, hoping they would just leave if he didn't respond. For once the male eva pilot agreed with Asuka about the fact that his friends were idiots.  
真嗣只是保持沉默，希望如果他不回应，他们就会离开。这一次，男性 eva 驾驶员同意明日香的观点，他的朋友们确实是笨蛋。

"Can we borrow those panties from you?" Touji asked eagerly.  
"我们能借用一下你的内裤吗？" 冬二急切地问道。

"No way" Shinji replied instantly.  
"没门" 真嗣立刻回答道。

"Ah such a spoilsport, but I expected nothing less from you" Touji replied, somewhat disappointed.  
"啊，真是个扫兴的家伙，不过我对你也没抱太大期望" 冬二有些失望地回答。

"Come on Touji, let's leave the boy alone. I think he's had enough embarrassment for the moment" Kensuke suggested.  
"来吧，阿薰，我们别打扰这孩子了。我觉得他现在受的尴尬已经够多了。" 真希建议道。

"Yeah, I suppose you're right" the jock agreed. "Well, I guess we'll be taking our leave then now, have fun Shin-man"  
"是啊，我想你说的对" 这位运动员同意道。"那么，我想我们现在就告辞了，祝你玩得开心，真嗣君"

"See ya Shinji" Kensuke said, waving.  
"再见，真嗣" 真希挥手说道。

"By the way, steal us a pair too next time" Touji added before turning around and walking away with Kensuke down the corridor.  
“顺便说一句，下次也帮我们偷一双。” 真嗣在转身与健介沿着走廊离开前补充道。

Shinji just continued to stare at the ground silently, hoping that his friends would somehow forget about this incident forever. On the other hand, something told him that his dear redheaded girlfriend wouldn't ever live this down. As if he could predict the future, sure enough a loud snort could soon be heard followed by a certain girl rolling on the floor laughing with tears in her eyes.  
真嗣只是继续默默地盯着地面，希望他的朋友们能以某种方式永远忘记这一事件。另一方面，他有种预感，他那红发女友绝不会轻易放过这件事。仿佛他能预知未来一般，果然不久后便传来一声响亮的鼻息，紧接着是某个女孩在地上打滚大笑，泪流满面。

"I assume you heard everything" Shinji said, sighing at Asuka's behaviour.  
“我想你全听到了吧” 真嗣说道，对明日香的行为叹了口气。

"Oh, you bet" the redhead replied, standing up and wiping the tears from her eyes.  
"哦，当然" 红发女孩回答道，站起身来擦去眼角的泪水。

"I don't wanna hear it, so stop before you even start" Shinji said quickly.  
"我不想听，所以你还没开始就别说了" 真嗣迅速说道。

"Aww, you ruin all my fun" Asuka teased.  
"哎呀，你毁了我所有的乐趣" 明日香打趣道。

"As if you haven't had enough fun already" Shinji remarked.  
“好像你还没玩够似的。” 真嗣评论道。

"Oh, definitely not" the redhead replied seductively.  
“哦，绝对没够。” 红发女孩挑逗地回答。

The boy looked at her for a second, wondering if she was serious. "Are you sure? We're still in school. It's also not a good time to use the old storeroom, what with the janitor cleaning now" Shinji explained.  
男孩看了她一会儿，怀疑她是否认真。“你确定吗？我们还在学校呢。而且现在也不是用旧储藏室的好时机，毕竟清洁工正在打扫。” 真嗣解释道。

"I have the best place in mind" Asuka started. "No one would ever check the female toilets and with all the students gone, it'll be perfect" she suggested.  
"我有个绝佳的地方" 明日香开口道。"没人会去检查女厕所，而且学生们都走了，那里再合适不过了" 她提议说。

"Not a bad idea, I'm always up for some fun" Shinji replied, smirking.  
"不错的点子，我总是喜欢找点乐子" 真嗣回答，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

"Then what are you waiting for, let's go" the redhead prompted, before turning around and walking towards the female toilets.  
"那你还等什么，走吧" 红发女孩催促道，随即转身向女厕所走去。

The boy followed Asuka to the lady's restroom and the two of them looked around before entering inside and dropping their bags on the floor.  
男孩跟着明日香来到了女洗手间，两人环顾四周后才走进去，把包扔在地上。

"By the way, I wanted to say thanks for saving my ass back there Asuka" Shinji told her.  
“对了，我想谢谢你刚才救了我。”真嗣对她说。

"No problem, it was kinda my ass too anyways" the girl replied.  
“没事，反正也算是我的屁股。”女孩回答道。

Shinji then grabbed his girlfriend and opened one of the cubicles before pushing her up against the cubicle wall and closing the door behind him.  
真嗣随即抓住他的女朋友，打开了一个隔间，将她推到隔间墙上，然后关上了身后的门。

"Oh, you're going to fuck me next to a toilet, how charming" Asuka teased.  
“哦，你要在厕所旁边干我，真是有情调。”明日香打趣道。

The male eva pilot reached down and stimulated her bare pussy with his hand in response. "It seems like your wet cunt doesn't care" the boy said, smirking.  
男性 eva 驾驶员伸手下去，用手指刺激她赤裸的下体作为回应。“看来你湿透的小穴并不介意。”男孩说着，嘴角上扬。

Asuka moaned at the contact. "Well, that's because anything's better than sitting down on that fucking seat without underwear" Asuka replied.  
明日香因接触而呻吟。“那是因为，比起不穿内裤坐在那个该死的座位上，什么都好”明日香回答道。

This time Shinji inserted his fingers, causing Asuka to cry out in pleasure and open her legs to give him more access. "You should be more honest Asuka, just like your body is" he teased. "What is the real reason your pussy is wet?"  
这次真嗣插入手指，让明日香因快感而叫出声，并张开双腿给他更多空间。“你应该更坦诚些，明日香，就像你的身体一样”他逗弄道。“你下面湿漉漉的真正原因是什么？”

"Because you get me all excited, you creep" Asuka answered, blushing.  
“因为你让我兴奋得不得了，你这个变态”明日香回答，脸颊泛红。

"Why thank you" Shinji replied, grinning.  
“哎呀，谢谢你。” 真嗣回答道，咧嘴笑着。

The boy then kissed the redhead on the lips and undid the ribbon around her collar, before unbuttoning her shirt. After her shirt was open, Shinji fondled her breasts, making sure to generously rub her erect nipples as well. Asuka could to nothing against his onslaught as she continuously moaned at his actions.  
男孩随即吻了红发女孩的唇，解开了她领口的丝带，然后解开她的衬衫扣子。衬衫敞开后，真嗣抚摸着她的胸部，特意用力揉搓她挺立的乳头。明日香在他的攻势下毫无反抗之力，只能不断地因他的动作而呻吟。

"God you are so sexy you know that?" Shinji asked while pulling down his pants.  
“天啊，你真是性感极了，知道吗？” 真嗣边问边脱下裤子。

"You say this as if it's not common knowledge" the redhead remarked, her eyes looking at him cheekily.  
"你这么说好像这不是常识似的" 红发女孩打趣道，眼神调皮地看着他。

"Your modesty always amazes me" the brown-haired boy commented, just as mischievously.  
"你的谦虚总是让我惊叹" 棕发男孩同样调皮地评论道。

Asuka was growing a little impatient at his delaying. "Just shut up and stop procrastinating already, can't you just get on-! Ah God yeah!" Asuka started before being interrupted by Shinji's cock being shoved up her wet pussy.  
明日香对他的拖延越来越不耐烦。"快闭嘴别再拖延了，你就不能直接开始吗！啊天哪，对！" 明日香话还没说完，就被真嗣的肉棒猛地插进了她湿润的小穴。

The boy grunted as he thrust in and out of her and the redhead wrapped her arms around him, keeping him close. Shinji kept his head in her chest, pleasantly stimulating her breasts with his mouth, while his hands were holding her ass, using it as leverage. Asuka could barely contain her cries and moans as the two made love.  
男孩哼了一声，在她体内进进出出，红发女孩则用双臂环绕着他，紧紧抱住。真嗣将头埋在她的胸前，用嘴愉悦地刺激着她的乳房，而他的双手则托着她的臀部，以此为支点。明日香几乎无法抑制自己的呻吟和呼喊，两人沉浸在爱的交融中。

Just as Shinji planted a kiss on his girlfriend's lips, the door to the toilets opened.  
就在真嗣吻上女友的唇时，洗手间的门突然打开了。

"Asuka, are you in here?" a female voice asked.  
“明日香，你在这里吗？”一个女声问道。

Shinji immediately stopped thrusting into the girl, almost falling over. He then looked at the girl questioningly, to which she just shrugged her shoulders and shook her head in response. The two stayed silent and still, hoping the person would go away. However, they soon heard footsteps as the person walked over to their cubicle. Panicking, Asuka quickly applied the lock, thinking the person was going to open their door.  
真嗣立刻停止了对女孩的推进，差点摔倒。他疑惑地看向女孩，而她只是耸了耸肩，摇了摇头作为回应。两人保持沉默和静止，希望那个人会离开。然而，他们很快听到了脚步声，那个人正走向他们的隔间。慌乱中，明日香迅速上了锁，以为那人会打开他们的门。

The person then halted. "Asuka, is that you?" the voice asked, which the two now recognised as Hikari's.  
那人随即停下脚步。“明日香，是你吗？”声音问道，两人现在认出这是光的声音。

Now that Hikari knew someone was inside, the redhead had to respond and she would then know it was her so she had no choice but to reveal that she was there.  
既然光已经知道里面有人，红发女孩不得不回应，她也会知道是明日香，所以她别无选择，只能透露自己在那里。

"Yeah it's me, is something wrong Hikari?" Asuka asked trying her best to sound calm; her awkward position added with Shinji still inside her made it difficult to speak normally.  
“是我是我，光，有什么事吗？”明日香尽力保持平静的语气问道；她尴尬的姿势加上真嗣还在她体内，让她很难正常说话。

"I just wanted to talk to you about something, but you rushed out of the classroom before I could get to you. I looked outside to see if you had left, but I couldn't find you so I went back inside to check if you came here" Hikari explained. "Are you finished yet?" she asked.  
“我只是想和你谈点事，但你匆匆离开了教室，我还没来得及追上你。我往外看了看，想找你是不是走了，但没找到，就回教室看看你是不是来了这里。”光解释道。“你结束了吗？”她问。

"Not yet, I still need… a few minutes" Asuka answered.  
“还没，我还需要……几分钟。”明日香回答。

"Ah ok, I'll wait outside then" Hikari replied.  
“啊，好的，那我在外面等。”光回答道。

The two eva pilots listened quietly as they heard Hikari walking off, followed by the door closing and then silence. At the sound of the door closing, Shinji quickly turned to face the girl.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员静静地听着，听到光离开的脚步声，随后是门关闭的声音，接着是一片寂静。听到门关闭的声音，真嗣迅速转向面对女孩。

"What do we do?" he asked Asuka.  
“我们该怎么办？”他问明日香。

"Fuck I don't know, why are you asking me?!" Asuka whispered angrily.  
"该死，我不知道，你干嘛问我？！" 明日香愤怒地低声说道。

"You're the girl here, I obviously can't leave the toilet with her outside" Shinji whispered back.  
"你是女生，我显然不能在她在外面的时候离开厕所" 真嗣低声回应。

"God damn it, she just had to come at the worst possible time!" she cursed, before sighing. "Well, I guess I have no other choice but to go outside and make her leave. What the hell does she even want?"  
"该死的，她偏偏在最糟糕的时候来了！" 她咒骂道，然后叹了口气。"好吧，我想我别无选择，只能出去让她离开。她到底想要什么？"

"You'll find out soon enough" Shinji replied, withdrawing from the girl and moving out of her way.  
"你很快就会知道的" 真嗣回答道，从女孩身边退开，让出了位置。

Asuka then buttoned up her shirt and retied her ribbon, before exiting the cubicle and checking herself in the mirror. The boy watched as the girl fixed up her hair and straightened her skirt before moving over to the door. Shinji pulled his pants back up and grabbed his backpack before hiding himself back inside the cubicle as Asuka opened the door and exited the toilet; it was lucky Hikari hadn't noticed the bags before. Shinji pondered for a moment what Hikari wanted with Asuka, his thoughts soon interrupted in only a few seconds as the door to the toilet opened again and in walked more than one person.  
随后，明日香扣好衬衫，重新系上发带，走出隔间，对着镜子检查自己。男孩看着女孩整理头发，拉直裙摆，然后走向门口。真嗣提上裤子，抓起书包，躲回隔间里，而明日香打开门离开了洗手间；幸好光没有注意到那些袋子。真嗣思索了一会儿光找明日香有什么事，但他的思绪很快就被打断了，因为洗手间的门再次打开，进来了不止一个人。

"Yeah I think it's better we discuss it in here, just in case someone accidentally eavesdrops on us" Hikari told Asuka.  
"是啊，我觉得我们在这里讨论比较好，以防有人不小心偷听到我们" 光对明日香说。

"Yeah, I suppose you're right" Asuka agreed, before closing the door.  
“嗯，我想你是对的。”明日香同意道，随后关上了门。

Shinji kept silent and listened intently to the conversation.  
真嗣保持沉默，专心地听着对话。

"You know Asuka you look a bit… messy for some reason and you're sweating. Is it to do with why you rushed out of the classroom? Were you here all this time?" Hikari asked curiously.  
“你知道吗，明日香，你看起来有点……乱糟糟的，还满头大汗。是不是和你急匆匆离开教室有关？你一直在这里吗？” 光好奇地问道。

"Oh, I just needed to go to the bathroom real bad and yeah I was here for a while" Asuka answered vaguely.  
“哦，我只是急需上个厕所，而且是的，我在这里待了一会儿。”明日香含糊地回答。

"You smell a bit funny too. It's nothing serious right?" Hikari continued.  
“你闻起来也有点怪怪的。没什么大问题吧？” 光继续问道。

The redhead knew the ponytailed girl wouldn't drop it until she got some type of explanation and so she decided to lie.  
红发女孩知道马尾辫女孩不得到某种解释是不会罢休的，于是她决定撒个谎。

"It was just a bad period Hikari" Asuka told her.  
"那只是个糟糕的时期，光子" 明日香告诉她。

"Well, why didn't you just say so? Honestly Asuka, you are so uptight sometimes. Although I thought yours was due in a week" Hikari replied.  
"那你为什么不直接说呢？说实话，明日香，你有时候真是太紧张了。不过我以为你的应该在一周后" 光子回答道。

Shinji made sure to make a mental note of that.  
真嗣确保自己在心里记下了这一点。

"Well it came early, but enough about this already. What did you want to talk to me about?" Asuka said, growing irritated.  
"好吧，它来得早了些，但关于这个已经说得够多了。你想跟我谈什么？" 明日香说道，逐渐变得不耐烦。

"Sorry, I just wanted to talk to you about the panty incident during class" Hikari explained.  
"抱歉，我只是想和你谈谈课堂上那次内裤事件" 光解释道。

"What about it?" the redhead asked.  
"那件事怎么了？" 红发女孩问道。

"Well it's just those panties Shinji had, I am almost certain they are yours" Hikari answered. "I wanted to talk to you about it during class, but thought better of it"  
"呃，就是真嗣那条内裤，我几乎可以肯定那是你的" 光回答道。"我本来想在课间跟你说的，但后来觉得还是算了"

"What makes you think they were mine?" Asuka questioned.  
"你怎么会觉得那是我的？" 明日香问道。

"Well first off, they look like your panties plus I saw some writing on the tag that didn't look Japanese" Hikari replied. "I could be wrong though"  
"首先，它们看起来像你的内裤，而且我在标签上看到了一些看起来不像日文的字" 光回答。"不过我也可能搞错了"

_'Wow Hikari is observant'_ Shinji thought.  
'哇，光真是观察力敏锐。' 真嗣心想。

"So, Shinji had stolen my panties?" Asuka put forward.  
'那么，真嗣偷了我的内裤？' 明日香提出疑问。

"It would seem so" Hikari said, nodding her head.  
'看来是这样。' 光点头说道。

"Damn that perverted baka, I'll smack him silly when I get home" Asuka said angrily.  
“该死的变态笨蛋，回家我非得把他揍得晕头转向。”明日香生气地说。

"Well actually, he might still be in school as I didn't see him leave either, why don't we go look for him?" Hikari asked.  
“其实，他可能还在学校，因为我也没看到他离开，要不我们去找找他？” 洞木光提议道。

The redhead internally groaned. "Just give me a few more minutes I want to… finish up here" she requested.  
红发少女内心呻吟了一声。“再给我几分钟，我想……把这里弄完。”她请求道。

"Sure" Hikari agreed, walking out of the toilet to wait outside for her.  
“当然。”光点头同意，走出洗手间在外面等她。

After Asuka was sure Hikari had exited the toilet she quickly moved over to Shinji's cubicle and knocked.  
在确认光已经离开洗手间后，明日香迅速走到真嗣的隔间前敲了敲门。

"I _really_ need you to finish me Shinji" the girl whispered desperately.  
“我真的需要你帮我完成，真嗣。”女孩绝望地低声说道。

The boy opened the door and grabbed her without hesitation. He immediately started where they left off, pulling his pants down and shoving himself in as deep and hard as he could as her vagina was still well lubricated. Shinji covered the girl's mouth with his, to prevent Hikari from hearing anything. Really needing to be quick, Shinji didn't bother with unbuttoning her shirt or anything else and just concentrated solely on getting the girl to orgasm. Already having been built up a bit, the redhead was already close to her climax. Asuka held the boy close as he fucked her, her whole body sweating and invigorated.  
男孩毫不犹豫地推开门，一把抓住了她。他立刻接续上次的激情，迅速脱下裤子，将自己深深地插入，她的阴道依旧润滑良好。为了不让光听到任何声音，真嗣吻住了女孩的嘴。他急需速战速决，懒得解开她的衬衫或其他，只专注于让女孩达到高潮。红发女孩已经积累了些许快感，接近高潮边缘。明日香紧抱着男孩，随着他的抽插，全身汗水淋漓，充满活力。

Shinji clearly felt it when the girl went over the edge and acted accordingly. He kept her against the wall and thrust into her relentlessly, trying to achieve his own orgasm. The redhead was wriggling vigorously as she came, her arms holding him even tighter and he could feel her mouth moaning. Soon, Shinji was having trouble keeping the girl still as it seemed she was struggling against him and then realised she was probably running out of air. He parted from her lips and she instantly gasped for air. At this moment, the boy finally came, spurting his hot semen up her pussy.  
当女孩越过极限时，真嗣清晰地感受到了，并随之采取了行动。他将她紧贴在墙上，无情地深入，试图达到自己的高潮。红发女孩在高潮中剧烈扭动，双臂将他抱得更紧，他能感觉到她在呻吟。不久，真嗣难以保持女孩静止，似乎她在挣扎，然后意识到她可能快喘不过气了。他离开她的唇，她立刻大口吸气。就在这时，男孩终于高潮了，将滚烫的精液射入她的私处。

The redhead leaned against Shinji as her body calmed down and the boy began to stroke her hair softly. She then groaned and buried her face in the boy's chest.  
红发女孩靠在真嗣身上，身体逐渐平静下来，男孩开始温柔地抚摸她的头发。她随后呻吟一声，将脸埋在男孩的胸前。

"You alright?" Shinji asked.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"I have to go look for you with Hikari. Couldn't she just let it go?" Asuka complained.  
“我得和光一起去找你。她就不能放手吗？”明日香抱怨道。

Shinji just chuckled. "Well, you best get fully cleaned up then. You look as if you lived through a tornado" he remarked.  
真嗣只是轻声笑了笑。“那你最好彻底清洗干净。你看起来像是刚从龙卷风里逃出来。”他打趣道。

Asuka pushed the boy off of her and straightened her skirt again. Shinji just pulled his pants back up while the redhead went over to the sink to fix herself up. This time the girl fixed up her hair neatly, smoothed out her shirt and washed herself a bit.  
明日香把男孩从自己身上推开，再次整理好裙子。真嗣则拉起裤子，而红发女孩走到水池边整理自己。这次，她把头发梳理得整整齐齐，抚平了衬衫，还稍微洗了洗脸。

"I'd better go…" Asuka said, turning to face the boy when she was done.  
"我还是走吧……" 明日香说完，转身面对那个男孩。

"Nothing we can do about it" Shinji replied, shrugging his shoulders.  
"我们对此无能为力" 真嗣回答，耸了耸肩。

At this, the boy returned to his cubicle just in case while the redhead took her bag from the floor and placed it on her back before exiting the female restroom. He waited inside the cubicle for a little while before he decided that the girls weren't coming back in. Shinji then also placed his bag on his shoulders and exited the cubicle before moving over to the door and pressing up against it to hear if the girls were still there. Unable to hear anything, he decided he would open the door. As the boy opened the door slowly, he prayed that they really were gone and that no females would try to enter the toilet as he left.  
听到这话，男孩回到自己的隔间以防万一，而红发女孩则从地上拿起书包，背在背上，然后离开了女洗手间。他在隔间里等了一会儿，确定女孩们不会回来后，真嗣也把书包背在肩上，走出隔间，走到门口，贴着门听外面是否还有女孩的声音。听不到任何动静，他决定打开门。男孩慢慢地打开门，祈祷她们真的已经离开，并且在他离开时不会有其他女孩试图进入洗手间。

When the door was open enough that he could fit through, Shinji poked his head outside and saw no one in the corridor. He quickly slipped out of the restroom before anyone came and sighed in relief; he had passed the first obstacle, now to get out of the school without the other two girls finding him. Even though he really wanted to walk home with Asuka, it would require that he reveal himself to Hikari and some annoying questions to answer would follow. Thinking that they wouldn't look for him at the entrance to the school first, Shinji decided he would just go straight to the exit and get out of the school as soon as possible.  
当门开到足够他通过时，真嗣探出头，发现走廊上空无一人。他迅速溜出洗手间，以免有人进来，然后松了一口气；他通过了第一个障碍，现在要设法在另外两个女孩找到他之前离开学校。尽管他真的很想和明日香一起走回家，但这意味着他必须向光和一些烦人的问题坦白。考虑到她们不会先在学校入口处找他，真嗣决定直接走向出口，尽快离开学校。

Unfortunately for the boy, both Asuka and Hikari were waiting for him at the exit of the school building; he had been caught. _'So much for that plan'_ he thought.  
不幸的是，对于这个男孩来说，明日香和光已经在学校建筑的出口处等着他了；他被逮个正着。'这个计划算是泡汤了'他心想。

"See Asuka, I told you the best place to wait for him was at the exit" Hikari said proudly.  
“看吧，明日香，我告诉过你，等他的最佳地点就是出口。”光自豪地说道。

"Oh, hey girls… is something wrong?" Shinji asked, trying to sound curious.  
"哦，嘿，姑娘们……有什么不对劲吗？" 真嗣问道，试图听起来充满好奇。

The ponytailed girl moved over to Shinji and reached into his pocket, pulling out Asuka's panties and studying them.  
扎马尾的女孩走到真嗣身边，伸手进他的口袋，掏出明日香的内裤，仔细研究起来。

"Wait-!" Shinji started. "等等——！" 真嗣开口道。

"I knew it, it _is_ yours Asuka" Hikari interrupted. "Here you go, these are yours" she said, giving the redhead back her panties which Asuka then pocketed.  
"我就知道，这是你的，明日香。" 光子打断道，"给你，这些是你的。" 她边说边把红发女孩的内裤递还给她，明日香随即塞进了口袋。

"Explain yourself Ikari" Asuka demanded.  
"解释一下，碇。" 明日香要求道。

_'What the hell do I say?'_ the boy thought. As no words came to his mouth, he just stayed silent.  
'我到底该说什么？' 男孩心想。由于无言以对，他只是沉默不语。

"She's asking you why you have her underwear in your pocket" Hikari rephrased.  
"她问你为什么口袋里有她的内衣" 光重新表述道。

Shinji knew he had to respond with something, so he used the same excuse he used with his friends.  
真嗣知道他必须说点什么，于是他用了一个和朋友们一样的借口。

"Well, I was doing the laundry at home and… I don't know… maybe I somehow left it in my pants, I was surprised to find it in my pocket as well" he answered.  
"嗯，我在家里洗衣服，然后……我不知道……可能我不知怎么地把它落在了裤子里，我自己也很惊讶会在口袋里找到它" 他回答道。

"Why should I believe you?" Asuka asked.  
“我为什么要相信你？”明日香问道。

_'Don't make things harder Asuka'_ Shinji thought angrily.  
“别让事情变得更复杂了，明日香。”真嗣气愤地想。

"Why would I steal _your_ panties? Even if I _wanted_ to steal them, I wouldn't even bring them to school, I could easily have made sure you wouldn't find out" he replied.  
“我为什么要偷你的内裤？就算我想偷，也不会带到学校来，我完全可以确保你不会发现。”他回答道。

"That's a good point. I guess I need to check your room when we get home. You're still getting slapped though" Asuka said, smirking.  
"那是个好主意。我想回家后得检查一下你的房间。不过你还是得挨这一巴掌。" 明日香说着，嘴角微微上扬。

Even with the warning and the subsequent bracing of himself, the slap still hurt like hell; a huge red hand-shaped welt on the boy's cheek was proof enough. Shinji cursed himself for falling in love with this violent girl as he nursed his poor cheek.  
“你最好别再让我抓到你偷我的内衣，第三适格者。”红发女孩威胁道。

"I better not catch you with my underwear again third child" the redhead threatened.

The boy just nodded pitifully in agreement.  
男孩只是可怜兮兮地点头表示同意。

"I think you hit him a little _too_ hard Asuka, his face is already injured" Hikari said worriedly.  
“我觉得你打他打得太重了，明日香，他的脸已经受伤了。” 光担忧地说道。

"Don't worry about this baka, besides he deserved it" Asuka refuted.  
“别担心这个笨蛋，再说了，他活该。” 明日香反驳道。

"We now know it was an accident and thinking about it now, the embarrassment he got in class was probably more than enough of a punishment" Hikari replied.  
“我们现在知道那是个意外了，想想当时，他在班上受到的尴尬可能已经足够作为惩罚了。” 光子回答道。

"Whose side are you on? Your best friend's or a panty thief's?" Asuka argued.  
“你到底站在谁那边？你最好朋友的还是内裤小偷的？” 明日香争辩道。

Hikari just giggled in response. "Sometimes you can behave so childishly Asuka. You should go make it up to Shinji when you get home, this all came from him doing your laundry after all" the class rep told her.  
光子只是咯咯地笑了起来。“有时候你表现得像个小孩子一样，明日香。你回家后应该去向真嗣道歉，毕竟这一切都是因为他帮你洗衣服引起的。” 班长告诉她。

"I can't believe my _best friend_ is betraying me" Asuka huffed.  
"我真不敢相信我最好的朋友会背叛我。" 明日香气呼呼地说。

"Don't you feel sorry for Shinji at all?" Hikari inquired, grinning at her friend's behaviour.  
"难道你一点都不同情真嗣吗？" 光子问道，对着朋友的行为咧嘴一笑。

"Now you're trying to make me feel guilty?" the redhead said disbelievingly.  
"现在你是在试图让我感到内疚吗？" 红发女孩难以置信地说。

"Don't be so difficult all the time or Shinji will leave you" Hikari joked.  
"别总是这么难相处，不然真嗣会离开你的。" 光子开玩笑地说。

"WHAT?!" Asuka shouted, while Shinji almost fell over.  
"什么？！" 明日香大喊，而真嗣差点摔倒。

The ponytailed girl laughed at the redhead's reaction. "Relax Asuka, I was just kidding" she said in response to the look she was getting.  
扎马尾的女孩对红发女孩的反应笑了起来。"放松点，明日香，我只是在开玩笑。" 她回应着对方的眼神说道。

"You scared me there for a second Hikari" Asuka replied.  
"你刚才真把我吓了一跳，光" 明日香回答道。

"But seriously Asuka, give the boy a break" Hikari requested.  
"但说真的，明日香，放过那男孩吧" 光请求道。

"Oh fine already" Asuka said grudgingly.  
"好吧，好吧" 明日香不情愿地说。

"You're a good person Asuka" Hikari complimented.  
"你是个好人，明日香。" 光称赞道。

"Yeah yeah whatever" the redhead replied.  
"是是是，随便吧" 红发女孩回答。

"Well, it's already quite a bit past the end of school so I better get going" Hikari announced. "I'll see you two later"  
"嗯，放学已经过去很久了，我得走了" 光宣布道。"回头见，你们俩"

"Bye Hikari" both Shinji and Asuka replied, before the class rep rushed off out of the school.  
“再见，光” 真嗣和明日香齐声回答，随后班长匆匆离开了学校。

"Damn you are so gonna get it for that Asuka" Shinji said in pain.  
“该死的，明日香，你一定会为此付出代价的” 真嗣痛苦地说道。

"Well it's your own stupid fault for taking my panties" Asuka countered.  
“哼，谁让你拿我内裤的，活该” 明日香反驳道。

"I still don't understand why you had to do it that hard" Shinji retorted.  
"我还是不明白你为什么要做得那么狠。" 真嗣反驳道。

"I had to act normal ok? It's not my fault" she snapped.  
"我得表现得正常，好吗？这不是我的错。" 她厉声说道。

"Oh of course, you had to act _normal_. I had forgotten being a violent bitch was 'normal' for you" he replied.  
"哦，当然了，你得表现得正常。我都忘了对你来说当个暴力婊子是'正常'的。" 他回答道。

"God you're nothing but a big baby" Asuka said irately before moving over to the boy and planting a kiss where she slapped him. "There, a kiss to make it feel better ok?"  
“天啊，你简直就是个大宝宝。”明日香恼火地说道，然后走到男孩身边，在他被扇的地方吻了一下。“好了，一个吻让你感觉好些了，行吗？”

Any anger Shinji felt instantly disappeared and he couldn't help smiling at her actions. "Well I guess I was mistaken, you really are a good person" he replied, before kissing the girl on the lips.  
真嗣感到的任何怒气瞬间消失，他忍不住对她笑了。“好吧，我想我错了，你真的是个好人。”他回答道，然后在女孩的唇上吻了一下。

The boy slipped his tongue into the redhead's mouth as he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer. Asuka too gave in to the passion of the moment and kissed the boy back just as avidly. As the redhead returned Shinji's embrace, they both closed their eyes, enjoying the kiss.  
男孩将舌头滑入红发女孩的口中，同时用双臂环抱住她，将她拉得更近。明日香也沉浸在这一刻的激情中，同样热情地回吻了他。当红发女孩回应真嗣的拥抱时，他们俩都闭上了眼睛，享受着这个吻。

"Oi, go on home already you kids!" a voice called out.  
"喂，你们这些小鬼，赶紧回家去！" 一个声音喊道。

The two eva pilots jumped and immediately parted as they were startled. They looked to where the voice had come from and saw the school janitor. Both in shock, the two just stood there dumbly.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员吓了一跳，立刻分开。他们朝声音传来的方向看去，看到了学校的清洁工。两人震惊之余，只是呆呆地站在那里。

"It's way past the end of school and I need to clean the place, so get out of here" the janitor continued.  
"早就放学了，我得打扫卫生，所以你们快离开这里。" 清洁工继续说道。

"Yes sorry, we'll be going now" Shinji replied, taking Asuka's hand and exiting the school building with her.  
“是的，抱歉，我们现在就走。” 真嗣回答道，牵起明日香的手，与她一同离开了学校大楼。

As there were still a few students outside, Shinji quickly released the redhead's hand and the two of them walked out the school gates together. Their silent stroll didn't last long as the redhead spoke up.  
由于外面还有几个学生，真嗣迅速放开了红发女孩的手，两人一起走出了学校大门。他们沉默的散步并没有持续太久，因为红发女孩开口了。

"Well how about that, getting caught by the school janitor while we were pashing" Asuka commented.  
“哎呀，真是的，居然被学校管理员抓到我们在亲热。” 明日香评论道。

"Yeah, that was definitely a mood killer, but better him than a teacher I suppose" Shinji replied. "You should be more worried about other things though"  
“是啊，那绝对是个情绪杀手，但总比是老师好吧，我想。” 真嗣回答道。“不过，你应该更担心其他事情。”

"Like what?" Asuka asked.  
“比如什么？” 明日香问道。

"When we get home, we're going to finish our business. After all, you're still mine for the rest of the day and now there'll be no interruptions" Shinji explained.  
“等我们回家后，我们要把事情做完。毕竟，你今天剩下的时间还是属于我的，而且现在不会再有打扰了。” 真嗣解释道。

"Yeah… I can hardly wait" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“是啊……我简直等不及了。”明日香讽刺地说道。

The two adolescents walked the rest of the way to their apartment in silence; after all the events of today, they could use a short break. Arriving at their apartment, they entered the building and took the elevator up to their floor. The two roommates then made their way to their door and entered their residence, closing and locking the door behind them.  
两个少年一路沉默地走回他们的公寓；经历了今天的一切，他们确实需要短暂的休息。到达公寓后，他们进入大楼，乘坐电梯到达自己的楼层。两位室友随后走向自己的房门，进入住所，并关上并锁好了身后的门。

"We're home!" Shinji called out as they both dumped their bags on the floor.  
“我们回来了！”真嗣喊道，两人同时把包扔在了地上。

They received no answer in response.  
他们没有得到任何回应。

"Misato isn't here?" Shinji said hopefully.  
"美里不在这里吗？" 真嗣满怀希望地说。

"Well, she said she had the day off today, but knowing her, she would spend it sleeping" Asuka remarked. "I'll go check her room to be sure"  
"嗯，她说她今天休假，但以她的性格，估计会睡上一整天。" 明日香评论道，"我去她房间确认一下。"

The redhead disappeared for a few seconds as she went and checked the Major's bedroom before returning to Shinji.  
红发女孩消失了几秒钟，她去检查了少校的卧室，然后回到真嗣身边。

"I didn't even have to go into her room to know that she was asleep. Man, that woman snores louder than a thunderstorm" Asuka told the boy.  
“我甚至都不用进她的房间就知道她在睡觉。天哪，那女人打呼噜的声音比雷暴还响。”明日香告诉男孩。

Shinji sniggered at her comment before replying. "Yeah, I once thought a monster had entered the house when I walked past her door" he recalled.  
真嗣听到她的评论后轻声笑了起来，然后回答道：“是啊，有一次我经过她的房门时，还以为有怪物闯进家里了呢。”他回忆道。

"Yeah, it's scary isn't it?" Asuka said, laughing.  
"是啊，挺吓人的，对吧？" 明日香笑着说。

"Oh yeah" he agreed. "哦，没错" 他同意道。

Their laughter was shortly interrupted by a certain redhead's stomach growling. The girl gave the boy a quick look before speaking up. "Well I know you're just _dying_ of anticipation for some 'fun,' but it seems like I'm really hungry, through no fault of my own might I add, so I'm going to eat my bento first" she declared.  
他们的笑声很快被某个红发女孩的肚子咕噜声打断。女孩迅速看了男孩一眼，然后开口道："好吧，我知道你正迫不及待想要找点'乐子'，但看来我真的饿了，这可不是我的错，所以我打算先吃我的便当" 她宣布道。

"Very well, you have my permission to eat" Shinji teased. "I'll join in too"  
“很好，我允许你吃。”真嗣打趣道，“我也一起。”

The girl just shook her head at him before opening her bag and taking out her uneaten lunch. Shinji did the same and the two eva pilots then moved over to the dining table before sitting down and eating their meals. It didn't take long for Asuka to finish her food, as it was just lunch, and so she stood up from the table, leaving the empty lunchbox on the table and moving off towards her room. Shinji wasn't too fussed about the redhead running away though, she couldn't escape him anyway. Asuka didn't get very far, however, as the sound of the phone ringing interrupted her trek. As the girl was the closest to the phone, she went and picked up the receiver.  
女孩只是对他摇了摇头，然后打开书包，拿出她未吃完的午餐。真嗣也照做，两位 EVA 驾驶员随后移步到餐桌前坐下，开始用餐。没过多久，明日香就吃完了她的食物，毕竟只是午餐，于是她从桌旁站起，将空饭盒留在桌上，朝自己的房间走去。真嗣并不太在意红发女孩的逃离，反正她也逃不出他的视线。然而，明日香没走多远，电话铃声就打断了她的脚步。由于女孩离电话最近，她便走过去接起了听筒。

"Hello?" Asuka greeted the phone.  
“喂？”明日香向电话那头打招呼。

The voice on the other side instantly responded excitedly.  
电话那头的声音立刻兴奋地回应道。

"Oh, hi Hikari, what's up?" the redhead asked.  
“哦，嗨，光，怎么了？”红发女孩问道。

"Really, that school dance is actually tonight?" Asuka replied after hearing Hikari's answer.  
“真的，那个学校舞会居然是今晚？”听到光的话后，明日香回答道。

The girl then paused as she listened to Hikari talk, giving a few grunts now and then as affirmation.  
女孩随即停下，倾听光说话，不时发出几声咕哝以示肯定。

"No way! You're going with Suzuhara to the school dance?!" Asuka exclaimed.  
“不可能！你要和铃原一起去学校舞会？！”明日香惊呼道。

"Ah I knew it. You want me to come tonight as well. Do I really have to go?"  
“啊，我就知道。你也想让我今晚去。我真的非去不可吗？”

The redhead's face soon showed irritation as she listened to the phone.  
红发女孩的脸很快显露出不耐烦，她听着电话。

"But I don't really wanna go, besides I don't have a partner"  
“但我真的不想去，而且我也没有搭档。”

This time, Asuka had a surprised look on her face.  
这一次，明日香脸上露出了惊讶的表情。

"You want me to take Shinji? Are you serious?" she asked disbelievingly.  
"你想让我带真嗣去？你是认真的吗？" 她难以置信地问道。

Hikari continued to explain her request.  
光继续解释她的请求。

"Wait a second… you're saying I should make it up to Shinji by taking him to the school dance?"  
"等一下……你是说，我应该通过带他去学校舞会来补偿真嗣？"

Asuka paused again as she listened to her friend's response.  
明日香又一次停顿，聆听着朋友的回应。

"That's ridiculous! Why are you so adamant about getting me to go, don't you want to be alone with that stupid jock anyway?"  
“那太荒谬了！你为什么这么坚持要我去，你不是想和那个蠢蛋运动员独处吗？”

This time, the redhead held the phone away from her ear as her best friend frantically began making "innocent" excuses as to why she was going to the dance with Touji.  
这次，红发女孩把手机从耳边移开，因为她的挚友开始急切地找一些“无辜”的借口，解释她为何要和东治一起去舞会。

"Oh alright, fine! I will go to the stupid dance" Asuka replied, losing her patience.  
“哦好吧，行了！我会去那个愚蠢的舞会的。”明日香回答道，失去了耐心。

The girl rolled her eyes as she listened to Hikari giving her gratitude.  
女孩翻了个白眼，听着光里向她表示感谢。

"Yeah yeah, I'll take him, but only because I don't have any other choice but Shinji at this short notice" the redhead said, sighing.  
“是是，我会带他去，但只是因为我没有其他选择，只能在这么短的通知时间内选真嗣。”红发女孩叹息道。

"Yeah ok, I'll see you there. Goodbye" she finished, before hanging up.  
“好的，到时候见。再见。”她说完便挂断了电话。

Asuka turned to face Shinji and sighed in irritation. The boy just looked at her confused, waiting for her explanation as to why he had just been forced to go to the school dance with her without ever being asked.  
明日香转过身面对真嗣，不耐烦地叹了口气。男孩只是困惑地看着她，等待她解释为什么自己未经询问就被迫与她一同参加学校的舞会。

"Hikari…" the redhead started, "Is just so pathetic. She's too scared to be alone with that stupid idiot and wants me to come, I can't believe how retarded she is argh" she complained.  
“光……”红发少女开口道，“真是太可悲了。她太害怕和那个蠢货单独相处，想让我也去，我简直不敢相信她有多迟钝，啊！”她抱怨道。

Shinji just looked at his roommate as if someone had just stolen his favourite toy. "But what about me having my fun tonight?" he asked.  
真嗣只是看着他的室友，仿佛有人刚刚偷走了他最心爱的玩具。“但今晚我也要找点乐子啊？”他问道。

"I promise we'll do it after" Asuka replied.  
“我保证我们之后会做的”明日香回答道。

"But-" Shinji started. “但是——”真嗣开口道。

"No buts, we're going" Asuka interrupted. "I need to take a shower and you should too. I think I'll put on my black dress. You should wear something formal too like a suit"  
"别找借口，我们走。" 明日香打断道，"我需要洗个澡，你也该洗。我想穿我的黑色连衣裙。你也应该穿正式点，比如西装。"

"But-" the boy began. "但是——" 男孩开口道。

"What did I just say?" the redhead interrupted again.  
"我刚说什么了？" 红发女孩再次打断。

Shinji just sighed in resignation; there was no point in arguing with her. "So, what time does it start?" he asked her.  
真嗣只是叹了口气，表示放弃；和她争论毫无意义。“那么，几点开始？”他问她。

"Very soon, so go get ready now" she answered.  
“很快就要开始了，所以现在就去准备吧。”她回答道。

With that, Asuka stood up and went straight to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Not having a choice, Shinji went to his room and began to rummage through his wardrobe for suitable clothing. He found a plain white shirt, a black overcoat and some long black trousers; it kinda looked like a tux and it was all he had anyway. Placing the clothes on his bed, he then exited his room to check if Asuka had finished. The closed door suggested that the redhead had not yet finished and thus Shinji decided to wait.  
说完，明日香站起身来，径直走向浴室，关上了门。真嗣别无选择，只好回到自己的房间，开始在衣柜里翻找合适的衣服。他找到了一件普通的白衬衫、一件黑色外套和一些黑色长裤；这有点像晚礼服，反正他只有这些。他把衣服放在床上，然后走出房间，看看明日香是否已经准备好了。关着的门表明红发女孩还没结束，于是真嗣决定等待。

It wasn't long till the girl walked out of the bathroom, covered in a towel. Smiling cheekily, Shinji moved over to her and pulled the towel off her.  
没过多久，女孩裹着浴巾从浴室走了出来。新治咧嘴一笑，凑上前去，一把扯掉了她的浴巾。

"Hey!" Asuka shouted. “嘿！”明日香大喊道。

"What?" Shinji asked innocently.  
“什么？”新治无辜地问道。

"Give me my towel back" she demanded, attempting to retrieve the towel from the boy.  
"把毛巾还我" 她要求道，试图从男孩手中夺回毛巾。

The boy found it amusing to watch a bare naked Asuka struggle to grab the towel off him.  
男孩觉得看着光溜溜的明日香挣扎着从他身上抢毛巾很有趣。

"Do you really need it? I've seen you a dozen times" he replied.  
"你真的需要它吗？我都见过你十几次了" 他回答道。

"I would advise you not to keep this argument going" the redhead warned.  
"我建议你不要继续这场争论" 红发女孩警告道。

Reluctantly, the male eva pilot returned the towel to girl who huffed and stormed off to her room. Now that the girl had finished her shower, Shinji entered the bathroom himself. He stripped off his clothes, got into the shower cubicle and turned the handles; nothing but cold water came out.  
不情愿地，男性 EVA 驾驶员将毛巾还给了那个女孩，她哼了一声，气冲冲地回到自己的房间。既然女孩已经洗完澡，真嗣便走进了浴室。他脱掉衣服，进入淋浴间，转动把手；出来的只有冷水。

_'She used all the hot water again'_ Shinji thought, sighing.  
'她又把热水用光了' 真嗣心想，叹了口气。

Not wanting to have a cold shower, the boy rushed his shower and got out as soon as he could. Having finished his shower, he dried himself with a towel before exiting the bathroom and returning to his bedroom. Entering his room, he then began to dress up into the clothes he had prepared. When he finished dressing up, Shinji checked himself in the mirror and fixed up his hair and anything else that needed his attention. Satisfied with himself, the boy then went over to Asuka's room to check on her and knocked on her door.  
不想洗冷水澡，男孩匆匆结束了淋浴，尽快走出浴室。洗完澡后，他用毛巾擦干身体，然后离开浴室回到自己的卧室。进入房间后，他开始穿上事先准备好的衣服。穿好衣服后，真嗣对着镜子检查自己，整理头发和其他需要关注的地方。对自己感到满意后，男孩走到明日香的房间，查看她的情况并敲了敲门。

"Yes?" Asuka responded through the door.  
“什么事？”明日香隔着门回应道。

"You ready?" Shinji asked.  
“准备好了吗？”真嗣问道。

"No" she answered. "不" 她回答道。

"Can I come in?" he requested.  
"我能进来吗？" 他请求道。

"No, I'm not finished" she replied.  
"不行，我还没完" 她回答说。

He momentarily considered opening her door, but soon thought it wise not to anger her.  
他短暂地考虑过为她开门，但很快认为最好不要惹恼她。

"Ok I'll be waiting then" he told her.  
“好的，那我就在这儿等着。”他告诉她。

Having nothing better to do, Shinji went to the kitchen and took out a drink. He then moved to the dining room and sat down on the table, slowly sipping his cup. As the boy waited patiently for his girlfriend to get ready, he thought about whether he would dance or not. Shinji wasn't particularly good at it, but he had learnt some from school and Kaji, who insisted dancing was essential to impressing girls. Dancing by himself wouldn't be too hard, but the prospect of dancing with Asuka made him a bit uneasy; he might have to let her lead. After about 20 minutes of pondering, he heard Asuka's door open; the redhead had finally emerged from her room.  
既然无事可做，真嗣便走向厨房，拿了一杯饮料。随后他来到餐厅，坐在桌旁，慢慢啜饮着杯子里的液体。男孩耐心地等待着女友准备完毕，同时思考着自己是否该跳舞。真嗣并不擅长跳舞，但他在学校和加持那里学到了一些，加持坚持认为跳舞是吸引女孩子的关键。独自跳舞并不难，但与明日香共舞的前景让他有些不安；他可能得让她来主导。大约 20 分钟的沉思后，他听到了明日香的房门打开的声音；红发女孩终于从房间里出来了。

Shinji stood up from the table as his roommate walked in. When the boy laid his eyes on the girl, he just stood there stunned. Asuka was wearing a low cut glittery black dress which fit tightly around the girl, showing off all her womanly curves. The redhead was also wearing sparkling silver earrings, long white gloves, sexy black stockings and high heels. To top it off, she was wearing eyeliner and luscious red lipstick. The boy had always known that Asuka was beautiful for a girl her age, even sexy, but the dress she was wearing right now accentuated her features and made her appear astounding. Shinji felt a burst of ego as he knew this girl was his.  
真嗣从桌旁站起身，他的室友走了进来。当男孩看到那个女孩时，他只是呆呆地站在那里。明日香穿着一件低胸的闪亮黑色连衣裙，紧贴着她的身体，展现出她所有的女性曲线。红发女孩还戴着闪闪发光的银色耳环，长长的白色手套，性感的黑色丝袜和高跟鞋。最重要的是，她还化了眼线和诱人的红色口红。男孩一直都知道明日香对于她这个年龄的女孩来说很美，甚至很性感，但她现在穿的这件裙子突出了她的特点，让她显得惊人。真嗣感到一股自豪，因为他知道这个女孩是他的。

"Well, how is it?" Asuka asked after the lack of response.  
“怎么样？”明日香在对方没有回应后问道。

"You look absolutely gorgeous" Shinji blurted out.  
“你看起来美极了。”真嗣脱口而出。

The redhead blushed at his remark. "Thank you, you look pretty handsome yourself" she replied.  
红发女孩听到他的话脸红了。“谢谢，你看起来也很帅气。”她回答道。

"Where the hell did you get a dress like that?" the boy asked curiously.  
“你到底从哪儿弄来这么一件礼服的？”男孩好奇地问。

"I um… had it custom made for me back in Germany, I decided to bring it over as I would outgrow the dress sooner or later" she answered. "I thought I might as well use it now as I haven't really had any other chance"  
“我嗯……在德国时特意定制的，我想着迟早会穿不下，就把它带来了。”她解释道，“我觉得现在用上正好，毕竟也没其他机会穿。”

The boy was just speechless as he admired his girlfriend's beauty, unable to say anything to accurately compliment her. Shinji then realised he had been staring at her for quite a bit and not wanting to annoy the redhead, he moved next to the girl.  
男孩被女友的美貌震撼得说不出话来，无法找到合适的言辞来赞美她。真嗣随后意识到自己已经盯着她看了好一会儿，不想惹恼这位红发女孩，他便移步到她身边。

"S-So then… w-we going now?" he stammered.  
"那…那我们…现在出发吗？" 他结结巴巴地说。

"Yes let's" she replied. "好的，我们走吧。" 她回答道。

Shinji moved his hand down her backside, feeling the lining of her underwear through the fabric of her dress. The redhead smacked his hand away, thinking he was trying to cop a feel.  
真嗣将手移到她的臀部，隔着裙子的布料感受她内裤的边缘。红发女孩拍开了他的手，以为他在试图占便宜。

"What happened to the punishment of not wearing panties?" Shinji asked.  
“不穿内裤的惩罚是怎么回事？”真嗣问道。

"I am _not_ going out in public with this dress without wearing underwear" she said with finality.  
“我绝不会穿着这条裙子不穿内裤出门的。”她斩钉截铁地说。

"I suppose you have a point. Well let's not waste any more time then" he replied, taking the girl's hand.  
“我想你说的有道理。那我们别再浪费时间了。”他回答道，牵起了女孩的手。

The boy led her to the front door and opened it for her to pass through first like any gentleman would. The two eva pilots then took the elevator down and out of the apartment building. As they began walking to the school, Shinji couldn't help but steal glances at the girl next to him; Asuka noticed of course.  
男孩领着她走到前门，像任何绅士一样为她打开门，让她先行通过。两位 EVA 驾驶员随后乘电梯下楼，离开了公寓大楼。当他们开始向学校走去时，真嗣忍不住偷瞄身旁的女孩；当然，明日香注意到了。

"What do you want?" the redhead asked slightly annoyed and pleased at the same time; she really did like attention after all.  
“你想要什么？”红发女孩略带恼怒又同时感到高兴地问道；毕竟，她确实喜欢被关注。

"Oh err… I was just um…" he stuttered.  
"哦，呃…我只是，嗯…" 他结巴道。

"Great, I've reduced you to a pile of gibbering jelly" she remarked.  
"太好了，我把你吓得语无伦次了" 她评论道。

"It's just… I didn't think you could look so stunningly beautiful" the boy said more confidently.  
"只是…我没想到你能如此惊艳" 男孩更加自信地说。

"Come off it, I already told you I was the most beautiful girl in the whole world" she said arrogantly.  
“得了吧，我早就告诉过你，我是全世界最漂亮的女孩。”她傲慢地说道。

Shinji just smiled at her comment and the two continued the rest of the walk quietly. Arriving at the school only a few minutes later, they heard a large noise coming from the school hall and so headed in that direction. When the two teens reached the school hall, they found the entrance had a check-in of some sort. Walking up to the "bouncer," Shinji and Asuka told him they were together. The guard stole a glance at the redhead, astonished by her attractiveness. Growing annoyed, Asuka told the man to hurry up, causing him to promptly stamp them both on the wrist; the redhead had to remove her glove temporarily to do so.  
真嗣只是对她的话微微一笑，两人继续安静地走着。几分钟后到达学校，他们听到学校大厅传来一阵巨大的噪音，于是朝那个方向走去。当两个少年到达学校大厅时，他们发现入口处有某种检查。走到“门卫”面前，真嗣和明日香告诉他他们是一起的。守卫偷瞄了一眼红发女孩，被她的美貌惊呆了。明日香越来越不耐烦，催促那人快点，他赶紧在他们手腕上盖了章；红发女孩不得不暂时脱下手套。

Entering inside, their ears were instantly assaulted by loud music and people chatting. As they looked around searching for Touji and Hikari, they saw the massive dance floor in the centre filled with numerous people moving about somewhat rhythmically. Asuka soon spotted the two sitting over by the tables and motioned to Shinji to follow her to the others. As the two eva pilots walked over to their friends, Touji and Hikari stood up as they noticed them coming.  
一进门，他们的耳朵立刻被嘈杂的音乐和人们的交谈声淹没。他们四处张望寻找东治和光，看到中央巨大的舞池里挤满了或多或少有节奏地移动的人群。明日香很快发现了坐在桌边的两人，示意真嗣跟着她去找其他人。当两位 EVA 驾驶员走向他们的朋友时，东治和光注意到他们来了，站了起来。

"Hey Hikari" Asuka called out to her.  
“嘿，光” 明日香向她喊道。

"Wow you look great Asuka!" Hikari exclaimed.  
“哇，你看起来真棒，明日香！” 光赞叹道。

"For once I'd have to agree" Touji remarked. "You lucky devil Shinji" he said, smacking Shinji's back.  
“这次我得同意” 真嗣评论道。“你这幸运的家伙，真嗣” 他说着，拍了拍真嗣的背。

"_Extremely_ lucky" Asuka added. "But then so are you Suzuhara, why Hikari is willing to be your partner is beyond me"  
"极其幸运" 明日香补充道。"不过你也是，铃原，我不明白光为什么愿意做你的搭档"

"Asuka stop it" Hikari pleaded.  
"明日香，别说了" 光恳求道。

"Fine" the redhead conceded, rolling her eyes.  
"好吧" 红发女孩让步了，翻了个白眼。

Wanting to break the slightly tense atmosphere, Shinji spoke up. "Hikari you also look quite pretty tonight" he complimented.  
想要打破这略显紧张的气氛，真嗣开口了。“光，你今晚也很漂亮。”他称赞道。

"Thank you Shinji" Hikari replied, blushing.  
“谢谢你，真嗣。”光回答道，脸颊泛起红晕。

"Hitting on my partner already? Well I understand, once the redhead opens her mouth all her beauty is lost" Touji joked.  
“已经开始搭讪我的搭档了？好吧，我理解，一旦红发女孩开口，她的美貌就荡然无存了。”斗志开玩笑说。

"Suzuhara, don't you start now!" Hikari quickly reprimanded him.  
"铃原，你别现在开始闹腾！" 光立刻责备他。

"You're lucky Hikari is my friend" was all Asuka said, glaring at the jock intensely.  
"你得庆幸光是我的朋友" 明日香只说了这么一句，狠狠地瞪着那个运动员。

"Why must you two always fight?" Hikari said annoyed. "We came here to have fun, so stop this nonsense already. Anyway, are you going to dance Asuka?" she asked.  
"你们俩为什么总是吵架？" 光不耐烦地说。"我们来这里是找乐子的，别再胡闹了。话说回来，你要跳舞吗，明日香？" 她问道。

"Yeah, aren't you? The whole point of coming here is to dance, unless you wanna sit and talk all night" Asuka answered.  
“是啊，难道不是吗？来这儿的目的不就是为了跳舞吗，除非你想整晚坐着聊天。”明日香回答道。

"Are you going to dance with Shinji?" Touji asked.  
“你要和真嗣跳舞吗？” 冬二问道。

"Who else? He's my dancing partner, it'll be like that time we practised against the twin angels" she replied, reminiscing a little.  
“还能有谁？他是我的舞伴，就像我们那次与双胞胎天使练习时一样。”她略带回忆地回答。

"Since when does the redheaded demon allow a boy to dance with her?" Touji inquired.  
"红发的恶魔什么时候允许一个男孩和她跳舞了？" 东治问道。

"Quiet Suzuhara, don't make her change her mind" Hikari snapped.  
"安静点，铃原，别让她改变主意" 光子急忙制止。

"It's just dancing, it's not like it really means anything" Asuka retorted. "Besides dancing by myself all night would be kinda lame"  
"这只是跳舞而已，又不是真的有什么意义" 明日香反驳道。"再说了，整晚一个人跳舞也挺无聊的"

Touji remained quiet; she did have a point.  
真嗣保持沉默；她说的确实有道理。

"And aren't you two going to dance as well anyway?" Asuka continued at his silence.  
"你们俩不也打算跳舞吗？" 明日香在他沉默中继续说道。

"I suppose so" Touji replied, looking at the ponytailed girl for approval.  
"我想是的" 冬二回答道，目光投向了那位扎着马尾的女孩，寻求她的认可。

"Sure, when Asuka goes" Hikari answered.  
"当然，只要明日香去" 光回答说。

"Well, I'd like some refreshments first before doing anything" the redhead commented.  
"嗯，我想先吃点东西，然后再做其他事情" 红发女孩评论道。

"I'll go get some drinks" Shinji replied, taking Asuka's hint.  
"我去拿些饮料。" 真嗣回应道，领会了明日香的意思。

The male eva pilot took off his coat and placed it on his seat before walking off to get some refreshments for the group. As the boy moved off, the redhead turned her attention back to the other two.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员脱下外套，将其放在座位上，然后起身去为小组取些饮品。当男孩离开后，红发女孩将注意力转回到另外两人身上。

"So, you and Suzuhara, when did you two become a couple?" Asuka asked.  
"那么，你和铃原，你们俩是什么时候成为一对的？" 明日香问道。

"What?!" they both replied.  
"什么？！" 他们齐声回应。

"I said, when did you two become a couple?" Asuka repeated.  
"我说，你们俩什么时候成一对了？" 明日香重复道。

"We're just here as dancing partners and nothing else" Hikari answered.  
"我们只是作为舞伴来的，别的什么都不是。" 光回答。

"Oh, I'm sure" Asuka said sarcastically.  
"哦，我确信。" 明日香讽刺地说道。

"Well, what about you and Shinji?" Touji countered.  
"那你和真嗣呢？" 冬二反问道。

"What about us?" Asuka questioned.  
"我们怎么了？" 明日香反问。

"Are you two a couple?" Touji asked.  
"你们俩是一对吗？" 冬二问道。

"Of course not" Asuka answered.  
"当然不是" 明日香回答道。

"There you go, you two are also _just_ dancing partners" Touji argued.  
"看吧，你们俩也只是舞伴而已" 冬二争辩道。

"Shinji was the only guy I could get to come with me at such short notice, thanks to Hikari who begged me to come, so I didn't have a choice. You two on the other hand chose each other specifically" Asuka shot back.  
"因为 Hikari 求我一定要来，所以临时通知下只有真嗣能陪我来，我别无选择。而你们俩则是特意选择了对方。" 明日香反驳道。

Touji and Hikari found themselves unable to retort and just as Asuka was about to announce her victory, Shinji came back to the group with a tray of beverages.  
剑介和光理无法反驳，正当明日香准备宣布胜利时，真嗣拿着一托盘饮料回到了小组。

"Here's your drinks everyone" Shinji announced as he returned.  
"这是你们的饮料，大家" 真嗣回来时宣布道。

Hikari and Touji quickly took their drinks and sat down at their table. The redhead took one of the two remaining glasses and looked at it distastefully.  
光和真嗣迅速拿起各自的饮料，坐到了他们的桌子旁。红发女孩拿起剩下的两个杯子中的一个，不满地看着它。

"Cranberry punch? Are you kidding?" Asuka asked.  
"蔓越莓潘趣酒？你在开玩笑吧？" 明日香问道。

"Sorry, there wasn't much of a choice" Shinji replied.  
"抱歉，选择不多" 真嗣回答道。

"Don't apologise!" Asuka snapped. The redhead then looked at the other two and an evil smile formed on her face. "Well since I've lost all desire to have a drink, I think I'll go dance now. And as promised, you two will also come up to dance now"  
"别道歉了！" 明日香厉声说道。红发女孩随即看向另外两人，脸上露出了邪恶的笑容。"既然我现在已经完全不想喝酒了，我想我现在要去跳舞了。而且如我所说，你们两个现在也要上来跳舞。"

"But we just got our drinks Asuka" Hikari objected.  
"但我们刚拿到饮料，明日香" 光反对道。"

"That's just too bad, it's rubbish anyway" Asuka refuted.  
"那真是太糟糕了，反正也是垃圾" 明日香反驳道。"

Touji and Hikari reluctantly stood up from the table after which the redhead took Shinji's hand and pulled him to the dance floor with the other two following them.  
冬二和光子不情愿地从桌边站起身，随后红发的明日香牵起真嗣的手，拉着他走向舞池，另外两人紧随其后。

"You didn't even ask me if I wanted to dance" Shinji said, slightly annoyed.  
“你甚至没问我想不想跳舞。”真嗣略带不悦地说。

"Are you saying you _don't_ want to dance with me?" Asuka replied, raising her eyebrows.  
“你是说你不想和我跳舞吗？”明日香挑起眉毛反问道。

"I just wanted you to ask" Shinji answered.  
"我只是希望你来邀请我" 真嗣回答道。

"What are you, a girl? Stop complaining already, or is it that you can't dance?" Asuka questioned.  
"你这是怎么了，像个女孩子似的？别再抱怨了，还是说你根本就不会跳舞？" 明日香质问道。

"I can dance fine" Shinji retorted, his pride stepping in.  
"我跳舞没问题的" 真嗣反驳道，自尊心驱使着他。

The DJ was currently playing some fast-paced dance music and the two roommates began to dance together. They started off dancing individually, pulling a few moves as they tried to show off to the other. Hikari and Touji also began dancing, however snuck off the dance floor after a while and back to their table, far too embarrassed to continue. Shinji and Asuka, however, had completely forgotten about the other two as they were too focused on each other and they began to dance a little closer, trying their best to do some partner dancing to the disco music.  
DJ 正播放着快节奏的舞曲，两位室友随之起舞。起初他们各自展示舞步，试图在对方面前炫耀一番。光和阿薰也加入了舞蹈，但不久后便悄悄离开舞池，回到桌边，实在太过羞涩难以继续。然而，真嗣和明日香完全忘记了另外两人，他们全神贯注于彼此，开始更靠近地跳舞，尽力配合迪斯科音乐进行双人舞。

"Dancing like this sucks eh? We need something more like the tango to go on" Asuka declared, getting bored of their ridiculous dancing.  
“这样跳舞真没劲，对吧？我们需要像探戈那样更有感觉的。”明日香宣布道，对他们的滑稽舞步感到厌倦。

As if her wish was granted, some Spanish music came on and Asuka grinned at the boy. Shinji was now terrified to dance with her as he had no choice now but to lead because of his earlier comment.  
仿佛她的愿望得到了回应，一段西班牙音乐响起，明日香对着男孩咧嘴一笑。真嗣现在害怕与她共舞，因为他之前的话让他别无选择，只能担任领舞的角色。

"What are you waiting for Shinji?" Asuka asked, holding out her hand.  
"你在等什么呢，真嗣？" 明日香问道，伸出手来。

"Nothing" he replied, taking her hand.  
"没什么" 他回答，握住了她的手。

Thus, the two eva pilots began actually dancing. Shinji started off simple, just doing a few steps and occasionally twirling her. He then held her around the waist as he curled her next to him before unravelling her outwards. Growing more confident, the boy then began swinging her around a little, the redhead laughing all the while; she was definitely having fun. Shinji then began to dip her and it was now that the two became completely oblivious to their environment. The couple began to pull off a few daring moves and soon a little crowd had formed, watching them dance. It slowly grew larger until Shinji and Asuka were the only ones dancing. At this point, the two eva pilots were dancing really close and the song was almost over. Finishing up, Shinji twirled the redhead all around him before doing a final dip.  
就这样，两位 EVA 驾驶员开始真正地跳舞。真嗣先从简单的动作开始，只是做了几个步子，偶尔旋转她。然后他搂住她的腰，将她卷曲在身边，再慢慢展开。随着自信的增长，男孩开始轻轻地摇摆她，红发女孩一直笑着；她显然玩得很开心。真嗣接着开始让她倾斜，这时两人完全忽略了周围的环境。这对情侣开始表演一些大胆的动作，很快形成了一个小观众群，观看他们跳舞。人群逐渐扩大，直到只剩下真嗣和明日香在跳舞。此时，两位 EVA 驾驶员跳得非常近，歌曲也快结束了。结束时，真嗣将红发女孩绕着自己旋转了一圈，最后做了一个深情的倾斜。

As the rush was over, the two roommates recomposed themselves before suddenly realising everyone was watching them and they both blushed as they became self-conscious.  
随着喧嚣过去，两位室友重新整理好自己，突然意识到大家都在看着他们，两人都因自我意识而脸红。

"What are you all looking at?!" Asuka shouted, glaring at everyone.  
“你们都在看什么？！”明日香喊道，瞪着所有人。

Everyone quickly resumed their previous activities while the two eva pilots walked off the dance floor completely beat and the dance floor was soon full of people dancing again. Shinji and Asuka came back to their friends before plopping down onto their seats.  
众人迅速恢复了之前的状态，两位 EVA 驾驶员疲惫地离开了舞池，不久舞池又挤满了跳舞的人群。真嗣和明日香回到朋友们身边，一屁股坐回座位上。

"I didn't see you guys on the dance floor when we were done. How long did you even dance for you slackers?" Asuka asked.  
"我们跳完舞的时候，舞池里没看到你们啊。你们这些懒虫到底跳了多久？" 明日香问道。

"We danced for… a bit" Hikari answered. "But what does it matter as long as we danced"  
"我们跳了……一会儿" 光回答道。"但只要跳了舞，又有什么关系呢"

"Well sure, you came to a school dance to dance only for _a bit_" Asuka remarked.  
"当然，你们来学校舞会就是为了跳一会儿舞的" 明日香评论道。

"But you two were dancing so well we couldn't compete" Hikari replied.  
"但你们俩跳得那么好，我们根本没法比拼。"光子回答道。

"Yeah, I can't believe you were calling _us_ a couple when you two were definitely hitting it off" Touji commented.  
"是啊，真不敢相信你当时说我们是情侣，你们俩明明就很来电。"东治评论道。

"We were just dancing" both Shinji and Asuka refuted.  
"我们只是在跳舞而已。"真嗣和明日香同时反驳道。

"Well to me, and probably everyone else, it looked like you two were a couple with those moves you were pulling. You guys were so close to each other, I thought you two were grinding" Touji retorted.  
"对我来说，可能对其他人也一样，你们俩看起来就像是一对，那些动作太亲密了。你们靠得那么近，我还以为你们在跳贴面舞呢" 东治反驳道。

"Ridiculous, as if I would ever do that with Shinji. You're just upset than Shinji could dance and you couldn't" Asuka snapped, growing tired of his accusations.  
"荒谬，我怎么可能和真嗣那样。你只是因为真嗣会跳舞而你不会，所以才这么不爽" 明日香厉声回击，对他的指控感到厌烦。

"That wasn't dancing, that was seduction" Touji teased.  
"那不是跳舞，那是诱惑" 东治打趣道。

"That's it, I've had enough! I come here at Hikari's request, she even asked me to bring Shinji along as I can't get in without a guy, and I wanted to at least have some fun. But no, I can't just dance in peace can I?" Asuka blew up.  
“就这样，我受够了！我是应光邀请来的，她甚至让我带上真嗣，因为我不带个男生就进不来，我至少希望能有点乐趣。但不行，我连安安静静跳个舞都不行，对吧？”明日香爆发了。

"Wait Asuka, Touji didn't mean that-" Hikari started.  
“等等，明日香，阿薰不是那个意思——”光开始解释。

"I'm leaving!" the redhead announced, storming off.  
“我要走了！”红发女孩宣布道，气冲冲地离开了。

There was a moment of silence as the temperamental girl disappeared into the crowd of people.  
当那个喜怒无常的女孩消失在人群中时，有那么一刻，四周陷入了沉默。

"Good work Touji" Shinji said, irritated.  
"干得好，东治。" 真嗣带着几分恼怒说道。

"I'm sorry Shin-man. I really was joking. I didn't think she'd go off" Touji replied.  
"对不起，真嗣。我真的是在开玩笑。没想到她会生气走掉。" 东治回答道。

The male eva pilot just sighed; he couldn't really be that angry at his friend, Asuka had overreacted a bit.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员只是叹了口气；他实在无法对朋友生气，明日香确实有点反应过度了。

"Well, she should cool off soon enough, besides, at least I got to dance with her. I was lucky she even came with me" Shinji remarked.  
“嗯，她应该很快就会冷静下来，再说，至少我有机会和她跳舞。她能跟我来已经很幸运了。”真嗣说道。

"Not just that, her dress must have showed off some of her skin and you had front row seats too" Touji teased.  
“不只是跳舞，她的裙子肯定露出了一些肌肤，而且你还有前排座位。”冬二打趣道。

"Touji!" Shinji replied, blushing.  
"托基！" 真嗣回答道，脸红了。

"So how was it?" Touji asked, grinning at Shinji.  
"那么，感觉如何？" 托基问道，对着真嗣咧嘴笑。

"Knock it off Suzuhara, you were only just apologising for making Asuka go off" Hikari snapped, annoyed at his dirty talk.  
"别闹了，铃原，你刚刚才为让明日香生气道歉呢" 光希厉声说道，对他的粗俗言语感到恼火。

"But-" Touji started. "但——" 冬二开口道。

"No, a true gentleman keeps his head clear. I think you should go apologise to Asuka not to Shinji" Hikari interrupted.  
"不，真正的绅士头脑清醒。我认为你应该去向明日香道歉，而不是真嗣" 光子打断道。

"I can't go to Sohryu, she'll kill me" Touji contested.  
"我不能去找惣流，她会杀了我的" 冬二争辩道。

"It's unlikely she'll come back by herself, you need to go get her" Hikari said resolutely.  
"她不太可能自己回来，你得去接她。" 光坚定地说道。

"Look, I'll go find Asuka" Shinji offered, "I am her dance partner after all"  
"看，我会去找明日香。" 真嗣主动提出，"毕竟我是她的舞伴嘛。"

"Thanks man" Touji replied gratefully. "Good luck" he added.  
"谢了，兄弟。" 冬二感激地回答，"祝你好运。" 他又补充道。

"Now that's a true gentleman" Hikari complimented Shinji.  
“这才是真正的绅士。”光称赞了真嗣。

With that, the male eva pilot walked off in search of the redhead. He pushed his way through the crowds of people but was unable to locate her within the school hall. Inferring that Asuka had left the school hall, Shinji then exited the place himself and searched the school grounds hoping that she hadn't gone too far. Fortunately, the boy found Asuka sulking on a bench.  
说完，男性 eva 驾驶员便开始寻找那位红发少女。他挤过人群，但在学校大厅里始终找不到她。推测明日香可能已经离开了学校大厅，真嗣便自己走了出去，在学校操场上寻找，希望她没有走得太远。幸运的是，他发现明日香正闷闷不乐地坐在长椅上。

"Thank goodness, I finally found you Asuka" Shinji called to her.  
“谢天谢地，我终于找到你了，明日香。”真嗣向她喊道。

The redhead turned her head away from him and ignored him. Shinji just continued to walk over to her, wondering how angry she was. When he was standing in front of her, he looked down at the girl.  
红发女孩将头转向一边，不理睬他。真嗣继续向她走去，心中疑惑她到底有多生气。当他站在她面前时，他低头看着这个女孩。

"Are you okay Asuka?" he asked softly.  
“你还好吗，明日香？”他轻声问道。

The girl continued to stay quiet and made no response. Shinji took her chin and gently turned her to face him only to have her turn away again. A little irritated, Shinji then forcefully turned her face towards him and held it in place.  
女孩依旧沉默不语，没有任何回应。真嗣握住她的下巴，轻轻地将她的脸转向自己，却见她再次转过头去。有些恼火，真嗣这次用力将她的脸转向自己，并固定住不让动。

"Stop behaving like this, it wasn't that big of a deal. If something else is bothering you, just tell me" Shinji said firmly.  
"别这样了，没那么严重。如果还有什么事让你烦心，直接告诉我。" 真嗣坚定地说道。

"You know what's bothering me? Everything!" she replied.  
"你知道我在烦什么吗？所有事！" 她回答道。

"Would you mind elaborating a little" Shinji responded, releasing his grip on her chin.  
"能稍微详细说说吗？" 真嗣回应道，松开了握住她下巴的手。

"I know I don't normally care about what others say, but it's just been getting on my nerves recently. I have to go act like a bitch or I can't do anything with you outside of our apartment, yet it also means I can't have fun with you, it's so frustrating. I had no choice but to storm off angry" Asuka explained.  
"我知道我通常不在乎别人怎么说，但最近这真的让我很烦躁。我不得不表现得像个泼妇，否则我们就不能在公寓外做任何事，但这同时也意味着我不能和你一起玩，太令人沮丧了。我别无选择，只能生气地离开。" 明日香解释道。

"Why didn't we just tell them the truth then?" Shinji replied.  
"那我们为什么不直接告诉他们真相呢？" 真嗣回答。

"Because they would rub it in my face and I would have to take back everything I've said, it's just too much to deal with" she answered.  
"因为那样他们会得意忘形，我得收回我说过的一切，这太难应付了。" 她回答。

"I don't think it'd be that bad" Shinji reassured.  
"我觉得不会那么糟糕的。" 真嗣安慰道。

"Yes it would, I'm pretty much just a cute girl with no real friends" she replied.  
"不，会很糟糕的，我基本上只是一个没有真正朋友的可爱女孩。" 她回答说。

"Come on Asuka, Hikari is definitely your friend and even _Touji_ was sorry he made you leave. He was only joking, as usual, so come back Asuka" Shinji implored.  
"别这样，明日香，光绝对是你的朋友，而且就连阿薰也对你离开感到抱歉。他只是像往常一样开玩笑，所以回来吧，明日香。" 真嗣恳求道。

"But I'm deceiving them, living this lie is hard and what happens if they find out the truth?" she refuted.  
"但我欺骗了他们，生活在这样的谎言中很艰难，如果他们发现了真相怎么办？" 她反驳道。

"I'm sure they'd understand why we were hiding this Asuka. Are you just ashamed of being with me?" Shinji asked.  
"我相信他们会理解我们为什么要隐瞒这个，明日香。你只是因为和我在一起而感到羞愧吗？" 真嗣问道。

"No, I'm just ashamed of myself for being so weak" she answered, her voice cracking a little.  
"不，我只是为自己如此软弱而感到羞愧" 她回答，声音有些哽咽。

"Asuka it's ok to be weak sometimes, you even said that you didn't want to be strong anymore" he replied. "And honestly Asuka, given what you've been through, I think you need a rest from being so almighty all the time"  
"明日香，有时候软弱是可以的，你甚至说过你不想再坚强了" 他回答道。"老实说，明日香，考虑到你所经历的一切，我想你需要从一直以来的无所不能中休息一下"

"It's how I've lived my whole life, I can't just…" she said, trailing off.  
"这是我一直以来生活的模式，我不能就这样…" 她说到一半就停住了。

"Asuka, it's only me here, just let it out" Shinji entreated.  
"明日香，这里只有我，就让它发泄出来吧" 真嗣恳求道。

"Just stop it, who wants to love someone weak!" Asuka refuted.  
"别说了，谁会爱一个弱者！" 明日香反驳道。

"I love you even more when you are at your weakest Asuka, just stop holding back" Shinji continued.  
"正是在你最脆弱的时候，我更爱你，明日香，别再压抑自己了。" 真嗣继续说道。

"No… shut up… I-I…" she choked, before her eyes began to water.  
"不…闭嘴…我…" 她哽咽着，泪水开始在眼眶中打转。

The boy embraced the girl tenderly as she desperately fought against her tears, her face buried in his shoulder. He just stayed silent, rubbing her back soothingly. Fortunately, Asuka calmed down shortly preventing any messing up of her makeup. The redhead then quickly moved off Shinji, embarrassed at her display.  
男孩温柔地拥抱着女孩，她拼命忍住泪水，脸埋在他的肩上。他只是静静地站着，轻轻地抚摸她的背以示安慰。幸运的是，明日香很快就平静下来，避免了妆容的凌乱。红发女孩随即迅速离开真嗣，对自己的表现感到尴尬。

"You feel better now?" Shinji asked, seeing that she was feeling better.  
“你现在感觉好些了吗？”真嗣问道，看出她情绪有所好转。

"Yeah, I guess" she said, sniffing a little.  
“嗯，我想是的。”她吸了吸鼻子，轻声回答。

The boy leaned down towards the redhead and gave her a soft kiss on the lips.  
男孩向红发女孩俯下身，轻轻地在她唇上印下一吻。

"God damn you're turning me soft" Asuka said annoyed when they parted. "I would never complain about something so trivial before _and_ you almost made me cry" she added, wiping the water out of her eyes.  
“该死的，你让我变得软弱了。”明日香在他们分开时恼怒地说，“我以前从不会为这种小事抱怨，你几乎让我哭了。”她补充道，擦去眼角的泪水。

Shinji chuckled in response and the two just sat there for a while.  
真嗣轻声笑了笑作为回应，两人就这样静静地坐了一会儿。

"Well, we should get back to the hall soon before they wonder where we are, we don't want any rumours to start now do we?" he replied.  
"嗯，我们该尽快回到大厅去，免得他们好奇我们去了哪儿，现在可不想有什么流言蜚语传开，对吧？" 他回答道。

"Good point" Asuka agreed.  
"说得对" 明日香表示同意。

The two eva pilots returned to school hall together, showing the guard the stamp on their wrists before entering. The two roommates then walked back over to where Touji and Hikari were. The ponytailed girl first noticed the redhead was back and went up to her, hugging her. Touji came up to them next and scratched his head anxiously.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员一同返回学校大厅，向门口的保安展示了手腕上的印章后进入。两位室友随后走向了东治和光的位置。扎着马尾的女孩首先注意到红发少女回来了，上前拥抱了她。东治随后也走了过来，焦虑地挠了挠头。

"Yo Sohryu, sorry about before, it was just a joke" Touji apologised.  
"哟，惣流，之前的事抱歉了，只是开个玩笑。" 冬二道歉道。

"What are you, Shinji?" Asuka remarked, smirking.  
"你这是怎么了，真嗣？" 明日香带着一丝讥讽的微笑说道。

"Hey!" Shinji said, offended.  
"嘿！" 真嗣感到被冒犯地说道。

"Nah, I just didn't mean to make ya go off angry" Touji replied.  
"不，我只是不想让你生气离开。" 冬二回答道。

"Well whatever, it's not every day you show some remorse for your imbecility, so I'll accept your apology" Asuka said, holding out her hand. "But just this once"  
"好吧，不管怎样，你难得为自己的愚蠢感到后悔，我就接受你的道歉吧" 明日香说着，伸出手来。"但仅此一次"

"You can't just humbly accept an apology can you Asuka?" Hikari said, sighing.  
"你不能就这么谦逊地接受道歉，是吧，明日香？" 光子叹了口气说。

"Relax Hikari, she's just teasing me back" Touji said, taking the redhead's hand and shaking it.  
"放松点，光，她只是在回逗我" 冬二说着，握住红发女孩的手摇了摇。

"Guess you do have some intelligent moments after all" Asuka remarked.  
"看来你终究还是有那么几个聪明时刻的" 明日香评论道。

"Well now that everything's settled, let's get back to enjoying ourselves" Shinji suggested.  
"既然现在一切都解决了，我们继续享受吧" 真嗣提议道。

The ponytailed girl looked at her watch and then frowned. "Unfortunately, it's quite late and my parents were adamant about me coming home so I must go" she replied.  
扎着马尾的女孩看了看手表，然后皱起了眉头。“不幸的是，现在很晚了，我父母坚持要我回家，所以我必须走了。”她回答道。

"Then I have to go as well" Touji started, "Besides I can't just let a girl walk alone at this time of night" he finished.  
“那我也得走了，”东治开口道，“再说，我不能让一个女孩在这样的夜晚独自走路。”他补充道。

"I'll take you up on your offer" Hikari replied, smiling.  
“我接受你的提议，”光笑着回答。

The class rep then turned to face the redhead.  
班代表随后转向了红发女孩。

"I guess it's goodbye then Asuka and Shinji, I had a good time, thanks for coming" Hikari thanked.  
“我想这就是再见了吧，明日香和真嗣，我玩得很开心，谢谢你们来。” 光感谢道。

"We really didn't get to talk much but I guess it can't be helped" Asuka said, disappointed. "I guess me and Shinji will leave now as well, at least I got to dance"  
“我们真的没怎么聊到，但我想这也是没办法的事。” 明日香失望地说，“我想我和真嗣也该走了，至少我跳了舞。”

"A good dance it was too. We'll see you two tomorrow" Hikari replied.  
"那舞跳得真不错。我们明天见你们俩。" 光回应道。

"You too" Asuka said in response.  
"你们也是" 明日香回答说。

"Goodbye, both of you!" Shinji added.  
"再见，你们俩！" 真嗣补充道。

"Goodbye" Touji said waving, before walking off with the ponytailed girl.  
“再见” 冬二挥手说道，随后与那位扎马尾的女孩一同离开。

The two eva pilots soon followed suit and exited the school hall before making their way to their apartment.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员很快也跟着离开了学校大厅，前往他们的公寓。

"Well, that was a somewhat nice evening" Asuka said, yawning.  
“嗯，今晚还算不错。” 明日香打了个哈欠说道。

"Yeah, it was fun" Shinji replied. "Are you tired though?"  
"是啊，挺有趣的。" 真嗣回答，"不过你累了吗？"

"Not really, no" Asuka answered.  
"并没有，不累" 明日香回答道。

"Good" he said happily. "那就好" 他开心地说。

"Don't tell me you're still going to-?" she started.  
"别告诉我你还在打算——？" 她开口道。

"It's not the end of the day yet and you did promise" he interrupted.  
"今天还没结束呢，你确实答应过" 他打断道。

"Quite…" she said, trailing off.  
"确实……" 她话音渐弱。

They walked the rest of the way without saying another word; they had said enough for the day. Upon arriving at the apartment building, they took the elevator up to their floor and went to their door. After entering their residence, they locked their door before checking Misato's bedroom to see if she was still sleeping; fortunately for them she was.  
他们一路沉默地走完剩下的路程；今天已经说得够多了。到达公寓楼后，他们乘电梯上了楼层，走到自家门前。进入住所后，他们先锁上门，然后去查看美里是否还在睡觉；幸运的是，她还在睡。

Moving back to the living room, the boy then wrapped his arms around Asuka's waist and held her tenderly. As Shinji embraced the girl, he gently kissed her neck and shoulders while moving one hand up to her chest. The boy fondled her breast and the redhead let out a moan. Removing her gloves, the girl threw them behind her onto the couch. Taking the hint, Shinji then began to pull off Asuka's dress as she held her arms up to make it easier for him before placing it behind him on the couch. Removing the dress left the redhead standing there clad only in her underwear and stockings. The boy then unclasped her bra, dropping it to the floor, while she took off earrings and threw them behind her. Asuka gasped as she felt his cold hands grasp her breasts, making her nipples erect.  
回到客厅，男孩随即用双臂环抱住明日香的腰，温柔地拥抱着她。当真嗣拥抱着女孩时，他轻轻地吻着她的脖颈和肩膀，同时一只手向上移动到她的胸前。男孩抚弄着她的乳房，红发女孩发出了一声呻吟。她摘下手套，随手扔在沙发上。真嗣领会了她的暗示，开始帮她脱下裙子，明日香举起双臂方便他动作，随后裙子也被扔在了沙发上。脱下裙子后，红发女孩只穿着内衣和丝袜站在那里。男孩解开她的胸罩，让它掉落在地，而她则摘下耳环，同样扔在身后。明日香倒吸一口气，感受到他冰冷的双手握住她的乳房，使她的乳头变得坚挺。

"Cold!" she exclaimed. “好冷！”她惊呼道。

"Well, we were outside at night for a while" he replied.  
"嗯，我们晚上在外面待了一会儿" 他回答道。

Shinji then softly pinched the girl's nipples eliciting a tiny squeak from her. Moving one hand down teasingly towards her lower region, he made sure to tickle her belly button on the way down causing the redhead to grunt disapprovingly. When Shinji reached Asuka's panties, he noticed her stockings, held up by garters, were blocking the removal of her underwear. The boy then pulled down her garters and stockings before slipping her panties off, leaving her completely naked. Having liked how sexy she had looked with the stockings on, he made the redhead lift her legs again and pulled the garters back up with the stockings now that her panties were off.  
真嗣轻轻捏了捏女孩的乳头，引得她发出一声微弱的尖叫。他一只手缓缓向下移动，挑逗地接近她的下体，途中还不忘挠她的肚脐，让红发女孩不满地哼了一声。当真嗣触到明日香的底裤时，他注意到她的长筒袜被吊袜带固定着，阻碍了脱下内裤。于是，男孩先解开她的吊袜带和长筒袜，然后脱下她的底裤，让她完全赤裸。他喜欢她穿上长筒袜时的性感模样，于是让红发女孩再次抬起双腿，重新拉上吊袜带和长筒袜，现在她的底裤已经脱掉了。

"You're leaving them on?" Asuka questioned.  
"你要留着它们吗？" 明日香问道。

"Yeah, I like how they look on you" he replied.  
"是啊，我觉得它们穿在你身上很好看" 他回答道。

Putting his arms around her waist again, Shinji held her tightly while the girl tensed slightly. The boy found her anxiety puzzling and reached down to tenderly stroke her pussy.  
再次将双臂环绕在她的腰间，真嗣紧紧地抱着她，而女孩的身体微微紧绷。男孩对她的紧张感到不解，便伸手温柔地抚摸她的私处。

"Why are you so nervous?" he asked her.  
"你为什么这么紧张？" 他问她。

"It's finally time. I don't know what to expect from you" she answered.  
“终于到时候了。我不知道该对你有什么期待。”她回答道。

At this, Shinji smiled slightly, amused that she was still expecting some perverted fantasy to be fulfilled with her. He then picked the redhead up and carried her over to his room before opening the door with his foot. Laying her down on his bed he then promptly removed all his clothes. Taking in the sight of Asuka, Shinji grew fully erect; she was stark naked save for the stockings with the black-laced garters on top. Moving on top of the girl, Shinji looked down into her face as he loved to watch the girl's facial expressions as he had his way with her.  
听到这话，真嗣微微一笑，觉得她还在期待某种变态的幻想得以实现。他随即抱起红发女孩，把她带到自己的房间，用脚踢开门。将她放在床上后，他迅速脱掉了所有的衣服。看着眼前的明日香，真嗣完全勃起了；她一丝不挂，除了那双黑色蕾丝吊袜带的上袜。他压在女孩身上，低头看着她的脸，他喜欢在她身上为所欲为时观察她的表情。

_'One of these days, I'll probably become your slave anyway'_ Shinji thought dryly.  
“总有一天，我大概会成为你的奴隶吧。”真嗣干巴巴地想。

The boy then moved his mouth down to nuzzle her neck while fingering her pussy causing the redhead to gasp again.  
男孩接着将嘴移到她的脖颈处轻蹭，同时用手指抚弄她的私处，让红发女孩再次倒吸一口气。

"Your fingers are cold" she remarked.  
“你的手指好凉。”她评论道。

"Let's warm them up then" he replied, pushing his fingers in deeper, making Asuka moan louder.  
“那我们就来暖暖它们。”他回答，将手指更深地推进，让明日香发出更响亮的呻吟。

"I don't get it Shinji" Asuka started hesitantly. "What are we going to do?" she asked, unable to contain the burning question any longer.  
"我不明白，真嗣。" 明日香犹豫地开口，"我们该怎么办？" 她终于忍不住问出了那个迫切的问题。

"We are just going to make love Asuka" he answered.  
"我们只是要相爱，明日香。" 他回答道。

"That's it?" she asked in disbelief.  
"就这样？" 她难以置信地问。

"Yep, I prefer to just have normal sex on a bed, all that slave stuff was just for fun and to keep you in obedience, you definitely made my day enjoyable" he explained.  
“没错，我更喜欢在床上正常做爱，那些奴隶的事情只是为了好玩，让你保持顺从，你确实让我的日子过得愉快。”他解释道。

"Honest to God Shinji, you really are a manipulative bastard" she said glaring at him, annoyed at how he had fooled her.  
“老实说，真嗣，你真是个操纵人心的混蛋。”她瞪着他，对他愚弄她感到恼火。

The boy just grinned at her response before positioning his member at her entrance and pushing slowly into her wet pussy, watching her intently. The redhead moaned erotically at the penetration and arched her back slightly. Shinji then fondled her breasts gently, just enjoying the moment. He could not take his eyes off Asuka as she looked up at him with longing; she was just so beautiful. However, the boy could see the girl was growing restless and surmised that she could not stand the current slow pace. Smirking a little, he then leant down and kissed her ardently.  
男孩对她的话只是咧嘴一笑，然后将他的阴茎对准她的入口，缓缓推进她湿润的阴部，目不转睛地看着她。红发女孩因插入而发出色情的呻吟，微微弓起背部。真嗣随后轻轻抚摸她的乳房，只是享受这一刻。他的目光无法从阿斯卡身上移开，她抬头望着他，眼中充满渴望；她是如此美丽。然而，男孩看出女孩变得焦躁不安，推测她无法忍受当前的缓慢节奏。他微微一笑，然后俯身热情地吻了她。

"You love it rough, don't you?" he asked her.  
"你喜欢粗暴的，对吧？" 他问她。

Irritated at his games, Asuka pushed him back onto the bed and moved on top of him. She vivaciously forced her lips onto his and began tracing circles on his chest.  
对他的游戏感到恼火，明日香将他推回床上，跨坐在他身上。她热情地将自己的唇压在他的唇上，开始在他胸前画圈。

"Damn straight I like it rough" she replied after parting.  
"没错，我就喜欢粗暴的" 她在分开后回答道。

Hearing this, Shinji pushed the girl back onto the bed before shoving his cock deep into her vagina. The redhead cried out in a mixture of pleasure and pain as the boy began to speed up his thrusts. This time, he roughly squeezed her breasts and pinched her nipples as he pumped into her. Asuka wrapped her legs around the boy, moaning and crying out with each penetration, her expression showing how lost in the passion she was. Shinji was exhausted from all the sex they already had today and soon came, unable to keep up any longer. Asuka too, was also exhausted and managed to orgasm at the exact same time and the two held onto each other as they climaxed together. The boy then moved off of the redhead and sat down on the edge of the bed, puffing a little.  
听到这话，真嗣将女孩推回床上，随即猛地将他的阴茎深深插入她的阴道。红发女孩在快感和痛楚的交织中尖叫起来，随着男孩加快抽插速度，他粗鲁地揉捏着她的乳房，并拧掐她的乳头。明日香用双腿缠绕住男孩，每一次插入都伴随着呻吟和呼喊，她的表情显露出她已完全沉溺于激情之中。真嗣因今天已有的多次性爱而筋疲力尽，不久便射精了，无法再继续下去。明日香也同样疲惫不堪，恰好在同一时刻达到了高潮，两人紧紧相拥，共同达到顶峰。随后，男孩从红发女孩身上移开，坐在床边，微微喘息。

"Well, that's the end of your slave day" Shinji said matter-of-factly without turning his head to face her.  
“好吧，你的奴隶日结束了。”真嗣直截了当地说，没有回头看她。

"Thank God" Asuka replied, relieved.  
“谢天谢地。”明日香回答，感到如释重负。

"Don't tell me you didn't enjoy it" the boy teased.  
"别告诉我你不喜欢" 男孩打趣道。

"As if" she refuted, a small smirk on her face.  
"怎么可能" 她反驳道，脸上带着一丝微笑。

"Unfortunate, but at least one of us did and you certainly kept up your end of the bet splendidly. As a reward, I'll carry you to your room my princess" Shinji replied.  
"虽然不幸，但至少我们中有一个享受了，而且你确实出色地完成了赌注。作为奖励，我会把你抱到你的房间，我的公主" 真嗣回答道。

"Maybe any other girl would find you charming, but I just think you're annoying. Shut up with that corny crap and just take me to my bed" the girl snapped.  
“也许其他女孩会觉得你迷人，但我觉得你烦人。别再说那些老套的话了，直接带我去我的床。”女孩厉声说道。

"As you wish" Shinji replied.  
“如你所愿。”真嗣回答道。

The boy then picked up the tired girl and carried her over to her room, before laying her down on her bed.  
男孩随后抱起疲惫的女孩，将她带到她的房间，轻轻地让她躺在床上。

"Take off my stockings too please" the girl said, yawning.  
“请也帮我脱掉丝袜。”女孩打着哈欠说道。

The boy pulled off Asuka's black stockings and just threw them onto the floor. The redhead then got under her covers and stretched her arms.  
男孩脱下了明日香的黑丝袜，随手扔在地上。红发女孩随后钻进被窝，伸展了一下双臂。

"Goodnight Asuka, sweet dreams" Shinji told her.  
“晚安，明日香，愿你有个好梦。”真嗣对她说。

"You too, now let me get some sleep" she replied.  
"你也是，现在让我睡会儿" 她回答道。

With that, Shinji exited her room and went back to his. Lying down on his bed, the boy got under his covers and thought about the day. Fortunately, it seemed Asuka had totally forgotten about her momentary depression yesterday, this whole thing had started because of it and he had gone against Misato's wishes too, but he believed it was worth it. The guilt he had felt since yesterday had disappeared when he saw Asuka's content smile as she went to sleep. It was now that Shinji was finally able to close his eyes and follow her into slumber.  
说完，真嗣离开了她的房间，回到自己的房间。躺在床上，男孩钻进被窝，回想着这一天。幸运的是，明日香似乎完全忘记了昨天短暂的沮丧，这一切都是因它而起，他也违背了美里小姐的意愿，但他相信这是值得的。自从昨天以来他感到的内疚，在看到明日香入睡时满足的微笑后消失了。现在，真嗣终于能够闭上眼睛，跟随她进入梦乡。

### Chapter 8: When the Past catches up to the Present  
第八章：当过去追上现在

Darkness assailed him. Staring into the pitch-black surroundings was truly quite depressing. He wasn't sure how many days had past as he had lost count, and there was nothing to keep track with. The boy was alone in his confinement with no visitors and food was served through a small compartment. He really hadn't understood at all what he was getting into at first. The boy had known it wasn't going to be pleasant, but the reality turned out to be far worse.  
黑暗侵袭着他。凝视着这漆黑一片的环境，实在令人倍感压抑。他已记不清过去了多少天，因为无从计数。男孩独自被囚禁，无人探访，食物通过一个小口递入。起初，他完全不明白自己陷入了怎样的境地。男孩知道这不会是什么愉快的事，但现实却远比想象中更为糟糕。

Shinji took in a deep breath to calm himself, trying to prevent himself for the umpteenth time from having a nervous breakdown. This feeling of being trapped and unable to escape was horrifying, and perhaps was a small taste of what Asuka had felt as he overpowered her that fateful day. Asuka, thinking about her certainly gave a warm sort of comfort, but also a sickening feeling of guilt as he recalled why he was here in the first place; he had raped her. There was no excuse for his wrongdoings, this dark empty room was a painful reminder of that. He thought back to the day when Misato came into their residence with Section 2 agents and handcuffed him, Shinji hadn't put up any resistance as they took him away but he remembered the sad look on Asuka's face as she tried to stop them. Their guardian held back the redhead, telling her it would be ok and comforting her; ah, if only he could do that. That warm embrace and those soothing words were what Asuka should have had immediately after the ordeal, instead she had suffered alone that afternoon, much like he was now.  
真嗣深吸一口气，试图让自己平静下来，以防第无数次陷入神经崩溃。这种被困住且无法逃脱的感觉令人恐惧，或许只是那命运之日他制服明日香时她所感受到的一丝滋味。想到明日香，确实带来一种温暖的慰藉，但同时也涌上一股令人作呕的罪恶感，因为他回想起自己来到这里的初衷；他强奸了她。他的错误无可辩解，这间黑暗空荡的房间痛苦地提醒着这一点。他回想起那天，美里带着第二课的特工进入他们的住所并给他戴上手铐，真嗣没有反抗，任由他们带走，但他记得明日香试图阻止他们时脸上悲伤的表情。他们的监护人拦住了红发的她，告诉她一切都会好起来并安慰她；啊，要是他能那样做该多好。那个温暖的拥抱和那些抚慰的话语，本应在事件发生后立即给予明日香，而不是让她独自承受那个下午，就像他现在这样。

Misato went with the young boy as the Section 2 agents escorted him to their car and drove him to NERV. The purple haired woman was talking to him the entire way, trying to keep Shinji calm, helping him to understand the necessity of the situation. The boy didn't have any reason to protest, he was certainly fearful, but he knew that everything comes with a price; and this was a small price to pay, all things considered. His guardian had stayed with him until the final moment up to when they finally placed him into the cell and closed the door. Misato had told him that he would be in there for a few weeks, no one was allowed to visit him and that he should use the time to reflect on what he'd done. After just a few minutes inside, the weight of the situation finally registered and he began to sob. Not only because of the regret for his crime, but because he wouldn't be able to see nor talk to Asuka.  
美里陪着那个小男孩，第二课的特工们护送他上了车，驱车前往 NERV。紫发女子一路上都在与他交谈，试图让真嗣保持冷静，帮助他理解当前情况的必要性。男孩没有理由抗议，他确实感到害怕，但他明白凡事都有代价；考虑到一切，这只是个小代价。他的监护人一直陪在他身边，直到最后他被送进牢房，门被关上。美里告诉他，他将在那里待上几周，不允许任何人探访，他应该利用这段时间反思自己的所作所为。仅仅几分钟之后，情况的严重性终于在他心中沉淀下来，他开始啜泣。不仅是因为对自己罪行的悔恨，更因为他将无法见到也无法与明日香交谈。

Shinji pondered briefly how she was coping. He hoped she wasn't in great pain; he certainly would be if their roles were reversed. Having had so much time to think, concerning thoughts wondered by in his head as well. Maybe with the separation, Asuka would realise what a horrible human being he was and decide she didn't want him after all. Maybe she never wanted to look at him again. These thoughts were agonising but he couldn't stop them. The night he raped her had replayed in his head so many times now, that he completely understood without a doubt what evil he had done. Shinji couldn't believe he had done such a thing, he had even strangled and physically hurt her in addition to forcing himself on her. He just held his head in his hands and cried again, deeply lamenting his actions.  
真嗣短暂地思索着她如何应对这一切。他希望她没有承受太大的痛苦；如果角色互换，他自己肯定会痛不欲生。经过这么多时间的沉思，种种忧虑也在他脑海中徘徊。也许随着分离，明日香会意识到他是个多么糟糕的人，并最终决定不再需要他。也许她再也不想见到他。这些念头令他痛苦不堪，却又无法抑制。那个强暴她的夜晚在他脑海中重播了无数次，他无比确信自己犯下了多么邪恶的罪行。真嗣无法相信自己竟做出了那样的事，他不仅强迫了她，还掐住她的脖子，对她造成了身体上的伤害。他只是双手抱头，再次痛哭，深切地悔恨自己的行为。

One thing for sure was that when he got out of here, whenever that was, he would sincerely apologise to Asuka. Not a simple one in recognition of doing something bad, but a deep, profound apology with the recognition of committing an atrocious offence. Even if she hated him after having had some time to herself, it didn't matter, it was only just. Finally calming down in the darkness and eerie silence, the boy felt around for his bed and laid down on it.  
可以肯定的是，无论何时他离开这里，他都会真诚地向明日香道歉。不仅仅是因为承认做了坏事，而是深刻、沉重的道歉，意识到自己犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。即使她独自一人后开始憎恨他，那也无所谓，这是他应得的。最终在黑暗与诡异的寂静中平静下来，男孩摸索着找到自己的床，躺了上去。

After his time in the sea of Dirac, where he had been all alone for hours, it was a wonder this prison time wasn't driving Shinji crazy. However, it seemed that his time there had just better prepared his mind for these sorts of situations. Even so, being alone in this darkness for so long was certainly taking its toll on the boy. He really wanted to talk to someone, anyone. How he longed to see Asuka and Misato and his friends. Shinji wondered what excuse they told his friends for his absence, though it didn't really matter either way. He would even happily talk to his father, not that it would be much of a talk, but even that tiny bit of interaction would be better than his current situation. _'I wonder what my father thought of my imprisonment… does he even know I'm here?'_ he thought. _'He must know, Misato wouldn't have been able to imprison an eva pilot without authorisation. He must think I'm a garbage human being…'_  
在狄拉克之海度过的那些时光，他独自一人度过了无数个小时，令人惊讶的是，这段监狱时光并没有让真嗣发疯。然而，似乎在那里度过的时光只是更好地锻炼了他的心智，以应对这类情况。即便如此，长时间独自在这黑暗中，无疑对少年产生了影响。他真的很想和某个人，任何人说说话。他多么渴望见到明日香、美里和朋友们。真嗣不知道他们用什么借口向他的朋友们解释他的缺席，尽管无论如何这并不重要。他甚至愿意愉快地与父亲交谈，尽管那不会是一次真正的对话，但即使是那一点点互动也比他现在的处境要好。'我想知道父亲对我的监禁有什么看法……他甚至知道我在这里吗？'他想着。'他一定知道，美里没有授权是不可能监禁一个 EVA 驾驶员的。他一定认为我是个垃圾人类……'

Shinji sighed aloud in sadness, he knew he deserved this punishment, but it had felt like ages already. The sentence for his crime was typically years, so he was getting off relatively easy, but even so, he couldn't take much more of this isolation.  
真嗣悲伤地大声叹息，他知道自己应受此罚，但感觉已经过了很久。对他的罪行的通常判决是数年，所以他算是相对轻松地逃脱了，但即便如此，他无法再忍受更多的孤独。

"I'm so… so sorry Asuka… you suffered so much…" he said aloud, his eyes tearing up.  
“我真的很……很抱歉，明日香……你受了那么多苦……”他大声说道，眼中泛起泪光。

Shinji began to sob, for perhaps the hundredth time since being in the cell. It was practically every day that he would cry himself to sleep and this time was no different. The final thoughts running through his mind just before he surrendered to sleep was wishing for Asuka's happiness.  
真嗣又开始啜泣，自从被关进牢房以来，这或许已经是第一百次了。几乎每天他都会哭着入睡，这次也不例外。在他屈服于睡意之前的最后念头，是希望明日香能幸福。

---

Shinji awoke instantly in the darkness as he heard a loud sound. He opened his eyes groggily, not that he could see anything by doing so. The boy wondered what that sound had been, when he noticed a small sliver of light coming from the door to the cell.  
真嗣在黑暗中瞬间惊醒，因为他听到了一声巨响。他睡眼惺忪地睁开眼睛，尽管这样做他也看不见任何东西。男孩想知道那声音是什么，这时他注意到牢房门缝中透出一丝微光。

"Hurry and open this door already!" a female voice said aloud. "I want to see him right now!"  
"快点把这门打开！" 一个女声大声说道，"我现在就要见他！"

That voice! It couldn't be? It sounded just like her.  
那个声音！不可能吧？听起来简直就像她。

The door quickly swung open, and light painfully assaulted his eyes, forcing Shinji to cover his face. However, he was soon surprised to have someone tackle him and embrace him strongly.  
门迅速被打开，光线刺痛了他的眼睛，迫使真嗣捂住脸。然而，他很快惊讶地被某人扑倒并紧紧拥抱。

"Shinji! It's so good to see you again!" Asuka said, gripping him tightly; it would seem the redhead had really missed the boy.  
"真嗣！再次见到你真是太好了！" 明日香紧紧地抱住他；看来这位红发女孩真的很想念这个男孩。

Shinji himself was so utterly confused, after having been all alone in the darkness for so long, he thought he might be dreaming; it was just too good to be true.  
真嗣自己则完全摸不着头脑，在黑暗中独自度过了那么久，他以为自己可能在做梦；这一切美好得令人难以置信。

"A-Asuka?" the boy asked, wanting to know if it was really her.  
"明日香？" 男孩问道，想知道是否真的是她。

"Who else you baka?" she replied. "Although, I suppose I should be a little understanding, you've been in this cell for three weeks" she explained.  
"除了你这个笨蛋还有谁？" 她回答道。"不过，我想我应该稍微理解一下，你已经被关在这个牢房里三个星期了" 她解释说。

"Asuka, it's really you… it's really you" he responded, hugging her back firmly. He couldn't stop the tears from falling as he wept, holding onto the girl.  
"明日香，真的是你……真的是你" 他回应着，紧紧地拥抱她。他无法止住泪水，哭泣着，紧紧抱住那个女孩。

"Shinji… it's ok… I'm here" Asuka said soothingly. The girl realised the poor boy must have suffered quite a deal being locked up in here. She hadn't wanted Misato to imprison him, but she understood why Misato did it and didn't have the authority to stop her anyway.  
"真嗣……没事的……我在这里" 明日香温柔地说。女孩意识到这个可怜的男孩一定在这里受了不少苦。她并不希望美里将他关起来，但她理解美里为什么这么做，而且她也没有权力阻止她。

"No… it's not that" Shinji said, sitting up, straightening himself and looking at the girl. Now that his eyes had better adjusted to the light, he could see her worried expression directed at him and the guilt he had accumulated in prison overcame him. "I… am so sorry Asuka… what I did to you… that was so fucked up… I can't stop crying every time I think about what you went through, how powerless you must have felt…" he finally said.  
"不…不是那样的" 真嗣说道，坐起身来，整理了一下自己，看着女孩。现在他的眼睛已经更好地适应了光线，他能看到她担忧的表情正对着他，监狱中积累的愧疚感涌上心头。"我…真的很抱歉，明日香…我对你所做的一切…那真是太糟糕了…每次想到你所经历的，你当时一定感到多么无助…我就无法停止哭泣…"他终于说道。

"Shinji… I've already forgiven you. Yes, it was horrifying at the time, but I know you genuinely regretted it. Thank you for your apology, I really appreciate it" Asuka replied sincerely, caressing the boy's cheek. She wasn't typically one to be so affectionate, but the boy sounded so… broken.  
"真嗣…我已经原谅你了。是的，当时确实很可怕，但我知道你真的后悔了。谢谢你的道歉，我真的很感激" 明日香真诚地回答，轻抚着男孩的脸颊。她通常不是一个这么亲昵的人，但男孩的声音听起来如此…破碎。

"I'm so glad you're ok Asuka… I wanted to see you so much… I just had to tell you all that. Thank you for everything…" he said, embracing the redhead once again.  
"我很高兴你没事，明日香…我非常想见你…我只是必须告诉你这一切。谢谢你的一切…" 他说着，再次拥抱了红发女孩。

The two stayed like that in silence for a few minutes before another voice spoke. "Is he alright Asuka?" the female voice asked hesitantly.  
两人就这样沉默地待了几分钟，直到另一个声音响起。“他没事吧，明日香？”那个女声犹豫地问道。

The two eva pilots stayed holding one another while Asuka replied "He's pretty down, but otherwise all good"  
两位 EVA 驾驶员继续相拥，明日香回答道：“他情绪很低落，但除此之外一切都好。”

"I'm coming in" Misato announced back.  
“我进来了。”美里宣布道。

The older woman came into the cell and her eyes fell upon her two wards holding onto each other. Misato couldn't really see Shinji's face, but she could tell he was downcast; it seemed his time in here had certainly been hard on him. She momentarily felt regret for doing this to him but remembering what Asuka had been through soon wiped it away. Still, he had taken on the punishment without resistance and Asuka had forgiven him. Misato was sure he had come to understand the seriousness of his actions during his time here. With these thoughts in mind, she walked over to the two and embraced both of them warmly.  
年长的女人走进牢房，目光落在紧紧相拥的两个孩子身上。美里看不清真嗣的脸，但能感觉到他情绪低落；看来他在这里的日子确实不好过。她短暂地感到后悔，但想到明日香经历的一切，这种感觉很快消失了。尽管如此，他没有反抗就接受了惩罚，明日香也原谅了他。美里确信，他在此期间已经明白了行为的严重性。带着这些想法，她走向两人，热情地拥抱了他们。

"Hey Shinji" Misato started. "I'm here to take you back home" she said tenderly.  
“嘿，真嗣。”美里开口道，“我来带你回家。”她温柔地说。

Shinji looked up at his guardian and smiled weakly. "Thank you Misato… for everything. I took so much for granted, and I did something horrendous to Asuka. I felt so defeated and depressed in here, but I'm grateful that I was able to come to terms with what I had done… I can see just how much you care about Asuka too… I'm so glad" the boy finished, before weeping again.  
真嗣抬头看着他的监护人，虚弱地笑了笑。“谢谢你，美里……为了这一切。我之前太不懂得珍惜，对明日香做了那么可怕的事。在这里，我感到无比挫败和沮丧，但我很感激能够面对我所做的一切……我能看出你有多关心明日香……我真的很高兴。”男孩说完，再次哭泣起来。

Misato couldn't help sobbing herself at his words, any remaining anger at him completely disappearing as she held onto them both even tighter. The trio stayed like that without a word for a few minutes, not wanting to break the serenity between them. The older woman stood up, breaking off the embrace.  
听到他的话，美里忍不住哭了起来，对他仅存的一丝怒气也随着她更加紧紧地拥抱他们而烟消云散。三人就这样静静地待了几分钟，谁也不愿打破这份宁静。年长的女子站起身，结束了拥抱。

"Come on Shinji, let's go home" Misato announced.  
“来吧，真嗣，我们回家。”美里宣布道。

At this, the redhead also stood up, holding her hand out to the boy to help him up.  
听到这话，红发女子也站了起来，向男孩伸出手，帮助他起身。

"Let's go baka, I'm sure you're dying to leave here" Asuka offered. "I'm not sure I can take another day of Misato's cooking" she joked.  
"走吧，笨蛋，我知道你肯定迫不及待想离开这儿了" 明日香提议道。"我可不确定还能再忍受一天美里做的饭" 她开玩笑说。

"Hey!" Misato shot back. "嘿！" 美里反击道。

A soft chuckle could be heard coming from Shinji, the first uplifting sign from the boy since they opened the cell. "Yes, let's go" he said, taking Asuka's hand and standing up.  
一阵轻笑从真嗣那里传来，这是自他们打开牢房以来，男孩的第一个振奋迹象。"好，我们走吧" 他说着，握住明日香的手站了起来。

The three of them exited the cell with Misato in front while Shinji and Asuka held hands. The purple haired woman led them out of the prison and down a corridor towards the elevator. After weeks in the darkness of the cell, even the dreary lighting in the NERV corridor was a welcome sight for the boy. Shinji turned to look at Asuka, noticing her features focused on looking ahead, the lights from above shining on her magnificent red hair as she walked forward. The young girl looked attractive as always, a desire not felt for these past weeks suddenly stirring up inside him. Guilt flowed through him as he remembered why he had been here in the first place and quickly quelled his urges.  
三人中由美里带头走出牢房，真嗣和明日香手牵手紧随其后。紫发女子引领他们穿过监狱，沿着走廊向电梯走去。在黑暗的牢房中度过了数周后，即便是 NERV 走廊里阴沉的灯光，对男孩来说也显得格外亲切。真嗣转头看向明日香，注意到她的目光专注地直视前方，头顶的灯光洒在她那耀眼的红色长发上，随着她的步伐闪耀。这位年轻女孩一如既往地迷人，过去几周未曾有过的渴望突然在他心中涌动。想到自己为何会身陷此地，愧疚感涌上心头，他迅速压制住了那些冲动。

Asuka had noticed him staring at her in her peripheral vision and turned to face him grinning. "Did you forget how beautiful I am or something Shinji?" she said with a hint of teasing.  
明日香察觉到他在用余光偷看自己，便转过头来，带着一丝戏谑的笑容。“你是忘了我有多美吗，真嗣？”她带着几分调侃说道。

Shinji blushed and turned away. "I-err umm" he stammered. "I-I could never forget such a thing… I'm just glad that you're not a dream" he finished.  
真嗣脸颊泛红，别过头去。“我、呃，嗯……”他结巴着，“我怎么可能忘记这种事……我只是很高兴你不是一场梦。”他最终说道。

At this, the redhead flicked him on the forehead painfully. "This ain't no dream baka, unfortunately" she said with a mock sigh. "You're in for a lot of housework when you get back, the place is a total mess. Without our little housewife, things just fell apart" she teased. "And to think I'm together with a moron like you… how unfortunate this isn't a dream" she finished, sticking her tongue out at him.  
听到这话，红发女孩狠狠地弹了他的额头一下。“这可不是什么梦啊，笨蛋，”她假装叹了口气说，“你回来后可有得忙了，家里一团糟。没有我们的小主妇，事情全乱套了。”她打趣道，“想想我和你这样的傻瓜在一起……真希望这不是梦。”她最后说道，冲他吐了吐舌头。

Shinji couldn't help but smile at her words; he knew she was trying to cheer him up and help him forget about his past few weeks. It reminded him that he really did love her, and he had missed her sharp wit.  
听到她的话，真嗣忍不住笑了；他知道她是在试图让他振作起来，帮他忘记过去几周的烦恼。这让他想起他确实深爱着她，也想念她那犀利的幽默感。

"Yeah, I guess you're just hopeless without me" Shinji replied, grinning mischievously.  
“是啊，没有我，你真是没救了。”真嗣回答道，狡黠地笑了笑。

"Hmpf… I'll let you win this one third child, but that's just because I'm feeling generous today" she retorted half joking, squeezing his hand.  
"哼…这次就让你赢吧，三弟，不过只是因为我今天心情好而已。"她半开玩笑地反驳道，紧握着他的手。

"Thank you for your generosity Asuka" he responded sarcastically.  
"多谢你的慷慨，明日香。"他讽刺地回应。

"You're welcome" she responded just as sarcastically.  
"不客气。"她同样讽刺地回答。

The two of them started giggling at each other, both feeling much more at ease.  
两人相视而笑，彼此都感到轻松了许多。

The Major in front couldn't help but overhear their conversation and smiled at their antics. It was reassuring to see they were still on such good terms; she had been worried their relationship would've been strained but alas, they were both much stronger than she gave them credit for. Misato resolved to improve herself and be as good a guardian as she could for the two of them. She had been negligent before, but she would not make the same mistake twice; she would be there for them when they needed her and she would do her best to keep them safe.  
前面的少校无意中听到了他们的对话，对他们的举动报以微笑。看到他们关系依旧如此融洽，她感到安心；她曾担心他们的关系会变得紧张，但事实证明，他们都比她想象的要坚强得多。美里决心提升自己，尽她所能成为他们俩的好守护者。她以前有所疏忽，但她不会再犯同样的错误；她会在他们需要时陪伴左右，并竭尽全力保护他们。

The three of them finally reached the elevator and they all entered inside, with Misato pressing the floor number for the car park. Shinji let go of Asuka's hand and leant against the wall of the elevator, closing his eyes; the light in the elevator was just a bit too bright for him at the moment. Seeing the boy like that, the other two decided to give him some peace for now; they figured he would be more relaxed when they got back home. The trio waited in silence until the elevator reached their floor. At this, Shinji opened his eyes again and they all exited the elevator with Misato motioning to them to follow her to the car.  
三人终于抵达电梯前，一同步入其中，美里按下了停车场楼层的按钮。真嗣松开了明日香的手，靠在电梯墙上，闭上了眼睛；此刻电梯内的灯光对他来说稍显刺眼。看到男孩这般模样，另外两人决定暂时不打扰他，他们认为回到家中他会更放松些。三人沉默地等待着，直到电梯到达他们的楼层。这时，真嗣再次睁开眼，他们随着美里的示意，一同走出电梯，跟随她前往车辆处。

As Misato got into the car, the two eva pilots got into the back, sitting next to each other. Driving out of NERV, they began their trip back home with Misato driving much less crazy than usual out of respect for Shinji. The boy turned to face the redhead, admiring her graceful features and familiar face; he really wanted to kiss her, it had been so long after all. Shinji moved his face closer to hers unconsciously, Asuka noticed of course and cheekily brought her lips to his in a kiss, surprising him a little. The two of them stayed lip locked for a few minutes before parting.  
当美里坐进车里，两位 EVA 驾驶员也坐到了后排，彼此相邻。驶出 NERV，他们开始了回家的旅程，美里开车比平时稳重许多，以示对真嗣的尊重。男孩转向红发女孩，欣赏着她优雅的容貌和熟悉的脸庞；他真的很想吻她，毕竟已经很久了。真嗣不自觉地将脸靠近她的，明日香当然注意到了，俏皮地将自己的唇贴上他的，让他有些惊讶。两人唇齿相依了几分钟才分开。

"I… umm…" Shinji started, lost for words.  
“我……呃……”真嗣开口，却一时语塞。

"Don't worry, I know you missed kissing me" Asuka teased.  
“别担心，我知道你想吻我。”明日香打趣道。

"Did I ever" he replied earnestly, giving her a quick peck. "I missed you immensely" he said sincerely, causing the redhead to blush a little.  
"当然有" 他认真地回答，迅速在她唇上轻啄一下。"我非常想念你" 他诚挚地说道，让红发女孩微微脸红。

"Jeez, stop saying such embarrassing things!" she responded.  
"天哪，别再说这么让人害羞的话了！" 她回应道。

"Sor-" he started, before Asuka scowled at him; damn he forgot she disliked him apologising. "I was just going to say that I'm still a bit out of it… I don't even know what day it is today" he explained.  
"对-" 他刚开口，就被明日香瞪了一眼；该死，他忘了她不喜欢他道歉。"我只是想说我还不太在状态…我甚至不知道今天是星期几" 他解释道。

"It's Sunday actually, in the afternoon" Asuka answered. "But don't worry, Misato already said you can take tomorrow off school while you become re-accustomed… though I'm pretty sure it's just an excuse so you can clean the place up" she said mischievously.  
"实际上今天是星期天，下午。" 明日香回答道，"不过别担心，美里已经说过你可以明天不去学校，让你重新适应一下……虽然我敢肯定这只是个借口，让你来打扫这个地方" 她调皮地说。

"I heard that!" Misato shouted angrily.  
"我听到了！" 美里生气地喊道。

"I'm just kidding woman, calm down!" Asuka shot back, laughing.  
"我只是开个玩笑，女人，冷静点！" 明日香回击道，笑着。

"Ok enough flirting between you two, despite me being responsible for Shinji's 'accommodation' for the past few weeks, I do understand that he needs some time to adjust" Misato elaborated. "Even though I thought this punishment was necessary for you Shinji, it still hurt me inside to go through with it. The least I can do is let you have an easy day tomorrow"  
“好了，你们俩别再调情了，虽然我负责了真嗣过去几周的‘住宿’，但我明白他需要时间适应。”美里解释道，“尽管我认为对你来说这个惩罚是必要的，真嗣，但执行它还是让我内心感到痛苦。至少明天我可以让你轻松些。”

"Thanks Misato, I appreciate it. Believe me, I am excited to go back to school and see my friends, but I would like some time at home first, so I'm grateful for that" Shinji replied.  
“谢谢你，美里，我很感激。说实话，我也很期待回学校见朋友们，但我希望先在家待一会儿，所以很感谢你的安排。”真嗣回答道。

"You're welcome" Misato answered back.  
“不客气。”美里回应道。

The car finally arrived at their residence and the three of them got out and entered the building. Taking the elevator to their floor, they exited it and opened their front door. The trio entered inside and Shinji relaxed; he was finally back. Taking a look around, it seemed that Asuka's exaggeration wasn't too far off as the place was certainly a mess. Dirty clothes were strewn about the couch, the floor was the dirty, there was dust everywhere… but he didn't care, he was home.  
汽车终于抵达了他们的住所，三人下车并走进了楼内。乘坐电梯到达他们的楼层后，他们走出电梯，打开了前门。三人进入屋内，真嗣放松下来；他终于回来了。环顾四周，似乎明日香的话并不夸张，这个地方确实一团糟。脏衣服散落在沙发上，地板脏兮兮的，到处都是灰尘……但他并不在意，他回到了家。

"I'm home" Shinji said aloud, his eyes watering a little.  
“我回来了。”真嗣大声说道，眼中泛起了泪光。

Seeing Shinji's reaction, Misato couldn't help but pull the boy into a warm hug. "Welcome home" she replied.  
看到真嗣的反应，美里忍不住将男孩拥入温暖的怀抱。“欢迎回家。”她回应道。

"While I'm sure you're enjoying our guardian's chest" Asuka started, pretending to sound jealous, "I'm pretty hungry Shinji, would you mind making some food?"  
"虽然我确信你很享受我们监护人的胸部" 明日香开始说道，假装听起来很嫉妒，"我真的很饿，真嗣，你介意做点吃的吗？"

Shinji blushed a little and moved away from Misato promptly. "Yes, right away Asuka!" he answered, moving into the kitchen as if he had never been away.  
真嗣脸颊微微泛红，迅速从美里身边移开。"好的，马上就来，明日香！" 他回答道，走进厨房，仿佛从未离开过。

"Hey! You shouldn't tease him like that" Misato said, scolding the redhead.  
"嘿！你不应该那样取笑他" 美里说道，责备着红发女孩。

"I don't know what you're talking about" the young girl replied innocently.  
"我不知道你在说什么" 年轻女孩无辜地回答道。

"I'm surprised you didn't even give him a moment to relax" the older woman noted.  
"我惊讶你甚至没给他一点放松的时间" 年长的女人指出。

"Believe me Misato, he enjoys cooking and it takes his mind off things, it's better he gets straight into it and then we can chat over dinner" Asuka explained.  
"相信我，美里，他喜欢烹饪，这能让他分心，最好让他直接开始，然后我们可以边吃边聊" 明日香解释道。

"Hmm… I suppose you're right" Misato conceded. "I did miss his cooking too…"  
"嗯……我想你是对的" 美里承认道。"我也确实想念他的厨艺了……"

"Now that it's settled, I'll just go sit down and-" the redhead started.  
"既然事情解决了，我就去坐下——" 红发女孩开口道。

"As his girlfriend, why don't you help him out and go and set the table for us" the purple haired woman said, smirking.  
"作为他的女朋友，你何不去帮帮他，去给我们摆好桌子" 紫发女子说着，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

Asuka shot the woman a glare before throwing her hands up in the air. "Fine! I almost forgot who was almost exclusively taking care of things while Shinji was gone" the young girl retorted, before moving off to set the table.  
明日香瞪了那女人一眼，然后双手一挥，气呼呼地说：“好吧！我差点忘了是谁在真嗣不在的时候几乎全权负责一切。”说完，她转身去摆桌子了。

"Thanks Asuka!" Misato replied mockingly, ignoring her remark; she was well used to Asuka's prickly attitude by now.  
“谢谢你，明日香！”美里嘲弄地回应，对她的反驳置若罔闻；她早已习惯了明日香那带刺的态度。

The Major went and sat down at the dining table while her two wards went about their tasks.  
美里少校走过去坐在餐桌旁，而她的两个监护对象则继续忙着自己的事情。

In the kitchen, Shinji was grateful to find the fridge stocked with many ingredients and was surprised how quickly his old habits kicked in. Despite being away for so long, the cooking utensils, pots and pans were all in the correct spot; perhaps there was little cooking done and mostly take out? He couldn't imagine Misato cooking all this time, Asuka wouldn't have allowed it anyway. While Shinji was enjoying cooking again, he was still a bit drained and thus didn't make anything extravagant. He was sure the other two would enjoy the meal though.  
在厨房里，真嗣很庆幸冰箱里备有丰富的食材，并惊讶于自己旧习惯恢复得如此迅速。尽管离开已久，烹饪工具、锅碗瓢盆都摆放得井井有条；或许这里很少做饭，大多都是外卖？他难以想象美里一直下厨，明日香也不会允许的。虽然真嗣再次享受起烹饪，但他仍感到有些疲惫，因此没有准备什么豪华大餐。不过他确信另外两人会喜欢这顿饭的。

"Dinner's ready!" the boy shouted, it felt so odd saying it after spending those weeks in the cell.  
“晚饭好了！”男孩喊道，在牢房里度过的那几周后，说出这句话感觉很奇怪。

As he brought the food to the dining table, he noticed the two females already sitting down with the dishes and cutlery set out for everyone. After placing down the food, Shinji sat next to Asuka before they all said "Let's eat!" The three of them dug into their meals happily, all happy to eat a nice homecooked meal while the boy was additionally happy to be eating with others.  
当他把食物端到餐桌时，注意到两位女性已经坐好，餐具也为大家摆好了。放下食物后，真嗣坐在明日香旁边，然后大家一起说：“开动吧！”三人愉快地享用着饭菜，都很高兴能吃到美味的家常菜，而真嗣还额外感到与他人共餐的喜悦。

"So… who was cooking while I was away?" Shinji asked curiously as he had just been preoccupied with it.  
"那么…我不在的时候是谁在做饭呢？" 真嗣好奇地问道，他刚刚一直在忙这件事。

"It was me obviously!" Asuka answered immediately, "Though we did get takeout sometimes"  
"当然是我啦！" 明日香立刻回答道，"不过我们有时候也会点外卖。"

"I'm impressed! The kitchen is in good order and the fridge is well stocked" he praised.  
"真了不起！厨房井井有条，冰箱也满满当当。" 他称赞道。

"It's almost like you expected me to be hopeless…" Asuka replied mockingly.  
"你几乎像是期待我会无可救药似的……" 明日香嘲讽地回答。

"Can you blame me?" Shinji teased.  
"这能怪我吗？" 真嗣打趣道。

"I don't appreciate your implication third child…" Asuka responded, leaning forward close to his face, unknowingly giving him an ample view of her cleavage, which Shinji couldn't help looking at; it had been a while since he had seen or fondled them. Noticing the boy's gaze, the redhead smirked, "Oh, did you miss these babies?" she asked, cupping her breasts overtly.  
"我不喜欢你这种暗示，第三适格者……" 明日香回应道，身体前倾靠近他的脸，不经意间让真嗣得以清楚地看到她的乳沟，真嗣忍不住看了过去；他已经很久没有见过或触摸过它们了。注意到男孩的目光，红发少女微微一笑，"哦，你想念这些宝贝了吗？" 她问道，故意用手托起自己的胸部。

Shinji quickly turned away blushing; if Asuka continued like this, he wouldn't be able to hold back.  
真嗣迅速转过身去，脸颊泛红；如果明日香继续这样下去，他恐怕无法克制自己。

"Asuka!" Misato said loudly. "Give the poor boy a break, besides that's not appropriate behaviour for the dinner table"  
“明日香！”美里大声说道，“放过这可怜的男孩吧，再说了，餐桌上的行为可不该这样。”

"Hmpf, fine!" Asuka conceded, turning back to her food and continuing to eat. The young girl paused after a moment and leant over to Shinji before whispering seductively, "Just in case you were worried, you'll get plenty of chance to play with them later"  
“哼，好吧！”明日香让步道，转回自己的食物继续吃。过了一会儿，她停下动作，向真嗣倾身过去，轻声诱惑地说：“只是以防你担心，以后你会有很多机会玩弄它们的。”

At this, the boy stood up abruptly. "I'm going to the toilet" he announced before walking off, eliciting a snort from the redhead.  
听到这话，男孩猛地站起身来。“我去趟洗手间。”他宣布后便走开了，引得红发女孩嗤之以鼻。

"Don't be too long darling!" Asuka called out, laughing as he walked off.  
“别太久哦，亲爱的！”明日香喊道，笑着看他离开。

Shinji entered the bathroom and took a deep breath. He didn't need to go to the bathroom, but he required a breather; the young girl's lewd behaviour was stirring up quite the lustful urges in him, he hadn't done it for so long after all. It was also hard to tell if she was just teasing him or she actually wanted him to act; it was probably both.  
真嗣走进洗手间，深吸了一口气。他其实并不需要上厕所，只是需要喘口气；那年轻女孩的放荡行为激起了他强烈的欲望，毕竟他已经很久没有过了。也很难判断她是在逗弄他还是真的想让他有所行动；可能两者都有吧。

At that, he walked over to the sink and washed his face with cold water. After he calmed down a little, he wiped his hands dry before exiting the bathroom and returning to the dining table. At this point, Asuka was finishing her meal and hadn't noticed the boy returning. He quietly crept up behind her, Misato noticed the boy but said nothing as he got closer to the redhead. Once Shinji was right behind her, making sure that she had placed down her utensils, he swiftly reached his hands under her shirt and placed them on her bare skin; not unlike the morning of the angel attack. Just like last time, she jumped at the cold contact in addition to the surprise of the attack.  
说完，他走到水槽边，用冷水洗脸。稍微冷静下来后，他擦干双手，走出浴室，回到餐桌旁。此时，明日香正在结束她的餐食，并未注意到男孩的归来。他悄悄地溜到她身后，美里注意到了男孩，但什么也没说，看着他靠近红发女孩。当真嗣正好站在她身后，确保她已经放下餐具时，他迅速将双手伸进她的衬衫，放在她裸露的皮肤上；这与天使袭击的早晨如出一辙。和上次一样，她因冷接触和突袭的惊吓而跳了起来。

"Jeez!" Asuka cried out, before realising what had happened. Shinji's hands weren't _that_ cold, unlike last time, but she didn't appreciate the shock.  
“天哪！”明日香惊呼出声，随即意识到发生了什么。真嗣的手不像上次那么冷，但她并不喜欢这种惊吓。

"Get your hands off me you moron!" the young girl shouted, while their guardian just laughed at what had transpired.  
“你这个白痴，把手拿开！”少女喊道，而他们的监护人则对发生的事情大笑起来。

"Serves you right!" Misato responded.  
"活该！" 美里回应道。

Not really wanting to annoy her, Shinji relented and removed his hands, giving relief to the girl. He then brought his arms in front of her and hugged her from behind.  
不想真的惹恼她，真嗣让步了，移开了双手，让女孩松了口气。然后他将自己的手臂伸到她面前，从背后抱住了她。

"I love you" Shinji told her, hoping it would appease her.  
"我爱你" 真嗣告诉她，希望这能让她平静下来。

"I'm not impressed baka, it's not like I was doing anything bad to you" she replied with a hint of anger, but not resisting his embrace either.  
“我才不觉得你有多厉害，笨蛋，我又没对你做什么坏事。”她带着一丝怒气回答，但也没有抗拒他的拥抱。

The boy then leaned in and whispered in her ear, "I know, but if you keep it up, I'll be unable to restrain myself… it's been weeks since we've done those things…"  
男孩随即靠近，在她耳边低语：“我知道，但如果你继续这样，我恐怕就控制不住自己了……我们已经好几个星期没做那些事了……”

Asuka grabbed his hands and gave them a squeeze, before turning her face towards him. "You won't have to wait long" she responded softly, a small blush appearing on her face, before she moved out of his embrace.  
明日香抓住他的手，用力握了握，然后转向他。“你不会等太久的。”她轻声回应，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，随后从他的怀抱中挣脱出来。

"Finish your meal already baka Shinji!" the redhead said loudly.  
"快点吃完你的饭，笨蛋真嗣！" 红发女孩大声说道。

"Y-yes Asuka" he replied. The boy's heart was pounding with excitement, those soft words had brought his desires right back up. He figured it best to sit back down and have some conversation about the past few days.  
"是-是的，明日香。" 他回答道。男孩的心跳因兴奋而加速，那些温柔的话语再次唤起了他的渴望。他觉得最好坐下来，聊聊过去几天的事情。

After sitting down in his chair, Shinji spoke up. "So, anything happen while I was gone? Anything at school? What did you tell everyone?" he asked, before continuing to eat his meal.  
坐回椅子后，真嗣开口了。"那么，我不在的时候有什么事发生吗？学校里有什么事吗？你跟大家说了什么？" 他边问边继续吃着饭。

"Things were strangely silent at NERV" Misato replied first, "I'm not sure what the Commander is thinking but ever since the last angel battle, he's been quiet; too quiet. In any case, you didn't miss anything there, well except a routine sync test a few days ago"  
"NERV 里出奇地安静" 美里先回答道，"我不确定司令在想什么，但从上次使徒战斗后，他就一直很沉默；太沉默了。无论如何，你没错过什么，嗯，除了几天前的一次例行同步测试"

"I had top sync rate as usual!" Asuka interrupted.  
"我一如既往地取得了最高的同步率！" 明日香插话道。

"Well, I didn't take the test so… it's not conclusive now is it?" Shinji teased.  
"嗯，我没参加测试，所以……现在还不能下结论，对吧？" 真嗣打趣道。

"Pfft, the outcome would have been the same, though I dunno why they didn't just wait till you were released" the young girl retorted.  
"噗，结果还不是一样，不过我真不知道他们为什么不等你出来再说" 年轻女孩反驳道。

"Maybe Ritstuko didn't have another chance to do it anytime soon?" Shinji offered.  
"也许律子津没有其他机会很快再做一次？" 真嗣猜测道。

"Well whatever… at least it means I was in _LCL_" the redhead said with emphasis on the last word, winking at the boy; Shinji couldn't help a small blush as he realised the significance behind her statement. Their guardian looked at the two curiously, wondering what secret message they had exchanged.  
"哎，管他呢……至少这意味着我在 LCL 里" 红发女孩强调着最后一个词，向男孩眨了眨眼；真嗣不禁脸颊微红，意识到她话中的深意。他们的监护人好奇地看着两人，想知道他们交换了什么秘密信息。

Not wanting Misato to question them or get suspicious, Shinji quickly spoke up again. "So, what about school? Were Touji and Kensuke worried about me?" He asked.  
不想让美里对他们产生疑问或起疑心，真嗣迅速再次开口。“那么，学校那边呢？东治和健介担心我吗？”他问道。

"Oh, your two stooge friends were asking about you all the time" Asuka replied. "But don't worry, I told them that you were imprisoned by the Commander for your actions in the last angel battle and that you weren't allowed any visitors… we figured it was the best lie since it was close to the truth… I told Kensuke the same as well"  
“哦，你那两个跟班朋友一直在问你的情况。”明日香回答道，“不过别担心，我告诉他们你因为上次天使战斗中的行为被司令关起来了，不允许任何访客……我们觉得这个谎话最合适，因为它接近真相……我也同样告诉了健介。”

"Yeah, that makes sense…" Shinji started, feeling guilty again. "It'll be good to see those guys again, I hope you told them I was fine"  
“是啊，这说得通……”真嗣开口道，再次感到内疚，“能再见到他们真好，我希望你告诉他们我没事。”

"Yeah yeah, don't fuss" Asuka began, "It'll be a relief when you see them, even I was getting sick of seeing them be so mopey" she commented.  
“是是，别大惊小怪的。”明日香开始说道，“你见到他们会松一口气的，连我都快看腻他们那副消沉的样子了。”她评论道。

"Haha is that so? I'll be sure to make it up to them then" the boy replied. "Oh actually! What about the play?" he asked, suddenly remembering that he had a major role there.  
“哈哈，是吗？那我一定会好好补偿他们的。”男孩回答。“哦，对了！那场戏怎么办？”他突然想起自己在那里有个重要角色。

"Play?" Misato asked. “戏？”美里问道。

"Oh, it's just a school play they want us to do Misato. Shinji has one of the leading roles, as do I. As for what happened Shinji, they deferred any practice till you came back since you had the leading male role… we haven't done anything since last time" Asuka explained.  
"哦，只是学校的一个话剧，他们想让我们参演，美里。真嗣和我都有主要角色。至于真嗣，他们推迟了所有练习等你回来，因为你担任男主角……自上次以来我们什么都没做" 明日香解释道。

At this point, Shinji had finished eating and automatically stood up to clear the table. The redhead grabbed his hand to pull him back down.  
这时，真嗣已经吃完饭，自动站起来收拾桌子。红发女孩抓住他的手，把他拉了回来。

"Don't worry about that today" the young girl requested.  
"今天不用担心那个" 年轻女孩请求道。

"Oh ok" the boy replied, sitting back down.  
"哦，好的" 男孩回答道，重新坐了下来。

"So, are you feeling better now?" Asuka asked with a hint of concern.  
"那么，你现在感觉好些了吗？" 明日香带着一丝关切问道。

"Yeah definitely! I'm back home, had some nice food… I'm in the company of you and Misato… I really do feel like I'm home" Shinji answered. "And you two, are you all good as well?" he asked.  
"当然好多了！我回到家，吃了些美味的食物……有你和美里在身边……我真的感觉像回到了家" 真嗣回答道。"你们俩也都还好吧？" 他问道。

"Yeah, yeah, I just missed you Shinji" Misato replied, standing up and giving the boy a warm embrace.  
“是啊，是啊，我就是想你了，真嗣。”美里回答道，站起身来给了男孩一个温暖的拥抱。

"As if you need to ask me" Asuka retorted smirking, "Though I did miss you a _teensy_ bit" she said, emphasising her description with her fingers.  
“好像你还需要问我似的。”明日香反驳道，嘴角带着一丝笑意，“不过我确实有点想你。”她用手指比划着强调自己的描述。

"Of course Asuka, how could I forget?" he said, chuckling. "However, I am glad to see you are both well. Although it sounds like it was a boring few weeks on the outside" Shinji stated.  
“当然不会忘记，明日香。”他笑着说，“不过，我很高兴看到你们俩都安然无恙。虽然听起来外面的这几周挺无聊的。”真嗣说道。

"Yeah, almost nothing happened. But the time passed by pretty quick anyway" Asuka replied yawning as she was tired. It was already quite late after prepping the food, eating and conversing.  
“是啊，几乎什么都没发生。不过时间倒是过得挺快的。”明日香打着哈欠回答，她已经很累了。准备食物、吃饭和聊天之后，时间已经相当晚了。

Hearing the girl yawn, Shinji looked up at the time. "It's already so late! I guess I'm feeling pretty tired too actually… so anything happening tomorrow?" he asked.  
听到女孩打哈欠，真嗣抬头看了看时间。“已经这么晚了！其实我也感觉挺累的……明天有什么事吗？”他问道。

"I'm happy for you two to take the day off from school tomorrow" Misato replied. "There's nothing scheduled at NERV for the pilots, so you can relax as much as you want"  
“我很高兴你们俩明天可以不去学校。”美里回答道，“NERV 对驾驶员没有安排，所以你们可以尽情放松。”

"Alright then, I'm going to have a shower now" Shinji announced.  
"好吧，那我现在去洗个澡" 真嗣宣布道。

"Sure thing! I'm going to head off to bed now then, goodnight you two" Misato said in response.  
"当然可以！那我现在去睡觉了，晚安你们俩" 美里回应道。

"Goodnight!" both Shinji and Asuka said in unison, before Misato walked off and went to her room.  
"晚安！" 真嗣和明日香齐声说道，随后美里走开，回到了自己的房间。

"I'll take a shower after you Shinji, so don't take too long" Asuka requested.  
“我会在你之后洗澡的，真嗣，别太久哦。”明日香要求道。

"Hai" Shinji responded, moving over to the girl. He moved down and brought his lips to hers, kissing her deeply. Asuka wrapped her arms around his neck, holding him as they kissed.  
“好的”真嗣回应着，向女孩走去。他俯下身，将嘴唇贴近她的，深深地吻了她。明日香用双臂环住他的脖子，紧紧地抱着他们亲吻。

As they parted, they looked into each other's eyes, both of their hearts pounding in their chests. The boy started to stroke the girl's hair and then nuzzled her neck before pulling away. "I'll umm… go have my shower now" he said reluctantly.  
当他们分开时，彼此凝视着对方的眼睛，两人的心跳都在胸腔中剧烈跳动。男孩开始抚摸女孩的头发，然后在她脖子上蹭了蹭，才依依不舍地离开。“我……现在去洗澡了。”他有些不情愿地说。

"Mm" Asuka replied. "嗯" 明日香应了一声。

Shinji walked to his room, opening the door and entering inside. It had been some time since he'd last stood in his room, it looked exactly as he last remembered it; he suspected no one had come in here while he was away. He was thankful that it still felt familiar and comforting, but then again, almost anything was better than the prison cell. Shinji took his pajamas, exited his room and went into the bathroom, locking the door. Turning on the water for the shower, he then undressed and stepped inside, serenely enjoying the hot water running over and washing his body; it was quite relaxing. He was tempted to stay in there a while but remembered the words Asuka had told him and he grudgingly turned off the water and dried himself before changing into his new clothes.  
真嗣走向自己的房间，打开门走了进去。自从他上次站在房间里已经有一段时间了，房间看起来和他记忆中的完全一样；他怀疑在他离开期间没有人进来过。他很感激房间依然让他感到熟悉和舒适，但话说回来，几乎任何地方都比那个牢房要好。真嗣拿起睡衣，走出房间，走进浴室，锁上门。他打开淋浴的水，然后脱掉衣服，走进去，静静地享受着热水冲刷和洗涤身体；这非常放松。他很想在里面多待一会儿，但想起了明日香对他说的话，便不情愿地关掉水，擦干身体，换上了新衣服。

The boy exited the bathroom and called out "I'm done showering, you can go now Asuka"  
男孩走出浴室，喊道：“我洗完澡了，你可以去了，明日香。”

Soon, the redhead appeared at the bathroom door with her bathrobe in hand. "Cheers" Asuka started, "Good to see you still listen to me, you finished quite promptly"  
不久，红发女孩手里拿着浴袍出现在浴室门口。“干杯”明日香开始说道，“很高兴看到你还在听我的话，完成得相当迅速。”

"Anything for my princess" Shinji replied mockingly.  
“为了我的公主，什么都行”真嗣嘲讽地回答。

"Don't make me puke thanks" Asuka replied with a look of disgust on her face before entering the bathroom and closing the door.  
“别让我吐出来，谢谢”明日香一脸厌恶地回答，然后走进浴室并关上了门。

The boy stretched his arms before heading to his room. He couldn't help yawning as he entered his room, he did feel exhausted. Shinji walked over to his bed and got under the covers, ready to sleep. Though his desires were still awakened, he figured it's probably better to leave it alone for tonight; both of them seemed too tired for it. Besides, he had just come out of prison which was a painful reminder of what he had done to Asuka; he wasn't sure he was mentally up for those activities just yet.  
男孩伸了个懒腰，准备回房间。一进屋，他就忍不住打了个哈欠，确实感到疲惫不堪。真嗣走到床边，钻进被窝，准备入睡。虽然欲望依旧涌动，但他觉得今晚还是别折腾了，两人似乎都太累了。况且，他刚从监狱出来，那是对他给明日香造成的伤害的痛苦提醒；他不确定自己是否已经准备好进行那些活动。

Shinji stared at the ceiling, pondering the past weeks, the conversation over dinner and Asuka. He felt restless and found himself unable to fall asleep, though he didn't find it surprising.  
真嗣盯着天花板，回想着过去几周、晚餐时的对话以及明日香。他感到心烦意乱，发现自己无法入睡，尽管这并不出乎意料。

Suddenly, the boy heard the door to his room open and he turned his head to face it. Standing there was Asuka, clothed in her bathrobe; though it was dark, his eyes had adjusted. "Are you awake baka?" she asked softly.  
突然，男孩听到房门打开的声音，他转头望去。站在那里的是明日香，穿着浴袍；虽然光线昏暗，但他的眼睛已经适应。“你醒着吗，笨蛋？”她轻声问道。

"Yeah" he replied. “嗯”他回答道。

Hearing his response, she entered inside and closed the door behind her. The redhead disrobed herself, revealing her naked body save for her panties. Though he couldn't make out all the details, Shinji could tell she was practically naked and felt his member stir.  
听到他的回应，她走进屋内并关上了身后的门。红发女孩脱去衣物，除了内裤外，她的身体几乎完全裸露。虽然看不清所有细节，但真嗣能感觉到她几乎一丝不挂，他的下体不禁有了反应。

"Make room for me" Asuka ordered as she walked to his bed.  
“给我腾个地方”明日香命令道，一边走向他的床。

Shinji lifted up the covers to let her in and she promptly joined him under the covers.  
真嗣掀开被子让她进来，她迅速钻进了被窝。

"I…" Asuka started, "I just figured you wouldn't want to be alone on the first night… and we don't have to do anything if you're not feeling up to it… I'm pretty tired anyway to be honest" she explained.  
“我……”明日香开口道，“我只是觉得你今晚不想一个人……如果你不想做些什么也没关系……老实说，我也很累。”她解释道。

The boy embraced her tightly, just grateful for her presence; her skin felt smooth and he could smell the scent of soap and shampoo. "Thanks Asuka" he started before smirking, "Although I thought you said I could play with your boobs" he teased.  
男孩紧紧拥抱着她，只是感激她的陪伴；她的皮肤触感光滑，他能闻到肥皂和洗发水的香味。“谢谢你，明日香。”他开口说道，然后微微一笑，“不过我记得你说过我可以玩你的胸部”他打趣道。

"Well, they're fully bare, nothing's stopping y-mmm!" she said, interrupted by his hands fondling her tits.  
“嗯，它们完全裸露着，没有什么能阻止你——嗯嗯！”她的话被他抚摸她乳房的手打断了。

"I almost forgot the feeling of these puppies" he commented, caressing them gently.  
“我几乎忘记了这些小家伙的感觉。”他评论道，轻轻地抚摸着它们。

Shinji then turned Asuka on her side so her back was facing him before bringing his arms to her front and cupping her breasts. The boy moved right up next to her so that he was in direct contact with her back and started to kiss her neck gently. The redhead moaned with his affections, she was definitely becoming aroused; if he wanted to have sex tonight, she would certainly be onboard right now.  
然后，真嗣让明日香侧过身来，背对着他，接着将双臂伸到她前方，捧起她的乳房。男孩紧贴着她的背部，开始温柔地亲吻她的脖子。红发女孩在他的爱抚下呻吟着，她显然越来越兴奋；如果他今晚想做爱，她现在肯定会同意。

"Shinji…" she called out enticingly, to which the boy began to play with her nipples, causing her to squeal in delight. The redhead could feel a certain hardness rubbing up against her backside, causing her to push back against it excitedly.  
“真嗣…”她诱人地呼唤着，男孩随即开始玩弄她的乳头，让她欢快地尖叫起来。红发女孩能感觉到某种坚硬的东西抵在她的臀部，这让她兴奋地向后蹭去。

Shinji could feel his heart beating rapidly and his erection was a sure sign that his body was ready to go ahead, however, for tonight he really just wanted to fall asleep with her in his arms and so stopped his ministrations. Asuka bit back the urge to let out a moan of protest; though she would usually be forceful when she wanted something, just for tonight she would follow his lead entirely.  
真嗣能感觉到自己的心跳加速，勃起无疑表明他的身体已经准备好了，然而，今晚他真的只想抱着她入睡，于是停止了挑逗。明日香强忍住发出抗议呻吟的冲动；尽管她通常在想要什么时会很强硬，但今晚她会完全跟随他的引导。

Sensing disappointment from the redhead, Shinji moved his mouth near her ear and brought one hand on her ass. "I really want to but… just for tonight I want to hold you and fall asleep… tomorrow we'll have the day off. I promise we'll continue…" he said softly.  
察觉到红发女孩的失望，真嗣将嘴凑近她的耳边，一只手放在她的臀部。“我真的想，但是…今晚我只想抱着你入睡…明天我们放假。我保证我们会继续…”他轻声说道。

"Who said I wanted anything?" Asuka retorted. "I was just keeping my word… did you enjoy the girls?"  
"谁说我想要什么了？" 明日香反驳道，"我只是守信罢了……你享受那些女孩了吗？"

"How could I not?" he asked, squeezing her breast reassuringly and patting her ass with his other hand.  
"我怎能不享受呢？" 他问道，一边安慰性地捏了捏她的乳房，另一只手拍了拍她的屁股。"

"Alright baka, let's go to sleep" Asuka responded with a yawn, turning around so that she was facing him.  
"好了，笨蛋，我们睡觉吧。" 明日香打着哈欠回应，转身面向他。"

Shinji gave the girl a quick kiss before laying down on his back while the girl laid her head on his chest.  
真嗣在女孩额头上轻轻一吻，随后仰面躺下，女孩则将头靠在他的胸膛上。

"Goodnight Asuka" he said, wrapping his arm around her.  
“晚安，明日香。”他说着，手臂环绕过她。

"Goodnight moron" “晚安，笨蛋。”

The boy couldn't help smiling at her cheekiness right up to the end, before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep without any difficulty this time.  
男孩直到最后都忍不住对她的大胆报以微笑，然后闭上眼睛，这次毫不费力地进入了梦乡。

---

Shinji woke up next morning feeling strangely at peace. Not only was he warm and comfortable, there was light. He looked up and saw the familiar ceiling of his room, a sight he hadn't seen for some time. The boy felt some hot air blow across his chest gently when he realised there was some weight on his chest. Looking down he saw Asuka, her hair splayed across his chest, breathing softly in slumber with one of his arms wrapped around her. Shinji soon remembered what had happened last night and blushed as he noticed the girl was almost entirely naked. He was now wide awake and his member stirred; his whole body was ready to go for it. The boy couldn't really do anything while the girl was asleep though and besides Misato was probably still here.  
真嗣第二天早上醒来时，感到一种奇怪的平静。他不仅感到温暖舒适，还有光亮。他抬头看到了自己房间熟悉的天花板，这是他许久未见的景象。当他意识到胸口有些重量时，一阵热风轻轻吹过他的胸膛。低头一看，他看到明日香，她的头发散落在他的胸前，一只手臂环绕着她，她正轻轻地呼吸着，沉浸在梦乡中。真嗣很快想起了昨晚发生的事情，当注意到女孩几乎全裸时，他脸红了。他现在完全清醒了，他的身体也做好了准备。然而，当女孩还在睡觉时，男孩什么也做不了，而且美里可能还在这里。

Shinji wanted to go check on his guardian and make breakfast for everyone, but he also didn't want to leave the bed and Asuka. Maybe he should just wait for the girl to wake up? Or maybe he could have some fun trying to get her to wake up. The boy brought his other arm to her chest and began fondling her breasts softly, at once a sharp intake of breath could be heard from the girl. However, the redhead did not wake up and instead let out a small moan of pleasure and shifted position, turning slightly such that her chest was more exposed. Shinji took this as an invitation to continue his fondling, lightly flicking her nipples as well.  
真嗣想去看看他的监护人并为所有人准备早餐，但他也不想离开床和明日香。也许他应该等女孩醒来？或者他可以试着逗她醒来，找点乐子。男孩将另一只手臂伸到她的胸前，开始轻轻地抚摸她的乳房，随即可以听到女孩急促的吸气声。然而，红发女孩并没有醒来，反而发出了一声小小的愉悦呻吟，并调整了姿势，微微转身使得她的胸部更加暴露。真嗣将此视为继续抚摸的邀请，轻轻地拨弄着她的乳头。

"Shinji…" Asuka whispered softly, still asleep, continuing to moan at his actions.  
“真嗣……”明日香轻声呢喃，依然沉睡，对他的动作继续发出呻吟。

'_I guess this isn't going to wake her up, let's be a bit bolder'_ the boy thought. Reaching down to her panties, he pulled them down quite a bit. He wasn't able to pull them off entirely because her legs were spread over his. The boy then brought his hand back up to her now exposed vagina which was a little wet from his affections earlier. Shinji ran his finger up and down her slit, causing the girl to react more strongly. She moaned louder, her legs opening as much as they could, giving him better access.  
"'看来这样还不能把她弄醒，得更大胆些。' 男孩心想。他伸手到她的内裤边，往下拉了不少。由于她的双腿跨在他身上，他无法完全脱掉它们。然后，男孩将手移回到她现在暴露在外、因他之前的抚摸而有些湿润的阴部。真嗣用手指在她的小缝上来回滑动，这让女孩反应更强烈了。她呻吟得更大声，双腿尽可能地张开，给了他更好的进入机会。

"Please Shinji…" the girl whispered again, though still asleep. Shinji was finding it hard to hold back now after seeing how willing her body was. He began to rub her clit, causing Asuka to press her pussy into his hand and finally wake up. Noticing the girl stirring, he stopped his fingers and laid back down, pretending to still be asleep; though his erection was a big give away.  
"“请……真嗣……” 女孩再次低声说道，尽管她仍在睡梦中。看到她的身体如此顺从，真嗣发现自己很难再克制了。他开始揉搓她的阴蒂，这让明日香将下体压向他的手，最终醒了过来。注意到女孩开始动弹，他停下了手指，躺回床上，假装还在睡觉；尽管他的勃起已经暴露了一切。

Asuka opened her eyes and looked up at Shinji groggily. Her face was flushed at the vague memory of the steamy dream she was just having about him; was she really that horny? The redhead could feel an intense lust and a familiar wetness in her vagina, she couldn't understand why she had such a strong desire all of a sudden. The girl saw Shinji with his eyes closed, seemingly still asleep. She moved her hand down to her lower region wondering why she felt exposed there, and to see how wet she was.  
明日香睁开眼睛，昏昏沉沉地看着真嗣。她脸上泛起红晕，依稀记得刚才那个关于他的热辣梦境；她真的那么饥渴吗？红发女孩能感觉到下体强烈的欲望和熟悉的湿润，她不明白为什么突然间会有如此强烈的渴望。她看到真嗣闭着眼睛，似乎还在熟睡。她将手移向自己的下身，想知道为什么那里感觉如此暴露，并想看看自己有多湿。

"Huh…? Why are my panties down?" she asked herself softly.  
“咦……？为什么我的内裤脱掉了？”她轻声自问。

Shinji could no longer take it and quickly rolled on top of the girl, taking her completely by surprise. Before she could react, he brought his lips down to hers and slipped a finger inside her still wet cunt, fingering her slowly. Shinji could feel her moan into his mouth at the contact and he parted from her lips.  
真嗣再也忍受不了，迅速翻身压在女孩身上，让她完全措手不及。在她反应过来之前，他将自己的嘴唇贴上她的，并伸进一根手指到她依然湿润的私处，缓慢地抽动。真嗣能感觉到她在他的嘴里发出呻吟，随后他离开了她的唇。

Asuka looked up at him confused and excited, her eyes had a look of hunger yet were also still a bit groggy from being half asleep. Taking advantage of the moment, Shinji took her panties off completely, throwing them onto the ground.  
明日香抬头看着他，既困惑又兴奋，她的眼神中透露出渴望，却又因半睡半醒而显得有些迷糊。趁此机会，真嗣彻底脱掉了她的内裤，随手扔在地上。

Regaining some lucidness, the girl became more aware of what was going on. "Wait Shinji!" she called out, sensing that he was about to pounce on her.  
女孩恢复了一些清醒，开始意识到正在发生的事情。“等等，真嗣！”她喊道，感觉到他即将扑向她。

The boy stopped whatever he was going to do. "You don't want to…?" he asked, hesitant.  
男孩停下了即将要做的事情。“你不想……？”他犹豫地问道。

"Of course I do you moron. I don't know what you did but all I want right not now is for you to fuck my brains out" she replied blushing, embarrassed at her admission. "However, isn't Misato still home? Last night when I came to your room, she was already asleep and we could have done this then, but right now she's probably already awake! Urggh, you've gone and made me so horny you asshole" she finished explaining with frustration.  
“当然，你这个白痴。我不知道你做了什么，但我现在唯一想要的，就是让你把我干到神志不清。”她红着脸回答，对自己的坦白感到尴尬。“不过，美里不是还在家吗？昨晚我来你房间时，她已经睡了，我们本可以那时做的，但现在她可能已经醒了！哎呀，你这个混蛋，让我变得这么饥渴。”她带着沮丧解释道。

"Ah… actually I momentarily forgot about Misato" Shinji replied sheepishly. "I couldn't resist playing with you while you were asleep and then got lost in the moment" he explained.  
“啊……其实我一时忘了美里的存在。”真嗣尴尬地回答，“我忍不住在你睡着时逗弄你，然后就沉醉其中了。”他解释道。

The girl sighed. "It's ok, it's not the end of the world. Just go and check on her, maybe she left already…" she said with a hint of hope.  
女孩叹了口气。“没关系，这又不是世界末日。去看看她吧，也许她已经离开了……”她带着一丝希望说道。

"Ok…" Shinji replied and reluctantly got out of bed.  
“好吧…” 真嗣回答道，不情愿地从床上爬了起来。

"Hey! You have a naked girl in bed waiting for you, don't make it sound like this is an ordeal" Asuka scoffed.  
“嘿！你床上有个一丝不挂的女孩在等你，别搞得像是什么苦差事似的。”明日香嘲讽道。

"Haha, that's true" he admitted, turning around to leave. He looked back at her and added while smirking, "Don't worry, you'll get your fill of cock soon enough"  
“哈哈，说得对。”他承认道，转身准备离开。回头看着她，带着一丝坏笑补充道，“别担心，你很快就会满足的。”

"You fucking asshole, get the fuck out of here before I change my mind!" Asuka spat back angrily, throwing a pillow at him.  
"你这个混蛋，趁我还没改变主意，赶紧滚出去！" 明日香愤怒地回敬道，抓起一个枕头朝他扔去。

At this, Shinji quickly walked over to his door to exit his room, wanting to get this over and done with so he could get back to the bed as soon as possible. Heading over to the kitchen, he could see Misato sitting at the dining table and sipping her beer, while checking over some documents. Perhaps she was just about ready to go to NERV?  
听到这话，真嗣迅速走向自己的房门，想要尽快结束这一切，以便能尽快回到床上。他走向厨房，看到美里正坐在餐桌旁喝着啤酒，同时翻阅着一些文件。也许她快要准备去 NERV 了？

"Morning Misato" Shinji greeted her.  
"早上好，美里" 真嗣向她打招呼。

At this, his guardian looked up. "Morning Shinji!" she responded. "I heard Asuka shouting at you, are you guys having a fight?" she asked.  
听到这话，他的监护人抬起头来。“早上好，真嗣！”她回应道，“我听到明日香在对你大喊大叫，你们是在吵架吗？”她问道。

"No! No, just our usual antics" he dismissed, wondering if Misato had heard what they said.  
“没有！没有，只是我们平时的打闹。”他轻描淡写地否认，心里却在想美里是否听到了他们说的话。

"Are you making breakfast? I'm going to NERV soon and I haven't had home-cooked breakfast for a few weeks" she hinted.  
“你在做早餐吗？我很快就要去 NERV 了，已经好几个星期没吃过家里做的早餐了。”她暗示道。

"I'd be happy to!" Shinji replied. "Just let me ask Asuka… if she wants to join us" he added. Shinji had to report back to the young girl, he wasn't sure what she would want to do.  
“我很乐意！”真嗣回答道，“不过我得先问问明日香……看她是否愿意加入我们。”真嗣需要向这位少女汇报，他不确定她会想做什么。

"Sure thing!" Misato replied, completely unaware of the fact Asuka was naked in his room or what they had been "fighting" about.  
“当然可以！”美里回答道，完全没有意识到明日香在他房间里一丝不挂，也不知道他们之前“争执”的内容。

At that, the boy turned around and returned to his room. Upon entering, he closed the door behind him and Asuka looked up at him expectantly.  
听到这话，男孩转身回到自己的房间。一进门，他关上了身后的门，明日香则期待地抬头看着他。

"And? I'm assuming at the very least Misato is awake, you wouldn't have taken so long otherwise" the girl prompted him.  
"然后呢？我猜至少美里是醒着的，否则你不会花这么长时间" 女孩催促他。

"Yeah she's awake, she also wants me to make breakfast, which I'm going to" he replied, walking over to the girl.  
"是啊，她醒了，她还让我做早餐，我正要去呢" 他回答道，走向女孩。

"Just great" Asuka said with a sigh.  
"真是太好了" 明日香叹了口气说。

"She's going to NERV straight after, so it's not too bad" Shinji reassured, sitting down on the bed. Looking at the girl, she was lying on her back with her hands behind her head, breasts fully exposed. The boy moved a hand to start playing with one of her breasts.  
"她直接去 NERV，所以还好" 真嗣安慰道，坐在床上。看着女孩，她仰面躺着，双手枕在脑后，胸部完全暴露。男孩伸手开始玩弄她的一个乳房。

"So, what are you doing here?" she asked, seemingly unphased. "Well, I suppose you think I'm just some whore in heat waiting desperately for her master to satisfy her desires" she added dryly, not moving at all.  
"那么，你在这里做什么？" 她问道，似乎不为所动。"嗯，我想你认为我只是个发情的妓女，绝望地等待着她的主人来满足她的欲望" 她干巴巴地补充道，一动不动。

'_Ouch, I didn't think she'd take_ _offense_ _from that joke'_ Shinji thought, instantly stopping what he was doing.  
'哎呀，我没想到她会因为这个笑话生气' 真嗣心想，立刻停止了手上的动作。

"Sorry Asuka I-" he started, followed by a death glare from the redhead.  
"对不起，明日香，我——" 他刚开口，就被红发女孩的死亡凝视打断了。

"I was just joking before" he quickly finished, "I came here to tell you about Misato and to ask if you wanted to join us for breakfast" he explained.  
"我之前只是在开玩笑，" 他迅速补充道，"我来这里是想告诉你关于美里的事，并问你是否愿意和我们一起吃早餐。" 他解释说。

The girl's face softened slightly. "Well, I guess it's been a while since you've cooked us breakfast, I wouldn't mind…" she said, relenting.  
女孩的脸色稍微缓和了一些。"嗯，我想你已经很久没为我们做早餐了，我不介意……" 她让步道。

Shinji brought his arms around her, pulling her up and embracing her warmly. "I really was just joking before Asuka, I love you"  
真嗣将双臂环绕在她周围，轻轻拉起并温暖地拥抱着她。“刚才真的是在开玩笑，Asuka，我爱你。”

"I know, you baka. Let go already" she replied gently.  
“我知道，笨蛋。快放开啦。”她温柔地回应道。

Moving back a little, the boy kissed the redhead softly. "You know… I had forgotten how beautiful you are… you're so attractive, it's difficult to stop myself" he said sincerely.  
稍稍后退一些，男孩轻柔地吻了红发女孩。“你知道吗…我曾忘记了你有多美…你如此迷人，我很难控制自己停下来。”他真诚地说道。

"Enough!" Asuka replied pushing him away, a small blush on her face. "Are we eating breakfast or what?"  
"够了！" 明日香推开他，脸上泛起一抹淡淡的红晕。"我们到底还吃不吃早餐了？"

"Yes! I'll go make it right away then" he said, getting off the bed and walking to his door.  
"好的！那我马上去做" 他说着，从床上起身走向房门。

Asuka followed suit and stretched her arms, before walking over to her bathrobe she took off the other day and covered herself with it. The two of them exited his room together and walked to the dining table.  
明日香也跟着起身，伸了个懒腰，然后拿起前天脱下的浴袍披在身上。两人一起走出房间，走向餐桌。

Misato noticed the two teens walking over and spoke up. "Morning Asuka! I'm glad you decided to join us" she greeted.  
美里注意到两个少年走了过来，便开口说道：“早上好，明日香！很高兴你决定加入我们。”她打招呼道。

"Morning" Asuka simply replied.  
“早上好。”明日香简单地回答。

"Are you naked under that?" Misato asked teasingly.  
“你那下面是裸着的吗？”美里打趣地问。

"Irrelevant either way don't you think?" Asuka shot back.  
"无论哪种情况都无关紧要，你不觉得吗？" 明日香反击道。

"Tssk, you're no fun" the older woman said, pouting.  
"啧，你真没趣" 那位年长的女人噘嘴说道。

"No, I'm just not a child like you" Asuka said arrogantly.  
"不，我只是不像你那样幼稚" 明日香傲慢地说。

"Excuse me!" Misato snapped.  
"对不起！" 美里厉声说道。

"Hey girls, relax! Don't you want breakfast?" Shinji said, trying to mediate.  
"嘿，女孩们，放松点！你们不想吃早餐吗？" 真嗣试图调解。

"She started this!" both of them said pointing at the other.  
"是她先开始的！" 两人同时指着对方说道。

"Um well… Asuka come here for a sec" Shinji requested, motioning her to come to him.  
"嗯，那个…明日香，过来一下好吗" 真嗣请求道，示意她过来。

"Why should I?" the redhead asked irately.  
"我为什么要过去？" 红发少女不悦地问道。

"Please?" he entreated. "拜托了？" 他恳求道。

"Fine" Asuka said glaring at their guardian before walking over to the boy.  
“好啦。”明日香瞪了他们的监护人一眼，然后走向那个男孩。

When the young girl came over, Shinji leant over and whispered into her ear. "Let's not get Misato angry at us this morning, she may even force you to go to school…"  
当小女孩走过来时，真嗣俯身在她耳边低语：“今天早上我们别惹美里生气了，她甚至可能会逼你去上学……”

"But-" she started, interrupted by Shinji's hand on her shoulder.  
“但是——”她刚开口，就被真嗣放在她肩上的手打断了。

"Do you really care about her teasing? You already gave her a good comeback, in my eyes you've already won" Shinji whispered further, stroking her ego.  
"你真的在意她的戏弄吗？你已经给了她一个有力的回击，在我看来你已经赢了" 真嗣低声说道，抚慰着她的自尊心。

The redhead took the bait, "Hmpf ok then, I'll stop" she conceded, turning around and sitting down at the dining table opposite Misato.  
红发女孩上钩了，"哼，好吧，那我就不闹了" 她让步道，转身坐在餐桌对面美里旁边。

"A wonderful breakfast awaits us Misato, let's not stress out poor Shinji" Asuka said with a fake smile.  
"美里，一顿美味的早餐在等着我们呢，别让可怜的真嗣再紧张了" 明日香带着假笑说道。

"I concur, it's been so long since I had a _nice_ home-cooked breakfast" Misato said, smiling just as fake.  
"我同意，好久没吃过一顿像样的家常早餐了" 美里说道，笑容同样虚假。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling at the two of them. They both turned to face the boy curiously. "You two are so silly, but at least you gave me a laugh" he commented before moving over to the kitchen.  
真嗣忍不住笑出声来。两人都好奇地转向男孩。"你们俩真傻，但至少让我笑了" 他评论道，然后走向厨房。

The boy quickly got to work preparing breakfasts meals for everyone, the fridge was well stocked so it was easy to make something nice. He whistled as he went about cooking and preparing food, slowly the past few weeks were becoming a fainter memory. It didn't take long for Shinji to finish and he brought the meals to the dining table, sitting down next to Asuka.  
男孩迅速开始为每个人准备早餐，冰箱里储备充足，所以做点好吃的并不难。他一边做饭一边吹着口哨，过去几周的记忆逐渐变得模糊。真嗣很快就完成了，他把早餐端到餐桌旁，坐在明日香旁边。

"Let's eat" they all said aloud and dug into their meals.  
"开动吧" 他们齐声说道，随即开始享用各自的餐点。

"Damn I missed good food in the morning!" Misato said loudly.  
"该死，我真是想念早晨的美味食物！" 美里大声说道。

"Finally, something I can agree with you there" Asuka spoke up after.  
"终于，有件事我能和你达成共识了" 明日香随后开口道。

"Great job Shinji! Thanks for that" Misato continued.  
“干得漂亮，真嗣！谢谢你。”美里继续说道。

"You're welcome" Shinji said gratefully, happily eating as well.  
“不客气。”真嗣感激地说，同时愉快地继续用餐。

Misato looked up at the clock and noticed the time, beginning to hurriedly finish her meal. "Hey guys sorry but I gotta go now! Would love to stay and enjoy breakfast and the company, but I don't have much time left" their guardian explained, gulping down the last of her beer to push down the food.  
美里抬头看了看钟，注意到时间，开始匆忙地结束她的餐食。“嘿，伙计们，抱歉，我现在得走了！虽然很想留下来享受早餐和你们的陪伴，但我时间不多了。”他们的监护人解释道，一口气喝完剩下的啤酒以助消化。

The older woman stood up, gathering her things, before rushing to the front door.  
年长的女士站起身，收拾好自己的东西，然后匆匆走向前门。

"See ya guys! Asuka please go easy on him! Have a good day both of you, I want you to go back to school tomorrow Shinji so get ready for that today. Bye!" Misato shouted out as she left their residence and closed the door behind her.  
“再见大家！明日香，请对他温柔点！祝你们俩今天愉快，真嗣，我希望你明天回学校，所以今天准备好。再见！”美里喊着离开了他们的住处，并关上了门。

'_Finally, we're alone!'_ Shinji thought as he finished up his meal.  
“终于，我们单独在一起了！”真嗣想着，吃完了他的饭。

"You done Asuka?" he asked.  
"你好了吗，明日香？" 他问道。

"Yep!" she answered. "好了！" 她回答道。

"Let me take those then" Shinji offered, taking the girl's dishes.  
"那我来拿这些吧" 真嗣提议道，接过了女孩的盘子。

"Thanks" she replied, remaining seated.  
"谢谢"，她回答道，依旧坐着。

Standing up, the boy took both their dishes and walked into the kitchen depositing them into the sink before returning to the dining room.  
男孩站起身，拿起两人的餐盘走进厨房，将它们放入水槽后，又回到了餐厅。

"What happened to the stuff we left on the table yesterday?" Shinji asked curiously.  
"我们昨天留在桌上的东西去哪儿了？" 真嗣好奇地问道。

"Misato washed them obviously" Asuka replied matter-of-factly.  
"美里显然洗过了" 明日香实事求是地回答道。

"Ah damn… I didn't realise… I'll thank her when she comes back" he commented.  
"啊，该死……我没意识到……等她回来我会感谢她的" 他评论道。

"Whatever" Asuka responded.  
"随你便" 明日香回应道。

Not able to contain himself, Shinji went up behind the girl and cupped her breasts, making her gasp.  
无法自控的 Shinji 从女孩身后走上前，双手捧住她的胸部，让她惊呼出声。

"That was quick!" she commented.  
“这么快！”她评论道。

"Don't tell me you're not in the mood now?" the boy asked hesitantly.  
“别告诉我你现在没心情了？”男孩犹豫地问道。

"No, I am totally sick of waiting" she replied, standing up.  
"不，我实在是等够了" 她回答道，站起身来。

Shinji took the invitation and opened up her robe and began to fondle her breasts. As he played with her nipples, he kissed her all along her neck and shoulders. Asuka moaned erotically, anticipating finally getting some sexual relief after weeks.  
真嗣接过邀请，展开她的长袍，开始抚摸她的乳房。他一边玩弄着她的乳头，一边沿着她的脖子和肩膀亲吻。明日香发出色情的呻吟，期待着在几周后终于能得到一些性缓解。

"I didn't orgasm once since you were gone…" the girl said, her voice full of lust.  
"自从你离开后，我一次都没高潮过……" 女孩说道，声音充满了欲望。

"Me neither" Shinji replied.  
“我也是。”真嗣回答道。

Turning Asuka around to face him, the boy pulled off her robe and let it drop to the floor. He then kissed her passionately, his tongue entering her mouth as he pushed her forward towards the dining table. Lifting up the girl, Shinji sat her onto the dining table and moved in between her legs all the while kissing her. He moved his mouth down her neck and down her body to her breasts where he began to suckle her nipples, making circles around them with his tongue. The redhead moaned in pleasure, arching her back and wrapping her arms around the boy's head, holding him into her chest.  
真嗣将明日香转过身来面对自己，脱下她的浴袍，任其滑落在地。他随即深情地吻她，舌头探入她的口中，一边推着她向前走向餐桌。真嗣将女孩抱起，让她坐在餐桌上，一边继续亲吻，一边移到她的双腿之间。他低头从她的脖颈吻至胸前，开始吮吸她的乳头，用舌头在周围画圈。红发女孩因愉悦而呻吟，挺起背部，双臂环绕着少年的头，将他紧紧拥入怀中。

As he played with her breasts, the boy's hand moved down to her lower region and he slipped his finger inside her soaking pussy.  
当他在玩弄她的乳房时，少年的手向下移至她的私密处，将手指滑入她湿润的私处。

"Oh God!" she cried out; it felt so gratifying after not being touched for a few weeks.  
"哦天哪！"她喊了出来；几周未被触碰后，这种感觉真是令人满足。

"That good huh?" Shinji asked, smirking.  
"这么好啊？" 真嗣问道，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

"Shut up! Just don't stop!" she retorted, opening up her legs to give him more access.  
"闭嘴！别停下！" 她反驳道，张开双腿以便他更深入。

The boy just added another finger to her vagina and began to thrust them in and out of her. Enjoying the pleasure she was feeling, the girl returned the favour and ran her hands up and down the boy's back. Shinji then started to rub her clit with his thumb, causing the girl's whole body to shudder.  
男孩又向她的阴道内伸入了一根手指，开始来回抽动。女孩享受着这份快感，也回以温柔，双手在男孩背上上下抚摸。随后，真嗣开始用拇指揉搓她的阴蒂，让女孩全身都颤抖起来。

"Shit shit! That's it, I'm going to cum, yes! YEESS!" she let out, unable to hold back her excitement.  
“该死！就是这种感觉，我要高潮了，对！就是这样！”她忍不住喊了出来，无法抑制自己的兴奋。

Cheekily, the boy stopped all his actions just as she was about to go over the edge, causing the girl to look down at him in disbelief.  
调皮地，就在她即将达到顶峰时，男孩突然停止了所有动作，让女孩难以置信地低头看着他。

"What, what! I was SOO close, what the fuck Shinji?!" she couldn't help yelling angrily; after weeks of nothing she just wanted her release.  
"什么，什么！我就差那么一点了，搞什么鬼啊，真嗣？！" 她忍不住愤怒地大喊；经过几周的毫无进展，她只是渴望得到解脱。

The boy could feel her whole body quivering. As his head was on her chest, he could also feel her heart beat racing. Even with her anger, her face had a look of desire and she was panting, her eyes full of yearning and disappointment.  
男孩能感觉到她的整个身体在颤抖。由于他的头靠在她的胸前，他还能感受到她心跳加速。尽管她愤怒，她的脸上却带着渴望的神情，喘着气，眼中充满了渴望和失望。

"You should ask for it nicely" he teased.  
"你应该礼貌地请求" 他打趣道。

"No, you can't say that shit now! I was literally about to cum!" she retorted.  
"不，你现在不能说那种屁话！我差点就要高潮了！"她反驳道。

"Tssk, I guess you don't want it after all" he replied, moving off.  
"啧，看来你根本不想要"他回答，移开了身体。

"I do, I do! I want to cum!" she said desperately.  
"我要，我要！我想高潮！"她急切地说。

"How do you ask nicely?" he asked playfully.  
"怎么礼貌地请求呢？" 他调皮地问道。

"PLEASE! Please Shinji, I want to cum!" she said, not caring anymore.  
"求你了！求求你，真嗣，我想高潮！" 她不再顾忌，直言不讳地说道。

At once he returned his fingers to her cunt, which were drenched in her juices. He went to kiss Asuka, but was surprised to see her attack him instead as she kissed him with intense passion.  
他立刻将手指重新伸入她的私处，那里早已被她的爱液浸透。他本想吻向明日香，却惊讶地发现她主动迎了上来，以一种炽热的激情吻住了他。

"I'm cumming! I'm cumming! Don't fucking stop!" she shouted parting.  
"我要来了！我要来了！别他妈停下！" 她分开时喊道。

Although he was tempted to stop again, he knew he shouldn't go overboard and gave Asuka her desired release.  
尽管他很想再次停下来，但他知道不应该做得太过火，于是给了明日香她渴望的高潮。

"SHINJI!" she screamed as she orgasmed fiercely.  
"真嗣！" 她在激烈的高潮中尖叫道。

The redhead arched her back, shoving her hips into his hand as she pulled on the boy. Shinji slowly let her down from her orgasm, removing his fingers from her pussy and letting the girl lean on him.  
红发女孩拱起背部，将臀部推向他的手，同时拉扯着男孩。真嗣缓缓地让她从高潮中平复下来，从她的私处抽出手指，让女孩倚靠在他身上。

SMACK! 啪！

The boy looked back at Asuka, surprised at the pain in his cheek. Even though the girl looked satisfied, and her eyes had a dreamy look in them, she had still slapped him across the face.  
男孩回头看向明日香，脸上惊讶地感受到疼痛。尽管女孩看起来心满意足，眼中带着梦幻般的光芒，但她还是狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。

"Don't pull that shit on me at the last second asshole, making me beg, how dare you!" she said trying to sound angry; the warm feeling of the afterglow made it hard for her to actually be mad at him.  
"别在最后一刻对我耍这种混蛋手段，让我求你，你怎么敢！" 她试图听起来很生气；但事后余温让她很难真的对他发火。

"Come on Asuka, it felt good didn't it?" he countered.  
"来吧，明日香，感觉不错吧？" 他反驳道。

"Hmpf" was all she said in return.  
"哼" 是她唯一的回应。

Shinji moved over and kissed her on the lips again, which she returned in full. As they parted, they looked at each other, Asuka's face still full of desire.  
真嗣挪过去再次吻了她的唇，她也热情地回应。分开时，他们彼此对视，明日香的脸庞依旧充满渴望。

"Are you going to fuck me or what?" Asuka asked impatiently.  
“你到底要不要上我？”明日香不耐烦地问。

"Believe me, I want nothing more, but it's fun seeing you lose your mind" he said, laughing.  
“相信我，我别无所求，但看你失控的样子真有趣。”他笑着说。

"Third child, you are this close to me kicking you in the balls. Don't keep me wait- OH GOD YES!" she let out as he thrust his cock up her cunt.  
"老三，你再磨蹭，我可要踢你蛋蛋了。别让我等——哦天哪，太棒了！" 她尖叫着，当他将他的肉棒深深插入她的蜜穴时。

The girl was so wet, his dick just slipped straight in. Asuka wrapped her legs around the boy as he moved in and out of her, trying to get him in as deep as possible. Shinji held onto the girl tightly as he pumped into her, his mouth kissing her everywhere he could while Asuka did the same. The redhead couldn't help crying out in pleasure as he began to thrust into her even quicker.  
女孩湿透了，他的阴茎轻易地滑了进去。明日香双腿缠绕着男孩，随着他在她体内进出，试图让他尽可能深入。真嗣紧紧抱住女孩，一边抽插一边亲吻她能触及的每一处，而明日香也以同样的方式回应。红发女孩忍不住随着他加快的抽插而发出愉悦的叫喊。

"Ah… Ah… fuck yes… this feels so good!" the girl shouted.  
"啊……啊……操，太爽了……这感觉太棒了！" 女孩大声喊道。

"Damn, your pussy is so tight, I can't hold on much longer" Shinji said, grunting with the effort; after no sex for a few weeks, he felt like he had barely any stamina to hold it in.  
“该死，你的那里真紧，我快撑不住了。”真嗣喘着气说，几周没有性生活，他感觉自己几乎没有耐力再坚持下去。

"It's… ok… if you… cum…" Asuka let out between thrusts.  
“你…可以…射…出来…”明日香在撞击间喘息道。

Unable to hold it in any longer, the boy burst inside the girl, continuing to thrust into her as he spilled his seed inside her before eventually coming to a stop, leaning on the girl. Asuka could feel him still inside her, slowly shrinking.  
男孩再也控制不住，在女孩体内爆发，继续在她体内冲刺，直到将种子全部倾泻其中，最终停了下来，靠在女孩身上。明日香能感觉到他还在她体内，慢慢缩小。

"Wow, that felt incredible… I missed out on this for so long" Shinji said as his body finally calmed down.  
“哇，那感觉真是不可思议……我错过了这么久。” 真嗣说道，他的身体终于平静下来。

Enjoying the warmth of his body next to her and the feeling of him still inside her, she let out a pleased mew. "Mmm, I can feel it… you let out _a lot_… I feel all warm inside" the girl replied, sounding delighted.  
享受着他身体紧贴的温暖和他仍在她体内的感觉，她发出了一声满意的喵呜。“嗯，我能感觉到……你释放了很多……我感觉里面暖暖的。”女孩回答道，听起来很高兴。

"I wasn't lying about not cumming" he responded, grinning.  
“我没有撒谎，关于没有射出来。”他回应道，咧嘴笑着。

"I'm just glad it felt so good for you" she said smiling genuinely, her hand stroking his chest, causing his member to stir. Asuka just grinned impishly as she felt his member harden again. "I can see you're ready to go again"  
"我只是很高兴你感觉那么好" 她笑着说，真心实意，手抚摸着他的胸膛，让他的那物开始苏醒。明日香只是调皮地笑了笑，感觉到他的那物再次变硬。"我能看出你已经准备好再来一次了"

"A-are you surprised? You are so damn sexy and… damn I almost forgot how good this felt" he commented, a blush on his face.  
"你感到惊讶吗？你真是太性感了，而且……该死，我差点忘了这感觉有多棒" 他评论道，脸上泛起红晕。

"Then what are you waiting for?" she asked.  
"那你还在等什么呢？" 她问道。

At this Shinji withdrew and moved off her, causing Asuka to let out a small sound of protest. As he stood back to let her off the table, he noticed some semen oozing out of her vagina. Following his lead, the girl got off the table and stood up, her legs wobbling momentarily before the boy promptly turned her around and pushed her face down on the table with her ass facing him.  
此时，真嗣退开并从她身上移开，导致明日香发出一声小小的抗议声。当他站到一旁让她离开桌子时，他注意到一些精液从她的阴道流出。跟随他的引导，女孩离开桌子站了起来，她的腿摇晃了一下，男孩迅速将她转过身来，将她的脸朝下按在桌子上，臀部对着他。

"Just wanted to change positions" he answered.  
“只是想换个姿势”他回答道。

Unseen by the boy, Asuka found herself going red from being in this position; there was just something embarrassing about exposing her rear to him like this. Shinji grabbed her ass and squeezed it, causing the girl to let out a small "mmm."  
男孩没有察觉到，明日香发现自己因为这个姿势而脸红；就这样将臀部暴露给他，总让她感到有些尴尬。真嗣抓住她的臀部并捏了一下，让女孩发出一声小小的“嗯”。

"Shinji…" the girl started softly, "This isn't the most comfortable position, I don't really mind, but don't take so long to st-arrrrr-t" she commented, finishing her sentence just he pushed his cock into her.  
"真嗣…" 女孩轻声开口，"这个姿势不太舒服，不过我无所谓，但你别拖太久才开——啊啊啊——始" 她话音刚落，他就将他的阴茎插入了她体内。

Shinji grabbed onto her waist to use as leverage as he pounded into her, a wet smacking sound heard as he continuously thrust his cock into her.  
真嗣抓住她的腰作为支撑，随着他猛烈地撞击她，一阵湿润的啪啪声随之响起，他不断地将他的阴茎插入她体内。

"Fuck yes! This is… so… fucking… good!" she managed to say between plunges.  
"操，太爽了！这真是…太…他妈的…爽了！" 她在每一次撞击间勉强说出这句话。

Shinji increased his pace, finding himself close to climaxing already.  
真嗣加快了速度，发现自己已经接近高潮。

"Yes! YES! I'm gonna cum! I'm cumming! Fuck yes!" the girl screamed; the previous activities had already built her up a bit.  
“是的！对！我要射了！我射了！操，太爽了！”女孩尖叫着；之前的活动已经让她有些兴奋了。

Hearing that Asuka was close made Shinji feel relieved as he doubled down on his efforts and rammed into her vagina without mercy, making the girl feel breathless.  
听到明日香也快到了，真嗣感到一阵释然，他加倍努力，毫不留情地猛烈撞击她的阴道，让女孩感到喘不过气来。

The redhead screamed in orgasm, her body shaking aggressively. At this, Shinji exploded inside the girl again, depositing another load into her, before collapsing onto her. After a moment, the boy began to pull out of the girl before being interrupted.  
红发女孩在高潮中尖叫，身体剧烈颤抖。见此情景，真嗣再次在女孩体内爆发，又一股热流注入，随后瘫倒在她的身上。片刻后，男孩正要抽身离开，却被打断了。

"Wait!" Asuka let out quickly, "Leave it in for a moment… just a moment" the girl implored, her voice sounding out of breath; she was enjoying the feeling of being full while her pussy throbbed around him.  
“等等！”明日香急忙喊道，“先别拔出来……就一会儿……”女孩恳求着，声音显得气喘吁吁；她正享受着那种被填满的感觉，下体紧紧包裹着他。

Feeling his cock shrink completely, the boy then pulled out of Asuka's vagina and moved off her. The redhead pushed herself off the dining table and turned around to face the boy. Feeling happy after their passion, the girl kissed the boy hungrily, before pushing him down onto the couch in the living room. She then sat on top of him and snuggled up to him, sighing with satisfaction.  
感觉到自己的阴茎完全萎缩，男孩随即从明日香的阴道中抽出，移开了身体。红发女孩从餐桌上一撑而起，转身面对男孩。激情过后，她感到无比愉悦，饥渴地吻了男孩，然后将他推倒在客厅的沙发上。她随即坐在他身上，依偎着他，满足地叹了口气。

"Mmmm Shinji, that was really good… I really needed that" she said softly.  
"嗯，真嗣，那真的很棒……我真的需要那个" 她轻声说道。

Shinji held her in his arms as she snuggled into him and he stroked her hair. "Thanks for that Asuka… I don't think I could've had a better welcome back" he said gratefully.  
真嗣抱着她，她依偎在他怀里，他轻抚着她的头发。"谢谢你，明日香……我想我没有比这更好的归来了" 他感激地说。

"Hmpf, who do you think you're talking to?" she asked rhetorically.  
"哼，你以为你在跟谁说话？" 她反问道。

"How could I forget?" he said, kissing her on the head. "Could I also request something…?" he asked with a hint of hope.  
"我怎么可能忘记呢？" 他说着，在她头上轻轻一吻。"我还能请求点什么吗……？" 他带着一丝希望问道。

"What's that?" the girl asked curiously.  
"那是什么？" 女孩好奇地问。

"Um… oral sex?" he suggested.  
"嗯……口交？" 他试探性地提议道。

"You want me to give you a blowjob?" she asked bluntly; causing his member to twitch.  
“你想让我给你口交？”她直截了当地问，这让他那玩意儿不由自主地抽动了一下。

"Err yeah, I just wanted to experience it at least once… and you seem to be in an accommodating mood" he replied.  
“呃，是的，我只是想至少体验一次……而且你看起来心情不错，愿意迁就人”他回答道。

"That doesn't mean I'll do anything for you" she retorted, narrowing her eyes at him before pondering his request for a moment. "Well, you've done it for me many times… though to be fair it's a bit easier for you… I can at least try it I suppose…" she said, agreeing to his appeal; Shinji's member twitched again.  
“这并不意味着我会为你做任何事”她反驳道，眯起眼睛打量了他一会儿，然后思考着他的请求。“好吧，你已经为我做过很多次了……虽然公平地说，对你来说可能更容易些……我想我可以至少试试……”她答应了他的请求；真嗣的那东西再次抽动了一下。

Asuka moved off the boy and went to grab Shinji's penis. "Already excited I see" she said smirking at his hardness; the feel of her hand grasping his shaft felt really good too.  
明日香从男孩身上移开，伸手去抓真嗣的阴茎。“看来已经兴奋了呢。”她带着一丝戏谑看着他的坚挺，手指握住他的肉棒，那种触感也让她感到非常舒服。

The girl then moved her hand up and down his shaft to get it to full hardness, causing the boy to groan in pleasure. Asuka felt odd pleasuring him like this, she typically only did this to get him hard while she let her vagina do all the work. Doing this, where she was only giving him physical pleasure, she could directly see the effect she had on him and it made her feel good in a different way; perhaps this is what Shinji felt like when he gave her pleasure with his fingers or tongue. She then moved her face down towards his member, the strong scent of his and her sexual odours assaulted her nose and she paused for a moment. _'Shinji must smell this every time… it's so strong… oh well whatever'_ she thought, just bearing with it; her nose would get used to it soon enough. Asuka continued and licked the tip of his cock with her tongue, making it twitch; its reaction fascinated the girl as she didn't really look at his penis up close normally. The taste itself wasn't pleasant, but it wasn't terrible, she could certainly go ahead without issue.  
女孩随后上下移动手在他的柱体上，直至它完全坚挺，引得男孩发出愉悦的呻吟。明日香感到这样取悦他有些奇怪，她通常只是这样做让他硬起来，然后让她的阴道完成所有工作。现在这样，她只给予他身体上的快感，能直接看到自己的影响，这让她感到一种不同的满足；或许这就是真嗣用手指或舌头给她带来快感时的感觉。她接着将脸靠近他的部位，他俩性欲的浓烈气味冲击着她的鼻子，她顿了一下。“真嗣每次都得闻这个…好浓…算了，无所谓了。”她想着，忍耐着；她的鼻子很快就会习惯的。明日香继续用舌头舔舐他的龟头，让它抽搐；这种反应让女孩着迷，因为她平时并不常近距离观察他的阴茎。味道本身并不愉快，但也不糟糕，她完全可以继续，没什么问题。

She carefully studied the cock in her hands, seeing the veins running up and down it. Tracing one with her finger, she briefly wondered about the intricacies of how erections worked and what it felt like for the boy.  
她小心翼翼地研究着手中的阴茎，观察着上面纵横交错的血管。用手指轻轻划过其中一条，她短暂地思考了勃起的复杂机制以及男孩对此的感受。

"Asuka, you really know how to tease" Shinji remarked at her actions.  
“Asuka，你真的很会挑逗。”Shinji 对她的举动评论道。

"Yeah well! It's what you deserve after doing it to me so many times" she retorted, gripping his cock tightly.  
“哼，那是当然！谁让你对我做了那么多次。”她反驳道，紧紧握住他的阴茎。

"Not so hard! It's sensitive just like your vagina" he said, jumping a little.  
“别太用力！它就像你的阴道一样敏感。”他说着，轻轻跳了一下。

"Hehe, this kind of fun" she said smirking before fondling his testicles with her other hand, causing the boy to tense up.  
“呵呵，这种乐趣。”她笑着，一边挑逗地摸着他的睾丸，让男孩紧张起来。

It definitely felt pleasant and it wasn't the first time she had touched them, but after her rough handling with the shaft, he felt a bit of fear. "That feels good Asuka, but please be gentle with those… you can easily cause me intense pain" he warned.  
那种感觉确实很愉快，而且这已经不是她第一次触摸它们了，但经过她对阴茎的粗暴对待后，他感到一丝恐惧。“感觉很好，Asuka，但请对它们温柔些……你很容易让我感到剧痛的。”他警告道。

"Seeing you panic is so funny, don't worry I won't hurt you" Asuka said, letting go, at which the boy instantly relaxed.  
"看你慌张的样子真有趣，别担心，我不会伤害你的。" 明日香说着，松开了手，男孩立刻放松了下来。

The redhead brought her mouth down onto his member, licking around the tip in circles, causing the boy to moan; that definitely felt good for him.  
红发女孩将嘴凑近他的部位，用舌头绕着顶端画圈，男孩不禁呻吟出声；这对他来说确实感觉很棒。

"Just be wary of your teeth…" he commented, which Asuka nodded at and continued her actions.  
"小心你的牙齿……" 他提醒道，明日香点头示意，继续她的动作。

She decided to lick the shaft up and down, before licking the tip again all the while watching his reactions; the boy definitely approved. Having some confidence now with her actions, she then brought his cock into her mouth and pushed it inside, engulfing it partially.  
她决定先上下舔舐那根柱子，然后再舔舐顶端，同时观察他的反应；那男孩显然很满意。有了些许自信后，她便将他的阴茎含入口中，推进去，部分吞没。

"That's great Asuka!" Shinji praised, making sure to let Asuka know she was doing the right thing.  
“干得漂亮，明日香！”真嗣称赞道，确保让明日香知道她做得对。

The girl took in more until it almost reached the back of her throat, before pulling out and repeating the same thing. She sucked on it as she brought it in and ran her tongue along the tip and shaft before pulling out again. Her head bobbed up and down as she repeated these actions, building up a rhythm; Shinji began to pat the girl's head, enjoying the pleasure.  
女孩吸入更多，几乎触及喉咙后部，然后抽出并重复同样的动作。她一边吸吮一边将其引入，用舌头沿着顶端和柱体滑动，然后再抽出。她的头上下摆动，重复这些动作，建立起节奏；真嗣开始轻拍女孩的头，享受着快感。

"Good girl, that feels great" he said moaning.  
"好姑娘，感觉真棒" 他呻吟着说。

Normally she would have felt like he was being patronising, but she could tell from his tone he was just praising her. The girl realised she wasn't taking in his whole length and suspected it would feel better if she could take more in, but struggled to think of way; surely she would gag if she took it in any deeper? She stopped her actions for a moment and looked up at the boy.  
通常她会觉得他在摆架子，但从他的语气中她能听出他只是在表扬她。女孩意识到自己并没有完全吞下他的全部，怀疑如果能吞得更深，感觉会更好，但又想不出办法；她肯定会作呕的，如果再深入一点的话？她停顿了一下，抬头看着男孩。

"Is this good?" she asked him, making sure.  
"这样好吗？" 她问他，确保一下。

"It's amazing Asuka, you don't need to stop" he said, he was getting pretty close to cumming.  
"真是不可思议，Asuka，你不用停下来" 他说道，他快要达到高潮了。

"How… how can I take it all in? It's already reaching the back of my throat… but I feel like it would feel better for you if I take more in" she asked him curiously.  
"我…我怎么能全部吞下呢？它已经顶到我喉咙后部了…但我觉得如果你能吞得更多，你会感觉更好" 她好奇地问他。

"Well, you don't need to worry about that" Shinji chuckled, surprised at her innocence. "Apparently Kensuke said there's a technique called deep throating where girls train themselves to stop their gag reflex and let it slide down their throat a little… but I'm not expecting you to do that… what you're doing is fabulous!" he explained.  
"嗯，你不必担心那个" Shinji 轻笑，对她的纯真感到惊讶。"显然 Kensuke 说过有一种叫深喉的技巧，女孩们训练自己抑制呕吐反射，让那东西滑入喉咙更深处…但我并不期望你做到那一步…你现在的表现已经非常棒了！" 他解释道。

"Hmmm… surely it's not that hard?" she commented, wanting to try at least.  
"嗯……应该没那么难吧？" 她评论道，至少想尝试一下。

The girl took his cock into her mouth again and this time slowly moved it further back, as it reached the back of her throat, she instantly gagged and moved away coughing.  
女孩再次将他的阴茎含入口中，这次她慢慢地将其向后移动，当它触及喉咙后部时，她立刻呛住了，咳嗽着移开了。

"Asuka, it's ok… you don't need to do it" Shinji remarked.  
"明日香，没关系的……你不必这么做" 真嗣说道。

"Wow, it's actually really big for your throat, now that I know what to expect I'll try again" she refuted, accepting the challenge.  
“哇，现在我知道该怎么做了，你的喉咙其实挺大的，我再试试。”她反驳道，接受了挑战。

Asuka took it in again and slowly moved it back to her throat again, she felt herself gag again and her body jolted but she forced her throat to relax and pulled away. She took a deep breath through her nose and tried again, focusing on relaxing her throat. This time her body reacted mildly and his cock slid down her throat, allowing her to take him in fully. The girl then pulled away and tried again, achieving a similar result; it was impossible for her to do this quickly though because it required so much concentration. The redhead moved off again to speak.  
明日香再次将其含入，慢慢地将其移回喉咙，她再次感到恶心，身体一震，但她强迫自己的喉咙放松并退开。她用鼻子深吸一口气，再次尝试，专注于放松喉咙。这次她的身体反应轻微，他的阴茎滑入她的喉咙，让她完全吞下他。女孩然后退开再次尝试，取得了类似的结果；尽管如此，她无法快速做到这一点，因为它需要如此多的专注。红发女孩再次移开说话。

"It's way too hard… sorry Shinji… I'll need more practice" she said, sounding a little defeated; Shinji almost couldn't believe his ears, if she needed more "practice," of course he would be happy to oblige.  
“这太难了……对不起，真嗣……我需要更多练习。”她说，听起来有些沮丧；真嗣几乎不敢相信自己的耳朵，如果她需要更多“练习”，当然他会很乐意配合。

"Asuka I'm just grateful you actually tried… I'm pretty close so just keep going! And if you could please… swallow it when I release" he requested.  
"Asuka，我只是很感激你真的尝试了……我快到了，所以继续！还有，如果你能在我释放时……吞下去，那就太好了" 他请求道。

"Yeah yeah so demanding, you're lucky I'm in such a generous mood" she said, smirking.  
"是是是，这么要求真多，算你走运我今天心情这么好" 她笑着说，嘴角上扬。

The girl then resumed her previous rhythm without deepthroating and began to move up and down his shaft with her lips at a good pace.  
女孩随后恢复了之前的节奏，没有再深喉，而是以一个不错的速度用嘴唇上下移动着他的阴茎。

"Damn that's good! I'm gonna cum soon" Shinji announced.  
"该死，太棒了！我快来了" 真嗣宣布道。

At this, the girl increased her pace, wanting to give the boy his release.  
听到这话，女孩加快了速度，想要让男孩得到释放。

"Shit I'm cumming, get ready, I'm cumming!" Shinji shouted in pleasure, unable to hold back his orgasm any longer, instinctively holding the girl's head as he began to cum.  
"妈的，我要射了，准备好，我要射了！" 真嗣兴奋地大喊，再也抑制不住自己的高潮，本能地按住女孩的头，开始射精。

The boy ejaculated inside the girl's mouth and Asuka was caught off guard at the amount and the taste but she made sure to swallow his seed as he released it, not wanting it to spill out. The girl found it quite interesting the way his cock pulsated with each load shooting out, it was a good indication of when another burst was coming. Eventually he finished and the girl pulled away, before licking the tip of his cock, finishing up any remnants of his semen. The taste was kind of salty and awful, but she figured she had already swallowed the rest anyway.  
男孩在女孩嘴里射了出来，明日香被这量和味道吓了一跳，但她确保在他释放时吞下了他的种子，不想让它溢出。女孩觉得他的阴茎随着每次射出而跳动的方式相当有趣，这是另一个爆发即将到来的好迹象。最终他结束了，女孩退开，然后舔了舔他的阴茎尖端，清理掉任何残留的精液。味道有点咸而且难吃，但她想反正已经吞下了剩下的部分。

"I must say your semen tastes pretty awful, but whatever, I'm guessing I don't taste that great down there either" she commented.  
"我得说你的精液味道相当糟糕，但无所谓，我猜我自己那儿的味道也不怎么样"她评论道。

"It's peculiar actually, you're right that it doesn't taste nice or anything, but once you do it a few times, you come to like it especially as you know how good it makes your partner feel" he explained. "In any case, you did a wonderful job honestly, thanks Asuka" he said gratefully.  
"实际上很奇怪，你说的没错，它确实不好吃，但一旦你做了几次，你就会开始喜欢它，尤其是你知道它让你的伴侣感觉有多好"他解释道。"无论如何，你做得真的很棒，谢谢你，明日香"他感激地说。

"Well… if I'm in a good mood I can do it again sometime, definitely not today though" she replied, before snuggling up to the boy again.  
"嗯…如果我心情好的话，改天可以再来一次，不过今天肯定不行"她回答道，然后再次依偎在男孩身边。

Shinji held her warmly, running his hand up and down her back.  
真嗣温暖地抱着她，用手在她背上上下抚摸。

"Mmmm" Asuka let out, enjoying the peace of the moment before speaking up, "Unfortunately we can't stay like this forever… you still need to clean the house and do the laundry…" she reminded him.  
"嗯嗯" 明日香发出声音，享受着这一刻的宁静，然后开口说道，"遗憾的是我们不能永远这样待着…你还得打扫房子和洗衣服…"她提醒他。

"Damn… what a way to ruin the mood" Shinji teased.  
"该死……真是破坏气氛的方式" 真嗣打趣道。

"Well yeah but… it has to be done…" she replied.  
"嗯，是啊，但是……这必须得做……" 她回答道。

"Yeah, yeah" he said resignedly, he didn't really mind anyway. "Do I get a reward after finishing?" he asked hopefully.  
"是啊，是啊" 他无奈地说，反正他也不介意。"完成后我能得到奖励吗？" 他满怀希望地问。

At this, the girl looked up at him with a seductive smile. "What, did you think we were done for today?" she asked, tracing his lips with her fingers. Shinji's eyed widened with excitement.  
听到这话，女孩抬头朝他露出一个诱人的微笑。“怎么，你以为今天就这样结束了？”她问道，手指沿着他的唇线划过。真嗣的眼睛因兴奋而睁大了。

"Errr- I… umm" he stuttered.  
“呃——我…嗯”他结巴道。

"Don't keep me waiting boy, hurry up and finish your chores" she ordered.  
“别让我等，小子，快点把你的活儿干完”她命令道。

"Yes Asuka!" Shinji replied. _'This is going to be a long day'_ he thought.  
"好的，明日香！" 真嗣回答道。'今天将会是漫长的一天' 他心想。

---

"-inji" "-真嗣"

"Shinji" "真嗣"

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

The noise caused the brown-haired boy to finally stir. He found himself opening his eyes to the sight of a beautiful girl's face. Shinji smiled up at the redhead, curiously wondering what she was doing here. Memories of yesterday filled his mind as he vividly remembered the abundant sex they had. The boy lost count of how many times he orgasmed yesterday, but he certainly remembered how Asuka seemed to have almost limitless energy. Right after he had finished cleaning the house and depositing the dirty clothes into the washing machine, they had screwed each other senseless, only stopping just before Misato came back; they had practically spent the whole day in Shinji's bed.  
这声呼唤终于让棕发少年动了起来。他睁开眼，映入眼帘的是一张美丽女孩的面庞。真嗣对着红发女孩微笑，好奇她为何会在这里。昨日的记忆涌入脑海，他清晰地记得他们之间激烈的性爱。真嗣已记不清自己高潮了多少次，但他确实记得明日香似乎有着近乎无限的精力。就在他刚打扫完房子，把脏衣服放进洗衣机后，他们便疯狂地缠绵在一起，直到美里回来前才停下；他们几乎一整天都待在真嗣的床上。

Their guardian was suspicious about the two as Asuka was in such a good mood, she didn't make any smart-ass comments or tease her; Misato knew exactly what a satisfied woman was like after all. Regardless, the older woman didn't say anything and they went about the rest of the day as usual, with Asuka helping Shinji prepare for school, until she went to bed. Afterwards, the boy had then paid a visit to Asuka in her room where they continued for another hour or so before Shinji went back to his bed and feel asleep immediately, exhausted from their activities; it looked like Asuka was really warming up to him.  
他们的监护人 Misato 对这两人的情况感到怀疑，因为 Asuka 心情异常好，没有说任何刻薄话或取笑他；毕竟，Misato 深知一个心满意足的女人是什么样子。尽管如此，年长的女性并未多言，他们照常度过了一天，Asuka 还帮 Shinji 准备上学，直到她上床睡觉。之后，Shinji 去 Asuka 房间看望她，他们在那里又继续了一个小时左右，然后 Shinji 回到自己的床上，立刻因活动疲惫而入睡；看来 Asuka 真的开始对他热络起来了。

After a moment of looking at the girl's face and seeing it more clearly, Shinji realised she didn't look too pleased.  
盯着女孩的脸看了一会儿，看得更清楚后，Shinji 意识到她看起来并不太高兴。

"Get up you lazy baka! Don't you remember we have school today and it's already late! You haven't even made our lunches yet!" Asuka shouted at him.  
“起床了，你这个懒鬼笨蛋！你难道不记得我们今天有学校吗，已经很晚了！你甚至还没准备好我们的午餐！” Asuka 对他大喊道。

'_Maybe I'm wrong'_ he thought sweat dropping; it was such a contrast to her sweetness yesterday.  
“也许我错了。”他心想，汗水滴落；这与她昨日的甜美形成了鲜明对比。

"Why didn't you wake me up earlier then?" Shinji asked, sitting up.  
“那你为什么不早点叫醒我？”真嗣坐起身问道。

"It's not my job to wake you up!" she shouted.  
“叫你起床可不是我的职责！”她喊道。

"But-" Shinji started. “但是——”真嗣开口道。

"Get dressed before I dress you myself!" she snapped, interrupting him before exiting his room.  
"在我亲自给你穿之前，快点自己穿好衣服！" 她厉声打断他，随即离开了他的房间。

Jumping out of his bed, the boy grabbed the school uniform out of his wardrobe and swiftly changed into it. He rushed out of his room and saw Asuka standing at the dining table. Shinji moved up to the girl, put his arms around her waist and kissed her softly on the cheek before entering the kitchen to begin preparing their lunches.  
男孩从床上跳起来，从衣柜里抓起校服迅速换上。他冲出房间，看到明日香站在餐桌旁。真嗣走到女孩身边，双手环住她的腰，轻轻在她脸颊上吻了一下，然后走进厨房开始准备他们的午餐。

"Misato not here?" he asked, unable to see their guardian; she was sipping a beer at the table at this time just yesterday.  
"美里不在吗？" 他问道，没看到他们的监护人；昨天这个时候她还在桌边喝着啤酒呢。

"Nope" Asuka replied, shaking her head.  
"不行" 明日香回答，摇了摇头。

Shinji continued inside the kitchen and started making their lunches. Not wanting to be late or make Asuka angry, the boy was sure to be fast in making the meals. The redhead went over to him when he finished with their lunches.  
真嗣继续在厨房里忙碌，开始准备他们的午餐。不想迟到或惹明日香生气，男孩确保自己动作迅速。红发女孩在他完成午餐后走到他身边。

"Knowing you probably have no clue, I should mention today is sports day. Remember to pack your sports gear" she stated, grabbing her lunch.  
"知道你可能没概念，我得提醒你今天是体育日。记得带上你的运动装备" 她一边说，一边拿起自己的午餐。

"Thanks for letting me know Asuka" the boy replied gratefully, yawning.  
"谢谢你告诉我，明日香。" 男孩感激地回答，打了个哈欠。

"You look a little tired" she remarked.  
"你看起来有点累。" 她评论道。

"You exhausted me yesterday Asuka!" Shinji said, sticking his tongue out at her.  
"你昨天把我累坏了，明日香！" 真嗣说，向她吐了吐舌头。

"Don't blame me retard! And as if you didn't enjoy it all. Just go and pack your stuff, we need to go!" she snapped at him.  
"别怪我，傻瓜！好像你没乐在其中似的。快去收拾你的东西，我们得走了！" 她厉声对他说道。

The boy took his lunch, returned to his bedroom and made sure to pack his sports gear into his gym bag and his lunch into his school bag before taking them both. Coming back to the dining room, Shinji saw his roommate waiting for him at the front door and thus went over to her.  
男孩拿起午餐，回到卧室，确保将运动装备装进健身包，午餐放进书包，然后带上两个包。回到餐厅时，真嗣看到室友在前门等他，于是走过去。

"I'm ready, let's go" Shinji announced.  
"我准备好了，走吧" 真嗣宣布道。

"About time" the girl said with relief.  
“终于到了。”女孩松了口气说道。

The two adolescents exited through the front door and closed it behind them before dashing down the stairs and out of the apartment. After leaving the building, Shinji and Asuka began their trip to school, walking at a brisk pace.  
两个少年从前门出去，关上门后便冲下楼梯，离开了公寓。离开大楼后，真嗣和明日香开始前往学校的路程，步伐轻快。

The boy was watching the girl to his right, still amazed at how beautiful she was; her long red hair flowing down her back was shining brightly in the sun today, probably from having a shower this morning.  
男孩注视着右边的女孩，依旧惊叹于她的美丽；她那长长的红发披散在背上，在阳光下闪闪发光，大概是今早洗过澡的缘故。

"You have wonderful hair Asuka, did I ever tell you that?" Shinji commented randomly.  
"你的头发真漂亮，明日香，我以前告诉过你吗？" 真嗣随意地评论道。

The redhead turned to face the boy, surprised at the remark.  
红发女孩转过身面对男孩，对他的话感到惊讶。

"Umm I don't think so but thanks… I washed it this morning" she replied awkwardly; he wasn't one to compliment her so casually.  
"嗯，我不记得了，不过谢谢……我今早刚洗过头发" 她尴尬地回答；他平时可不会这么随意地赞美她。

Even after her reply, the male eva pilot kept his gaze on her, causing Asuka to wonder what he was doing.  
即便在她回复之后，那位男性 EVA 驾驶员依旧凝视着她，这让明日香不禁好奇他在做什么。

"Why are you looking at me? Have I got something on my face?" she inquired, a small smile forming on her face from the attention.  
“你为什么盯着我看？我脸上有什么东西吗？”她问道，因这份关注而在脸上绽开了一抹浅笑。

"Yeah" he answered. “嗯”他答道。

"Oh, what is it?" she asked, reaching up to her face.  
"哦，怎么了？" 她问道，伸手摸向自己的脸。

"Your beautiful smile" he replied.  
"你美丽的笑容" 他回答道。

The girl found herself blushing; as much as she said she disliked him being corny, she actually enjoyed and cherished the moments when Shinji had the courage to be sweet and charming.  
女孩发现自己脸红了；尽管她常说讨厌他老套，但实际上她很享受并珍惜真嗣有勇气展现温柔和魅力的时刻。

"Enough with that, you're making me blush. I don't know what's up with you this morning" Asuka said, shaking her head.  
“够了，你让我脸红了。不知道你今天早上怎么了。”明日香摇着头说。

"I mean, I did have lots of fun with a gorgeous girl yesterday… I'm in a pretty good mood and I just want to show my appreciation for you" he explained, "But if that's not enough, I can also play you a song too" Shinji joked.  
“我是说，昨天和一位漂亮女孩玩得很开心……我现在心情很好，只想表达对你的感激。”他解释道，“但如果这还不够，我也可以给你弹首歌。”真嗣开玩笑说。

"You are such a moron, why would I want you to serenade me?" she retorted.  
“你真是个傻瓜，我为什么要你给我唱小夜曲？”她反驳道。

"Perhaps you'd prefer a duet instead? After all you play the violin, right?" Shinji suggested more seriously.  
"或许你更喜欢二重奏？毕竟你会拉小提琴，对吧？" 真嗣更认真地提议道。

"Now that's not a bad idea actually. You could even teach me how to play the cello" Asuka replied.  
"这主意其实不错。你甚至可以教我拉大提琴" 明日香回答道。

"It wouldn't be too hard I guess" the boy agreed.  
"我想应该不会太难" 男孩同意道。

The two eva pilots continued on to the school, arriving at the gates quite soon. Hurrying into the school building and moving down the corridor, Shinji and Asuka finally reached their classroom. Not a moment later after the two had entered the classroom and sat down at their seats, did the teacher walk in. Hikari instantly stood up and said her "Rise! Bow! Sit!" beginning the class. This time, however, the teacher didn't start on his speech and instead addressed the students.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员继续前往学校，很快就到达了校门口。他们匆匆进入教学楼，沿着走廊前行，最终抵达了教室。两人刚一进教室并坐到座位上，老师就走了进来。光立刻站起来，喊出“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”开始了课堂。然而，这次老师没有开始他的讲话，而是直接向学生们宣布。

"Everyone, the first part of school will be spent down at the pool as we are doing swimming practice for sports today" the teacher announced. "Additionally, seeing as Mr. Ikari has returned, we will continue practising the play after lunch. If there are no questions, we will head down to the pool now"  
“各位，今天上午我们将在游泳池进行游泳练习，作为体育课的一部分。”老师宣布道，“另外，既然碇同学回来了，我们午饭后将继续排练戏剧。如果没有问题，我们现在就去游泳池。”

At this, the class stood up and piled out of the classroom before heading down towards the pool. The students left their schoolbags in the classroom while taking their sports bag to the pool. A few students greeted and welcomed Shinji back to school as they walked to the pool. As the class arrived at the pool, they slowly sat down on the seats nearby and awaited the teacher's instructions. The teacher looked around as if searching for something before addressing the class.  
听到这话，全班同学站起身，涌出教室，朝游泳池走去。学生们把书包留在教室，只带上运动包前往泳池。有几个学生在走向泳池的路上向真嗣打招呼，欢迎他返校。当班级到达泳池时，他们缓缓坐在附近的座位上，等待老师的指示。老师环顾四周，仿佛在寻找什么，然后向全班讲话。

"It seems I have forgotten something. I'm sorry class but we can't begin just yet, I need to go back to the classroom. I won't be long so please wait here till I get back" the teacher announced before walking off.  
“看来我忘了带东西。很抱歉，同学们，我们还不能开始，我需要回教室一趟。不会太久的，请在这里等我回来。”老师宣布后便离开了。

As soon as the teacher left, everyone started talking to each other; a few people stood up and started playing around. Shinji himself stood up as he wanted to stretch a little and looked around for his friends, he hadn't seen them at all since entering school; perhaps they were just in late today? Shinji walked nearby the poolside, contemplating the upcoming lesson. He stopped momentarily to peer at the clear water, wondering if he could somehow get out of doing the lesson as he still didn't know how to swim; he didn't really want the annoyance and humiliation.  
老师一离开，大家就开始互相交谈；几个人站起来开始嬉戏。真嗣自己也站了起来，想稍微伸展一下，四处寻找他的朋友，自从进入学校以来他还没见过他们；也许他们今天只是迟到了？真嗣走到泳池边，思考着即将到来的课程。他停了一会儿，凝视着清澈的水面，想知道是否能设法逃过这节课，因为他仍然不会游泳；他真的不想经历这种烦恼和羞辱。

"Stop that you idiots!" shouted a few girls, causing Shinji to turn around, curious as to what the commotion was about.  
“别闹了，你们这些白痴！”几个女孩喊道，这让真嗣转过身来，好奇是什么事情引起了骚动。

Unfortunately, it was a little too late as a few boys were running straight towards him and Shinji didn't have enough time to react. The male eva pilot was sent reeling into the deep end of the pool from the momentum of them running into him. The boys stopped short of the edge of the pool, they had just been fooling around and didn't realise that Shinji was so close to the edge of the pool.  
不幸的是，这一切发生得太晚了，几个男孩正直冲向他，真嗣没有足够的时间反应。男性 eva 驾驶员被他们冲撞的势头带进了泳池的深水区。男孩们在泳池边缘停了下来，他们只是闹着玩，并没有意识到真嗣离泳池边缘这么近。

Asuka looked up after hearing the splash and realised Shinji had been the one pushed in. The girl soon remembered he couldn't swim and ran over to the pool to see if he was alright.  
听到水花声，明日香抬头一看，意识到是真嗣被推进了水里。她很快想起他不会游泳，便跑向泳池，看看他是否安然无恙。

"Help!" Shinji called out, feebly trying to stay afloat, struggling not to choke on the water.  
“救命！”真嗣呼喊着，无力地试图保持漂浮，挣扎着不让自己被水呛到。

"Get him out! He's gonna drown you idiots!" she shouted, seeing him beginning to drown.  
“把他拉出来！他要淹死了，你们这些白痴！”她喊道，看到他开始溺水。

"Why do you care about what happens to Ikari?" one of them asked, confused, "We were just playing around anyway, he's just faking it" he finished.  
"你为什么在乎碇的事？" 其中一人困惑地问，"我们只是在玩闹而已，他只是在装样子" 他最后说道。

"No! He can't swim!" she retorted.  
"不！他不会游泳！" 她反驳道。

"As if, everyone here knows how to swim" he replied dismissively, walking off.  
"好像吧，这里每个人都知道怎么游泳" 他不屑地回答，走开了。

The female eva pilot began to panic, she didn't have time to argue and convince them that he was actually drowning. With both of them in their school uniforms it would be quite difficult to pull Shinji up with all the extra weight, what could she do? _'Fuck! There's no other choice'_ she thought, realising what she had to do. In front of everyone, she quickly stripped off her clothes, leaving her clad in only her bra and panties before diving into the water. The redhead hastily made her way to the bottom where Shinji was and pulled him up to the surface. Breaking the surface of the water, she quickly moved the unconscious Shinji towards the edge of the pool, worried about his state. _'Come on Shinji, don't do this to me!'_ she thought.  
女式 EVA 驾驶员开始慌了，她没有时间争论和说服他们他实际上正在溺水。两人都穿着校服，要拖着额外的重量把真嗣拉上来相当困难，她能怎么办？'该死！别无选择了'她想，意识到自己必须做什么。在众目睽睽之下，她迅速脱掉衣服，只穿着胸罩和内裤就跳入水中。红发女孩匆忙游向水底，找到真嗣并把他拉上水面。冲出水面后，她迅速将昏迷的真嗣推向泳池边缘，担心他的状况。'加油啊，真嗣，别这样对我！'她心想。

"Pull him out!" she yelled.  
“把他拉出来！”她喊道。

This time, the boys were shaken up as it looked like Shinji was in trouble and they promptly pulled out the unconscious lad.  
这次，男孩们被吓到了，因为看起来真嗣有麻烦，他们迅速把昏迷的少年拉了出来。

Asuka launched herself out of the pool and quickly moved over to Shinji, leaning in to check on his breathing, water dripping off her.  
明日香从泳池中一跃而出，迅速移动到真嗣身边，俯身检查他的呼吸，水珠从她身上滴落。

"Shit, he ain't breathing, fuck!" she shouted. _'Everyone here is fucking useless!'_ she thought to herself.  
“该死，他没呼吸了，操！”她大喊道。‘这里的每个人都他妈的没用！’她心中暗想。

Asuka checked his pulse glad that it was still there strong, there was only one course of action left. _'I'm way past humiliated right now, I gotta do this!'_ she thought as started to do CPR. After the chest compressions, she gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as everyone watched on transfixed. The whole class was shocked by the events and simply stared in bewilderment, not one of them ever thinking to help. _'Come on Shinji, don't leave me'_ Asuka thought desperately as she continued repeating the CPR. Finally, after a few painstaking minutes Shinji gagged and coughed out water, beginning to breathe again. Asuka couldn't stop herself hugging him in relief.  
明日香检查了他的脉搏，庆幸它依然强劲有力，只剩下一个行动方案。‘我现在已经顾不上丢脸了，我得这么做！’她想着，开始进行心肺复苏。在胸外按压后，她进行了口对口人工呼吸，所有人都目不转睛地看着。全班同学都被这一幕震惊了，只是茫然地盯着，没有一个人想到要帮忙。‘加油，真嗣，别离开我’明日香急切地想着，继续重复着心肺复苏。终于，在几分钟后，真嗣呛咳着吐出水来，开始重新呼吸。明日香忍不住紧紧抱住他，松了一口气。

"Thank goodness, I thought you were going to die!" Asuka said, struggling to keep her calm.  
"谢天谢地，我还以为你要死了！" 明日香说道，努力保持镇定。

The male eva pilot opened his eyes as he regained his consciousness and looked up at the girl, remembering where they were and being very confused at her current state of attire. Asuka was only wearing her bra and panties which were soaked, making them almost see-through. Her nipples were poking out due to the cold water, the sight almost caused a nosebleed. Shinji was also confused as to why the redhead looked so distressed and looked around seeing his classmates all staring at them, many of the boys with lewd looks.  
男性 eva 驾驶员恢复意识，睁开眼睛，抬头看着女孩，回忆起他们所在的地方，并对她目前的着装状态感到非常困惑。明日香只穿着她的胸罩和内裤，这些衣物都被水浸透了，几乎变得透明。由于冷水的作用，她的乳头清晰可见，这一幕差点让真嗣流鼻血。真嗣也困惑于为什么红发女孩看起来如此焦虑，环顾四周，发现他的同学们都在盯着他们，许多男生带着猥琐的表情。

"Why are you wearing almost nothing, Asuka?" Shinji questioned her as the first thing that came to mind; his brain not functioning properly yet.  
"你怎么几乎没穿衣服，明日香？" 真嗣首先想到的问题脱口而出；他的大脑还没有完全恢复正常。

The redhead's worry was overwritten with embarrassment and she blushed, suddenly becoming self-conscious.  
红发女孩的担忧被尴尬所取代，她脸红了，突然变得自我意识过强。

"What the hell are you all staring at you perverts?" Asuka shouted at everyone, attempting to cover herself with her hands. The girl couldn't help but feel the eyes of every boy staring at her, many had nosebleeds.  
“你们这群变态到底在看什么？”明日香对着所有人喊道，试图用手遮住自己。女孩忍不住感觉到每个男孩的目光都集中在她身上，许多人甚至流了鼻血。

"I did it to save you, I wouldn't have been able to pick you up with that extra weight on" she explained as she turned to face Shinji. "Stop staring at me already! I just saved his life and this is the respect I get?" she shouted at everyone again.  
“我这么做是为了救你，要不是那额外的重量，我本来可以把你抱起来的。”她解释着转向真嗣。“别再盯着我看了！我刚救了他的命，这就是我得到的尊重吗？”她再次对着所有人喊道。

Now that Shinji was ok, Asuka's anger overtook everything and she put him down, picking up the uniform she had stripped off. She then grabbed her swimming gear and stormed off, letting out a string of German curses, letting everyone know she was pissed off.  
既然碇真嗣没事了，明日香怒火中烧，将他放下，捡起自己脱下的制服。随后她抓起游泳装备，怒气冲冲地离开，嘴里不断冒出德语咒骂，让所有人都知道她非常生气。

As Shinji had come to his senses, he quickly got up wanting to chase after the redhead. Before he went off, one of the boys that pushed him in came up to him, "Sorry bout that man, didn't know you couldn't swim" he said, truly apologetic.  
碇真嗣回过神来，迅速起身想要追上红发少女。在他离开之前，其中一个把他推进水里的男孩走上前来，"抱歉啊，兄弟，我不知道你不会游泳"，他真诚地道歉。

"Don't worry about me, what you did to Asuka was horrible!" Shinji retorted.  
“别担心我，你对明日香做的事太糟糕了！”碇真嗣反驳道。

"What do you mean? Doesn't she insult you every day? You don't think she deserves it?" he replied, confused at Shinji's response.  
"你什么意思？她不是每天都侮辱你吗？你不觉得她活该吗？" 他回答道，对真嗣的反应感到困惑。

"No, she doesn't deserve it. She just saved my life despite her personal dignity! Would you do anything like that?!" he asked nastily.  
"不，她不该受这种待遇。尽管牺牲了个人尊严，她还是救了我的命！你会那样做吗？！" 他恶狠狠地问道。

The boy and the class were speechless; never had they heard Shinji defending Asuka of all people. Hikari had begun to go after her friend, worried about her state of mind, before Shinji rushed up to her and put a hand on her shoulder.  
男孩和全班都哑口无言；他们从未听过真嗣为明日香辩护，尤其是她。光子开始追上她的朋友，担心她的心理状态，但真嗣冲上前去，把手放在她的肩膀上。

"I'll go after her, don't worry Hikari" Shinji reassured.  
"我会去找她的，别担心，光" 真嗣安慰道。

"Oh Shinji, I wanted to ask how you've been all this time away from school… but first I want to make sure Asuka's ok…" she replied.  
"哦，真嗣，我想问问你这段时间没来学校过得怎么样…但首先我想确认明日香没事…" 她回答道。

"Don't worry, I'm not offended! It wasn't that interesting anyway, we can talk about it at lunch, hopefully Touji and Kensuke are here then too" he started. "About Asuka though… trust me Hikari, it's better if I go, you should probably stay with the class for when the teacher returns" he said resolutely.  
"别担心，我没生气！反正也没什么有趣的，我们可以午饭时再聊，希望到时候东治和健介也在" 他开始说道。"至于明日香…相信我，光，还是我去比较好，你最好留在班上等老师回来" 他坚定地说。

"Alright… please make sure she's ok" Hikari entreated.  
"好吧……请确保她没事" 光请求道。

"I will" Shinji replied. With that, he went off after her while the whole class began discussing the incident.  
"我会的" 真嗣回答。说完，他便追了上去，而全班同学开始讨论这起事件。

"Can you believe she actually did mouth-to-mouth with him?"  
"你能相信她真的对他做了人工呼吸吗？"

"She stripped just to save the boy she belittles every day"  
"她脱光衣服只是为了救那个她每天都在贬低的男孩"

"She's just a skank wanting to show off her body to everyone"  
"她不过是个想向所有人炫耀身体的荡妇"

"Does this prove Asuka isn't really a bitch?"  
"这是否证明了明日香其实并不是个婊子？"

"I can't believe every boy was looking at her, those perverts"  
"真不敢相信每个男生都在看她，这些色狼。"

---

Shinji was rushing towards the changing rooms as he saw Asuka go in that direction. The boy finally caught sight of the redhead and called out to her.  
真嗣急忙朝更衣室跑去，因为他看到明日香往那个方向去了。男孩终于看到了红发女孩，并朝她喊道。

"Asuka! Wait up!" "明日香！等等我！"

The redhead slowed down at his voice but continued walking towards the female changing rooms, remaining silent.  
红发少年在他的声音中放慢了脚步，但仍继续向女更衣室走去，保持沉默。

"Asuka, thank you for doing that to save my life" he said gratefully as he caught up to her.  
“明日香，谢谢你救了我一命。”他感激地说着，追上了她。

At this, the girl stopped, dropped what she was carrying and turned around to face him, her face full of anger. Shinji looked at her unsteadily, a remnant of the temporary lack of oxygen to the brain.  
听到这话，女孩停了下来，丢下手中的东西，转过身面对他，脸上满是愤怒。真嗣看着她，眼神有些不稳，脑部暂时缺氧的后遗症还在。

"Don't treat it so casually, you could have died! I wouldn't have pulled such a crazy stunt otherwise. And what do I get for it? A couple of boys gawking me" she spat furiously.  
"别这么轻描淡写，你差点就死了！不然我也不会冒这么大的险。而我得到了什么？几个男孩盯着我看。" 她愤怒地吐露道。

"I'm not intending to trivialise it at all! I sincerely appreciate what you did… I understand what it must have been like" he responded.  
"我绝没有轻视的意思！我真心感激你所做的一切……我理解那一定很不容易" 他回应道。

"No you don't, you-" she started.  
"不，你不理解，你——" 她开口道。

"Yes I do" he interrupted, "Don't forget I was watching you being attacked by that last angel powerless to do anything, nothing tore me apart more" he finished, his voice cracking a little; just recalling that helplessness while she was suffering was terrifying.  
“是的，我确实记得，”他打断道，“别忘了我当时眼睁睁看着你被最后一个天使攻击，却无能为力，那种无力感撕裂了我的心。”他声音有些哽咽，仅仅回想起她在受苦时的那种无助，就让他感到恐惧。

"How can you be so calm? I could have lost you!" she shouted at him. "I don't know what I would have done if I couldn't have saved you" she said hoarsely.  
“你怎么能这么冷静？我差点就失去你了！”她对他大喊。“如果我救不了你，我不知道我会做出什么，”她沙哑地说。

Shinji moved over to her and pulled her into a warm embrace. "It's alright, it's alright… I'm here" he comforted.  
真嗣走到她身边，将她拥入温暖的怀抱。“没事了，没事了……我在这里，”他安慰道。

He could feel the redhead take a deep breath as she calmed herself down. The boy then kissed her softly, causing the redhead to wrap her arms around him and pull him closer. Shinji found the feeling of her wet body rubbing against him and her soft breasts pressed up against him to be quite arousing. Giving into temptation, he reached down to grope her ass, causing the girl to pull away from him.  
他能感觉到红发女孩深呼吸以平复情绪。男孩随即温柔地吻了她，红发女孩便伸出双臂环抱住他，将他拉近。真嗣感受到她湿润的身体摩擦着自己，柔软的胸部紧贴着他，这让他颇为兴奋。禁不住诱惑，他伸手去摸她的臀部，女孩随即从他身边挣脱。

"Jeez you hentai baka! I guess you must be fine if you're already trying to cop a feel. Just how much sex did I give you yesterday you pig?" she snapped at him.  
“天哪，你这个色情笨蛋！看来你恢复得不错，已经开始动手动脚了。昨天我到底给了你多少次，你这个色狼？”她厉声对他说。

The boy couldn't help grinning sheepishly, but he was also glad that her mood was back to normal. "You're practically naked… and well… sexy" he explained, before moving one hand to her breast and playfully stimulating her nipple.  
男孩不禁尴尬地笑了笑，但也庆幸她的情绪恢复了正常。“你几乎一丝不挂……而且……很性感。”他解释道，随后一只手移向她的胸部，调皮地刺激她的乳头。

The girl sighed before smacking his hand away and picking up her stuff. "Anyway, I'd best get changed. It'd be weird if someone caught us talking like this, especially with you kissing and touching me" she said, flicking her hair back before walking towards the female changing room.  
女孩叹了口气，拍开他的手，拿起自己的东西。“总之，我最好去换衣服。要是有人看到我们这样说话，尤其是你还亲我摸我的，那就太奇怪了。”她说着，甩了甩头发，朝女更衣室走去。

"Alright, I'll head back then! Love you!" he called out.  
“好吧，那我回去了！爱你！”他大声喊道。

The redhead just raised one arm up and waved to him before entering into the changing room. Shinji then turned around and headed back to the class. On his way there, he saw the female classmates coming his way. As they were passing by him, Hikari stopped him.  
红发女孩只是举起一只手向他挥了挥，然后走进了更衣室。真嗣转过身，朝教室走去。在路上，他看到女同学们迎面走来。当她们经过他时，光子停下了脚步。

"Is Asuka ok?" the class rep asked.  
"明日香还好吗？" 班长问道。

"Yeah! She's in a better mood now. Right now she's in the changing room, so you can go talk to her" he explained.  
"嗯！她现在心情好多了。她现在在更衣室，所以你可以去找她聊聊" 他解释道。

"Alright, thanks Shinji!" she replied, smiling warmly before walking off.  
"好的，谢谢你，真嗣！" 她微笑着回答，然后走开了。

The boy continued on and made it back to the pool and picked up his swimming gear. He noticed that everyone already had their swimming costumes on; the boys must have gone to their changing room first. Shinji could see the teacher was busy talking to some of his classmates, probably asking about the incident that just happened. He quickly went over to the male changing room and changed into his swimming gear. After finishing, he exited and came back, just as the girls were returning to the pool; he could see Asuka and Hikari walking together chatting.  
男孩继续前行，回到了游泳池边，拿起他的游泳装备。他注意到大家都已经换好了泳装；男孩们肯定是先去了更衣室。真嗣可以看到老师正忙着和一些同学交谈，可能是在询问刚刚发生的事故。他迅速走向男更衣室，换上了自己的游泳装备。结束后，他走出更衣室回到泳池边，正好看到女孩们也回来了；他能看到明日香和光一起边走边聊。

The teacher noticed Shinji coming back and motioned for him to come over. "Students, sit down" the teacher announced. "Mr. Ikari and Miss Sohryu, please come here" he requested.  
老师注意到真嗣回来，示意他过去。“同学们，坐下。”老师宣布道，“碇同学和惣流同学，请过来一下。”他请求道。

The two eva pilots came up to the teacher, looking at him expectantly.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员走到老师面前，期待地看着他。

"Now Mr. Ikari, I heard there was an incident while I was gone. Do you mind explaining to me what happened from your point of view?" the older man asked.  
"伊卡里先生，我听说我不在的时候发生了一起事件。您介意从您的角度向我解释一下发生了什么吗？" 那位年长的男士问道。

"Not at all sir. I was over by the pool when a few boys knocked me into the deep end" he started.  
"一点也不，先生。我那时在泳池边，几个男孩把我撞进了深水区" 他开始说道。

"Who knocked you Ikari?" the teacher asked.  
"是谁撞了你，伊卡里？" 老师问道。

"I believe it was Sengoku, Nagumo and Ichihara" Shinji answered, pointing to the group of boys.  
"我相信是仙石、长门和市原他们" 真嗣回答道，指向那群男孩。

"What happened next?" the teacher prompted.  
"接下来发生了什么？" 老师追问道。

"I umm… I can't swim so I began to drown… after that I blacked out and I don't know for sure what happened" Shinji finished.  
"我呃…我不会游泳，所以开始溺水…之后我就昏过去了，确切发生了什么我也不清楚" 真嗣说完。

"Miss Sohryu, can you explain the course of events after he began drowning?" the teacher asked Asuka.  
“碇君开始溺水后，你能解释一下事件的经过吗？”老师问明日香。

"I tried to get the guys to pull him out but they thought he was pretending so I jumped into the pool to save him" she answered.  
“我试图让那些家伙把他拉出来，但他们以为他在假装，所以我跳进泳池去救他。”她回答道。

"She took off her school uniform before diving in! And also gave him CPR as soon as he was out of the water" a random student called out.  
“她脱掉校服才跳进去的！而且一把他救上岸就立刻给他做了心肺复苏。”一个旁观的学生喊道。

"You took off your uniform?" the teacher asked, confused.  
"你脱掉了制服？" 老师疑惑地问。

Asuka couldn't help blushing before replying, "Yes sir… he would've been too heavy to pull up with my uniform dragging me down as well"  
明日香忍不住脸红，回答道："是的，先生……如果穿着制服，我也会被拖累，那样就太重了，拉不上来。"

"You did well miss Sohryu, thank you for your efforts. Your quick thinking saved this young man's life, even at the expense of your own personal embarrassment" the older man thanked, to which Asuka nodded. "As for Sengoku, Nagumo and Ichihara, you boys have a detention for three weeks, your behaviour was irresponsible" he announced, turning to face those boys.  
"你做得很好，碇小姐，谢谢你的努力。你的机智救了这个年轻人的命，尽管牺牲了你个人的尴尬。" 年长者感谢道，明日香点头回应。"至于仙石、永野和市原，你们三个要关三周禁闭，你们的行为太不负责任了。" 他转向那些男孩宣布道。

At the announcement, the three boys looked at him in disbelief. The teacher turned back to face Shinji. "Mr. Ikari, I'll understand if you wish to skip this swimming lesson" he offered.  
听到这个通知，三个男孩难以置信地看着他。老师转过身来面对真嗣。“碇同学，如果你希望跳过这节游泳课，我会理解的。”他提议道。

"Thank you sensei, I will stay out of the water this lesson" Shinji replied.  
“谢谢老师，这节课我会待在水外。”真嗣回答。

"Perfectly understandable, and miss Sohryu I'll speak with the principal later to make sure your efforts are recognised" the teacher declared.  
“完全可以理解，还有，明日香同学，我稍后会和校长谈谈，确保你的努力得到认可。”老师宣布道。

"Thank you sensei" Asuka replied.  
“谢谢老师。”明日香回答道。

"Alright class, let's begin the swimming lesson" the teacher announced.  
“好了，同学们，我们开始上游泳课吧。”老师宣布道。

The kids were split up into several groups so that the kids could alternate between stretches and getting into the water. The teacher began instructing each group, teaching them the proper forms of swimming. Like this, the groups rotated turns in the water while Shinji sat back on the grass resting a little, taking particular interest in watching Asuka. The male eva pilot loved how she'd fling her hair back when she rose out of the water. The redhead caught him watching her a few times and gave him a quick smile.  
孩子们被分成了几个小组，以便他们可以在拉伸和下水之间轮换。老师开始指导每个小组，教他们正确的游泳姿势。就这样，小组们在水中轮流练习，而真嗣则坐在草地上稍作休息，特别留意观察着明日香。这位男性 EVA 驾驶员喜欢她从水中起身时甩动头发的样子。红发女孩几次发现他在看她，便给了他一个快速的微笑。

It wasn't long till the swimming lesson was over and all the kids went back to their changing rooms and dried themselves before dressing back into their school uniforms. No sooner had everyone finished up then the school bell had rung. Most of the class rushed off, joining up in their usual groups before moving off to their lunch spots. Several boys came up to Asuka apologising for not helping out and staring at her like perverts, additionally congratulating her on the rescue. This was not unnoticed by the girls in the class, several of them jealous of the attention the redhead was getting, even from the boys who had girlfriends. Asuka quickly thanked all the boys, just wanting to have lunch; not that she didn't enjoy the attention, but she could also feel the eyes of her female classmates.  
不久，游泳课结束了，所有孩子回到更衣室，擦干身体，换回校服。大家刚收拾好，学校的铃声就响了。大多数同学急忙离开，按照惯例组成小组，前往各自的午餐地点。有几个男孩走到明日香面前，为没有帮忙和像变态一样盯着她看而道歉，同时也祝贺她成功救人。这让班上的女生们注意到了，其中几个对红发女孩受到的关注感到嫉妒，甚至包括那些有男朋友的男生。明日香迅速感谢了所有男孩，只想去吃午饭；她并非不喜欢这种关注，但也感受到了女同学们的目光。

Shinji himself had already gone ahead, letting Asuka have her moment of glory, besides he wanted to see if his friends had arrived. He soon spotted Touji and Kensuke coming out of the school building and he moved towards them. As he came closer, the two boys jumped in shock and ran over, realising that Shinji was at school.  
真嗣自己已经先走一步，让明日香享受她的荣耀时刻，此外他也想看看朋友们是否到了。他很快看到东治和健介从教学楼出来，便朝他们走去。当他走近时，两个男孩吓了一跳，跑过来，意识到真嗣来学校了。

"Shinji my man! How are ya doing?" Touji yelled, smacking the boy on the shoulder.  
"真嗣，我的好兄弟！最近怎么样？" 冬二大声喊道，拍了拍男孩的肩膀。

"Good to see you Shinji! It's been a while since you've been at school!" Kensuke told him excitedly.  
"真嗣，见到你真好！你有一阵子没来学校了！" 剑介兴奋地对他说。

"Hey guys, I'm doing pretty well, all things considered" he said, scratching his head, "I'm super happy to see you two though, man I kinda missed school too"  
"嘿，伙计们，考虑到所有情况，我过得还不错。" 他说着，挠了挠头，"不过见到你们我真的很开心，我也挺想念学校的。"

"We heard the details from the demon that you were imprisoned, and for some reason not allowed any visitors dammit" Touji started.  
"我们从那个恶魔那里听说了你被囚禁的细节，而且不知为何不允许任何探访，该死" 冬二开口说道。

"Yeah, are you ok Shinji? You didn't tell us you were coming to school today" Kensuke asked with concern.  
"是啊，真嗣你还好吗？你没告诉我们今天要来学校" 健介关切地问道。

"Yeah, I wanted it to be a surprise! I'm good now though, thanks for asking. I'm not gonna lie and say being in the cell alone was fun, but sometimes you just gotta take it on the chin" he answered.  
"嗯，我想给大家一个惊喜！不过我现在很好，谢谢关心。我不会撒谎说独自待在牢房里很有趣，但有时候你只能硬着头皮接受" 他回答道。

"Also, I heard some kids talking about an incident at the pool involving you, and Asuka too I think. Neither of us were at school this morning" Kensuke mentioned.  
"对了，我听一些孩子说游泳池发生了一件事，好像和你还有明日香有关。今天早上我们俩都没去学校。" 真嗣提道。

"Yeah, there was… I'll tell you in a sec, but where were you two this morning actually?" Shinji asked.  
"是的，确实有……我一会儿告诉你，不过你们俩今天早上到底去哪儿了？" 真嗣问道。

"Well, me and Touji had gone camping for the weekend and Monday. We came back this morning, so we were late to school. Since we were just missing the sports session our parents weren't too concerned, otherwise we would've probably had to come back yesterday" Kensuke explained.  
"嗯，我和阿薰周末和周一去露营了。我们今早才回来，所以迟到了。因为我们只是错过了体育课，父母倒不是很担心，不然我们可能昨天就得回来了。" 真嗣解释道。

"Man, it was so great though" Touji exclaimed, putting his arm on Shinji's shoulder, "Really wish you had been there Shin-man, if we had known you'd be back today we could have pushed the trip forward for next weekend"  
"伙计，真的很棒啊" 冬二大声说道，手臂搭在真嗣的肩上，"真希望你当时也在，真嗣，要是早知道你今天回来，我们本可以把下周的旅行提前的"

"Don't worry, don't worry! We'll have plenty of chances to do those sorts of things again" Shinji replied.  
"别担心，别担心！我们以后还有很多机会做这些事的" 真嗣回答道。

"Oi baka, are you alright?" a voice yelled out, causing the three boys to turn towards the source of the voice. "Those two idiots aren't tiring you out with clowning about?" Asuka asked, smirking.  
"喂，笨蛋，你还好吗？" 一个声音喊道，让三个男孩转向声音的来源。"那两个白痴没把你累坏吧？" 明日香问道，脸上带着一丝讥笑。

The trio could see Asuka and Hikari walking towards them.  
三人组可以看到明日香和光正朝他们走来。

"It's none of your business demon! We're just getting all caught up since he's been gone so long!" Touji retorted.  
"这关你什么事，恶魔！我们只是因为他离开太久，有很多话要说！" 真嗣反驳道。

"How are you Shinji?" Hikari interjected before Asuka could say anything back. "I wanted to ask you earlier as you know"  
"你还好吗，真嗣？" 光插话道，没等明日香回嘴。"我之前就想问你了，你知道的"

"I'm doing well now thanks Hikari, both after my time in prison and after the drowning incident" he answered.  
"我现在很好，谢谢你，光。无论是从监狱出来后，还是溺水事件之后。" 他回答道。

"Drowning incident?!" both Touji and Kensuke exclaimed.  
"溺水事件？！" 东治和真希都惊呼起来。

"Yeah well… I was knocked into the deep end of the pool and… Asuka saved me from drowning" Shinji explained.  
"是啊，嗯……我被撞进了泳池的深水区，然后……明日香救了我，让我免于溺水。" 真嗣解释道。

"Don't forget stripping and giving you CPR! Asuka was very brave!" Hikari added.  
"别忘了脱掉衣服给你做 CPR！明日香当时非常勇敢！" 光补充道。

"Ssshh Hikari, you didn't have to give all that detail!" Asuka snapped, blushing a little.  
"嘘，光，你没必要说那么多细节！" 明日香有些脸红地反驳道。

"Waaahh? You did that?! For _Shinji_?" Touji said, surprised.  
"哇？你真的那么做了？！为了真嗣？" 冬二惊讶地说。

"While I may have my dislikes about the third child" Asuka started, "I was the only one able to save him. I couldn't just let my fellow pilot die"  
"虽然我对三号机有些不满" 明日香开口道，"但我是唯一能救他的人。我不能眼睁睁看着我的同僚飞行员死去"

"Well, if ya really did all that… I suppose ya deserve our gratitude" Touji said, reluctantly holding out his hand to shake hers.  
"好吧，如果你真的做了那么多…我想你值得我们感谢" 真嗣说，不情愿地伸出手与她握手。

"Thanks for saving him Asuka" Kensuke said, also holding out his hand.  
"谢谢你救了他，明日香" 健介也伸出手。

"Not every day I see the dumb jock show his appreciation for my existence" Asuka replied smirking, shaking Touji's hand before shaking Kensuke's.  
“不是每天都能看到那个笨蛋运动员展示他对我的存在的感激。”明日香带着一丝嘲讽回答，先摇了摇冬二的手，然后是真嗣的。

"Asuka!" Hikari snapped. “明日香！”光愤怒地说。

"I'll let this go just for today ya bad-tempered girl" Touji responded with a fake smile.  
“今天就放过你吧，你这个坏脾气的女孩。”冬二带着假笑回应道。

"You're definitely ok Shinji?" Hikari asked, ignoring the other two's antics.  
"你真的没事吗，真嗣？" 光不理会另外两人的胡闹，问道。

"Yeah yeah, Asuka acted pretty quick thankfully" he replied.  
"是啊是啊，幸好明日香反应很快" 他回答道。

"And your time in prison…? I think it's silly the Commander put you there" Hikari continued.  
"还有你在监狱里的时间……？我觉得司令把你关进去真是太荒唐了" 光继续说道。

"Damn straight, that Commander is an asshole! You're fighting dem angels all the time, he could cut you some slack" Touji added aggressively.  
“说得太对了，那个指挥官就是个混蛋！你一直在和那些天使战斗，他至少该给你点宽松。” 冬二咄咄逼人地补充道。

"Well, the time in prison was a difficult experience I'll admit, but it did give me some time to think about a lot of things" Shinji explained. "In any case, I'm glad you guys are on my side but I did deserve to go to prison. There's no need to be angry for my sake" he finished.  
“好吧，监狱里的时光确实是一段艰难的经历，我承认，但它也给了我时间去思考很多事情。” 真嗣解释道，“无论如何，我很高兴你们站在我这边，但我确实应该进监狱。没必要为我生气。” 他结束了这段话。

"What! No matter what orders you disobeyed, it can't be worth that surely?!" Touji refuted.  
“什么！无论你违抗了什么命令，这肯定不值得吧？！” 冬二反驳道。

"Angel battles are a serious thing" Asuka interrupted. "Not following orders can lead to casualties or worse, the angel defeating us" she explained, helping Shinji with the lie.  
“天使之战可不是闹着玩的。”明日香打断道，“不服从命令可能导致伤亡，甚至是我们被天使击败。”她解释着，帮真嗣圆谎。

"Well… I suppose…" Touji said, relenting.  
“嗯……我想也是……” 冬二说着，态度软化下来。

"I'm with you Touji, but I guess NERV has to follow protocol and discipline its staff accordingly" Kensuke added.  
“我支持你，冬二，但我想 NERV 必须遵守程序，并相应地对员工进行纪律约束。” 健介补充道。

"Who cares about all that now anyway, it's behind me. I'm really happy about your concern, but it's ok. I'm back to school, nothing really interesting to note about my time there – dark empty room – but right now I'm hungry, let's go sit down and eat!" Shinji told them all.  
“反正现在谁还在乎那些，都过去了。我很感激你的关心，不过没事的。我回到学校了，那里没什么特别值得一提的——黑漆漆的空房间——但现在我饿了，我们坐下来吃点东西吧！”真嗣对他们说。

"Great idea, I'm starving!" Touji exclaimed.  
“好主意，我快饿死了！” 东治兴奋地喊道。

The five of them all walked together, chatting excitedly, before sitting down in the shade of a tree to eat. They all took out their lunches and began to eat their food.  
他们五个人一起走着，兴奋地聊着天，然后在树荫下坐下来吃饭。大家都拿出自己的午餐，开始享用食物。

"Oh, I almost forgot. We're continuing the play today" Hikari announced.  
"哦，我差点忘了。我们今天继续排练那出戏" 光宣布道。

"Oh yeah, cause Shinji's back" Touji replied.  
"哦对，因为真嗣回来了" 冬二回答道。

"I must admit I was kinda grateful for the break" Asuka started, "I haven't yet read the whole play, I wonder how the story goes"  
"我得承认，我有点感激这个休息时间" 明日香开口道，"我还没读完整部剧本，不知道故事是怎么发展的"

"The costumes and props aren't too bad though actually, we got to work on those quite a deal since you were gone. If we're practising today, then we'll be using those as they're mostly ready" Kensuke added. "Did you get a chance to read over your lines Shinji?" he asked curiously.  
"服装和道具其实还不错，你不在的时候我们花了不少时间在这上面。如果今天排练的话，我们会用那些已经准备得差不多的东西。" 真希波补充道。"你有时间看你的台词吗，真嗣？" 他好奇地问。

"Yeah yeah, yesterday Asuka let me know" Shinji answered; when Misato had returned home yesterday, the redhead insisted he read over his lines in the play.  
"嗯嗯，昨天明日香提醒我了" 真嗣回答；昨天美里回到家时，红发女孩坚持让他复习剧本中的台词。

"You were back home yesterday?" Touji asked.  
"你昨天回家了？" 冬二问。

"Yeah, I didn't go to school. This is my first day back today" Shinji explained, recalling that his friends hadn't been at school yesterday. "I was readjusting to home life"  
"是啊，我没去上学。今天是我第一天回来" 真嗣解释道，回想起他的朋友们昨天都没去学校。"我在重新适应家庭生活"

"Actually, you were also home yesterday Asuka" Hikari piped up.  
"实际上，昨天你也在家，明日香" 光插话道。

"Suspicious" Kensuke joked.  
"可疑哦" 健介开玩笑说。

"Hah, probably just being a slave-driver and forcing him to do all the house chores" Touji remarked.  
"哈，可能只是在当个奴隶主，逼他做所有的家务活。" 东治评论道。

"Shinji begged me to stay home with him you idiots!" Asuka lied; Touji's joke was far closer to the real truth.  
"真嗣求我留在家里陪他，你们这些傻瓜！" 明日香撒谎道；东治的玩笑其实更接近真相。

"Ah, she was staying to help him" Hikari said, smiling.  
"啊，她留下来是为了帮他忙。" 光笑着说。

"No! Well… I couldn't just leave him alone on his first full day back" Asuka conceded.  
“不！呃……我总不能让他第一天完全回来就一个人待着吧。”明日香让步道。

"Shinji, why don't you tell us what went down?" Touji asked, grinning.  
“真嗣，给我们讲讲发生了什么？” 冬二笑着问道。

"Asuka was my maid for the day" Shinji said with a blank face. Kensuke and Touji couldn't help sniggering.  
“明日香今天当我的女仆。”真嗣面无表情地说。剑介和冬二忍不住窃笑起来。

"Did she wear the outfit too? 'Welcome back Master!'" Touji joked, imitating a girl's voice.  
"她也穿那套衣服了吗？'欢迎回来，主人！'" 冬二开玩笑地模仿着女生的声音。

"Shut up morons! Obviously I did no such thing. _He_ did the house chores!" she retorted in outrage.  
"闭嘴，蠢货们！我当然没做那种事。他负责做家务！" 她愤怒地反驳道。

"So I _was_ right!" Touji declared.  
"那我就说对了！" 冬二宣布道。

"Urgh" Asuka let out, realising her mistake.  
“呃” 明日香意识到自己的错误，不禁发出声来。

"Asuka did help me prepare for school though" Shinji added, defending her.  
“不过明日香确实帮我准备上学的事” 真嗣补充道，为她辩护。

"The least she could've done" Touji commented, "You shoulda let him feel your boobs"  
“她至少可以做点什么” 冬二评论道，“你应该让他感受一下你的胸部”

"Touji!" Hikari shouted, "How could you even think such a thing?"  
"托基！" 光大声喊道，"你怎么会有这种想法？"

"His perverted stupidity has got the better of him, that isn't exactly an exchange two _normal_ people would do now is it?" Asuka remarked incredulously; although ironically, she _had_ let Shinji do that _and_ more.  
"他的变态愚蠢占了上风，这可不是两个正常人会做的交换，对吧？" 明日香难以置信地说道；虽然讽刺的是，她自己也让真嗣做了更多。

"It's not like she'll ever get touched, might as well give a reward to this poor boy" Touji refuted, causing Kensuke to laugh.  
"她又不会真的被碰到，不如给这个可怜的男孩一点奖励" 托基反驳道，让剑介笑了起来。

"Excuse me a moment" Hikari said, an angry vein pulsing on her forehead, before pulling Touji away by the ear, kicking and screaming.  
“请稍等一下。”光说，额头上愤怒的青筋跳动，然后拽着冬二的耳朵把他拉走，冬二一边踢打一边尖叫。

Both Shinji and Kensuke felt a little pity for him, but he had gone too far.  
真嗣和健介都对他感到一丝同情，但他确实做得太过分了。

Waiting till they were out of earshot, Shinji turned to face Kensuke. "I wanted to tell you something Kensuke, now that those two are temporarily gone… the real reason I was in prison was because of… what I did to Asuka" he admitted. "Obviously I can't tell the other two that, but I felt like you should know since you know about what happened and our relationship"  
等到他们听不见声音后，真嗣转向健介。“健介，我有件事想告诉你，既然那两个人暂时离开了……我入狱的真正原因是因为……我对明日香做了什么。”他坦白道，“显然我不能告诉其他人，但我觉得你应该知道，因为你了解发生了什么以及我们的关系。”

"I see… thanks for letting me know, I'm surprised you'd get him in jail though Asuka" Kensuke replied.  
"我明白了…谢谢你告诉我，不过我真没想到你会让他进监狱，明日香。" 真嗣回答道。

"I didn't…" Asuka started, "I would've preferred he didn't go; it was Misato's orders. Actually, can we not talk about this topic?" she requested firmly.  
"我没有…" 明日香开口道，"我本希望他不去；这是美里小姐的命令。实际上，我们能不谈这个话题吗？" 她坚定地请求道。

"Of course, no problem" Kensuke answered. "So was Touji right about your reward too Shinji?" Kensuke joked.  
"当然，没问题。" 真嗣回答。"那么，东治关于你的奖励的说法也是真的吗，真嗣？" 真嗣开玩笑道。

Both Shinji and Asuka blushed, giving away the answer. Asuka opened and closed her mouth trying to think of some retort, but realised she had hesitated for too long and decided to just stay silent instead. Fortunately, at that moment the bell rang for the end of lunch, saving the two eva pilots. All the students started making their way to the stage room.  
真嗣和明日香都脸红了，答案不言而喻。明日香张了张嘴，试图想出一些反驳的话，但意识到自己犹豫得太久，决定干脆保持沉默。幸运的是，就在这时，午餐结束的铃声响起，救了两位 EVA 驾驶员。所有学生开始向舞台室走去。

"We best go! We have the play to practise" Asuka said breaking the silence, moving towards the stage room.  
“我们最好快点走！还要排练戏剧呢。”明日香打破沉默，向舞台室走去。

"Yes, let's go!" Shinji replied, going after her.  
“好的，走吧！”真嗣回应道，跟在她后面。

Kensuke decided it best not to say anything and just quietly made his way to the stage room as well.  
健介决定最好还是不要说什么，只是静静地走向舞台室。

After the students had all arrived at the stage room, the teacher showed them to the changing rooms. "Alright everyone, please go change into your costumes so we can begin practising the play" the teacher announced. "Furuhashi, Satozaki, hand out the costumes to everyone please"  
学生们都到达舞台室后，老师带他们去了更衣室。“好了，大家请去换上你们的服装，我们就可以开始排练戏剧了。”老师宣布道。“古桥，佐崎，请把服装分发给大家。”

With that, the class lined up to get their respective costumes as they were being distributed. As each student got their costume, they piled into the separate changing rooms to adorn their clothes. As the students waited for everyone to change, they read over their lines. Soon everyone was ready and the students all got into position for where they left off; after the knight had given his name.  
说完，班级排成一列领取各自的服装。每个学生拿到服装后，都涌入各自的更衣室换装。学生们一边等待大家换装，一边复习台词。很快，所有人都准备好了，学生们都站到了上次停下的位置；骑士报上名字之后的地方。

The princess was patiently waiting at the gate for her men to come, worried for their safety. The knight stood back, ready to defend the princess should someone hassle her.  
公主耐心地在城门口等待着她的士兵们归来，心中担忧着他们的安危。骑士站在一旁，随时准备保护公主，以防有人骚扰她。

"Why have my men not yet returned?" the princess said anxiously.  
“为何我的士兵们还未归来？”公主焦急地说道。

"Your Highness, fear not, considering the distance and the bandits that assailed them they should be arriving shortly" the knight reassured.  
“殿下，请勿担忧，考虑到路途遥远以及遭遇的匪徒，他们应该很快就会到达。”骑士安慰道。

No sooner had the knight spoken then did the princess spot her men and her carriage in the distance.  
骑士话音刚落，公主便在远处看到了她的随从和马车。

"They've arrived!" she exclaimed.  
“他们到了！”她惊呼道。

After her men made it to the gate, she went to go speak with them.  
随从们抵达城门后，她前去与他们会面。

"It is good to see you safe my Lady!" the captain said.  
"见到您平安无事，真是太好了，夫人！" 船长说道。

"Thank you captain, it is good to see you are also well. How many casualties?" she asked.  
"谢谢你，船长，看到你安然无恙我也很高兴。伤亡情况如何？" 她问道。

"Some reinforcements soon joined us after you were taken away and explained the situation. We would have chased after you otherwise, we only lost three men, I am grateful for whoever called those reinforcements" the captain explained.  
"您被带走后不久，一些援军就加入了我们，并向我们说明了情况。否则我们早就追上去了，只损失了三名士兵，我感激那位召唤援军的人。" 船长解释道。

"Any loss saddens me, but I'm glad it was only a few" the princess replied, "Captain, I would like to discuss a new plan for our journey and to have you meet the man who called the reinforcements" she said, motioning the knight to come forward.  
"任何损失都令我悲伤，但幸好只是少数。" 公主回答道，"队长，我想讨论一下我们旅程的新计划，并让你见见那位召唤援军的人。" 她示意骑士上前。

"I am Sir Jonathan, I am glad the reinforcements arrived swiftly" the knight said, bowing.  
"我是乔纳森爵士，很高兴援军能迅速赶到。" 骑士说，鞠了一躬。

"You also have our thanks for rescuing our Lady Sankt" the captain replied, also bowing. "My Lady, what is this new plan?"  
"我们也要感谢你救了我们的桑克特女士。" 队长回答，同样鞠躬。"女士，这个新计划是什么？"

"The knight has suggested that I travel with him to the castle, he knows the terrain and a lone horseman would bring less attention. I have taken a liking to the idea as I do not wish to risk any more of my men's lives" the princess explained.  
“骑士建议我与他一同前往城堡，他熟悉地形，且一名独行的骑手不会引起太多注意。我对此提议颇为中意，因为我不想再让我的士兵们冒险。”公主解释道。

"My Lady you are too kind, I will respect your decision however you choose, but surely traveling alone with a man you hardly know is also risky?" the captain remarked with concern.  
“殿下，您太过仁慈，无论您如何决定，我都会尊重，但与一个几乎不认识的男人单独旅行，难道不也是冒险吗？”上尉担忧地评论道。

"He is a knight of this kingdom and as such must keep to his code of chivalry, nothing of that sort will happen" she responded.  
“他是本国的骑士，必须遵守骑士精神，绝不会发生那种事。”她回答道。

"As you say my Lady, if you trust him then I agree with this plan. We will return to our kingdom when we hear of your safe arrival at the castle" the Captain agreed.  
"正如您所说，夫人，如果您信任他，那么我同意这个计划。当我们得知您安全抵达城堡的消息后，我们将返回我们的王国。" 队长同意道。

"Thank you Captain, I shall rest at this town for a bit before departing" she explained before turning to face the knight, "Sir Knight" she addressed.  
"谢谢你，队长，我将在镇上稍作休息，然后再出发。" 她解释道，随后转向骑士，"骑士先生" 她称呼道。

"Yes, your Highness?" the knight replied.  
"是的，殿下？" 骑士回答道。

"Do you have a place to stay?" she asked.  
"你有地方住吗？" 她问道。

"Ah well no, but do not worry I will keep watch at night" he answered.  
"啊，没有，但别担心，我会在夜里守望的" 他回答道。

"There is no need, no one will attack this town. I will pay for a room for you at the inn we are staying at" she declared.  
"没必要，没人会攻击这个镇子。我会为我们住的旅馆给你付个房间的钱" 她宣布道。

"My Lady, I do appreciate your generosity but I cannot accept this" he declined.  
"我的女士，我非常感激您的慷慨，但我不能接受这个" 他婉拒道。

"Are you refusing a Princess?" she prompted.  
"你是在拒绝一位公主吗？" 她追问道。

"No, of course not. I thank you your Highness, you are too kind" he accepted.  
"不，当然不是。我感谢您，殿下，您太过仁慈了" 他接受了。

"Good! Now that that is settled, I need to get myself clean. That whole escapade got me filthy" she announced.  
"好极了！既然事情解决了，我得把自己弄干净。那场冒险把我弄得一身脏。"她宣布道。

The princess walks off into the inn, followed by a few of her guards.  
公主走进旅店，几名侍卫紧随其后。

"What an interesting person that princess" the knight says to himself.  
"那位公主真是个有趣的人。"骑士自言自语道。

After that, the knight walks into the inn and asks the innkeeper where his room is and the innkeeper gives him directions. The knight mishears and instead walks into the bathing room by accident. He walks in to find a stark naked, of course just a skin costume, princess who had undressed to enter the bath. The princess sees him enter and instantly covers herself.  
之后，骑士走进旅店，向店主询问他的房间位置，店主给他指了路。骑士听错了，误打误撞走进了浴室。他一进门，就看到一位公主，当然只是穿着皮肤服装，正脱光衣服准备洗澡。公主见他进来，立刻遮住了自己。

"What the hell are you doing here?" she shouted.  
“你到底在这里干什么？”她大声喊道。

"I err…" the knight stumbled.  
“我……呃……”骑士结巴了。

"Get out!" she shouted. "滚出去！" 她喊道。

He didn't need to be told twice and ran straight out. He finally stopped after fumbling about for a bit and mysteriously ended up outside his room.  
他不需要被说第二次，直接跑了出去。他摸索了一会儿，最终神秘地停在了自己的房间外。

"That was not a good first impression" he said to himself.  
“那可不是个好印象” 他自言自语道。

The knight entered his room and took off his armour before laying down on his bed. A few minutes later, an angry princess came storming into his room.  
骑士走进房间，脱下盔甲后便躺在了床上。几分钟后，一位愤怒的公主怒气冲冲地闯进了他的房间。

"Mr. KNIGHT! I hope you can explain your actions before I have you beheaded!" she shouted furiously.  
"骑士先生！我希望你能在被我斩首之前解释你的行为！"她愤怒地喊道。

"I am truly apologetic your Highness, I really did not mean to disturb you. I foolishly misheard the innkeeper's directions to my room and ended up where you were" he explained, sitting up.  
"我深感抱歉，殿下，我真的无意打扰您。我愚蠢地误解了旅店老板指引我房间的方向，结果误入了您的房间。"他坐起身解释道。

"You do realise I could have you slaughtered right now?" she retorted.  
"你难道不知道我现在就可以下令处死你吗？" 她反驳道。

"I realise my Lady. I humbly ask you for your forgiveness" he said, prostrating.  
"我明白，我的女士。我谦卑地请求您的宽恕。" 他说着，俯身跪下。

The princess sighed as she decided to let it go. "Make sure it does not happen again"  
公主叹了口气，决定放过此事。"确保不要再发生这种事了。"

"Yes, your Highness" he replied, standing back up.  
"是的，殿下" 他回答道，站起身来。

At that, she walked out of his room and closed the door. The knight finally relaxed, relieved of the impending doom.  
听到这话，她走出了他的房间并关上了门。骑士终于放松下来，摆脱了迫在眉睫的厄运。

"She is a very understanding woman. If that had been any other princess, I would probably not have lived to see the next day" he mused.  
"她是个非常善解人意的女人。如果是其他公主，我可能活不到第二天了" 他沉思道。

The knight lay down on his bed again and went to sleep. The next morning, he awoke to the sound of someone knocking on his door. Getting up from his bed, he went to his door and opened it, immediately greeted by the sight of the princess.  
骑士再次躺回床上，进入了梦乡。第二天早晨，他被一阵敲门声唤醒。他从床上起身，走向门口，打开门，立刻看到了公主的身影。

"Sir Knight" she hailed. “骑士先生”她招呼道。

"Yes, your Highness?" he prompted.  
“是的，殿下？”他询问道。

"Get ready immediately, I wish to leave early. I will say goodbye to my men while you are preparing" she instructed.  
"立即准备出发，我想早点离开。你准备的时候，我会向我的士兵们告别" 她命令道。

"Yes, your Highness" he agreed.  
"是的，殿下" 他同意道。

At this, the princess closed the door and walked off. The knight promptly put on his armour and fixed himself up before exiting his room. He then made his way out of the inn, thanking the innkeeper as he left and found the princess outside saying her goodbyes to her men.  
听到这话，公主关上门离开了。骑士迅速穿上盔甲，整理好自己后走出房间。他随后离开了旅店，向店主道谢，并在外面找到了正在向士兵们告别的公主。

"Do not worry men, I will arrive safely with the help of this knight" the princess reassured.  
"别担心，男士们，有这位骑士的帮助，我会安全到达的。" 公主安慰道。

"Yes my Lady, we trust in your wisdom" the men replied.  
"是的，女士，我们相信您的智慧。" 男士们回答。

The knight walked up to the princess, kneeling in front of her. "Your Highness, I am ready. Sir Jonathan at your service" he declared, bowing. "I will deliver you safely to our king"  
骑士走到公主面前，跪在她面前。"殿下，我已准备就绪。我是乔纳森爵士，随时为您效劳。" 他宣布道，鞠了一躬。"我会将您安全送到我们的国王那里。"

"Rise Sir Jonathan, let us make haste" the princess commanded. 

The knight stood up again and bowed to her men before leading her to his horse. After they mounted the horse, they rode off while the princess waved to her men. When the village was out of sight, she spoke up. 

"So how long for us to reach your king's castle?" she asked. 

"It depends, at this rate about two days, but I can make the horse run faster and we could be there sooner" the knight answered. 

"Go ahead, ride faster" she commanded. 

"Yes your Highness, but I advise you to hold on" he requested. 

He urged the horse faster and it sped up, forcing the princess to hold the knight tightly around the waist for support. After a few hours of riding, the princess called for a break and they stopped by a pond so the horse could drink some water. 

"We make good progress, we are getting there faster than expected and we still have many hours of day left," the knight explained. 

"Good news, however, I am famished right now" the princess replied. 

He promptly handed her some food, which she took and ate ravenously, disregarding proper etiquette. The knight was a little shocked. 

"Forgive me your Highness, but are you not to eat like a proper Lady?" he asked meekly. 

"Are you questioning me knight?" the princess asked with a hint of jest. "Just between you and me, acting all proper has its place but at certain moments is pointless. I'd rather just act normally for now" she continued. 

"I meant no disrespect, you may do as you wish your Highness" he replied. 

"Enough of that, you may call me Adelita. 'Your Highness' is starting to sound a little dry" she retorted. 

"Yes your-I mean Adelita" he conceded. 

"So how is it you became to be a knight?" she asked curiously. 

"Ah well, that's a sad story your High-Adelita… probably not one I should bother you with" he started. 

"No, it is not a bother, please continue" she prompted. 

"When I was younger, my family was brutally murdered and my farm burnt down. I was the only survivor. A knight like myself found me and took me in. Ever since, I always wanted to be a knight to find the group of people who killed my family and exact justice" he recounted. 

"That's dreadful, I am truly sorry for your loss" the princess consoled. 

"Do not worry Adelita, I was too young to remember. I was told of these events when I was older" he clarified. 

"Do you have any family now? Or are you all alone?" she inquired. 

"I had a woman I was living with for a while, but I found out she was having affairs with another man and I ended it. From then on, I decided I would not have a woman scorn me again" he answered. 

"Oh, you think all are women bad?" she teased. 

"Well no but… it's difficult to open my heart again" he replied. 

"I understand, I am sorry you had such experiences" she said with a soft tone. 

"Well, we best get moving again" the knight announced. 

"Yes let's" she agreed. 

They mounted the horse and began riding again. They did not stop for a while this time and they rode until the skies were getting dark. 

"This is great, we are already more than halfway there" the knight commented. 

"Let us rest then, I can wait another day" the princess requested. 

After finding a suitable place to make camp, they dismounted the horse to prepare. After setting up their camp, the princess started making a fire. 

"Is that wise Adelita? A fire would give away our position" the knight asked. 

"We need a fire to stay warm, besides a fire keeps away wild animals" she explained. 

"Bandits are to be feared more than any wild animal" he warned. 

"The fire stays and so I command" she ordered. 

"Yes, my Lady" he said, obeying. 

After she finished the fire, they set down beds next to the fire to sleep on. The knight removed his armour and they went to sleep peacefully. 

In the middle of the night, the knight awoke to some strange sound. Looking around, he could see it was now very dark, the fire the only thing illuminating the area. He figured that it was just his imagination and he tried to go back to sleep. Then he heard it again; it was a twig snapping. At that, he instantly got up and picked up his sword. 

"You are greatly outnumbered and you do not have your armour on, I would advise putting your weapon down and coming with us quietly" a voice said aloud. 

"I will not allow you to take me" Jonathan said to the abyss. 

"That really is an unwise choice" the voice replied. 

The knight looked around desperately for any sign of the man. He guessed he would have to use his hearing extensively. He heard a sound coming from behind and ducked just in time to dodge a swinging blow from a sword. The fight began and the knight found himself fighting five men. He fought hard, parrying and swinging, doing his best to defend the princess; he could not let what happened to his family happen to her. He scored a strike and one man stumbled back, mortally wounded. The knight knew one hit without his armour would kill him, but he had the advantage of higher maneuverability without it and so was able to dodge their attacks. He managed to strike another man directly, leaving three men left. However, the knight was growing weary and it was difficult to keep fighting. His fatigue caused him to falter and his sword was knocked out of his hand. The man moved in after disarming him and held his sword against his throat. 

"You fight admirably, but now you will have to die" the bandit declared. 

The knight closed his eyes, regretting his failure and waited for his death. All of a sudden, he heard the man holding the sword shout in pain. Instantly, he moved out of range of the sword and found his weapon, picking it up again. He fought the last two men, easily wounding one while the other ran away. Concerned about the princess, he turned around and saw her holding a dagger covered in blood. 

"Guess you were right about the fire" the princess acknowledged. 

"You saved my life?" he asked. 

"Hardly, you fought our assailants valiantly. I simply woke up when I heard the commotion and realised you were fighting. I found my dagger and snuck up behind the man to stab him just in time. You took care of the rest" she explained. 

"I guess I was wrong about you Adelita, you can handle yourself adequately. Thank you for your quick thinking, I am deeply indebted to you" he expressed gratefully. 

"On the contrary, I am in your debt. Besides, it was my fault they came in the first place. In spite of this, you fought bravely to protect me" she said, smiling. 

"Thank you for your kind praise Adelita" the knight replied. 

"In any case, I think we best put out this fire before something else happens" she declared. With that, she threw dirt over the fire, extinguishing it. 

"Princess, the night will be fairly cold without the fire" he commented. 

"You are right, we will simply have to share our warmth" she explained. 

The knight was shocked at her response. "Are you sure princess? You would lay down with a stranger?" 

"You are no stranger to me" she replied. 

The knight smiled in the pale moonlight. "I'd like to ask you one question" he requested. 

"You may" she prompted. 

"You said you were meeting with my king to marry him. What are the reasons for this?" he inquired. 

"Well, my father and your king wish to use me as part of an alliance contract, though truthfully I did not agree to this. I do not care for ruling power, I just wish to be with a man that I love" she explained. 

"That is truly unfortunate indeed, is there no other way?" he asked. 

"I argued with my father but he would have none of it, no one cares what a woman has to say anyway" she said dismissively. 

"I do…" the knight said kindly. 

The princess stayed silent at his response, prompting the knight to get back to the task at hand, putting their beds together so they could sleep. 

After he was done, the princess put her hand on his shoulder. "Sir knight" 

"Yes, my Lady?" he said curiously. 

"I er… well that is…" she stumbled. 

They two teenagers both paused, and stayed like that, finding it awkward to do the next part of the play. 

"Asuka you're supposed to kiss the knight now" the teacher whispered. 

"Do I have to?" she whispered back. 

"Yes, it's part of the play. It's just pretend, practise it to get used to it so that you can do it when we present the play" the teacher answered. 

Asuka swallowed nervously; obviously this was just pretend, they didn't have to actually kiss, but it was still embarrassing. The redhead moved her face towards his, her lips just barely touching his, but having kissed Shinji so many times her body took over and she kissed him properly; though it's not like the class could tell how real or fake the kiss was. Shinji couldn't help kissing the girl back, but made sure it still looked like a phony kiss. Luckily, the bell rang for the end of school at that moment, causing Shinji and Asuka to part instantly, both blushing. A couple of wolf whistles were let out from the class. 

"Shut up you perverts, it's just part of the play!" Asuka shouted, making everyone instantly shut up. 

"We'll finish up here for today, please remove your costumes and pack everything away" the teacher directed. 

All the students stood up and separated into groups; one set packing away props while the others lined up at the changing rooms to remove their costumes. As people finished changing, they swapped with someone packing props, while they went to change. Eventually all props were packed away and all people changed out of their costumes. 

"Alright class, good job with this practice session" the teacher praised. "We will continue next time from this point, dismissed" 

At this, the class piled out of the stage room and the students began exiting the school to make their way home. Shinji went out with Asuka, while Touji, Kensuke and Hikari followed them out. 

"It was really surprising to see you two kiss each other" Hikari announced gleefully. 

"Come of it Hikari, it was just pretend" Asuka said, sounding annoyed.  
"得了吧，光，那只是假装而已。" 明日香说道，听起来有些不耐烦。

"It looked pretty convincing to me, especially for a girl who seems to hate Shinji" Touji commented jokingly.  
"在我看来挺逼真的，尤其是对一个似乎讨厌真嗣的女孩来说。" 东治打趣地评论道。

"That's just a testament to my skill in making it look genuine" Asuka retorted.  
"那只是证明了我让这一切看起来很真实的技巧。" 明日香反驳道。

"So Shinji, what was it like? Were you burnt by fire? Was your mouth full of ash?" Touji joked.  
"那么，真嗣，感觉如何？你被火烧到了吗？嘴里是不是全是灰？" 东治开玩笑地说。

The redhead shot them both a glare, "It would be a _privilege_ to be kissed by me asshole" she spat at Touji.  
红发女孩瞪了他们俩一眼，"被我亲吻可是你的荣幸，混蛋"，她对东治厉声说道。

"L-like Asuka said, it was just p-pretend" Shinji answered, stammering.  
"就像明日香说的，那只是假装"，真嗣结结巴巴地回答。

"You don't need to hide your feelings Shinji… if it was awful, just let us know" Kensuke teased.  
"你不需要隐藏你的感受，真嗣……如果那很糟糕，直接告诉我们吧" 剑介打趣道。

"Ugh… I'm surrounded by morons" Asuka said, smacking her head.  
"呃……我被一群白痴包围了" 明日香说着，拍了拍自己的头。

"Hey Shinji, do you want to come hang out with us now? To celebrate your return and all" Touji offered.  
"嘿，真嗣，你现在想和我们一起出去玩吗？庆祝你回来什么的" 东治提议道。

"Yeah, we can tell you all the details of our camping trip too" Kensuke added.  
“是啊，我们也可以告诉你露营的所有细节。” Kensuke 补充道。

"Ummm well…" he said unsure, glancing at his girlfriend.  
“嗯，这个嘛…”他不确定地说，瞥了一眼他的女朋友。

"Go spend time with your idiotic friends if you want to, I don't care" Asuka remarked, letting him know it was fine.  
“想去就和你那些蠢朋友一起玩吧，我不在乎。” Asuka 说道，让他知道没关系。

"Yeah guys, that'd be great!" Shinji replied.  
“好的，伙计们，那太棒了！”真嗣回答道。

"Asuka, you can come over to my place if you don't wanna be home alone" Hikari offered.  
“明日香，如果你不想一个人在家，可以来我这里”光提议道。

"Thanks Hikari, I'll take you up on that offer" Asuka said thankfully.  
“谢谢你，光，我会接受你的提议”明日香感激地说。

By this time, the five of them had exited the school gates and they found themselves greeted by the purple-haired Major waiting for the two teens.  
此时，他们五人已经走出了校门，迎面而来的是那位紫发的少校，正等待着两位少年。

"Hey Shinji, Asuka!" Misato said, waving to them.  
“嘿，真嗣，明日香！”美里向他们挥手道。

"Hey Misato" both Shinji and Asuka said in unison.  
“嘿，美里。”真嗣和明日香齐声回应道。

"It's Misato!" Touji let out excitedly.  
"是美里小姐！" 冬二兴奋地喊道。

"Hey everyone, how are you doing?" Misato asked, giving a small wink to Shinji's friends.  
"大家好，你们怎么样？" 美里问道，向真嗣的朋友们眨了眨眼。

"Doing great now!" Kensuke replied, unable to stop himself smiling.  
"现在感觉棒极了！" 肯斯克回答，忍不住笑了起来。

"Like a dream come true!" Touji exclaimed.  
"宛如梦想成真！" 冬二惊叹道。

"What are you doing here Misato?" the redhead asked, ignoring the two drooling boys.  
"美里，你在这里做什么？" 红发女孩问道，无视了那两个流口水的男孩。

"I've come to pick you two up, you're required at NERV immediately" Misato answered.  
"我来接你们两个，NERV 要求你们立即前往。" 美里回答道。

"Oh…" Shinji said trailing off, he had been excited to hang out with his friends and he wasn't too fond of returning to NERV just yet.  
"哦…" 真嗣拖长了声音说道，他原本很兴奋能和朋友一起出去玩，并不太想这么快就回到 NERV。

"We were all about to hang out after school, Shinji's friends wanted to celebrate his return" Asuka explained, feeling pity for the boy.  
"我们本来放学后都要一起出去玩的，真嗣的朋友想庆祝他的归来" 明日香解释道，对这男孩感到同情。

"I'm sorry to do this to you guys, but I really must take you two now" Misato said firmly.  
"我很抱歉这样对你们，但我现在真的必须带你们两个走" 美里坚定地说道。

"Ah damn! That really sucks bro!" Touji said, smacking Shinji on the back.  
"啊，该死！那真是糟糕透了，兄弟！" 冬二说着，拍了拍真嗣的背。

"Sorry guys, I guess we'll hang another time!" Shinji replied, trying not to sound defeated.  
"抱歉，伙计们，看来我们得改天再聚了！" 真嗣回答，尽量不显得沮丧。

"No problem" Kensuke replied, "These things happen"  
"没事的" 剑介回应道，"这种事难免会发生"

"Sorry Hikari, another time" Asuka said with a hint of disappointment.  
"对不起，小光，下次吧" 明日香带着一丝失望说道。

"Don't worry Asuka, you're welcome anytime" the class rep replied, smiling.  
"别担心，明日香，你随时都受欢迎" 班长笑着回答。

"Alright then, let's go" Misato prompted.  
"那好吧，我们走吧" 美里催促道。

"See ya tomorrow guys" Shinji said, waving at his friends.  
“明天见，伙计们。”真嗣挥手向朋友们告别。

"See ya Hikari" Asuka said, waving at her friend.  
“再见，光。”明日香向她的朋友挥手。

"See ya!" they all responded, waving as well.  
“再见！”他们也挥手回应。

At that, the two eva pilots turned back to Misato and followed her as she began to walk to her car. The two teens began to chat as they made their way to the car.  
听到这话，两位 EVA 驾驶员转身回到美里身边，跟着她走向她的车。两个少年边走边聊，向车子走去。

"Oh man… what a day!" Shinji let out with a breath. "That whole incident in the pool and then that last scene in the play"  
“哦，天哪……真是漫长的一天！”真嗣叹了口气说道，“先是泳池里的那场意外，然后是剧中的最后一幕”

"I didn't realise we had to kiss in that play, that sure brought a lot of unwanted attention" Asuka remarked.  
“我没想到我们在那出戏里还得接吻，那确实招来了不少不必要的关注。”明日香评论道。

"It shouldn't really matter, we can just use the excuse of it being a play and no one will pay heed…" he replied, "Besides you easily intimidate everyone Asuka" he added teasingly.  
"这其实没什么大不了的，我们可以用演戏作为借口，没人会当真的……" 他回答道，"再说了，你很容易就能吓住所有人，明日香。" 他打趣地补充道。

"Haha, I guess you're right" she replied, smirking.  
"哈哈，我想你说的对" 她回答道，嘴角微微上扬。

"By the way, do you know what kind of a name Adelita Sankt is?" Shinji asked curiously.  
"对了，你知道 Adelita Sankt 这个名字是什么来头吗？" 真嗣好奇地问道。

"Yes actually! It's German funnily enough, Adelita means 'sweet' or 'noble,' while Sankt means 'saint', so together it means 'noble saint' or similar" Asuka answered.  
"是的，实际上！有趣的是，Adelita 在德语中意味着'甜美'或'高贵'，而 Sankt 意味着'圣人'，所以合起来就是'高贵的圣人'或类似的意思" 明日香回答道。

"My noble saint" he responded sarcastically.  
"我的高贵圣人" 他讽刺地回应道。

"Knock it off" she said, punching him in the shoulder.  
"别闹了" 她说着，一拳打在他的肩膀上。

Reaching the car, Misato got into the driver's seat, while the two eva pilots got in the back together sitting next to each other. As they drove off, Shinji turned to face Asuka and gave her a passionate kiss, taking the girl by surprise. As the redhead joined in, Shinji pulled her closer to him and ran his hand up and down her back.  
到达车旁，美里坐进了驾驶座，而两位 EVA 驾驶员则一起坐在了后排。车子启动后，真嗣转向明日香，给了她一个热情的吻，让女孩措手不及。随着红发少女的回应，真嗣将她拉得更近，手在她背上上下抚摸。

"I see you two are as lovey-dovey as ever" Misato commented on their display, causing the two teens to part.  
“看来你们俩还是一如既往地恩爱啊。”美里对他们的表现评论道，这让两个少年少女分开了。

As they parted, the young girl looked at him curiously. "You alright baka?" she asked.  
分开后，少女好奇地看着他。“你还好吗，笨蛋？”她问道。

"Now I am" he answered, grinning, "Wanted to get that out of my system, plus it's a thanks for saving me in the pool"  
"现在我是" 他回答，咧嘴笑着，"想把这事儿从心里掏出来，再说也是为了感谢她在泳池里救了我"

"What happened in the pool?" Misato asked, a little concerned.  
"泳池里发生了什么？" 美里问，略显担忧。

"Nothing much, Asuka saved me before I drowned" Shinji answered before Asuka could speak up; he didn't want to worry Misato too much.  
"没什么大不了的，明日香在我溺水前救了我" 真嗣回答，不让明日香有机会插话；他不想让美里太过担心。

The redhead glanced at him but didn't challenge his statement.  
红发女孩瞥了他一眼，但没有质疑他的话。

"Oh, at least it wasn't too serious then, thanks for saving him Asuka" Misato replied.  
“哦，那至少不是太严重，谢谢你救了他，明日香。”美里回答道。

"No problem. So, what's this all about Misato?" Asuka asked curiously, wondering why they had to be taken from school.  
“没什么。那么，这到底是怎么回事，美里？”明日香好奇地问，想知道为什么他们必须从学校被带走。

"I'm not sure why, but the Commander wants to discuss the relationship between you two with both of you" Misato answered. "Your relationship became a hot topic throughout NERV ever since the defeat of the angel, and now that you're out of prison, I can't delay the Commander any longer" she elaborated.  
"我不确定为什么，但指挥官想和你俩讨论你们之间的关系。" 美里回答道。"自从击败天使后，你们的关系就成了 NERV 的热门话题，现在你出狱了，我不能再拖延指挥官的要求了。" 她进一步解释道。

"Does he know why I was in jail?" Shinji asked curiously.  
"他知道我为什么入狱吗？" 真嗣好奇地问道。

"Yes, that's probably one of the reasons for him ordering your presence. A relationship between two pilots could be bad for NERV, especially in light of all the information. I couldn't keep the Commander off your back any longer" Misato answered.  
"是的，这可能是他要求你到场的原因之一。两名驾驶员之间的关系对 NERV 不利，尤其是在所有这些信息曝光的情况下。我无法再阻止指挥官关注你们了。" 美里回答道。

"That's ok, thanks for getting us some time" the boy replied appreciatively.  
“没关系，谢谢你为我们争取了时间。”男孩感激地回答。

"He's not going to try to separate us, is he?" Asuka asked, a hint of concern in her voice.  
“他不会试图拆散我们吧？”明日香问道，声音中带着一丝担忧。

"I don't know honestly Asuka, but I doubt it, if that's what he wanted he probably would have made sure it happened by now" Misato responded.  
“老实说，我不知道，明日香，但我怀疑他不会，如果他真想这么做，可能早就确保它发生了。”美里回应道。

Shinji held Asuka's hand comfortingly, "Don't worry, I'll never let you go" he told her quietly with conviction. The redhead squeezed his hand back and nodded.  
真嗣安慰地握住明日香的手，"别担心，我永远不会放开你"他坚定地轻声告诉她。红发女孩也紧握他的手，点了点头。

The two teens jumped as they heard the Major blast the horn. "Get out of the way dammit! This traffic is killing me" she exclaimed; it was end of school time after all.  
两位少年听到少校猛按喇叭时吓了一跳。"让开，该死的！这交通快把我逼疯了"她喊道；毕竟现在是放学时间。

Seeing a small opening in the lane, Misato then floored the accelerator and swerved through the gap, causing other cars to beep at them. Shinji and Asuka held onto each other, fearing their lives as the Major continued to drive recklessly, almost crashing into several cars, before Shinji passed out. Finally arriving at NERV, the two teens quickly got out of the car, thankful for the end of the ride.  
看到车道上有个小空隙，美里随即猛踩油门，穿过缝隙，导致其他车辆对他们鸣笛。真嗣和明日香紧紧相拥，担心自己的生命安全，因为少校继续鲁莽驾驶，差点撞上几辆车，直到真嗣昏过去。终于抵达 NERV，两位少年迅速下车，庆幸这段惊险旅程的结束。

"I don't know why I bothered saving Shinji, when your driving will kill us anyway" the redhead announced irately.  
"我不知道我为什么要费心救真嗣，反正你的驾驶技术迟早会把我们都害死。"红发女孩生气地宣布道。

"Come on, it wasn't that bad! I didn't want to spend ages in traffic so you guys would have more time for yourselves after this visit" Misato said, defending herself.  
"拜托，没那么糟糕吧！我不想让大家在交通堵塞上浪费太多时间，这样你们在这趟拜访后还能有更多属于自己的时间。"美里辩解道。

"Whatever" Asuka replied, sighing, "Let's just get this over and done with"  
"随便吧"明日香叹了口气，"我们还是赶紧把这事了结了吧"

At that, all three of them made their way to the elevator before pressing the floor number for the Commander's office. Once they reached the floor, they stepped out of the elevator and began their long dreary walk along the corridor leading to the Commander's office. It wasn't long till they stopped outside his door.  
听到这话，他们三人一起走向电梯，按下了通往指挥官办公室的楼层按钮。到达楼层后，他们走出电梯，开始了沿着通往指挥官办公室的走廊的漫长而沉闷的步行。不久，他们便停在了他的办公室门外。

"Alright listen up, the Commander has specifically requested me not to be a part of the audience, you're on your own. This discussion will be with just you two" Misato explained.  
“好了，听着，指挥官特别要求我不要在场，你们得自己面对。这次讨论只会是你们两个人的事。”美里解释道。

"It's fine, don't I need the father's blessing anyway?" Asuka joked.  
“没关系，反正我不也需要父亲的祝福吗？”明日香开玩笑说。

Shinji smiled a little at her wit, but was still quite nervous about the discussion to take place. However, having Asuka with him was quite reassuring, she was very good at asserting herself.  
真嗣对她机智的回答微微一笑，但对于即将进行的讨论仍感到相当紧张。然而，有明日香在身边确实让他安心不少，她非常擅长为自己争取。

"Let's do this Asuka" Shinji spoke up.  
“我们开始吧，明日香。”真嗣开口说道。

"Unn" the redhead replied, nodding.  
“嗯”红发少女应声点头。

The two teens entered the office, the door closing behind them. The Commander's room was dark and gloomy as always, one would wonder how the Commander saw anything. Looking forward, they saw Shinji's father behind his desk in his usual pose, impossible to see his facial expression because of his tinted glasses. Standing behind the Commander was the Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, not making any expression.  
两个少年走进办公室，门在他们身后关闭。指挥官的房间一如既往地昏暗阴沉，让人不禁好奇指挥官是如何看清任何东西的。他们向前看去，只见真嗣的父亲坐在桌后，保持着他一贯的姿态，由于墨镜的遮挡，无法看清他的面部表情。站在指挥官身后的是副指挥官冬月，脸上没有任何表情。

"You two both know why you are here so I'll cut straight to the point" the Commander said suddenly, looking down at them with an icy chill. "Explain your relationship, so I can decide if it will be detrimental to the goals of NERV"  
“你们俩都知道为什么来这里，所以我直截了当”指挥官突然说道，带着冰冷的目光俯视着他们。“解释你们的关系，这样我才能决定它是否会妨碍 NERV 的目标。”

Asuka knew not to annoy the Commander and decided to speak for both of them, knowing Shinji would struggle talking to his father. "Your son and I have a consensual relationship with mutual infatuation. We have engaged in the act of sexual intercourse and the like several times" she answered without emotion.  
明日香知道不要惹恼指挥官，决定替他们两人说话，她知道真嗣面对父亲会难以开口。“您的儿子和我有一个双方同意的关系，彼此迷恋。我们进行过多次性行为”她毫无感情地回答道。

"Are you using protection? NERV cannot afford a pregnant pilot" the Commander continued.  
"你在使用防护措施吗？NERV 可承担不起一个怀孕的驾驶员" 指挥官继续说道。

"Yes sir, we are using protection" she replied.  
"是的，长官，我们使用了防护措施" 她回答道。

The Commander paused for a moment, seemingly considering something.  
指挥官停顿了一下，似乎在考虑着什么。

"Shinji, it was conveyed to me that you raped the second child initially. I would ask that you refrain from engaging in any acts that hinder the piloting ability of NERV, your time in prison has surely given you time to reflect on your actions" the Commander declared impassively.  
"真嗣，有人向我报告说你最初侵犯了二号适格者。我希望你不要再做出任何妨碍 NERV 驾驶员能力的行为，你在监狱里的时间应该足够让你反思自己的行为了" 指挥官冷漠地宣布道。

The young boy almost choked at his casual mention of the event. "Y-yes father… I have reflected seriously on my actions"  
少年几乎被他轻描淡写地提及那件事呛到。"是...是的，父亲...我已经认真反思过我的行为了"

"Normally I would disagree with any relationship of this sort between two pilots" the Commander interjected, both teens remained silent. "However, this is a special case. This relationship seems to boost your sync ratio. As long as your relationship will not interfere with your duties at NERV and you continue to use protection, I will have no quarrel with you. In the event it comes into conflict with your work, I will have you two separated immediately" he threatened. "And while we are here, Shinji do not disobey my orders again" he finished off.  
"通常情况下，我反对两位驾驶员之间存在这种关系" 指挥官插话道，两个年轻人都保持沉默。"然而，这是一个特殊情况。这种关系似乎提升了你们的同步率。只要你们的关系不会干扰到在 NERV 的职责，并且你们继续采取保护措施，我就不会对此有异议。一旦它与你们的工作发生冲突，我会立即让你们分开" 他威胁道。"而且既然我们在这里，真嗣，不要再违抗我的命令了" 他最后说道。

"Excuse me Commander, but I do not know what you are referring to" Shinji asked, confused; he couldn't think of anything he'd done recently.  
“对不起，司令，我不明白您指的是什么。” 真嗣困惑地问道；他想不出最近自己做了什么。

"In the last angel attack, I told you to stay in system freeze, yet you moved up the catapult to the surface" the Commander replied.  
“在上一次使徒袭击中，我命令你保持在系统冻结状态，但你却移动到了弹射器表面。” 司令回答道。

Asuka, sick of the Commander's conduct, spoke up to one up him. "Sir! With all due respect, the third child was coming out to save the star pilot of NERV" she said resolutely, "NERV can't afford to lose a pilot at a time like this"  
明日香对司令的行为感到厌烦，决定反击。“长官！恕我直言，第三适格者是为了救 NERV 的明星驾驶员而出动的。”她坚定地说，“在这种时候，NERV 可损失不起一个驾驶员。”

"And what is your point Sohryu?" he asked coldly.  
"那你想表达什么，双龙？" 他冷冷地问道。

"I'd say the end justifies the means sir" she replied vindictively.  
"我认为结果能证明手段的正当性，长官。" 她报复性地回答。

The Commander merely looked at the girl shocked; she had just used his life motto against him. The Sub-Commander behind him laughed shortly, before the older Ikari recomposed himself.  
指挥官只是震惊地看着女孩；她刚刚用他的生活信条反驳了他。他身后的副指挥官短暂地笑了一声，随后年长的碇重新调整了自己的情绪。

"One last thing" the Commander began, "I'm sure you are both aware of the issue with underage sex in regards to the second child's US citizenship, make sure no one finds out about your 'activities.' Dismissed" he finished.  
"还有一件事，"指挥官开口道，"我相信你们俩都清楚，关于第二个孩子的美国公民身份，未成年性行为是个问题，确保没人发现你们的'活动。'解散。"他结束了讲话。

"Yes sir!" they both affirmed, saluting, before exiting the room relieved.  
"是的，长官！"他们齐声回答，敬礼后，如释重负地离开了房间。

Just as the doors closed, the Sub-Commander spoke up. "She's excellent, she outsmarted even the great Gendo, no wonder your son pursued her" he praised.  
门刚关上，副指挥官就开口了。"她非常出色，连伟大的源堂都被她智胜了，难怪你儿子追求她。"他称赞道。

"It will not happen again" the Commander replied, pushing his glasses up.  
"不会再有下次了" 指挥官回答，推了推他的眼镜。

"So Rokubungi, why have you changed the scenario?" Fuyutsuki asked.  
"那么，六分仪，你为何改变了剧本？" 冬月问道。

"It was unintentional, when I had his LCL drugged I thought he would desire Rei and thus complete a more stable instrumentality scenario. Instead, his actions caused the second child to defeat the 15th angel without her losing her mind. This changes everything considerably, I do not believe it is possible to follow the scenario anymore" Gendo replied, before sighing. "But at least my son is happy"  
"这是无意的，当我给他注入药物时，我以为他会渴望丽，从而完成一个更稳定的融合场景。然而，他的行为导致第二适格者在没有丧失理智的情况下击败了第 15 使徒。这改变了一切，我不认为还能继续按照剧本行事了" 碇源堂回答，随后叹了口气。"但至少我的儿子是幸福的"

"How will this affect everything?" The Sub-Commander inquired.  
“这会如何影响一切？”副司令询问道。

"The next angels will still come, but Seele will no doubt attack once they find out what has happened. I have no choice now but to try and stop instrumentality… maybe I will get the chance to see Yui again in the afterlife…" Ikari said, trailing off.  
“下一批天使仍会到来，但 Seele 一旦发现发生了什么，无疑会发动攻击。我现在别无选择，只能尝试阻止神化……也许我还有机会在来世再见 Yui 一面……”碇源堂说道，声音渐渐低沉。

"Are we able to stop Seele?" the older man asked with apprehension.  
“我们能阻止 Seele 吗？”年长者不安地问道。

"We certainly have a chance. I have in my possession everything they need for instrumentality to occur. Besides, I'm sure my wife will show them not to mess with Shinji" Gendo said, somewhat amused.  
"我们确实有机会。我手中握有他们实现人类补完计划所需的一切。此外，我相信我的妻子会让那些人明白，不要招惹真嗣。" 碇源堂说道，语气中带着一丝戏谑。

"Very well" Fuyutsuki replied, "Though I wonder if your son has inherited some of your genes?"  
"很好" 冬月回答道，"不过我好奇，你的儿子是否继承了你的某些基因？"

"What do you mean?" Gendo prompted.  
"你指的是什么？" 碇源堂追问道。

"It seems like he can really give it to her" the Sub-Commander joked.  
"看来他真的能对付她"，副指挥官打趣道。

The Commander allowed a small smile to grace his usually cold features for a moment. "I suppose he has"  
指挥官的脸上难得地露出一丝微笑，"我想他确实有这个本事"

---

Outside the Commander's office, Misato and the two eva pilots were conversing about what had just taken place. The three of them were walking along the corridor they came from to return to the elevator.  
在指挥官办公室外，美里和两位 EVA 驾驶员正在讨论刚刚发生的事情。三人沿着来时的走廊走向电梯。

"That was a really weird discussion" Asuka remarked.  
“那真是一场奇怪的讨论。”明日香评论道。

"Are you guys alright? Anything I should know about?" Misato asked curious, but also concerned.  
“你们还好吗？有什么我该知道的吗？”美里好奇地问，同时也带着关切。

"It was a mostly pointless discussion honestly" Asuka replied.  
“老实说，那场讨论基本上毫无意义。”明日香回答道。

"It was about making sure we were putting NERV first basically…" Shinji explained.  
"基本上就是确保我们把 NERV 放在首位……" 真嗣解释道。

"And that asshole was totally blasé about… about Shinji… forcing me…" she finished; she still found it difficult to say the word out loud.  
"那个混蛋对……对真嗣……强迫我……" 她结结巴巴地说完；她仍然觉得难以大声说出那个词。

"Yeah, that really got me off guard" Shinji started, "It really made me angry that he thought so little of incident and merely commented about its negative impact to NERV"  
"是啊，那真的让我措手不及" 真嗣开始说道，"他如此轻视这件事，仅仅评论其对 NERV 的负面影响，这真的让我很生气"

"Left a bad taste in my mouth" Asuka spat.  
“让我感觉恶心。”明日香啐道。

"Don't worry about my father, he's a horrible human being. Who cares what he thinks about us, as long as we can stay together" Shinji told Asuka reassuringly, giving her a hug.  
“别担心我父亲，他是个糟糕透顶的人。只要我们能在一起，谁在乎他怎么想我们。”真嗣安慰地对明日香说，并给了她一个拥抱。

Misato joined in the hug, "Don't worry about the Commander Asuka. I'm even surprised he let you guys off the hook, so let's just appreciate the silver lining" she said comfortingly.  
美里也加入了拥抱，“别担心司令了，明日香。我甚至惊讶他放过了你们，所以让我们珍惜这线光明吧。”她安慰地说。

"Yeah yeah, I'm fine. Thanks" Asuka responded.  
“是是，我没事。谢谢。”明日香回应道。

Moving off the two, Misato spoke up, wanting to get Asuka's mind off the conversation with the Commander. "Oh, I almost forgot! I have something for you two" she announced.  
离开两人后，美里开口了，想让明日香不再想着与司令的对话。“哦，我差点忘了！我有东西给你们俩。”她宣布道。

As the two teens looked at their guardian curiously, Misato pulled out a photo and handed it to them. It was a picture of the two of them sleeping together on the couch in their living room.  
当两个少年好奇地看着他们的监护人时，美里拿出一张照片递给他们。那是他们俩在客厅沙发上睡在一起的照片。

"What the hell? How did you get a picture of this?" Asuka asked, struggling to remember when this event happened.  
"搞什么鬼？你怎么会有这张照片？" 明日香问道，努力回忆这个事件发生的时刻。

"I came home that night after Ritsuko tested you a few weeks back and found you two sleeping on the couch together and I couldn't help taking a picture. My best guess is you guys had fallen asleep while watching the TV" the older woman explained.  
"那晚在理津子几周前给你测试后，我回到家，发现你们俩一起睡在沙发上，我忍不住拍了张照片。我猜你们是在看电视时睡着了。" 年长的女性解释道。

"Oh, this was the night after Ritsuko tested us? Asuka, do you remember when you woke up with me on the couch the first time?" Shinji prompted.  
"哦，这是理津子测试我们的那晚之后吗？明日香，你还记得第一次和我一起在沙发上醒来是什么时候吗？" 真嗣提示道。

"First time?" Misato asked curiously.  
"第一次吗？" 美里好奇地问。

"Oh yeah! I remember now. Where's the blanket though?" the redhead asked, ignoring Misato's question.  
"哦，对了！我现在想起来了。不过，毯子在哪儿？" 红发女孩问道，忽略了美里的问题。

"Blanket?" he asked, confused. "I only wrapped us in a blanket the second time, which was the night before the angel attack by the way Misato"  
"毯子？" 他困惑地问。"我只在我们第二次的时候用毯子裹住我们，顺便说一下，那是在天使袭击的前一晚，美里。

"I see. As for the blanket, that would have been me" Misato said, jumping in, "After taking this photo, I put a blanket over you two before I left"  
"我明白了。至于那条毯子，应该是我盖的。" 美里插话说，"拍完这张照片后，我给你们俩盖上了毯子才离开的。"

"I don't remember any blanket though" Shinji commented, taking the photo for himself and peering at it closely.  
"我不记得有毯子啊。" 真嗣评论道，接过照片仔细端详。

"That's because I woke up first, I let it fall to the floor when I got up. I thought you had put it there actually, just like the second time" Asuka clarified.  
"那是因为我先醒的，我起床时让它掉到地上了。我还以为是你盖的呢，就像第二次那样。" 明日香解释道。

"So Misato, why did you think we had fallen asleep watching TV?" Shinji asked with a playful tone, "You didn't suspect something else?"  
"那么美里，你为什么认为我们在看电视时睡着了呢？" 真嗣带着调皮的语气问道，"你没有怀疑其他事情吗？"

"Something else?" Misato mused, "Well I didn't exactly fathom that you two had a relationship, besides the TV was on and the remote was next to your hand. Now about this something else…" Misato encouraged.  
"其他事情？" 美里若有所思，"嗯，我确实没想到你们俩有什么关系，毕竟电视开着，遥控器就在你手边。现在说说这个其他事情……" 美里鼓励道。

"The truth is that Asuka had passed out from 'exertion'," Shinji started. "I was too exhausted to put her to bed and so I just lay down on the couch with her" he finished.  
"事实是，明日香因为'劳累'而昏过去了，" 真嗣开始解释，"我太累了，没法把她抱到床上，所以就和她一起躺在沙发上了。" 他结束了叙述。

Asuka turned bright red at Shinji's admission, pushing Shinji's hand with the photo away. "Anyway! Thanks Misato" she said, quickly trying to change the subject.  
听到真嗣的坦白，明日香的脸瞬间涨得通红，推开了真嗣拿着照片的手。“总之！谢谢你，美里。”她急忙试图转移话题。

"It's nothing to be embarrassed about Asuka" Misato said, laughing.  
“这没什么好害羞的，明日香。”美里笑着说。

"Says you, you tramp!" Asuka refuted.  
“说得轻巧，你这个荡妇！”明日香反驳道。

"Hey! You're not innocent no more Asuka, you're the same" Misato countered.  
"嘿！你也不再是无辜的明日香，你跟我一样" 美里反驳道。

"Oh really? I didn't realise I had slept with over 50 men, Shinji is my _only_ boy toy" Asuka responded, smirking.  
"哦，真的吗？我可没意识到我和超过 50 个男人睡过，真嗣是我唯一的玩伴" 明日香回应道，嘴角带着一丝笑意。

This time, it was Misato's turn to blush. "Enough of this! Let's just go home" she said, moving off towards the elevator.  
这次轮到美里脸红了。"够了！我们回家吧" 她说着，朝电梯走去。

"Boy toy?" Shinji asked curiously.  
"男孩玩具？" 真嗣好奇地问道。

"I was joking relax" Asuka replied, "Though I would prefer you didn't tell Misato such embarrassing things"  
"我开玩笑的，放松点" 明日香回答，"不过我倒是希望你别跟美里说这些尴尬的事"

"It's only fair I get to tease you sometimes, you're still far in the lead" Shinji said grinning, "You didn't take it easy on Misato either"  
"偶尔我也得有机会逗逗你，你还是遥遥领先" 真嗣笑着说，"你对美里也没手下留情啊"

"Hmpf, she just can't handle the truth" she replied pompously.  
"哼，她就是接受不了真相。"她傲慢地回答道。

"And what about you, Miss I can't admit I love Shinji" he teased.  
"那你呢，自称无法承认爱着真嗣的 Miss 小姐？"他打趣道。

"Lay off! That's completely different" she spat angrily and stopped; Misato was probably in the elevator by now, heading to the car.  
"别说了！这完全不一样。"她愤怒地反驳，然后停了下来；美里现在可能已经在电梯里，正往车上去了。

The boy stopped in his tracks, taken aback by her response; he had been mostly joking after all. Feeling a little irritated at her response, he shot back, "How is it different exactly? Did you not want to admit feelings towards me? And weren't you also afraid to start a relationship?"  
男孩停下脚步，被她的回答惊到了；毕竟他大多是在开玩笑。对她的反应感到有些恼火，他反驳道，“到底有什么不同？你不想承认对我的感情吗？而且你不是也害怕开始一段关系吗？”

"Why are you such an asshole sometimes Shinji?! I can't believe you brought that up, I don't wanna talk about that now" Asuka refuted, sounding displeased.  
“你有时候怎么这么混蛋，真嗣？！真不敢相信你又提这事，我现在不想谈这个。”明日香反驳道，听起来很不高兴。

"I was just making a joke you bitch! And besides it doesn't seem like you ever want to talk about it" Shinji countered.  
“我只是开个玩笑，你这个泼妇！而且看起来你好像从来都不想谈这件事。”真嗣回击道。

"Have you lost your mind? You were gone for weeks, it's not like we've had many chances for that! Besides, it's not an easy thing to talk about" Asuka huffed.  
"你疯了吗？你消失了几个星期，我们哪有那么多机会谈这个！再说了，这也不是件容易开口的事。" 明日香气呼呼地说。

"You think my past is easy to talk about?" Shinji continued, the heat of the moment fueling his anger.  
"你觉得我的过去就容易谈吗？" 真嗣继续说道，情绪激动让他更加愤怒。

"Get fucked, you wouldn't understand-" Asuka started.  
"去你的，你根本不会懂——" 明日香开口道。

"How do you know?!" Shinji shouted, interrupting.  
"你怎么知道的？！" 真嗣大喊，打断了对话。

The redhead was a little startled at his response, surprised he was so worked up; in truth, it was probably as a result of no interaction with her for several weeks.  
红发女孩对他的反应有些惊讶，没想到他会如此激动；实际上，这可能是因为几周来都没有与她交流的结果。

"I mean, well-" Asuka started again, a little flustered.  
"我是说，嗯-" 明日香再次开口，有些慌乱。

"Exactly!" Shinji interrupted, "Do you think I don't have problems of my own? You can't just assume I wouldn't understand! What I do know is that I won't understand you completely unless I know what happened to you" he finished.  
"正是！" 真嗣打断道，"你以为我没有自己的问题吗？你不能就这样假设我不会理解！我所知道的是，除非我知道你经历了什么，否则我无法完全理解你" 他结束道。

Asuka's momentary lapse was over, her anger returning in full. "How can YOU just assume you would understand what I went through you jerk?!" she shouted.  
明日香短暂的失神结束了，她的怒火完全回归。"你怎么能假设你会理解我所经历的一切，你这个混蛋？！" 她喊道。

"Even so! I know for a fact it's not good to keep these things bottled up inside, don't you trust me?" Shinji replied, banging the wall with his free fist.  
"即便如此！我确信把这些事情憋在心里不好，你不信任我吗？" 真嗣回答，用空着的那只拳头捶打墙壁。

"Shut up! I am _not_ ready to tell you so get lost!" Asuka shouted back, clenching her fist.  
“闭嘴！我还没准备好告诉你，滚开！”明日香回喊道，紧握着拳头。

"You're just scared of what I might think of you after you tell me!" Shinji shot back.  
“你只是害怕告诉我之后我会怎么看你！”真嗣反驳道。

SLAP!

He stood there motionless, looking back at the girl who slapped him across the face, her hand still raised and her face looking dark.  
他站在那里一动不动，回望着那个扇了他一巴掌的女孩，她的手还举着，脸色阴沉。

"Here we go again, pushing everyone away. Why can't you just share all your feelings with someone?" Shinji finally responded.  
"又来了，总是把大家推开。为什么你就不能和某个人分享你所有的感受呢？" 真嗣终于回应道。

"And you're one to talk?! You who always ran away from all your problems! The 'great' Shinji always ran away!" the redhead rebutted.  
"你还敢说我？！你这个总是逃避所有问题的人！‘伟大的’真嗣总是逃跑！" 红发女孩反驳道。

"God damn it Asuka, I've moved past running away! Here I am confronting you right now, yet I see that you have not changed" he replied nastily.  
"该死的，明日香，我已经不再逃避了！我现在就在这里面对你，而你却一点都没变" 他恶狠狠地回答。

He instantly regretted those words as he saw the hurt look on Asuka's face before she put on her mask of anger once again. Opening her mouth, she couldn't find any words to retort with and so she instead turned around and ran to the elevator.  
他立刻后悔了这些话，因为看到明日香脸上受伤的表情，随后她又戴上了愤怒的面具。她张开嘴，却找不到任何反驳的话，于是她转身跑向电梯。

Shinji swore at himself, before kicking the wall. The pain of the fight stung him deeply; why had he gotten so worked up, it shouldn't have been a big deal.  
真嗣咒骂着自己，然后踢了一脚墙。战斗的痛苦深深刺痛了他；为什么他会如此激动，这本不该是什么大事。

Looking down at his hand, he saw the photo of them peacefully sleeping on the couch together, softening his heart. "I shouldn't have been so hard on her" he said to himself, feeling a bit calmer.  
低头看着手中的照片，是他们一起在沙发上平静入睡的画面，这让他的心软了下来。“我不该对她那么严厉”，他自言自语道，感觉稍微平静了一些。

Remembering she had run off, he pocketed the photo in his shirt and sped off after her, hoping to catch up before she got to Misato. Shinji soon saw her entering the elevator and hitting the close door button. _'Crap'_ he thought and increased his pace, trying to make it before the doors closed. Unfortunately, the doors closed a mere second before he got there, causing him to slam into the elevator doors, with both arms out front. _'Damn it!'_ he thought, before taking the other elevator to begin his ascent to the car pool. After arriving at the right level, Shinji made his way to Misato's car and noticed Asuka already inside. As Misato saw the boy, she began waving to him.  
想起她已经跑开了，他便将照片塞进衬衫口袋，加速追了上去，希望能赶在她到达美里之前追上。很快，真嗣看到她走进电梯并按下了关门按钮。'糟糕'，他想，并加快了脚步，试图在门关闭之前赶到。不幸的是，门在他到达前一秒关闭了，导致他撞上了电梯门，双臂前伸。'该死！'他想，然后乘坐另一部电梯开始上升到停车场。到达正确的楼层后，真嗣走向美里的车，注意到明日香已经在里面了。美里看到男孩，开始向他挥手。

"There are you Shinji! Come on, get in" Misato called out.  
“你来了，真嗣！快点，上车”美里喊道。

Shinji was soon at the car and saw Asuka sitting in the front seat, avoiding his gaze. Seeing this, he got into the back seat and buckled himself in. Misato took the car up the car elevator and then exited NERV. The older woman noticed the two eva pilots were completely silent and she was a little worried.  
真嗣很快来到车旁，看到明日香坐在前排座位上，避开他的目光。见此情景，他坐进后座并系好安全带。美里将车开上电梯，然后驶出 NERV。这位年长的女性注意到两位 eva 驾驶员完全沉默，她有些担心。

"Hey guys, is everything alright? Why the eerie silence?" Misato asked with concern. Neither of them answered her.  
“嘿，大家，一切都还好吗？怎么这么诡异的安静？”美里担忧地问道。他们俩都没有回答她。

Their guardian decided she wouldn't push for now and stayed silent after that. The drive ended up being a long silent one. _'Something is definitely wrong here'_ she thought to herself. After parking the car, they all got out. The Major soon noticed that Asuka was avoiding Shinji. After getting in the elevator and getting to their door, they all their residence. Just as they entered, Asuka immediately went straight to her room, causing Shinji to sigh. _'What could be wrong? They were fine just before I left for the elevator…'_ Misato thought to herself.  
他们的监护人决定暂时不再追问，之后便保持沉默。这次驾车变成了一段漫长的沉默之旅。“这里肯定有什么不对劲”她暗自思忖。停好车后，他们都下了车。美里很快注意到明日香在避开真嗣。进入电梯并到达门口后，他们都回到了住处。一进门，明日香立刻直奔自己的房间，这让真嗣叹了口气。“到底出了什么问题？我离开去电梯前他们还好好的……”美里暗自思索。

Shinji was feeling a lot calmer now and had thought over the fight they had. His contemplation had brought him to the conclusion that he was in the wrong with pushing her so much. Thinking that some food might give them an opportunity to converse again, he began making dinner; it was also good to take his mind off the incident temporarily. The boy just hoped the redhead would cool down so he could talk to her calmly.  
真嗣现在感觉平静了许多，并仔细思考了他们之间的争执。他的沉思让他得出了结论，自己确实在逼迫她方面做得过分了。想到一些食物或许能给他们一个重新交谈的机会，他开始准备晚餐；这也是暂时让自己从那件事中抽离的好方法。男孩只希望红发女孩能冷静下来，这样他就可以平静地和她谈谈了。

The purple haired woman noticed Shinji making dinner and came over. "Hey Shinji, is everything alright between you two?" she asked, concerned.  
紫发女子注意到真嗣在做晚饭，便走了过来。“嘿，真嗣，你们俩没事吧？”她关切地问。

"It's ok, we just had a fight. It was my fault though, I was too forceful" Shinji answered, sighing.  
“没事，我们只是吵了一架。不过，是我的错，我太强硬了。”真嗣叹息着回答。

"We always regret things we say in the heat of the moment but don't worry, she's a strong girl. Why don't you make those waffles again? They'll probably cheer her up" Misato suggested.  
“我们总是在冲动时说出后悔的话，但别担心，她是个坚强的女孩。不如你再做那些华夫饼吧？它们可能会让她开心起来。”美里建议道。

Shinji blushed furiously as he remembered the waffles his guardian had eaten in ignorance. "That won't be possible Misato, I… err… don't have the 'ingredients' to make them again" he responded.  
真嗣想起他的监护人无知地吃掉的那些华夫饼，脸红得厉害。“那不可能，美里，我……呃……没有再做它们的‘材料’了。”他回答道。

"Oh don't be silly! If we've run out, I'll give you money to buy some" Misato replied earnestly.  
“哦，别傻了！如果用完了，我会给你钱去买一些。”美里真诚地回答。

"You can't buy those ingredients!" Shinji refuted, not wanting to continue this conversation.  
“那些材料是买不到的！”真嗣反驳道，不想继续这个话题。

Unfortunately, Misato was clearly not getting it. "What are you talking about? What did you put in those waffles?" she asked, dumbfounded.  
遗憾的是，美里显然没明白。“你在说什么？你在那些华夫饼里放了什么？”她问，一脸茫然。

"You weren't supposed to eat them alright" he replied, avoiding the question.  
“你本来就不该吃它们，好吧”他回答，避而不答。

Misato was suspicious now and wouldn't let it go. "Shinji, you better answer me" she said firmly.  
美里现在起了疑心，不肯罢休。“真嗣，你最好给我个答案”她坚定地说。

"Well, I um…" he started.  
"嗯，我，呃……" 他开口道。

"Yes?" she prompted. "然后呢？" 她追问。

Shinji sighed and looked up at her. "I put Asuka and I's sexual secretions in it" he blurted out.  
真嗣叹了口气，抬头看着她。"我把明日香和我的体液放了进去" 他脱口而出。

Misato just looked at him shocked, unable to believe her ears.  
美里只是震惊地看着他，无法相信自己的耳朵。

"Wait what?!" Misato said, horrified. "Please tell me you're joking"  
"等等，什么？！" 美里惊恐地说，"请告诉我你在开玩笑"

"Unfortunately, I'm not" he replied.  
"遗憾的是，我并没有开玩笑" 他回答道。

The older woman's face paled and she looked like she was going to be sick. "I thought there was something odd about them that time… that is so gross" she said, looking at him with disgust.  
年长女性的脸色变得苍白，看起来快要吐了。“我当时就觉得他们有些不对劲……真是太恶心了。”她带着厌恶的表情看着他说。

"You weren't meant to have them!" Shinji quickly declared. "And I didn't want to tell you afterwards… for obvious reasons"  
“你本不该吃那些东西的！”真嗣迅速声明道，“而且我本来也不想事后告诉你……出于显而易见的原因。”

Misato just took a deep breath, not wanting to think about the fact she had ingested her ward's sex fluids. "Look, please just tell me next time if I shouldn't eat something ok? Call Asuka in when you finish dinner" she requested before walking back to the dinner table.  
美里只是深吸了一口气，不想去想自己竟然摄入了她的监护人的性液。“听着，下次如果有什么我不该吃的，请提前告诉我好吗？吃完饭叫明日香过来。”她请求道，然后走回了餐桌。

Pretty soon, Shinji had finished making dinner and he went to prepare the table. "Asuka, dinner's ready!" he called out when everything was set, both he and Misato were already seated.  
不久，真嗣就做好了晚饭，他去准备餐桌。“明日香，晚饭好了！”一切就绪时他喊道，他和美里已经就座。

A moment later they heard some shuffling, followed by Asuka's door opening and the girl coming out, Shinji noticed the redhead had changed clothes. Asuka sat down at the table next to Misato without saying a word nor looking at either of them.  
片刻后，他们听到了一些响动，接着是明日香的房门打开，女孩走了出来，真嗣注意到红发女孩换了衣服。明日香一言不发，也不看他们俩，就在美里旁边坐下。

"Let's eat" Misato said aloud.  
“我们开动吧”美里大声说道。

At once, the young girl began eating, not a single sound coming from her other than from the cutlery she was using. Shinji and Misato followed suit and began to dig into their meal, the redhead's mood a real dampener on the atmosphere; both of them struggled to think of a way to initiate a conversation. They stalled for too long though as Asuka finished promptly, stood up, put her plate in the sink and walked straight back to her room, closing the door behind her.  
那年轻的女孩立刻开始用餐，除了餐具的声音外，她没有发出任何声响。真嗣和美里也跟着开始享用他们的餐点，红发女孩的情绪确实让气氛变得沉闷；两人都努力寻找开启对话的方式。然而，他们拖延得太久了，因为明日香迅速吃完，站起来，把盘子放进水槽，然后径直走回她的房间，关上了门。

"Well, that went well" Shinji muttered, "She might as well have not even been here"  
“好吧，那顿饭吃得真好。”真嗣低声嘀咕，“她还不如根本没在这儿。”

Misato went over to Shinji and gave him a big bear hug. "Don't take it to heart, you know Asuka, she's quite stubborn"  
美里走到真嗣身边，给了他一个大大的拥抱。“别放在心上，你知道明日香的，她很固执。”

"Don't I know it" he replied.  
"我当然知道" 他回答道。

The woman then kissed Shinji on the forehead. "You know I love you both, I want to see you both happy. I think you should go talk to her, no arguing, perhaps tell her what you're thinking, maybe that's all she needs. Besides, she's probably calmed down a bit now" she advised.  
那女人随后在真嗣的额头上亲了一下。"你知道我深爱着你们俩，我希望你们都能幸福。我觉得你应该去找她谈谈，不要争吵，或许告诉她你的想法，也许这就是她所需要的。而且，她现在可能已经冷静一些了" 她建议道。

"Thanks Misato, wish me luck" he said with a smile.  
"谢谢你，美里，祝我好运" 他微笑着说。

"Good luck!" Misato replied.  
"祝你好运！" 美里回答道。

At this, Shinji first went to his room to change out of his school uniform, throwing it into his pile of dirty clothes. With his new resolve, he went over to her door and knocked. Misato had already retired to her room; the silence was deafening.  
于是，真嗣首先回到自己的房间，换下校服，扔进了脏衣服堆。带着新的决心，他走到她的门前敲了敲。美里已经回到自己的房间；四周的寂静震耳欲聋。

"Asuka?" Shinji called through the door.  
"明日香？" 真嗣隔着门喊道。

No response. 没有回应。

"I'm coming in" he announced, before opening the door and entering her room. Shinji noticed her lying down on her back on the bed, before closing the door behind him.  
"我要进来了" 他宣布道，随即打开门走进她的房间。真嗣注意到她仰面躺在床上，然后在他身后关上了门。

"I know you hate it when I say sorry, but after reflecting on the fight we had, I was definitely in the wrong. I insulted you, but more importantly I shouldn't have pushed you to talk about something sensitive like your past, especially out of anger" Shinji admitted.  
"我知道你不喜欢听我说对不起，但经过对我们争吵的反思，我确实错了。我侮辱了你，但更重要的是，我不该在愤怒中逼你谈论像过去那样敏感的话题" 真嗣承认道。

Despite Asuka usually hating his apologies, she appreciated a genuine apology, lightening her mood a bit. However, she still didn't say anything and just stared at him blankly.  
尽管明日香通常讨厌他的道歉，但她对真诚的道歉还是有所感激，这让她的心情稍微轻松了一些。然而，她依旧一言不发，只是茫然地盯着他。

"Look Asuka, I know you're being stubborn" he said, sighing, "But even so, I would like some sort of response. I won't judge you"  
“听着，明日香，我知道你在固执”他叹了口气说，“但即便如此，我还是希望你能有所回应。我不会评判你。”

No response. 没有回应。

Remembering Misato's suggestion, he figured it wouldn't hurt to try. "You know what, I'm going to wait here for you, I'm not gonna give up. While I'm waiting, I'll tell you my story, I'll tell you about my past. Maybe it's similar to what happened to you" he declared.  
想起美里小姐的建议，他觉得试试也无妨。“你知道吗，我打算在这里等你，我不会放弃的。在等待的时候，我会告诉你我的故事，我会告诉你我的过去。也许它和你经历的有些相似。”他坚定地说道。

Shinji noticed her lift her head up a bit to listen; seems she wasn't ignoring him.  
真嗣注意到她微微抬起头来倾听；看来她并没有无视他。

"Back when I was very young, probably three or four, my mother and father were working on project Eva. I barely remember that time, it was so long ago, back when my father actually cared about me" he started, his voice wavering a little. "My mother was used as the test subject for Unit-01… my eva. But something horrible happened in the experiment and she vanished. As a young child I watched my mother disappear right in front of my eyes and I never saw her again, I can't even remember her face" he continued, his eyes watering.  
“在我很小的时候，大概三四岁吧，我的父母正在参与 Eva 项目。我对那段时间几乎没什么记忆，太久远了，那时我父亲还真的关心我。”他开始讲述，声音有些颤抖。“我母亲被用作 01 号机——我的 Eva 的试验对象……但实验中发生了可怕的事情，她消失了。作为一个孩子，我亲眼看着母亲在我面前消失，从此再也没有见过她，我甚至记不清她的脸。”他继续说着，眼中泛起了泪光。

"To make it worse, that's when my father abandoned me, discarded me as if I was trash. He left me with some professor who didn't really like me anyway. Years later, one day I get called by my father to come to Tokyo-3 only to be let down as I realised he just wanted to use me to pilot Unit-01. In the end after all that time, my father still just saw me as another pawn. That was one of the reasons why I got so angry when you said I was like my father, I would never do what he did…" the boy explained, sitting down on the bed next to Asuka.  
"更糟糕的是，就在那时，我父亲抛弃了我，把我像垃圾一样丢弃。他把我留给了一个本来就不怎么喜欢我的教授。多年后，有一天我被父亲叫到第三新东京市，结果却发现他只是想利用我驾驶初号机。到最后，经过那么长时间，我父亲仍然只把我当作另一枚棋子。这就是为什么当你说我像我父亲时，我会那么生气，我绝不会做他所做的那些事……" 男孩解释道，坐在 Asuka 旁边的床上。

Shinji took the girl's hand, wanting some comfort, grateful she didn't pull away. "Anyway Asuka, because of my past… I didn't want to expose my heart to anyone, I was afraid of getting hurt like that again. So… every time I was faced with something too hard to deal with, I just ran away from it – it was how I coped. But because of you Asuka, I now realise running doesn't solve anything and by being all alone you sacrifice your happiness" he finished, squeezing the girl's hand.  
"Shinji 握住女孩的手，渴望得到一些安慰，庆幸她没有抽开。"不管怎样，Asuka，因为我的过去……我不想向任何人敞开心扉，我害怕再次受到伤害。所以……每次面对难以处理的事情时，我只会逃避——这就是我应对的方式。但因为你，Asuka，我现在意识到逃避解决不了任何问题，独自一人只会牺牲你的幸福" 他结束时，紧握着女孩的手。

After Shinji went silent, he sat there for a few minutes, waiting for the girl to respond. Trying one last approach, he got onto the bed next to her and began to move his mouth down to kiss her, hoping it would break her out of her silence. As he was just about to touch her lips he stopped, it seemed like she wasn't going to respond and so began to pull away.  
在真嗣沉默之后，他坐在那里几分钟，等待女孩的回应。尝试最后一次接近，他爬上床靠近她，开始将嘴移向她的唇，希望能打破她的沉默。就在他即将触碰到她的唇时，他停了下来，似乎她不会回应，于是开始退缩。

"Wait" Asuka whispered, it was so quiet he almost thought he hadn't heard it.  
“等等”明日香轻声说，声音如此之小，他几乎以为自己没听到。

The redhead brought one arm around his neck and brought his face down to hers and they shared a gentle kiss.  
红发女孩用一只手臂环住他的脖子，将他的脸拉近，他们共享了一个温柔的吻。

"Don't go" the redhead pleaded after parting.  
"别走" 红发女孩在分别后恳求道。

Shinji's heart melted completely at her response and he picked her up and held her in his arms. He then stroked her hair and kissed her softly on her forehead, he could feel her whole body relaxing.  
真嗣的心完全被她的回应融化了，他抱起她，紧紧拥在怀里。他轻抚她的头发，温柔地吻了吻她的额头，能感觉到她的整个身体都放松了下来。

"I'm so sorry for what happened to you Shinji, I didn't know at all… so many awful things I've said to you all this time" she started. "Also, I said some nasty things to you in that fight, I'm grateful for your apology so let's just call it even"  
"真嗣，对于发生在你身上的事，我真的很抱歉，我完全不知情……这段时间我对你说了那么多难听的话" 她开始说道。"还有，在那场战斗中，我也对你说了些刻薄的话，我很感激你的道歉，我们就此扯平吧"

"Of course, all is forgiven Asuka" he replied, giving her another kiss on the lips, this time with more strength.  
“当然，一切都原谅你了，明日香。”他回答道，再次吻上她的唇，这次更加用力。

The redhead brought her hand up to his cheek to caress it while they kissed deeply; she now felt more at peace. The two of them parted and gazed at each other tenderly.  
红发女孩抬起手，抚摸着他的脸颊，两人深情拥吻；她现在感到更加平静。他们分开，温柔地凝视着对方。

"Listen Shinji…" Asuka spoke up, "I should tell you about myself too"  
“听着，真嗣……”明日香开口道，“我也应该告诉你一些关于我自己的事。”

"It's ok Asuka, if you're not ready you can tell me another time" Shinji replied.  
“没事的，绫波，如果你还没准备好，可以改天再告诉我。”真嗣回答道。

"No, it's ok… after hearing your story, it's only fair" she conceded. Asuka sighed before starting, "When I was very young, my mother was also working on the Eva project. My mother used to play with me often back then, but as she started working more on project Eva I barely saw her" she began. "Then an accident happened when my mother was used as a test subject for Unit-02; she came back different. She had gone insane and to make it worse she totally ignored me. My mother… had this doll with red hair and she would act as if it was me" she continued, her breathing quickening; it had been a while since she had thought about all this, locked away in her mind.  
“不，没关系……听了你的故事，我也该公平些。”她让步道。明日香叹了口气，开始讲述：“我很小的时候，我母亲也参与了 Eva 项目。那时她经常陪我玩，但随着她对 Eva 项目的投入越来越多，我几乎见不到她了。”她接着说，“后来，母亲作为二号机的试验对象发生了事故；她回来后变得不一样了。她疯了，更糟糕的是，她完全忽视了我。我母亲……有一个红头发的娃娃，她会把它当作我。”她的呼吸加快了；这些记忆在她心中尘封已久，如今再次被提起。

"I was a small child; I didn't understand why my mother wasn't paying attention to me. Later on one day, I was picked to be the second child and pilot of Unit-02. I was so happy that I ran home, thinking my mum would finally take notice of me now that I had become a pilot. But… but I came home only to find…" she said trailing off, her voice a little raspy. Asuka promptly cleared her throat and held Shinji's hand. "I found my mother hanging from the ceiling dead… and the doll in her hand had its head ripped off…" she finished off, her eyes watering; it was such an awful memory.  
"那时我还小，不明白为什么妈妈不关注我。后来有一天，我被选中成为二号机的驾驶员，我高兴极了，以为妈妈终于会注意到我了。但是…我回到家，却发现…" 她声音有些沙哑，停顿了一下。明日香清了清喉咙，握住了真嗣的手。"我发现妈妈吊在天花板上，已经去世了…她手里的娃娃头也被扯掉了…" 她哽咽着说完，眼中泛起了泪光；那是一段极其痛苦的记忆。

At this, Shinji held Asuka tight, comforting her as she recalled her tragic past.  
听到这里，真嗣紧紧抱住明日香，安慰着她回忆起那段悲惨的过去。

"After that… I made a promise to myself never to rely on anyone, and never to cry again. My father remarried and neither of them could stand me anymore and I soon grew distant from them. That's why I became so adult-like when I'm just a teenager, that's why I hate dolls, that's why I despise being weak, that's why I hate crying and that's why it was so hard for me to accept this relationship. I couldn't take the pain of someone leaving me again" she said, wiping her eyes dry.  
"从那以后…我发誓再也不依赖任何人，再也不哭泣。父亲再婚了，他们俩都无法忍受我，我渐渐与他们疏远。这就是为什么我作为一个青少年却显得如此成熟，这就是为什么我讨厌娃娃，这就是为什么我鄙视软弱，这就是为什么我讨厌哭泣，这就是为什么我很难接受这段关系。我无法承受再次被人抛弃的痛苦" 她擦干眼泪说道。

"Asuka…" Shinji let out sympathetically; her past had been so much worse than he thought, no child should have to see her mother kill herself, on top of being ignored completely.  
“明日香……” 真嗣同情地叹道；她的过去比他所想的还要糟糕得多，没有哪个孩子应该目睹自己的母亲自杀，更不用说完全被忽视了。

"Anyway you bastard, even though I promised I would never cry, you made me break that promise when we fought just before the last angel fight… my mind had finally registered the betrayal and pain I felt from your… actions… but after all that's happened, perhaps sometimes it's ok" she remarked.  
“无论如何，你这个混蛋，尽管我曾发誓永远不会哭泣，但在与最后一个使徒战斗前的那场战斗中，你让我违背了誓言……我的内心终于感受到了由你的……行为所带来的背叛和痛苦……但经历了这一切之后，或许有时候哭泣也是可以的。”她评论道。

"Betrayal…" Shinji repeated, she hadn't referred to it that way to him before. "Indeed, that night was a betrayal of your _and_ Misato's trust, betrayal as a roommate, a comrade, a coworker, a friend… God damn, you had already suffered enough" he said, angry at himself for what he did to her.  
“背叛……” 真嗣重复道，她之前从未这样对他说过。“确实，那一夜是对你和美里信任的背叛，作为室友、战友、同事、朋友的背叛……该死，你已经承受了太多。”他对自己所做的一切感到愤怒。

Tears started flowing from the boy, after sharing his story and hearing hers, he couldn't help but be overcome with emotion. "About your past… I am so sorry you had to go through that… I promise you Asuka, I will never leave you" he said resolutely. "Urghh, and to think I added such a horrible experience on top of it all too, I was an asshole to try to force you talk about this!"  
泪水开始从男孩的脸颊滑落，在分享了他的故事并听完她的之后，他情不自禁地被情感淹没。“关于你的过去……我真的很抱歉你经历了那些……我向你保证，明日香，我永远不会离开你。”他坚定地说道。“呃，想想我还在这之上加上了这么糟糕的经历，我真是混蛋，竟然试图强迫你谈论这些！”

"Yeah, you were" Asuka said, her voice a little hoarse from all the emotion, "But it's fine, I feel better after having finally told you it all"  
“是啊，你确实很过分。”明日香说道，她的声音因情绪激动而有些沙哑，“但没关系，终于把这些都告诉你之后，我感觉好多了。”

Shinji couldn't stop crying as he took a deep breath, trying to calm down a little. "Listen Asuka… if you need to, just go ahead and cry… about all the ridiculous injustice, the suffering you had to experience, about the pain you had to go through, about what I did to you, about the angel's assault on you… just let it out" he said, stroking her hair.  
真嗣无法停止哭泣，他深吸一口气，试图稍微平静下来。“听着，明日香……如果你需要，就尽管哭出来吧……关于那些荒谬的不公，你所经历的苦难，你所承受的痛苦，关于我对你所做的一切，关于天使对你的袭击……就让它发泄出来吧。”他说着，轻抚她的头发。

"B-but…" Asuka croaked, her eyes watering again, "I-I've a-already cried over that night baka. And… you suffered too, your past, all my abuse to you and… having to watch the angel assault me" she said, her voice breaking.  
"但…" 明日香嘶哑地说道，泪水再次涌上眼眶，"我…我已经为那个夜晚哭过了，笨蛋。而且…你也受了很多苦，你的过去，我对你所有的伤害，还有…不得不看着那个天使袭击我" 她哽咽着说。

"You don't have to hold back… you can cry for my sake too… I know that I'm crying for you" he replied, rubbing the girl's back soothingly.  
"你不必压抑自己…你也可以为我哭…我知道我在为你哭泣" 他回答道，温柔地抚摸着女孩的背。

"I-I c-can't" she retorted, fighting back the urge; it was what she had done all her life.  
"我…我做不到" 她反驳道，努力抑制住这种冲动；这是她一生都在做的事情。

"It's ok Asuka! It's not your fault! This doesn't mean you're weak, no! This just means you're human… that you were hurt by these unreasonable things and still got through it… you are so incredible. We both somehow made it all this way… just let it out" he entreated, tears pouring out.  
"没事的，明日香！这不是你的错！这并不意味着你软弱，不！这只是意味着你是人……你被这些不合理的事情伤害了，却依然挺了过来……你真是太了不起了。我们俩不知怎么地都走到了今天……就让它发泄出来吧" 他恳求道，泪水涌出。

At this, the dam broke and Asuka started sobbing, clutching onto the boy tightly as she wept. "It was so hard" Asuka let out, tears streaming down her face. All her bottled-up emotions, from the past to the present, coming out in a torrent. "Shinji, it was so hard, I just wanted mama to notice me"  
听到这话，堤坝崩溃了，明日香开始抽泣，紧紧抓住男孩哭泣。"太难了" 明日香哭诉道，泪水顺着脸颊流下。她所有压抑的情感，从过去到现在，如洪水般倾泻而出。"真嗣，太难了，我只是想让妈妈注意到我"

Shinji pulled her close, holding her tightly. "I know… it's ok now" he comforted.  
真嗣紧紧抱住她，安慰道："我知道……现在没事了" 他安慰道。

"I-I was in s-so much pain Shinji, the humiliation from losing to you… the pain after you _raped_ me" she let out, her voice so raspy; the first time she had used the word since the angel fight. "The pain from the angel's assault, it all hurt so much Shinji" she said bawling; truly Shinji could finally see how vulnerable the girl was, how much damage she had been done.  
“我-我那时痛得要命，真嗣，输给你的屈辱…你强暴我后的痛苦”她哽咽着说，声音沙哑；这是自与使徒战斗后她第一次使用这个词。“使徒攻击带来的痛苦，这一切都让我痛不欲生，真嗣”她泣不成声；真嗣终于真切地看到了女孩的脆弱，她所承受的伤害有多深重。

"You experienced all that pain so unjustly" Shinji responded, kissing her head, "I know you hurt so much, that I hurt you so much… but you got through it Asuka and I love you… it's ok now… somehow it's all ok now" he reassured, his tears slowing down.  
“你承受了那么多不公的痛苦”真嗣回应道，亲吻着她的额头，“我知道你受了那么多苦，我伤害了你那么多…但你挺过来了，明日香，我爱你…现在一切都好了…不知怎么的，现在一切都好了”他安慰道，泪水渐渐止住。

The boy lifted her chin and faced her, bringing his lips to hers and kissing her deeply. The redhead returned his kiss tenderly, clutching onto to him as if her life depended on it.  
男孩抬起她的下巴，与她对视，将唇贴近她的，深深地吻了她。红发女孩温柔地回应着他的吻，紧紧抓住他，仿佛她的生命全然寄托于此。

The two of them parted and looked at each other, eyes red from their tears. "I love you too" Asuka said softly, her voice husky, her breathing laboured.  
两人分开，彼此对视，眼中泪光闪烁。“我也爱你。”明日香轻声说道，声音沙哑，呼吸急促。

Shinji just embraced her affectionately in response, holding her as if he was protecting her, while she buried her face into his chest, her arms holding onto him. The two eva pilots stayed like that in silence, grateful for finally getting it all off their minds. They were both quite exhausted and found their eyes slowly closing before they both drifted off to sleep, Asuka still in Shinji's arms as he slid down onto his back.  
真嗣只是温柔地拥抱着她，仿佛在保护她，而她将脸埋在他的胸前，双臂紧紧环抱着他。两位 EVA 驾驶员就这样静静地待着，庆幸终于将心中的重担卸下。两人都疲惫不堪，眼皮渐渐沉重，最终在彼此的怀抱中沉沉睡去，明日香依然依偎在真嗣的臂弯里，他则慢慢躺倒，背部着地。

Misato had been waiting in her room, wanting her two wards to sort things out between them. It had been a while since she had heard Shinji go into Asuka's room, and she could hear there had been some discussions between them but they were too quiet to really tell what was going on. At least it was a good sign that there was no screaming or shouting, they must be working things out. The Major found it impossible to fall asleep without knowing how Shinji and Asuka were doing, she was just too anxious.  
美里一直在自己的房间里等待，希望她的两个孩子能解决彼此之间的问题。自从她听到真嗣进入明日香的房间已经有一段时间了，虽然能听到他们之间有些交谈，但声音太轻，无法得知具体发生了什么。至少没有尖叫或争吵，这是个好迹象，他们一定在努力解决问题。美里发现自己无法入睡，除非知道真嗣和明日香的情况，她实在是太焦虑了。

The woman got up and figured she might as well turn the lights off. She doubted they were going to be done anytime soon or if Shinji was even going to leave the room. As she exited her room and walked past Asuka's room, she heard absolutely nothing; it was completely silent. Just to be sure, Misato pressed her face up against the door and still heard nothing. Curiosity got the better of her and she decided to quietly open the door to look inside, careful not to shine too much light into the room.  
女人起身，心想不如顺手把灯关了。她怀疑他们不会很快结束，或者真嗣是否还会离开房间。当她走出自己的房间，经过明日香的房间时，她听到了绝对的寂静；完全无声。为了确认，美里将脸贴在门上，仍然听不到任何声音。好奇心驱使她决定悄悄打开门向里看，小心不要让太多光线照进房间。

The Major poked her head through the door, suddenly hearing the sound of soft breathing and realised that the two of them were asleep. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness of their room, she saw them sleeping together, with Asuka in Shinji's arms, a peaceful look on their faces and Misato couldn't help smiling.  
少校探头进门，突然听到轻微的呼吸声，意识到两人已经睡着了。当她的眼睛适应了房间的黑暗，她看到他们依偎在一起，明日香在真嗣的怀里，脸上带着平和的表情，美里不禁微笑起来。

"I finally gave some good advice" she whispered happily.  
“我终于给了一些好建议”她开心地低声说道。

At that, she closed the door, turned off the lights and returned to her room, easily falling asleep now.  
说完，她关上门，熄了灯，回到自己的房间，现在很容易就睡着了。

End Notes: What a LOONNGG chapter. After rewriting it and adding some new content, it became 26000 words, basically two chapters (according to my story's average) long. That last part was some good heart to heart too :D, well at least I thought so, I definitely felt sympathy for them after writing that. And… I made Misato find out about the waffles :P. This is _by far_ my longest chapter so far. I doubt any other chapters will reach this length (it's _too_ long to be honest).  
尾注：这一章真是太长了。经过重写并添加了一些新内容后，它变成了 26000 字，基本上相当于我故事中的两章长度。最后那部分也是一次深入的交流，至少我是这么认为的，写完后我确实对他们产生了同情。而且……我让美里发现了华夫饼的事 :P。到目前为止，这是我写过的最长的一章。我怀疑其他章节能否达到这个长度（说实话，确实太长了）。

Author's Notes: It's interesting to look back on the original author's notes to see what I was doing back then and the conversation with Darknemo (and other readers). I think I got better at adding description in the story (the previous rewrites should show as much?) and I actually agree of course that I was rushing these chapters out too fast. In any case, this chapter is the beginning of another major turning point.  
作者注：回顾一下最初的作者注很有趣，可以看到我当时在做什么，以及与 Darknemo（和其他读者）的对话。我认为我在故事中添加描述方面做得更好（之前的重写应该能说明这一点？），当然，我确实同意我当时把这些章节写得太快了。无论如何，本章是另一个重大转折点的开始。

Original notes: 最初的注释：

_I'm SO SORRY for taking so long to update this time, usually I do it much quicker but several factors hindered this. First of all I had to reformat my dad's comp and reinstall windows and all his programs then place all his files back into place etc. Then I had a test today so I didn't have any time to do this story and lastly because I was trying to make this story more 'detailed.' I update so fast because I write it out pretty quickly without writing much description, but I sacrifice solid writing as Darknemo puts it. I decided to attempt to put more description, as I like to please all my fans, and so anyway if you dislike the extra detail throw stones at him :D. I'm pretty sure I failed horribly at it anyway oh well I tried. Anyways all those in fear of Asuka becoming lovey-dovey have no fear, she only has her occasional soft moments so do not worry. I don't know what your obsession with the waffles are but I mentioned them in this chapter due to popular demand :P. Regardless this chapter is the beginning to another major turning point in the story. And actually now that I think about it I don't think I make any or hardly any spelling or grammatical mistakes in my chapters, and considering how fast I write them plus I don't have any pre-readers or editors isn't that at least one good thing Darknemo?  
这次更新花了我这么长时间，我深表歉意，通常我更新得快多了，但有几个因素阻碍了我。首先，我不得不重新格式化我爸爸的电脑，重新安装 Windows 和他所有的程序，然后把他的所有文件放回原处等等。然后我今天有考试，所以我没有时间写这个故事，最后是因为我试图让这个故事更“详细”。我更新得这么快，是因为我写得很快，没有写很多描述，但我牺牲了扎实的写作，就像 Darknemo 所说的。我决定尝试添加更多描述，因为我想取悦我的所有粉丝，所以无论如何，如果你不喜欢额外的细节，就朝他扔石头吧：D。无论如何，我敢肯定我在这方面做得非常糟糕，但我还是尝试了。无论如何，所有害怕明日香变得爱意绵绵的人都不用害怕，她只是偶尔有温柔的时刻，所以不用担心。我不知道你对华夫饼的痴迷是什么，但我在这章中提到了它们，因为这是大众要求：P。无论如何，本章是故事中另一个重大转折点的开始。 实际上现在我想想，我不认为我在章节中犯过任何拼写或语法错误，而且考虑到我写得有多快，加上我没有预先阅读者或编辑，这至少算一件好事，对吧 Darknemo？_

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 9 (First rewrite).  
注意，这是重写的第 9 章（第一次重写）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
"重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，则表示您正在阅读故事的最新版本。如果您在上一章中没有看到此注释，那么您很不幸地在我在更新所有章节之前就开始阅读此内容。建议您重新阅读前几章，因为故事的某些细节以及格式都会发生变化，这会导致在进一步阅读时产生一些困惑。**_

### Chapter 9: The Truth 

Shinji woke up, opening his eyes slowly as they felt a little bleary and sensitive. His arms were wrapped around something on this chest, something warm. Looking down, his eyes felt a little raw and he noticed a ball of red hair on his chest. The boy soon remembered the events of last night that led him to fall asleep with Asuka snuggled up to his chest in her bed and felt his eyes go a little prickly; it had been quite emotionally exhausting. Shinji looked down at the girl appreciatively, her red hair glistening in the morning sun, her head resting on its side. It was completely quiet in the room save for Asuka's soft breathing and a sense of tranquility filled the area. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the blinds on the window, creating a mosaic of light and dark patches across the room. He felt the soft beating of her heart against his chest and he found himself enjoying the peaceful moment. The girl's arms were wrapped around him tightly, keeping him in a blanket of warmth.  
"真嗣醒来，缓缓睁开眼睛，感觉有些模糊和敏感。他的手臂环绕着胸前的东西，那东西很温暖。低头一看，他的眼睛有些生涩，他注意到胸前有一团红发。男孩很快想起了昨晚的事件，导致他与依偎在他胸前的明日香在她的床上睡着，并感到眼睛有些刺痛；这在情感上非常令人疲惫。真嗣感激地低头看着女孩，她的红发在早晨的阳光下闪闪发光，她的头侧靠着。房间里除了明日香轻柔的呼吸声外，一片寂静，一种宁静感充满了整个区域。阳光穿过窗户上的百叶窗，在房间里形成了一片明暗相间的马赛克。他感觉到她心脏在他胸前的轻柔跳动，他发现自己享受着这片刻的宁静。女孩的手臂紧紧地环绕着他，让他置身于温暖的毯子里。

Shinji reached down to her face, stroked her cheek and traced her lips, enjoying the subtle expressions her face made as he gave her affection. He then held her forehead and kissed her on the head smiling, before feeling nature's call. Reluctantly, he attempted to pry Asuka off him but it only caused her to hold onto him tighter. Not wanting to disturb her peaceful slumber, the boy slowly sat up and moved his legs off the bed. He then moved his arms below her buttocks, before standing up and carrying her. Shinji walked like this over to the bathroom and awkwardly relieved himself. He then returned to her bed and lay back down, trying to get comfortable again. The girl sighed contentedly as he laid back down.  
真嗣伸手抚摸她的脸，轻抚她的脸颊，描摹她的嘴唇，享受着她在他给予的关爱时脸上微妙的表情。然后他托住她的额头，微笑着吻了吻她的额头，然后感到大自然的召唤。他依依不舍地试图将明日香从他身上撬开，但这只会让她抱得更紧。不想打扰她安详的睡眠，男孩慢慢坐起来，把腿从床上移开。然后他把胳膊放在她臀部下面，然后站起来抱着她。真嗣就这样走到浴室，笨拙地解脱了自己。然后他回到她的床上躺下，试图再次感到舒服。当他躺下时，女孩满足地叹了口气。

Shinji looked up at the clock and realised they didn't have much time before school and so he gently shook Asuka awake. "Asuka wake up, we have school soon" he whispered softly.  
真嗣抬头看了看时钟，意识到他们上学前时间不多了，于是轻轻摇醒明日香。“明日香，醒醒，我们快上学了。”他轻声细语。

"I don't care," she grumbled in reply, still half asleep.  
""我不管，”她含糊不清地回答，仍然半睡半醒。

The boy reached under her shirt and began tickling her ribs, causing the girl to start laughing immediately.  
男孩伸手到她衬衫下面，开始挠她的肋骨，女孩立刻开始大笑。

"Stop!" she protested, "God damn it Shinji, stop exploiting my weaknesses"  
“别！”她抗议道，“该死的真嗣，别利用我的弱点”

Shinji relented, causing the girl to relax again, although she was more awake now. "Get ready for school" he requested.  
真嗣让步了，女孩又放松下来，尽管她现在更清醒了。“准备上学”他要求道。

"Fine" she said, sighing in defeat.  
“好吧，”她叹着气认输道。

At this, the girl let go of the boy and moved up to face him, her hair dangling down all over the place in a mess. Shinji noticed her eyes were still a little red from last night but barely noticeable. He couldn't help pushing some strands of her hair to the side before bringing the girl down into a kiss. Asuka returned the exchange tenderly, her hand touching his cheek affectionately. Grudgingly, the boy parted with her and began stroking her hair.  
这时，女孩放开了男孩，走到他面前，头发乱糟糟地垂在各处。真嗣注意到她的眼睛昨晚还有些红，但几乎看不出来。他忍不住把她的几缕头发拨到一边，然后吻了上去。明日香温柔地回应着，她的手深情地抚摸着他的脸颊。男孩不情愿地离开了她，开始抚摸她的头发。

"Ok… I'll go now to make breakfast and our lunches while you change" he explained.  
“好的……我现在去准备早餐和午餐，你换衣服吧，”他解释道。

"Hmpf… go already then" she replied, trying to sound annoyed but yawned instead.  
“哼…那就去吧。”她回答道，试图装作很生气的样子，但还是打了个哈欠。

The boy pushed her up and sat up on the bed before turning so that he was sitting on the edge of the bed. The girl also sat up and leaned on the boy, resting her head on his shoulder. Shinji pet Asuka on the head before getting off the bed.  
男孩把她推起来，在床上坐起来，然后转身坐在床边。女孩也坐起来，靠在男孩身上，把头靠在他的肩膀上。真嗣在起床前摸了摸明日香的头。

Shinji turned to look back at her and noticed she was pouting at him. "Ok honey, come out when you've changed so you can eat breakfast" he mentioned.  
真嗣转过身来看着她，注意到她正在对他撅嘴。“好吧，亲爱的，等你换好衣服出来吃早餐。”他说道。

"Yes yes, shoo already" she said, waving him off. "Thanks for yesterday" she added quietly.  
“是是，快走吧，”她挥着手说，“谢谢昨天。”她小声补充道。

Shinji nodded, before exiting her room and closing the door behind him. He then entered the kitchen, not seeing Misato anywhere, and took out various ingredients from the cupboards and fridge to make breakfast and their lunches. He whistled quietly to himself as he finished packing their bentos with food. After finishing, he placed the breakfast meals on the dining table before going to his room to change into his school uniform himself and pack his school bag. Returning to the kitchen, Shinji found Asuka's meal already eaten and so sat down at the table to eat his own. After finishing, he walked over to the front door with his bag and noticed Asuka standing there waiting for him to finish. He snuck up behind her and nuzzled her neck gently, causing the redhead to jump a little. The boy then boldly reached down and cupped her breasts with his hands, Asuka moaning in pleasure.  
真嗣点点头，然后走出她的房间，关上门。他走进厨房，没看到美里，从橱柜和冰箱里拿出各种食材，准备做早餐和午餐。他一边把便当装满食物，一边轻轻地吹着口哨。做完后，他把早餐放在餐桌上，然后回到自己的房间，换上校服，收拾书包。回到厨房，真嗣发现明日香的饭已经吃完了，于是坐到桌边吃自己的饭。吃完后，他拿着书包走到前门，发现明日香站在那里等他吃完。他偷偷走到她身后，轻轻地蹭了蹭她的脖子，这让红发女孩跳了一下。然后，男孩大胆地伸手，用双手捧住她的胸部，明日香发出愉悦的呻吟。

"Don't get me aroused now!" she scolded.  
“别现在让我兴奋！”她责备道。

The boy didn't stop and instead reached under her skirt, attempting to stimulate a certain area.  
男孩没有停下来，反而伸到她的裙子下面，试图刺激某个部位。

"Stop that now!" she ordered, trying to push his hand away.  
"现在就住手！"她命令道，试图推开他的手。

He responded by slipping a finger into her panties, to which the girl painfully slapped his hand away.  
他回应道，将一根手指滑进她的内裤，女孩痛苦地拍开了他的手。

"We don't have time, now stop it!" she said, raising her voice. "_You_ were the one who woke me up so we wouldn't be late baka"  
“我们没时间了，现在停下来！”她提高声音说道，“是你把我叫醒的，这样我们才不会迟到，笨蛋”

"Awww" he replied with disappointment.  
“啊”他失望地回答道。

"Let's just go already!" she snapped, forcefully pulling him along.  
“我们现在就走吧！”她厉声说道，用力把他拉走。

The two teens made their way out of the apartment building and began their walk to school. The sun shone down on them, but it wasn't hot thankfully. Shinji noticed the girl's red hair was all neat and tidy now, unlike this morning.  
这两个青少年走出公寓大楼，开始步行去学校。阳光照在他们身上，但还好不热。真嗣注意到这个女孩的红头发现在又整齐又干净了，不像今早那样。

"So, how do you like the play so far?" Shinji asked, breaking the silence.  
“那么，你到目前为止觉得这出戏怎么样？”真嗣打破沉默问道。

"It's ok I suppose… I haven't read much further so I'll have to look over it before the practice session we have today… at least I _assume_ we are practising today" Asuka answered.  
“我想还行吧……我还没读太多，所以我得在今天排练之前把它看一遍……至少我认为我们今天会排练。”明日香回答道。

"I think we are… and yeah I also haven't read much further, you've kept me busy after all" he replied, sticking his tongue out at her. "But I reckon the story is getting kinda interesting" he added.  
“我想我们……是的，我也没有读太多，毕竟你让我很忙，”他回答道，对她吐了吐舌头。“但我认为这个故事变得有点意思了，”他补充道。

"I'm sure you're just happy you get to kiss me in front of everyone" she remarked, also sticking her tongue out at him.  
“我敢肯定你只是高兴你可以在所有人面前吻我，”她评论道，也对他吐了吐舌头。

"I'd love to kiss you in front of everyone _whenever_ I want" he countered, grinning.  
“我想在任何时候当着所有人的面吻你，”他反驳道，咧嘴一笑。

"Everyone will find out eventually I suppose, so that's likely to happen anyway" she replied, stretching her arms out.  
“每个人最终都会发现，我想，所以无论如何都会发生”她回答道，伸展着手臂。

At her comment, Shinji kissed Asuka softly on the cheek. They proceeded to walk to school in silence, enjoying the cool breeze of the morning. Some cars drove by as they continued on quietly on the footpath for the rest of the walk to school. A few people greeted or smiled at the couple as they walked past them. They arrived at the school seeing masses of students walking through the front gate; people were heading into class as classes were almost beginning. The two eva pilots walked through the front gates, noticing a large amount of litter on the ground. The leaves and grass shone with an ethereal sheen of emerald in the morning radiance. Entering the school, they made their way to their classroom; school posters covered the walls entirely, most of them promoting the "great city of Tokyo-3."  
听到她的评论，真嗣轻轻地吻了明日香的脸颊。他们继续沉默地走向学校，享受着早晨的凉风。当他们安静地沿着人行道继续向学校走去时，一些汽车驶过。当他们走过时，一些人向这对夫妇打招呼或微笑。他们到达学校，看到大批学生穿过前门；人们正走向教室，因为课程即将开始。这两个 EVA 驾驶员穿过前门，注意到地上有大量的垃圾。在早晨的光辉中，树叶和草地闪耀着绿宝石的空灵光泽。进入学校后，他们前往教室；学校海报完全覆盖了墙壁，其中大部分都在宣传“伟大的东京 3 号市”。

Just outside the classroom, a blue haired girl came up to them to confront them before they could enter. Asuka hadn't seen Rei since the sync test, but that was typical as she usually skipped school; Shinji hadn't seen her since after the angel battle. The first child had a strange look on her face, however seemed focused on Shinji. Asuka raised her eyebrow at Rei questioningly.  
就在教室外，一个蓝头发的女孩走过来，在他们进入教室之前拦住了他们。自同步测试以来，明日香还没有见过丽，但这很正常，因为她通常会逃学；自与使徒战斗以来，真嗣也没有见过她。这个一号机驾驶员脸上表情很奇怪，但似乎很专注于真嗣。明日香疑惑地挑了挑眉毛看着丽。

"Shinji… I heard about the incident yesterday and…" Rei started.  
“真嗣……我听说了昨天的事，而且……”丽开始说。

The blue haired girl went over to and embraced Shinji. The boy was completely shocked at her display and stood there dumbly. Breaking out of his momentary shock, Shinji decided he should return her affection and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her back. Rei felt very soft and gentle, quite a contrast to Asuka, who felt warm and lively whenever he hugged her. The redhead frowned slightly but said nothing.  
蓝发女孩走到真嗣身边，拥抱了他。男孩完全被她的举动惊呆了，呆呆地站在那里。真嗣从短暂的震惊中回过神来，决定回应她的感情，于是也伸出双臂抱住了她。丽给人的感觉非常柔软温柔，与他每次拥抱时都感觉温暖活泼的明日香形成了鲜明的对比。红发女孩微微皱了皱眉，但什么也没说。

"I… I am very thankful you are still alive" Rei continued. "It is also good that you are out of prison and look well"  
“我……我很感谢你仍然活着。”丽继续说道，“你出狱了，而且看起来很好，这真是太好了。”

"Thanks… that's very nice of you Rei" he replied, a little unsure of what to say.  
“谢谢……你真是太好了，丽。”他回答道，有点不确定该说什么。

"I do not really understand these feelings Shinji. I felt awful when I heard you had almost died, but was then relieved when I heard that you had recovered. Perhaps you can explain it to me later?" she requested.  
“我并不真正理解这些感觉，真嗣。当我听说你差点死了的时候，我感觉很糟糕，但当我听说你已经康复的时候，我又松了一口气。也许你以后可以向我解释一下？”她请求道。

"I would be glad to" he answered, rubbing her back. "You should thank Asuka though, she was the one who saved me from drowning"  
“我乐意”他回答，抚摸着她的后背。“你应该感谢明日香，是她救了我，让我免于溺水”

Letting go of Shinji, Rei turned to face Asuka. "Pilot Sohryu, thank you for saving Shinji" she thanked the redhead, bowing.  
放开真嗣，丽转身面对明日香。“惣流驾驶员，谢谢你救了真嗣”她向红发女郎道谢，鞠躬。

"Of course, I couldn't let a co-worker die" Asuka huffed.  
“当然，我不能让一个同事死去”明日香哼了一声。

"But he is also quite important to you now? If I recall correctly you two are in-" Rei started.  
"但他现在对你来说也很重要？如果我没记错的话，你们两个正在-" 丽开始说。

"Shhh, we're keeping that a secret at school Rei" Asuka interrupted, speaking quietly.  
"嘘，我们在学校里保密，丽" 明日香打断了她，轻声说道。

Rei cocked her head to the side. "You announced it to all of NERV, why do you need to hide it?" she asked curiously.  
"丽把头歪向一边。 "你已经向 NERV 的所有人宣布了，为什么还要隐瞒？"她好奇地问道。

"Please Rei, it's a little complicated to explain, but please do as Asuka asks" Shinji spoke up.  
“丽，稍微有点复杂，不过请你照明日香说的做”真嗣开口说道。

"Very well, I will not mention it" Rei agreed. "See you then" she finished, before kissing Shinji on the cheek and walking into the classroom.  
“好吧，我不提了。”丽答应道。“那再见了。”她说完，在真嗣脸上亲了一下，走进了教室。

Asuka watched after Rei as she entered the classroom and you could almost see steam coming out of her ears; she was clearly not happy about the exchange.  
明日香看着丽走进教室，你几乎可以看到她耳朵里冒出蒸汽；她显然对这次交换不满意。

"It's good that Rei is starting to show more emotions" Shinji commented, touching his cheek where she had pecked him.  
“丽开始表现出更多的情感，这很好。”真嗣评论道，抚摸着她啄过他的脸颊。

"Yeah, she's not just a stupid doll anymore" Asuka remarked spitefully.  
“是啊，她不再只是一个愚蠢的洋娃娃了。”明日香恶毒地评论道。

"Come on Asuka, don't be too hard on her. It seems she's had an… unusual life, and she is definitely improving" he replied gently; he wanted to caress Asuka, but couldn't do so at school.  
“算了，明日香，别太为难她了。她好像……经历过一些不寻常的事情，而且她肯定在进步。”他温和地回答道；他想抚摸明日香，但在学校里不能这样做。

"What do you care? She's just a stupid freak, trying to seduce idiots like you" the redhead retorted.  
“你管得着吗？她不过是个愚蠢的怪胎，想勾引你这样的白痴。”红发女郎反驳道。

Shinji found himself a little curious at Asuka's reaction, why would such small actions from Rei bother her? "Don't tell me you're getting jealous Asuka?" he said, deciding to tease her.  
真嗣发现自己对明日香的反应有点好奇，为什么丽的这些小动作会让她生气？“别告诉我你吃醋了，明日香？”他决定逗逗她。

"No, it's just that… well… what was up with all that affection she was giving you? She's obviously trying to take you from me" Asuka refuted.  
“没有，只是……那个……她对你那么亲热，是怎么回事？她分明是想抢走你。”明日香反驳道。

Shinji laughed, _'What's up with women, do they think all men are unfaithful?'_ he thought.  
真嗣笑道，“女人们怎么了，她们是不是认为所有男人都是不忠实的？”他想。

"So, you're suggesting I'd run off with Rei?" he asked, smirking.  
“所以，你的意思是说，我应该和丽私奔？”他问道，带着一丝坏笑。

"Well no… that is…" Asuka started, unable to think of anything to say. Shinji just looked at her with a face that said "I knew it."  
“啊，不……那个……”明日香支吾着，想不出什么话来说。真嗣只是用“我就知道”的表情看着她。

"Well fine! Maybe I am a _little_… jealous. But that's normal" she explained.  
“好吧！也许我有点……嫉妒。但这很正常。”她解释道。

"Of course!" he said in a patronising tone.  
“当然！”他以一种居高临下的口气说道。

"Don't patronise me!" she replied, raising her hand to smack him.  
“别对我指手画脚！”她回答道，举起手要打他。

Shinji figured he had teased her enough and gave the redhead a warm hug; doing something like this wasn't as big deal at school he supposed. Their embrace was not to last as someone coughed, making them move part.  
真嗣觉得他已经逗她够了，于是给了红发女孩一个温暖的拥抱；他认为在学校里做这样的事情并不是什么大不了的事情。他们的拥抱并没有持续多久，因为有人咳嗽了一声，让他们分开。

"Am I interrupting something?" Touji asked, grinning.  
“我是不是打扰到你们了？”东治笑着问道。

"Well actually, Rei came up to me, giving me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I didn't want Asuka to feel left out, and besides it was thanks for her saving me yesterday" Shinji explained.  
“其实，是丽主动过来，给了我一个拥抱，还亲了我的脸颊。我不想让明日香觉得被冷落了，而且她昨天救了我，我应该感谢她。”真嗣解释道。

"I did not ask you for it!" Asuka replied defiantly.  
“我没有要求你这样做！”明日香挑衅地回答道。

Touji laughed before responding. "I never would have thought that Sohryu, of all people, would be jealous of Rei flirting with _Shinji_"  
冬治在回答之前笑了。“我从来没想过，所有的人中，惣流会嫉妒丽和真嗣调情”

Shinji couldn't help snorting at his comment, especially because she had admitted as much to him earlier.  
真嗣忍不住对他的评论嗤之以鼻，特别是她早些时候已经向他承认了这一点。

"Shut up you idiotic boys!" Asuka shouted, giving them both a menacing glare. Both boys stopped instantly, fearing for their lives instead. "That's much better" she smirked, almost prancing into the classroom.  
“闭嘴，你们这群白痴！”明日香大喊，恶狠狠地瞪着他们。两个男孩立刻闭嘴，反而担心起自己的小命。“这样才对嘛。”她得意地笑，几乎是蹦跳着走进教室。

"Why is it no man on earth can stand up to her hellish glare?" Touji joked.  
“为什么地球上没有一个人能承受她那地狱般的目光？”冬二开玩笑说。

"Heh, it is pretty terrifying" Shinji replied.  
“呵呵，还蛮吓人的嘛”真嗣答道。

The two friends walked into class and sat down at their respective desks as it was almost time for school to start. The classroom was loud with chatter, one could see the blackboard had "I hate second impact" scribbled all over it. Soon the teacher walked in and the class instantly quietened.  
两个朋友走进教室，在各自的课桌上坐下，因为学校快上课了。教室里充满了喧闹声，可以看到黑板上写满了“我讨厌第二次冲击”。很快，老师走了进来，教室立刻安静下来。

"Rise! Bow! Sit!" Hikari called out.  
"起立！鞠躬！坐下！”光叫道。

"Thank you Miss Horaki" the teacher thanked. He paused momentarily when he looked at the blackboard and smiled slightly. "Today we will practise the play after our lunchbreak, if any of you are still not well versed on your parts, you can use the break to practise. Right now, I'd like to welcome the principal to say a few words about yesterday" he finished off.  
"谢谢堀老师”老师感谢道。他看着黑板，微微一笑，停顿了一下。“今天我们午休后会练习戏剧，如果你们中还有人对自己的部分不太熟悉，可以利用休息时间练习。现在，我想请校长来谈谈昨天的事情”他结束了。

At this, the principal walked into the classroom. "Miss Sohryu?" he asked.  
校长这时走进教室。'惣流小姐？'他问道。

"Here sir" Asuka replied, standing up.  
'"在，先生"明日香回答，站了起来。"

"Mr. Ikari?" the man prompted.  
'"碇先生？'那人提示道。"

"Here sir" Shinji replied, standing up.  
""好的，先生，""真嗣站起身来回答道。

"I was told by sensei here yesterday that you saved Mr. Ikari from drowning, is that right Miss Sohryu?" the principal inquired.  
""昨天，这里的老师告诉我，你救了碇先生，没有淹死，是吗，惣流小姐？""校长问道。

"Hai" Asuka answered. ""嗨，""明日香回答道。

"I'd like to give a special thanks to you Miss Sohryu, it's not everyday people act courageously for others, especially when there is a personal cost to themselves" the principal praised.  
“我想特别感谢你，惣流小姐，并不是每个人都能勇敢地为他人挺身而出，尤其是在对自己有损失的情况下。”校长赞扬道。

"I accept your gratitude sir" Asuka responded.  
“我接受你的感谢，先生。”明日香回应道。

"I didn't come here just to give nice words, I'd like to give you something for your efforts" the principal continued.  
“我来这里不仅仅是为了说好话，我想给你一些东西来奖励你的努力。”校长继续说道。

He held up a piece of paper and handed it to Asuka. She examined it briefly; it was a certificate for good community service.  
他举起一张纸，递给明日香。她简单地检查了一下；这是一张社区服务优良证书。

"I rarely give these out, only when a student does something special. This is quite a special certificate; when applying for a job, people will recognise this and your chances of getting employed are much higher" the principal explained.  
“我很少发这些，只有当学生做了特别的事情时才会发。这是一张非常特别的证书；在求职时，人们会认出这张证书，你获得聘用的机会会高得多。”校长解释道。

"I thank you very much sir" Asuka thanked.  
“非常感谢您，先生。”明日香道谢。

The principal went over to the redhead and shook her hand, smiling a cheesy grin. "You must be very grateful for her actions" he said, facing Shinji.  
校长走到红发女孩面前，握了握她的手，咧嘴一笑。“你一定很感谢她的行为。”他面对真嗣说道。

"I am sir" Shinji replied.  
“是的，先生。”真嗣回答道。

"Alright everyone, I better let you get back to your lesson, learn well!" the principal finished off. With that, he left the room, closing the door behind him. Both Shinji and Asuka sat down.  
“好了，各位，我最好让你们回去上课，好好学习！”校长说完，离开了房间，关上了身后的门。真嗣和明日香都坐了下来。

"Now let the class begin" the teacher said as he began lecturing, predictably, the ever-pointless topic of second impact. Asuka looked up as she saw a new message notification blinking on her screen. She looked over to Shinji but he seemed to just be staring at Rei. The redhead shook her head, slightly annoyed, before opening the message, wondering whom it was from.  
"现在开始上课"老师开始讲课，不出所料，讲的是第二次冲击这个永远没有意义的话题。明日香抬头一看，看到屏幕上闪烁着一条新消息通知。她看向真嗣，但他似乎只是盯着丽。红发女孩摇了摇头，略显恼怒，然后打开消息，想知道是谁发来的。

_**Touji: Hey Sohryu,**__**just wanted to ask you about Shinji. Have you noticed that he's changed? Despite the angel battles and his time in prison, he seems a lot more cheerful and not so reserved and… well not so Shinji.**_  
冬治：惣流，只是想问你关于真嗣的事。你有没有注意到他变了？尽管经历了使徒之战和在监狱里的时光，他看起来更开朗了，也不那么拘谨了，嗯，不像真嗣了。

Asuka was surprised to see the message and quickly began typing a reply.  
明日香惊讶地看到这条消息，迅速开始输入回复。

_**Asuka: Yeah, you mean he's grown a spine. Yes, he definitely seems more outgoing and confident. I'm not too sure what has caused this.  
明日香：是啊，你的意思是他的脊梁骨长出来了。是的，他肯定看起来更外向、更有自信了。我不太确定是什么导致了这一点。**_

'_Yeah right'_ she thought to herself cheekily.  
“说得对”她厚着脸皮自言自语道。

_**Touji: Lol, grown a spine. I can only guess it's you Sohryu, so keep up the good work. Whatever it is you're doing, even if you don't realise what it is, keep it up, I've never seen Shinji so happy. He seems to generally enjoy your company, he defends you and interacts with you a lot, maybe he likes you?  
冬治：哈哈，长了脊梁骨。我只能猜是你，惣流，所以继续努力。无论你在做什么，即使你没有意识到自己在做什么，也要继续下去，我从未见过真嗣如此开心。他似乎很享受你的陪伴，他维护你，并经常与你互动，也许他喜欢你？**_

The redhead was shocked to hear this coming from Touji; since when was he so perceptive? _'Maybe revealing our relationship to everyone wouldn't be so bad…'_ she thought.  
红发女听到东治这么说感到震惊；他什么时候变得这么敏锐了？“也许向所有人公开我们的关系不会那么糟糕……”她想。

_**Asuka: Suzuhara you almost sound grateful to me, I thought you hated me? And as for Shinji liking me, I don't think so. Maybe he's just happy because I saved his life yesterday.  
明日香：铃原，你听起来几乎对我心存感激，我还以为你讨厌我呢？至于真嗣喜欢我，我不这么认为。也许他只是因为我昨天救了他的命而高兴。**_

_**Touji: I don't HATE you… you just scare me :P. Though perhaps you're right about Shinji, if he DOES come up to you confessing his feelings, don't be mean to him. I mean, I know you probably don't like him that way, but be nice.  
东治：我不讨厌你……你只是吓到我了：P。不过也许你对真嗣是对的，如果他真的来找你表白，不要对他刻薄。我的意思是，我知道你可能不喜欢他，但要友善。**_

_**Asuka: He wouldn't have the guts to ask me out, but I'll be nice if he does, I do respect him.  
明日香：他没胆量约我出去，但如果他约我，我会表现得很友善，我确实尊重他。**_

_**Touji: Thank you. 冬治：谢谢。**_

Seeing as her conversation with Touji was over, she looked back over to the subject of their discussion and noticed he was still looking at Rei. _'What is he doing staring at that doll?'_ she thought angrily, he was giving her too much attention. Asuka tapped her desk as she waited impatiently for the class to end, it was particularly boring today. Finally, after what felt like years, the bell rang. The students stood up from their seats and massed out of the classroom to have their lunchbreak.  
看到她与冬治的谈话已经结束，她回过头来看向他们讨论的话题，注意到他仍在看着丽。“他盯着那个洋娃娃看什么？”她愤怒地想，他给了她太多的关注。明日香敲着桌子，焦急地等待着下课，今天特别无聊。终于，在感觉过了好几年之后，铃声响了。学生们从座位上站起来，成群结队地走出教室去吃午饭。

The redhead, still irritated at her boyfriend, went over to Shinji and tapped him on the shoulder. "So, what were you doing staring at the freakazoid?" she asked.  
红发女仍然对她的男朋友感到恼火，她走到真嗣身边，拍拍他的肩膀。“所以，你盯着那个怪胎看什么？”她问道。

"Huh? What?" he replied, confused.  
“啊？什么？”他困惑地回答道。

"I saw you staring at Rei many times during class" she clarified.  
“我看到你在课堂上多次盯着丽”她澄清道。

"Oh… I was just wondering why she always looks out the window and what she's thinking" Shinji answered.  
“哦……我只是想知道她为什么总是看着窗外，她在想什么。”真嗣回答道。

"You seem very interested in her recently, are you sure there isn't something you're not telling me?" Asuka inquired.  
“你最近看起来对她很感兴趣，你确定没有事情瞒着我吗？”明日香问道。

"Asuka please, I was just thinking about the unusualness of Rei's behaviour. I also haven't seen her for a long time remember?" he quickly responded. "You know you are my only one" he reassured.  
“明日香，拜托，我只是在想丽的行为很奇怪。而且我也很久没见到她了，还记得吗？”他迅速回答道。“你知道你是我唯一的。”他安慰道。

Asuka sighed, "Well, what the hell am I supposed to think?" she snapped, before lowering her voice, "Last night I told you so many of my secrets… don't betray me Shinji"  
明日香叹了口气，“好吧，我他妈的该怎么想？”她怒吼道，然后压低声音，“昨晚我告诉你我那么多的秘密……别背叛我，真嗣”

"It's alright Asuka, I understand what you're saying but I'm telling you there's no need to worry" the boy replied, trying to relieve her of her concerns.  
“没事的，明日香，我明白你在说什么，但我告诉你，不用担心，”男孩回答道，试图让她打消顾虑。

"Jeez, I can't believe I'm behaving like this over _you_" Asuka said, sticking her tongue out at him. "You're just baka Shinji, as if you'd look at anyone but the great Asuka"  
“天哪，我不敢相信我竟然会因为你这样，”明日香说道，对他吐了吐舌头。“你只是个笨蛋真嗣，好像你会看任何人，除了伟大的明日香”

Shinji laughed in response, smiling at her.  
真嗣笑着回应，对她微笑。

"Yo Shin man!" Touji called out to the boy, "You coming for lunch?" he asked, waving to him. Touji had been looking for Shinji after they left the classroom. Kensuke was standing next to the jock, also waving him over.  
“哟，真嗣！”东治向那个男孩喊道，“你过来吃午饭吗？”他问，向他挥手。东治在他们离开教室后一直在找真嗣。剑介站在那个运动健将旁边，也向他挥手。

"Of course, but just letting you know I was going to use the break to read over my lines for the play" he answered.  
“当然，不过我要让你知道，我打算利用休息时间来读一下我为戏剧准备的台词。”他回答道。

"That's fine man" Touji replied.  
“没问题，伙计。”冬治回答道。

"Actually, I need to read over my lines too" Asuka added, "I'll join you guys since my lines almost all involve Shinji's role"  
“事实上，我也需要读一下我的台词。”明日香补充道，“我的台词几乎都涉及到真嗣的角色，所以我加入你们。”

"Don't forget me!" the class rep said jumping in; she had just walked up to her redheaded friend.  
“别忘了我！”班长跳进来说道；她刚走到她红头发的朋友身边。

"Hey Hikari!" Asuka greeted, "Don't worry, I know you love spending time with that perverted jock too" Asuka teased.  
“嘿光！“明日香打招呼道，“别担心，我知道你也很喜欢和那个变态运动健将待在一起”明日香取笑道。

Hikari couldn't help turning pink at her friend's joke, "Wah, no that's not it Asuka, don't joke like that" she said, embarrassed.  
光被朋友的玩笑弄得脸红，“哇，不是那样的明日香，别这样开玩笑”她害羞地说。

"You're too easy Hikari" Asuka said in response, smirking.  
“你太好骗了光”明日香回应道，得意地笑着。

Shinji himself, moved over to his two friends to talk to them as the five of them walked down to their usual lunch spot.  
真嗣自己走到他的两个朋友那里，在他们五人走到他们平常的午餐地点时与他们交谈。

"Hey guys, how are you doing?" Shinji asked them.  
“嗨，伙计们，你们过得怎么样？”真嗣问他们。

"Doing good man" Touji replied.  
“做好人”斗鸡回答道。

"Yeah, me too" Kensuke added, "What about you? You're the one who almost drowned yesterday. Everything good with you? All recovered?"  
“是啊，我也是。”健介补充道，“你呢？你可是昨天差点淹死的人。你一切都好吗？都恢复了吗？”

"Yeah yeah, I'm fine honestly" Shinji answered. "Sorry again about ditching you yesterday… NERV business and all. But don't worry, it wasn't anything too serious" he explained.  
“是啊是啊，我很好，真的。”真嗣回答道。“昨天又把你丢下，真抱歉……NERV 的事，你知道的。不过别担心，没什么大事。”他解释道。

"Yeah no worries Shinji, nothing you could do" Kensuke reassured.  
“是啊，别担心，真嗣，你也没办法。”健介安慰道。

"So where were you guys going to take me out yesterday?" Shinji inquired.  
“所以你们昨天准备带我去哪里？”真嗣问道。

"Oh, there was this new place that opened up that's supposed to have good food, I was going to suggest going there" Touji answered.  
“哦，有个新地方开业了，听说那里的食物不错，我本来想提议去那里的。”东治回答道。

"We could have gone to my place too, played some games or watched a movie, my parents wouldn't have minded" Kensuke added.  
“我们也可以去我家，玩玩游戏或者看场电影，我父母不会介意的。”健介补充道。
"Hah damn, that's sounds way better than my trip to NERV yesterday" Shinji commented. "Speaking of, I don't have anything planned after school today… maybe you guys are free to hang out?" Shinji requested.  
"哈哈，该死，这听起来比我昨天去 NERV 好多了" 真嗣评论道。 "说起来，我今天放学后没什么计划...也许你们有空出去玩？" 真嗣问道。

"I'm in!" Touji instantly replied, squeezing Shinji's shoulder.  
"我参加！" 冬治立刻回答，捏了捏真嗣的肩膀。

"Even if I wasn't free, I'd ditch it for this! This celebration is happening my man" Kensuke added excitedly.  
"即使我没有空，我也会为了这个而放弃！这个庆祝活动正在发生，我的朋友" 剑介兴奋地补充道。

"Great! Thanks guys, looking forward to it" Shinji responded.  
"太棒了！谢谢你们，期待着呢"真嗣回应道。

They soon reached their spot and sat down in the shade of a tree. The three of them were soon joined by Asuka and Hikari, causing the boys to shift a bit to make room for them. The grass felt soft beneath their feet as they all began eating their food.  
他们很快到达了目的地，坐在一棵树的树荫下。他们三个很快迎来了明日香和光，导致男孩们挪动了一下，给她们腾出空间。草坪在他们脚下感觉很柔软，他们都开始吃自己的食物。

"Oh actually! Can I see your certificate Asuka?" Hikari asked, curious as to what it said.  
"哦，对了！明日香，我能看看你的证书吗？"光问道，好奇上面写了什么。

"Sure" Asuka replied, handing it to Hikari who examined it with curiosity.  
“当然”明日香回答道，把它递给好奇地检查它的光。

"Well it looks nice. It also shows the appreciation of the school" Hikari commented.  
“嗯，看起来不错。也体现了学校的重视”光评论道。

To this, Asuka snorted. "Well, it's ok I guess. At least it can be used for _something_" she remarked.  
对此，明日香哼了一声。“嗯，还可以吧。至少可以用来做点什么”她评论道。

"Can I see it too?" Shinji asked.  
“我也能看看吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah, it's nothing amazing" Asuka said, giving permission.  
“嗯，没什么了不起的。”明日香说着，给了许可。

Hikari handed the certificate to Shinji who also took a look at it and passed it to his two friends afterwards.  
光把证书递给了真嗣，真嗣也看了一眼，然后传给了他的两个朋友。

"Alright then, while we still have time, I'm going to start looking over my lines" Asuka announced.  
“好吧，趁我们还有时间，我要开始背台词了。”明日香宣布。

"Good idea, I need as much practise as I can get" Shinji replied.  
“好主意，我需要尽可能多地练习。”真嗣回答。

They all got out their copies of the play from their bags and began reading their parts. Shinji and Asuka did a bit of roleplaying with each other since many of the lines involved dialogue with both of them. Time seemed to stand still as they practised or read over their lines, the occasional cloud covering the sun being the only indication that time was passing. The five of them were so absorbed in their work, they jumped when they heard the bell. Other than the eva pilots, they placed their copies back into their bags, before they all began walking back to the school building.  
他们从包里拿出剧本，开始朗读自己的台词。真嗣和明日香互相扮演角色，因为很多台词都是他们两个人的对话。他们练习或朗读台词时，时间似乎静止了，偶尔有云朵遮住太阳，这是时间流逝的唯一迹象。他们五个人都沉浸在自己的工作中，听到铃声时都吓了一跳。除了 EVA 驾驶员外，他们把剧本放回包里，然后一起往教学楼走去。

The students did not return to the classroom, knowing that they had play practice, and all head towards the stage room. Shinji and Asuka skimmed over their lines as they walked, just to help be ready. Upon entering the stage room, the teacher opened the storeroom which held all the costumes and props. Students took out what they needed and used the changing rooms to change into their appropriate costumes, much like the other day. Soon the scene from yesterday was set up, back to the dark night in the forest. All props were in place, Shinji and Asuka moved beside the sleeping beds.  
学生们知道自己有戏剧排练，所以没有返回教室，而是径直走向舞台室。真嗣和明日香一边走一边浏览自己的台词，以便做好准备。进入舞台室后，老师打开了存放所有服装和道具的储藏室。学生们取出自己需要的东西，并使用更衣室换上合适的服装，就像前一天一样。很快，昨天的场景就布置好了，回到了森林中的黑暗夜晚。所有道具都已就位，真嗣和明日香走到睡床旁边。

"Let us begin from where we left off, Asuka and Shinji if you may start from the kiss" the teacher announced.  
"我们从上次中断的地方开始，明日香和真嗣，你们可以从吻戏开始""老师宣布道。

Thus, the play resumed. The two eva pilots looked at each other for a moment before Asuka moved her face towards Shinji's and pretended to kiss him. The redhead moved her arms around him to pull him closer and Shinji automatically responded by actually kissing her. Realising his mistake, Shinji parted with her after a moment.  
"于是，戏剧继续进行。两位 EVA 驾驶员对视片刻，然后明日香将脸转向真嗣，假装亲吻他。红发女孩将手臂环绕在他身上，将他拉近，真嗣下意识地回应，真的吻了她。意识到自己的错误后，真嗣片刻后便与她分开。

"Princess…?" the knight prompted, as Shinji got straight back into his role.  
“公主……”骑士提示道，真嗣立刻恢复了他的角色。

"I'm sorry… I shouldn't be doing this, but you make me feel like I can be myself" the princess replied. "I don't want to marry the king"  
“对不起……我不应该这么做，但你让我感觉我可以做我自己。”公主回答道，“我不想嫁给国王。”

"My duty as a knight says I should stop this and escort you to the king… but my heart says to continue this… I cannot decide" the knight deliberated out loud.  
“作为一名骑士，我的职责是阻止这一切，并护送你到国王那里……但我的心告诉我继续下去……我无法决定。”骑士大声思考道。

"Then let me decide for you" she responded immediately.  
""那么让我来替你决定吧""她立刻回答道。

The princess moved once again towards him and fake kissed him again. They both moved down onto the bed and this time Shinji correctly kept his kiss pretend and moved on top of her. He quickly covered them with the blanket, signifying the end of the scene. The scenery was changed from being dark to light. Next morning, the knight and princess woke up together.  
公主再次向他靠近，假装再次亲吻他。他们俩都躺到了床上，这次真嗣正确地假装亲吻了她，并压在了她身上。他迅速用毯子盖住了他们，表示这场戏结束了。场景从黑暗变成了光明。第二天早上，骑士和公主一起醒来了。

"This is a not a good situation I put us in now" the princess remarked.  
""我现在把我们置于一个不好的境地""公主评论道。

"Yes my Lady, it would be wise to continue our journey to the king" he replied.  
“是的，我的女士，继续我们的旅程去见国王是明智的，”他回答道。

"But what about you?" she asked, concerned.  
“但是你呢？”她关切地问道。

"Worry not for me, I am but a humble knight. I do not wish to see this country go to war. It is for the greater good that I take you to the king" he answered.  
“不要为我担心，我只是一个卑微的骑士。我不想看到这个国家陷入战争。我带你去见国王是为了更大的利益，”他回答道。

"Yes… you are right" the princess agreed sadly. "Let us continue the journey then, shall we"  
“是的……你说得对。”公主悲伤地同意道，“那么我们继续赶路吧，好吗？”

They packed up their camp and prepared everything, before mounting the horse and riding off towards the castle. When they saw the castle in the distance, a feeling of foreboding descended upon them.  
他们收拾好营地，准备一切，然后骑上马朝城堡出发。当他们远远地看到城堡时，一种不祥的预感降临到他们身上。

"We are almost there my Lady, I'd say only a few hours now" the knight commented. The princess remained silent. "Perhaps you'd wish to take one more break before we arrive?" he asked, thinking she didn't want to impose.  
“我的小姐，我们快到了，我想现在只需要几个小时了。”骑士评论道。公主保持沉默。“也许您希望在我们到达之前再休息一下？”他问道，以为她不想打扰。

"No, just ride to the castle" she replied with a hint of sorrow.  
“不，直接骑到城堡去。”她带着一丝悲伤回答道。

The knight continued on at her response. Finally, the two arrived at the castle just a bit before evening. Dismounting the horse, they then walked up to the castle guards.  
骑士继续回应她。最后，两人在傍晚前一点到达了城堡。他们下马，然后走到城堡守卫面前。

"Halt! Who goes there?" the guards called out.  
“站住！什么人？”守卫喊道。

"I am Princess Adelita Sankt. I have come from my country to marry your king" the princess declared.  
“我是阿德莉塔·桑克特公主。我从我的国家来嫁给你们的国王。”公主宣布道。

"Ah princess, you have finally arrived! With all due respect, we still need to check your proper identification papers" the guards requested.  
“啊，公主，你终于到了！恕我直言，我们还需要检查一下你的身份证明文件。”守卫们要求道。

"Of course, right here" she said handing them her identification papers.  
“当然，就在这里。”她说着把身份证明文件递给他们。

The guard examined the papers, finding everything in order. "Welcome to Castle Silver Moon your Highness! Forgive me, one last question, who here is this man with you?" he asked.  
守卫检查了文件，发现一切都井然有序。“欢迎来到银月城堡，殿下！请原谅我，最后一个问题，您身边这位男子是谁？”他问道。

"A knight of your kingdom of name Jonathan, he has escorted me here safely" the princess answered.  
“一位名叫乔纳森的骑士，他安全地护送我到这里。”公主回答道。

"Well then I bid you well, you may enter also. I will have guard Thomas show you to the king" the guard offered.  
“那么我祝您一切顺利，您也可以进来了。我会让托马斯护卫带您去见国王。”守卫说道。

"You have my thanks" the princess replied.  
“感谢您”公主回答道。

"Right this way your Highness" guard Thomas prompted.  
“这边请，殿下”卫兵托马斯催促道。

Thomas walked on through the gate and they followed him. The following trip was long and in complete silence. They walked up and down stairs, between baileys and walls until arriving at the keep. Finally, the guard led them to the throne room.  
托马斯穿过大门，他们跟在他后面。接下来的旅程漫长而寂静。他们上下楼梯，在护墙和城墙之间穿行，直到到达城堡。最后，卫兵把他们带到了王座室。

"Here is the throne room your Highness, you will meet our king here" the guard explained.  
“殿下，这是王座厅，您将在那里见到我们的国王。”卫兵解释道。

"Thank you" the princess replied.  
“谢谢。”公主回答道。

With that, the guard left, leaving them alone. The princess couldn't help shaking nervously.  
说完，卫兵便离开了，留下他们独处。公主忍不住紧张地颤抖着。

"Do not fear princess, our king is a good man" the knight reassured.  
“不要害怕公主，我们的国王是个好人。”骑士安慰道。

The knight then opened the door for her and they walked in. Walking up the room to the throne, they saw the king sitting down on it, watching their approach.  
然后骑士为她打开了门，他们走了进去。走到王座前，他们看到国王坐在上面，看着他们走近。

"What business have you here?" the king demanded.  
“你们来这里有什么事？”国王问道。

"My Lord, I am Princess Adelita Sankt, I was sent here to marry you as an alliance pact" the princess answered, bowing.  
“我的大人，我是阿黛莉塔·桑克特公主，我被派来与您联姻以结成同盟”公主回答道，鞠躬。

"Ah so you have finally arrived, I can begin the marriage preparations at once" the king declared. "Scribe, make a list of everyone we are inviting and send them the proper invitations" he commanded.  
“啊，你终于到了，我可以立刻开始准备婚礼了”国王宣布。“文书，列出我们邀请的所有人，并给他们发送适当的请柬”他命令道。

"Yes, my Lord" the scribe replied.  
“是，我的大人”文书回答道。

"Who is this man with you Princess?" the king asked.  
“公主，这位和你在一起的男人是谁？”国王问道。

"He is one of your knights, he escorted me safely to your castle" the princess answered.  
“他是你的骑士之一，他安全地护送我到你的城堡。”公主回答道。

"An excellent job indeed, I will make sure you are rewarded appropriately" the king replied.  
“确实做得很好，我会确保你得到适当的奖励。”国王答道。

"I thank you humbly, your Highness" the knight thanked.  
“我诚挚地感谢您，殿下。”骑士道谢道。

"Call in Sister Joanne to conduct all tests and such" the king ordered.  
“请乔安妮修女来进行所有测试和诸如此类的事情。”国王命令道。

"Tests my Lord?" the princess asked, not sure what he meant.  
“测试，我的大人？”公主问道，不确定他的意思。

"Just standard procedure. Before marriage we test for maidenhood" the king explained.  
“只是标准程序。在结婚前，我们都会测试处女之身。”国王解释道。

At this, the princess gulped; she hadn't realised this was going to happen. A small nun soon came in and walked over to the princess.  
公主听到后，不禁咽了口唾沫；她没有意识到会发生这样的事情。一位小修女很快走了进来，走到公主面前。

"Ah sister, please begin right away" the king commanded.  
“啊，修女，请马上开始吧。”国王命令道。

"Yes, my Lord" the nun replied, nodding. "My Lady, please come with me" she continued, motioning for the princess to follow her.  
“是的，我的大人，”修女回答道，点头。“我的小姐，请跟我来，”她继续说道，示意公主跟随她。

The two women walked into a private room. The rest of them waited in silence while the test was in progress. After a few minutes, the nun and princess emerged.  
两个女人走进一间私人房间。其他人则在测试进行时静静地等待着。几分钟后，修女和公主出来了。

"Sister Joanne, is the princess pure and virtuous?" the king asked with eagerness.  
“乔安妮修女，公主纯洁而有德吗？”国王急切地问道。

The small nun shook her head. "She has lain with men sire, there is clear proof" the nun answered, while the princess had her head downcast.  
小修女摇了摇头。“她与男人同床，陛下，有明确的证据。”修女回答道，而公主则低着头。

The king's face turned to anger. "What is this?! Your kingdom promised me a maiden, what treachery is this?" he demanded.  
国王的脸变得愤怒。“这是怎么回事？！你的王国向我承诺了一个处女，这是怎么回事？”他质问道。

"Well… that is…" the princess started, trying to think of how to explain her blunder.  
“嗯……那是……”公主开始说话，试图想出如何解释自己的失误。

"Is this a sign they want to go to war?!" the king provoked, seeing her stumbling.  
“这是他们想发动战争的信号吗？！”国王看到她跌跌撞撞，挑衅道。

"No your Highness!" the knight announced; he had to save the princess.  
“不，殿下！”骑士宣布道；他必须拯救公主。

Everyone in the room turned to him. "I am at fault, she arrived to this country pure. I had her. Do not punish her for my wrong" he explained.  
房间里的每个人都转向他。“我的错，她来到这个国家时还是纯洁的。我拥有她。不要因为我的错误而惩罚她。”他解释道。

"You? One of my trusted knights betrayed me? This is treason. I will have your head!" the king exclaimed with anger. "However, all is not lost. She was given as a pure maiden, the marriage will go ahead. Now my Lady, I apologise for being so rude, I did not know. I understand it would be hard to resist him because of his strength and it is not something you would like to admit. I have a room prepared for you. My servant will show you the way" he directed.  
“你？我信任的骑士之一背叛了我？这是叛国。我要你的头！”国王愤怒地喊道。“然而，一切都还没有失去。她被当作纯洁的少女献上，婚礼将继续进行。现在，我的女士，我为自己的无礼道歉，我并不知情。我理解你很难抗拒他，因为他很强大，而且这不是你愿意承认的事情。我已经为你准备了一间房间。我的仆人会带你过去。”他指示道。

One of the king's servants came up to the princess and took her out of the room; the princess was still in shock at what the knight had done for her and couldn't do anything but follow the servant out.  
国王的一名仆人走上前来，将公主带出了房间；公主仍然对骑士为她所做的一切感到震惊，除了跟着仆人出去，她什么也做不了。

"Now you sir knight… how could _you_ of all people be a traitor?" the king inquired.  
“现在，你，骑士先生……你们所有人中，你怎么会是叛徒？”国王问道。

"I am deeply sorry my Liege, I gave in to temptation" he answered.  
“我深感抱歉，我的陛下，我屈服于诱惑，”他回答道。

"I'm sure you understand my position. I will have you executed, you will be stripped of all your titles and you will be remembered as a traitor, no one will weep for you" the king elaborated.  
“我确信你明白我的立场。我将处决你，剥夺你所有的头衔，你将被铭记为叛徒，没有人会为你哭泣，”国王详细说道。

"It's what I deserve, I have no one to mourn for me anyway" the knight replied sadly.  
“这是我应得的，反正也没有人会为我哀悼，”骑士悲伤地回答道。

"Guards, take this man to prison" the king ordered.  
“卫兵，把这个人带到监狱去”国王命令道。

Two big men came over to the knight, grabbed him by the arms and pulled him away. The guards took him down deep into the earth and shoved him into a dark dank cell, before locking the door and leaving.  
两个大汉走到骑士面前，抓住他的胳膊把他拉走。卫兵把他带到地牢深处，把他推到一个黑暗潮湿的牢房里，然后锁上门离开了。

"I should have known this would be the end result… at least I was able to save the princess and prevent hostilities… this pain I feel will soon be over" he lamented.  
“我早就知道会有这样的结果……至少我救了公主，避免了敌对……我感受到的这种痛苦很快就会结束”他哀叹道。

The knight just sat there until he fell asleep. Later, he awoke to the sound of someone calling his name. Looking around, he saw someone outside his cell holding a torch.  
骑士就坐在那里，直到他睡着。后来，他被某人呼唤他名字的声音惊醒。环顾四周，他看到有人举着火把站在牢房外。

"Who's there, what do you want?" he called out.  
“是谁，你想要什么？”他喊道。

The person brought the torch in front of her to reveal herself as the princess. "It's me, Adelita" she answered.  
那人把火把举到自己面前，露出公主的面容。“是我，阿德莉塔。”她回答道。

"Princess! What are you doing down here?" the knight questioned, surprised to see her.  
“公主！你在下面做什么？”骑士问道，惊讶地看到她。

"I know I shouldn't be down here but I wanted to see you. It was noble what you did for me, but you do not deserve to die!" the princess explained.  
“我知道我不应该下来，但我想要见你。你为我做的事很伟大，但你不应该死！”公主解释道。

"Worry not, it is far better than having this country go to war" he expressed.  
“别担心，这比让这个国家陷入战争要好得多。”他表示。

"But I was at fault! The king plans to execute you in front of me, I don't think I can bear watching you die. Alas I cannot open this prison" she admitted.  
“但是我的错！国王计划在我面前处决你，我想我无法忍受看着你死去。唉，我无法打开这个监狱。”她承认。

"Nor would it change anything, I would forever be seen as a traitor to this country, I could go nowhere and my honour gone" the knight replied.  
“这也不会改变任何事情，我将永远被视为这个国家的叛徒，我无处可去，我的荣誉也荡然无存。”骑士回答。

"Is your life worth nothing to you?" she said angrily.  
“你的生命对你来说一文不值吗？”她愤怒地说。

"I have nothing left now… there is not a soul left who cares for me" he refuted, sounding defeated.  
“我现在一无所有了……没有一个灵魂关心我”他反驳道，听起来很沮丧。

"I care! Do you not see?! You think I would lay with some random person like I'm some common whore?! No! I chose you because I love you!" the princess exclaimed.  
“我在乎！你难道看不见吗？！你以为我会像个普通妓女一样和随便什么人上床吗？！不！我选择你，因为我爱你！”公主惊呼道。

The knight looked at her shocked, unable to believe his ears.  
骑士惊讶地看着她，不敢相信自己的耳朵。

"I can see you're the one who does not care" she said with venom, turning to leave.  
“我看得出来你不在乎，”她恶狠狠地说，转身要走。

"Wait!" the knight shouted.  
“等等！”骑士喊道。

The princess stopped and turned around, moving back to the prison bars. The knight stood up and walked over to the bars, reaching through them to hold her hand.  
公主停下来转身，回到牢房的栏杆前。骑士站起来走到栏杆前，伸出手握住她的手。

"Thank you for your kind words… I also love you Adelita… but there is nothing that can be done" he conceded.  
“感谢你的好意……我也爱你，阿德莉塔……但没有什么办法可以做到”他承认道。

The princess gripped his hand firmly. "I will speak with the king. I will find a way!" she said desperately.  
公主紧紧握住他的手。“我会和国王谈谈。我会找到办法的！”她绝望地说。

"Do not worry Adelita, I chose this path and I accept it" he said, trying to comfort her.  
“别担心，阿德莉塔，我选择了这条路，我接受它”他安慰她道。

"I cannot accept this! Alas… I must go before someone finds me here, goodnight my knight" she finished, before hurrying off.  
“我无法接受！唉……我必须在有人发现我之前离开，晚安，我的骑士。”她说完，便匆匆离去。

The knight looked after her as she disappeared before going back to sleep. He woke up the next day to a pair of men picking him up and dragging him out. The knight was brought to a courtyard and dragged to the middle where there was a headstock. The executioner stood there, sharpening his axe. Jonathan's head was placed in the headstock before locking it. He looked up and saw the king and the princess sitting in front of him.  
骑士看着她消失，然后回去睡觉。第二天，他醒来时，一对人把他抬起来拖了出去。骑士被带到一个庭院，拖到中间，那里有一个绞刑架。刽子手站在那里，磨着他的斧头。乔纳森的头被放在绞刑架上，然后锁住。他抬起头，看到国王和公主坐在他面前。

"Now my dear, you will see this vile man killed, you will have your vengeance" the king announced. The princess herself had a sick look on her face.  
“现在，我的亲爱的，你将看到这个卑鄙的人被杀，你将得到你的报复。”国王宣布道。公主自己脸上露出病态的表情。

"Executioner, have him beheaded!" the king commanded.  
“刽子手，砍了他的头！”国王命令道。

The man brought up his axe and walked over to the knight's head. He placed the blade over his head and got ready to swing. He lifted his axe and swung, but just before the knight was decapitated, the princess screamed with all her might.  
那人举起斧头，走到骑士面前。他把刀刃放在骑士头上，准备挥动。他举起斧头挥动，但就在骑士被斩首之前，公主用尽全力尖叫。

"Wait!" “等等！”

The executioner halted mere millimetres from the knight's head while everyone turned to the princess expectantly.  
刽子手在离骑士头部几毫米的地方停了下来，这时所有人都满怀期待地转向公主。

"This can't happen! That man does not deserve to die, he has done nothing wrong!" Adelita shouted, beginning to cry. "_I_ was the one who chose to lay with him, him being a humble person accepted the blame to keep peace in this land. He has done nothing but dutifully serve his country!" she explained.  
“这不可能！那个人不值得死，他什么错都没有！”阿德莉塔大喊，开始哭泣。“是我选择和他睡觉，他是一个谦卑的人，为了保持这片土地的和平而接受了指责。他所做的只是尽职尽责地为他的国家服务！”她解释道。

"Adelita… I was ready to die, you did not have to save me" the knight let out, though he was relieved he wasn't going to die.  
“阿黛丽塔……我已做好赴死的准备，你本不必救我”骑士如释重负地吐出这句话，尽管他并不想死。

"I was not ready to accept your death…" the princess replied.  
“我还没有做好接受你死亡的准备……”公主回答道。

"A true knight to the end" the king commented, "You almost had me execute a knight with more honour than anyone I've known"  
国王评论道：“到最后都是真正的骑士”，“你差点让我处决了一个比我认识的任何人都更有荣誉的骑士”

"I did not wish for it to happen this way, and he was the one who took the blame upon himself selflessly" the princess elaborated.  
“我并不希望事情会变成这样，而他却无私地将责任揽在了自己身上。”公主解释道。

"Princess, you knew what you were doing and what would happen, so why did you lay with this man?" the king asked, confused by her decision.  
“公主，你知道你在做什么，会发生什么，那你为什么还要和这个男人上床？”国王问，对她做出的决定感到困惑。

"Because I love him, no offence to you Your Highness, but I did not want this. I was forced into this arranged marriage" the princess answered.  
“因为我爱他，殿下，恕我直言，我并不想要这样。我是被迫接受这门包办婚姻的。”公主回答道。

"But that is customary" the king said matter-of-factly.  
“但这是惯例，”国王实事求是地说。

"I implore you Your Majesty, I will go ahead with this marriage, or you can imprison me instead, but please do not kill that man" she begged.  
“我恳求您陛下，我将继续这门婚事，或者您也可以将我监禁起来，但请不要杀死那个人。”她恳求道。

"Give me a moment" the king commanded, as he began to ponder for a while.  
“给我一点时间”国王命令道，因为他开始思考一会儿。

The king then spoke up, "I have grown old in age, I doubt I can bear this country an heir. With this in mind and seeing the nobility of this man, I think I put my kingdom in safe hands when I say that this man will be my heir. Therefore, Princess you will be married to this 'prince' and no war will occur" he announced.  
国王随后说道，“我已年迈，我怀疑我能否为这个国家生下继承人。考虑到这一点，并看到这个人的高贵，我认为当我说这个人将是我的继承人时，我将我的王国交到了安全的手中。因此，公主，你将嫁给这个‘王子’，并且不会发生战争。”他宣布。

The princess smiled widely, unable to believe the king's kindness. "Thank you O wise and generous king" she said, hugging him and kissing him on the cheek.  
公主开心地笑了，她无法相信国王的仁慈。“谢谢您，睿智而慷慨的国王。”她说，拥抱了他并在他的脸颊上亲吻了一下。

"Think nothing of it my daughter, it would be a sin to separate you two lovers" the king replied. "Release sir Jonathan!" the king commanded.  
“我的女儿，不要放在心上，拆散你们这对恋人将是一种罪过。”国王回答道。“释放乔纳森爵士！”国王命令道。

The executioner unlocked the headstock and freed the knight. The princess ran over to him and hugged him, sobbing on his shoulder.  
刽子手解开了绞架，释放了骑士。公主跑过去抱住他，在他肩上抽泣。

"There, there Adelita it's all over" the knight said, calming her.  
“好了，好了，阿黛丽塔，一切都结束了。”骑士说道，安抚着她。

At this point, the curtains were closed; the play was finished. The teacher and the other students began clapping, grateful to finally have done a full run.  
此时，窗帘拉上了；戏剧结束了。老师和其他的学生开始鼓掌，感谢终于完成了一场完整的演出。

"Good work class! We've had a full run through of the play, just keep practising to perfect it and we'll be prepared to present it" the teacher praised. "Time to get out of your costumes and clean up the set. Afterwards, come sit down for your dismissal" he instructed.  
“干得好，同学们！我们已经完整地演练了一遍，只要继续练习，把它完善，我们就能做好准备去表演了。”老师表扬道。“现在脱下你们的戏服，清理一下舞台。之后，坐下来等放学。”他指示道。

The class split up to change out of their costumes and pack away props just like yesterday. Eventually, all the props were taken off the stage and together with the costumes were placed back into the storeroom. The stage was cleaned up and the class sat down together in front of the teacher.  
就像昨天一样，班级解散去换掉戏服，收拾道具。最后，所有道具都被搬下舞台，和戏服一起放回储藏室。舞台被清理干净，班级在老师面前坐了下来。

"Now there are no more practice sessions at school, so lessons return to normal. School finishes in a few minutes. Class dismissed" the teacher finished.  
“现在学校里没有练习了，所以课程恢复正常。学校几分钟后就放学了。下课。”老师说完了。

The students all rushed out of the room, eager to go home. Shinji walked up beside Asuka as they exited the room to notify her of his plans.  
学生们都冲出教室，急于回家。真嗣在他们离开教室时走到明日香身边，通知她他的计划。

"Hey Asuka, I'm going to hang out with my friends now, no need to wait up for me" Shinji informed.  
“明日香，我要和朋友出去玩了，不用等我”真嗣说。

"Sure… I'll go hang out with Hikari then. When you're done just come by her place, I'll send you the address and we can walk home together" the redhead replied.  
“好的……那我去找光了。你忙完了直接去她那，我发地址给你，我们一起走回去。”红发少女说道。

"Sounds like a plan! I'll see you later then my princess" he joked.  
“听起来不错！那么我稍后见，我的公主。”他开玩笑说。

"Urgh, don't start that again" she said, grimacing at the boy.  
“呃，别再开始了，”她对男孩说，并对他做了个鬼脸。

Not wanting to risk it with a kiss, Shinji instead gave Asuka's hand a small squeeze before moving off to find his two friends. It didn't take long to find Touji and Kensuke, the two of them waved at Shinji as he walked up to them.  
真嗣不想冒险亲吻，而是轻轻握了握明日香的手，然后转身去找他的两个朋友。没过多久就找到了冬治和剑介，他们俩向走过来的真嗣挥手。

"Hey guys! I'm all set to go" Shinji declared.  
“伙计们！我准备好了”真嗣宣布道。

"Let's go eat! My shout!" Touji let out enthusiastically. "I'll show you the way" he said, turning around and leading the two forward.  
“走，吃饭去！我请客！”东治热情地说，“我带路。”说着，转身领着两人向前走去。

"Hooray for Shinji's return! Let's do this" Kensuke joined in.  
“真嗣君回来真是太好了！我们一起加油吧”健介也附和道。

"Hooray for great friends!" Shinji responded.  
“为好朋友干杯！”真嗣回应道。

Thus, the trio began their celebration, all eager to fool around and relax with each other.  
于是，三人组开始了他们的庆祝，都渴望互相嬉戏和放松。

---

It was late afternoon when Shinji began walking towards Hikari's house. The boy had just partied with his two friends, enjoying the time they spent together; he had really missed it after weeks without seeing them. The boys had first started with eating at a noodle joint that Touji recommended, chatting and fooling around as they ate. They talked about the past few weeks at school, the play, the girls in the class, video games and several other topics. Touji didn't miss the opportunity to tease Shinji about Asuka, and Shinji responded in kind about Hikari while Kensuke just laughed, happy not to be the target of any jokes.  
"当真嗣开始朝光的家走去时，已经是傍晚了。这个男孩刚刚和他的两个朋友聚会，享受着他们在一起的时光；在几周没有见到他们之后，他真的很想念他们。这些男孩首先在冬治推荐的一家面馆吃饭，一边吃一边聊天和嬉戏。他们谈论了学校过去几周发生的事情、戏剧、班上的女孩、电子游戏和许多其他话题。冬治没有错过取笑真嗣关于明日香的机会，而真嗣也以同样的方式回应了光，而剑介只是笑着，高兴自己没有成为任何笑话的目标。

Afterwards, they had head over to Kensuke's house to play some video games. Kensuke's parents served them tea and they spent the rest of their time playing against each other. Various shouts, curses and praises could be heard as they battled it out. They were so engrossed in gaming, that time just flew by and Shinji realised he should probably get back home for Misato's sake; he imagined his guardian wanted to eat dinner. The male eva pilot said his goodbyes reluctantly before leaving and waving his friends off. He checked his phone for Asuka's message containing Hikari's address and head towards the place.  
之后，他们前往剑介家玩电子游戏。剑介的父母给他们上了茶，他们剩下的时间都在对战中度过。在他们激战时，可以听到各种各样的喊声、咒骂声和赞美声。他们如此沉迷于游戏，以至于时间飞逝，真嗣意识到他应该为了美里回家了；他想象他的监护人想吃晚饭。这位男性 EVA 驾驶员不情愿地告别，然后离开并向他的朋友们挥手告别。他查看了手机上明日香包含光地址的信息，然后朝那个地方走去。

It didn't take long for Shinji to reach Hikari's residence and he walked up the door, ringing the doorbell. Footsteps could soon be heard and someone came to open the door for him. Shinji was greeted by an older woman, unfamiliar to him.  
真嗣很快就到达了光的住所，他走到门口，按响了门铃。很快就能听到脚步声，有人来给他开门。真嗣受到了一位年长女性的欢迎，他并不认识她。

"Hello" the woman greeted.  
""你好"这位女士打招呼道。

"H-Hi, I'm Shinji Ikari, a classmate of Hikari, are Asuka and Hikari here?" Shinji asked, making sure he was at the right place.  
“H-嗨，我是碇真嗣，光同学的同学，明日香和光同学在吗？”真嗣问道，确认自己没有走错地方。

"Who is it, mum?" a familiar voice called out; it was Hikari.  
“是谁啊，妈妈？”一个熟悉的声音传来，是光。

"It's a boy named Shinji Ikari" the mother of Hikari turned slightly back to reply.  
“是一个叫碇真嗣的男生。”光的妈妈稍稍转过身来回答。

"Oh, the idiot has finally arrived" another familiar voice called out, none other than Asuka. Shinji's face flushed a little at Asuka's remark.  
“哦，这个白痴终于到了。”另一个熟悉的声音喊道，正是明日香。真嗣的脸因为明日香的话语而微微泛红。

"Come on in" Hikari's mum said, motioning Shinji to come inside.  
“进来吧。”光子的妈妈说道，示意真嗣进屋。

"Thank you!" Shinji replied.  
“谢谢！”真嗣回答道。

The boy entered inside and closed the door behind him before being greeted by a grinning redhead walking out of the corridor with Hikari in tow.  
男孩走进去，关上门，然后一个红发女郎从走廊里走出来，带着光，向他打招呼。

"Did you have a good time fooling around with the two stooges?" Asuka teased.  
"你玩弄那两个傻瓜玩得开心吗？""明日香取笑道。

"Yeah, it was great. I had a lot of fun. What about you? Did you two have a good time as well?" Shinji responded.  
"是的，太棒了。我玩得很开心。你呢？你们也玩得很开心吗？""真嗣回答道。

"Mmm, Hikari's family treated me to dinner before I went to Hikari's room where we had a good long talk. She also showed me a few things she had been making, she's really good at arts and craft if you didn't know" Asuka answered.  
“嗯，光的家人在我去光房间之前请我吃了晚饭，我们在那里好好聊了一阵。她还给我展示了她做的一些东西，如果你不知道的话，她真的很擅长艺术和手工。”明日香回答道。

"Would Ikari like something to drink?" the mother asked, sensing a pause in the conversation.  
“碇君要不要喝点什么？”母亲问道，她感觉到了谈话中的停顿。

"No thanks Mrs. Horaki, I am not staying here… I came to pick up Asuka" Shinji explained.  
“不用了，堀崎夫人，我不会留在这里……我是来接明日香的。”真嗣解释道。

"There's no rush is there?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow.  
“不着急吧？”明日香问道，挑了挑眉毛。

"I don't want to have Misato wait too long for us to come back home" he elaborated.  
“我不想让美里等我们太久才回家。”他解释道。

"Ah yeah, fair enough… it is getting a bit late" Asuka agreed.  
“啊，对，说得对……确实有点晚了。”明日香同意道。

"How was Touji?" Hikari asked Shinji.  
“冬治怎么样？”光问真嗣。

"He was fine? We ate and played some video games after. He seemed to be having fun too" Shinji answered.  
“他很好？我们吃了饭，然后玩了一些电子游戏。他看起来也很开心。”真嗣回答。

"Are you worried there's a bromance going on or something?" Asuka said cheekily, elbowing Hikari gently.  
“你担心他们之间有什么兄弟情谊吗？”明日香调皮地说，轻轻用肘部碰了碰光。

"No! I was just curious… jeez Asuka!" Hikari said, defending herself; Shinji was glad he wasn't the only one Asuka teased.  
“不！我只是好奇而已……天哪，明日香！”光说，为自己辩解；真嗣很高兴自己不是明日香唯一取笑的对象。

"Yeah yeah… in any case like Shinji mentioned, it's best we head off. Twas fun my dear, we should definitely do this again" the redhead remarked.  
“是是……无论如何，就像真嗣提到的，我们最好出发了。亲爱的，很开心，我们一定要再做一次。”红发女郎评论道。

"Yes of course" Hikari said, smiling warmly.  
“当然。”光说，热情地微笑着。

"Thank you for your hospitality Mrs. Horaki" Asuka said, bowing. Shinji followed suit and said his thanks as well.  
“谢谢您的款待，堀崎夫人。”明日香鞠躬说道。真嗣紧随其后，也表达了自己的谢意。

"No problem, come anytime" the mother replied.  
“没问题，随时欢迎你们来玩。”这位母亲回答道。

"Alright, let's go Shinji" Asuka said, heading towards the door.  
“好了，真嗣，我们走吧。”明日香说着，走向门口。

Shinji followed the redhead to the door and the two eva pilots said their goodbyes, waving at the Horaki family. After all the goodbyes, the two teens exited the house, with the door being closed behind them. The couple began their stroll back home, both feeling relaxed. As it was late afternoon, it was already getting dark. Cars had their lights on and the street lights were lit, illuminating their faces as they walked. Shinji took the girl's hand as they continued walking.  
真嗣跟着红发女孩走到门口，两位 EVA 驾驶员道别，向堀崎一家挥手。在道别之后，两个少年走出了房子，门在他们身后关上了。这对情侣开始悠闲地往家走。由于是傍晚，天已经黑了。汽车开着灯，路灯亮着，照亮了他们走路时的脸。真嗣牵着女孩的手，继续走着。

"How are you feeling at the moment Asuka?" Shinji asked, already halfway to their apartment.  
"你现在感觉怎么样，明日香？""真嗣问道，他已经走到公寓一半的路程了。

"Fine… I certainly had my fill of entertainment" Asuka answered. "And you?"  
"很好……我当然已经得到了足够的娱乐""明日香回答道。""你呢？"

"Yeah, I'm good… after spending several weeks without seeing them, it was good to catch up and just hang out. They teased me about us and the play too of course" Shinji replied. "Speaking of which, what did you think of the play?" he added.  
“是啊，我很好……在几个星期没见到他们之后，能赶上并一起出去玩真是太好了。他们当然也拿我们和那部戏取笑我。”真嗣回答道。“说到这个，你觉得那部戏怎么样？”他补充道。

"The play was interesting, though I have to say it was a bit too soapy. I mean a happy ending like that it's so unrealistic" the redhead remarked.  
“那部戏很有趣，不过我不得不说有点太肥皂剧了。我的意思是，像那样的皆大欢喜结局太不现实了。”红发男子评论道。

"You'd prefer the knight and princess both die?" Shinji asked.  
“你宁愿骑士和公主都死掉吗？”真嗣问道。

"Well, no… I don't prefer it… but I just mean those sorts of happy endings don't really happen in reality" Asuka explained.  
“嗯，不……我不喜欢……但我的意思是，那种幸福的结局在现实中并不存在。”明日香解释道。

"You don't think people can have a happy ending?" Shinji shot back.  
“你不认为人们可以拥有幸福的结局吗？”真嗣反驳道。

"There are a lot of difficulties in real life relationships, a lot of marriages turn into divorce, girlfriends and boyfriends break up. People always leave each other in the end, even if it means by death" Asuka elaborated.  
“现实生活中的关系有很多困难，很多婚姻都变成了离婚，女朋友和男朋友分手。人们最终总是会离开彼此，即使这意味着死亡。”明日香详细解释道。

"So you're saying… _we_ won't have a happy ending?" Shinji prompted; he really wanted to understand Asuka's train of thought.  
“所以你的意思是……我们不会有一个幸福的结局？”真嗣追问；他真的很想理解明日香的思路。

"I didn't mean that… I wasn't saying that" Asuka refuted.  
“我不是那个意思……我不是那个意思。”明日香反驳道。

"Well, you did say people _always_ leave each other" Shinji pointed out.  
“好吧，你说过人们总是会离开彼此的。”真嗣指出。

"Look Shinji… this was one of the reasons it was so hard to accept this relationship. I can't take another person abandoning me. In my logical reasoning, all I could see was - no matter whom the person - they would eventually leave me. But… you were different. You promised you'd never leave me with such honesty, it made me feel like no matter what happened, even if I said I hated you, you'd stay and endure me" Asuka admitted.  
“看，真嗣……这是我很难接受这段关系的原因之一。我无法再承受另一个人抛弃我了。在我的逻辑推理中，我所能看到的只是——无论那个人是谁——他们最终都会离开我。但是……你不同。你承诺过无论发生什么事，你都不会离开我，这让我觉得，即使我说我讨厌你，你也会留下来忍受我。”明日香承认道。

The boy looked at her tenderly, feeling the urge to comfort her and subsequently hugged her tight. "Is that why you were so upset about the thing with Rei? I'm so sorry" he apologised.  
男孩深情地看着她，感到一股安慰她的冲动，随后紧紧地抱住了她。“这就是你对丽的事情如此不安的原因吗？我真的很抱歉。”他道歉道。

"Honestly, you are such a baka" she replied, rolling her eyes.  
“老实说，你真是个笨蛋。”她回答道，翻了个白眼。

"Yeah and I'm your baka" he joked.  
“是啊，我是你的笨蛋。”他开玩笑说。

Asuka couldn't help her lips from twitching a bit. "Let's just get home" she finished.  
明日香忍不住嘴唇抽动了一下。“我们回家吧。”她说完。

They walked the rest of the way in comfortable silence, entering their building and taking the elevator to their floor. After entering their living place, they called out "We're home." No response. They closed the door and went to the living room to check for their guardian. Shinji checked Misato's room while Asuka checked the bathroom, both unsuccessful in locating human life; there was no one here.  
他们舒适地沉默着走完了剩下的路，走进他们的公寓，乘电梯到他们的楼层。走进他们的住所后，他们喊道：“我们回来了。”没有回应。他们关上门，走到客厅寻找他们的监护人。真嗣检查了美里的房间，明日香检查了浴室，都没有找到人类的踪迹；这里没有人。

"I didn't see Misato in the morning either, so she's been gone since then and it's already this late… I wonder what's going on?" Shinji commented.  
“早上也没见到美里，她从那时起就不见了，现在已经这么晚了……我很好奇发生了什么事？”真嗣评论道。

"Must be something happening at NERV… we can ask her when she comes back" she remarked.  
“NERV 肯定发生了什么事……等她回来我们可以问问她”她评论道。

"Good idea… I'm not hungry at the moment as I ate with Touji and Kensuke, I'll make supper later unless you're hungry?" Shinji mentioned.  
“好主意……我刚和冬治和剑介一起吃过饭，现在不饿，除非你饿了，否则我晚点再做晚饭？”真嗣说道。

"No, I'm good. Like I said, I had a nice dinner with Hikari's family" Asuka replied.  
“不，我很好。就像我说的，我和光一家人吃了一顿美餐。”明日香回答道。

"Well then… hmmm…" Shinji pondered, going to sit on the couch.  
“那好吧……嗯……”真嗣沉思着，走到沙发上坐下。

"We could watch TV?" Asuka suggested.  
“我们可以看电视吗？”明日香建议道。

"Actually, you reminded me… I was playing video games at Kensuke's place and I got a bit of practise… maybe I have a chance at beating you now. Do you want to play and find out?" Shinji challenged.  
“说起来，你提醒我了……我在健介家玩电子游戏，练了一点……也许我现在有机会打败你了。你想玩玩看吗？”真嗣挑战道。

"You'll never beat me in any game Shinji, you should know that by now" the girl said, smirking.  
“真嗣，你永远都赢不了我，这一点你应该很清楚了。”女孩得意地笑着说。

Shinji recalled the many evenings in the arcade being smashed by her; he knew her declaration was well grounded.  
真嗣回忆起在游戏厅里被她打败的无数个夜晚；他知道她的宣言是有根据的。

"Well, practising against you makes me better, so who knows" Shinji said, shrugging his shoulders.  
“好吧，和你对练让我进步不少，所以谁知道呢”真嗣耸耸肩说道。

The two teens took out their PlayStation console and connected it to the TV. Shinji looked through their games, trying to decide which game he played best at today. He made his choice and inserted the game. They both sat down together on the couch, controllers in hand, while Street Fighter loaded up. Choosing their characters, the two eva pilots began their fight. The sound of button mashing was heard throughout as they played vigorously. After some time, Shinji was winning at 10 rounds to Asuka's 8.  
这两个少年拿出了他们的 PlayStation 游戏机并把它连接到电视上。真嗣浏览着他们的游戏，试图决定今天他最擅长玩哪款游戏。他做出了选择并插入了游戏。他们俩一起坐在沙发上，手持控制器，而街头霸王正在加载。选择好角色后，这两个 EVA 驾驶员开始了他们的战斗。随着他们激烈地玩着，按按钮的声音响彻整个房间。过了一会儿，真嗣以 10 比 8 的比分赢了明日香。

"Oh, so I'll _never_ beat you, is that right?" Shinji said smugly.  
“哦，所以我永远都赢不了你，是吗？”真嗣得意洋洋地说。

"I should've known this is what I would get for going easy on you. Besides, I was just surprised you weren't playing terribly for once" she rebuked.  
“我就知道对你手下留情会落得这样的下场。再说，我只不过惊讶于你居然没有像往常一样打得那么糟糕罢了。”她责备道。

"Suuuuure" Shinji replied sarcastically.  
“当然了。”真嗣讽刺地回答道。

"That's it!" she spat angrily.  
“够了！”她愤怒地吐道。

The redhead focused properly and began to play far better, beating Shinji relentlessly. The score had soon changed to Shinji still at 10 and Asuka at 20. The boy realised he didn't really stand a chance and decided to change tactics. As the redhead was concentrating on the screen, he used one hand to reach under her skirt and rub her panties. Asuka moaned and lost her concentration while Shinji spammed buttons and killed her.  
红发女郎集中注意力，开始打得更好，无情地击败真嗣。比分很快变为真嗣仍然是 10 分，明日香是 20 分。男孩意识到自己真的没有机会，于是决定改变策略。当红发女郎专注于屏幕时，他用一只手伸到她的裙子下面，摩擦她的内裤。明日香呻吟着，失去了注意力，而真嗣则疯狂地按着按钮，杀死了她。

"What the hell was that?! Don't play dirty Ikari!" Asuka shot at him, not appreciating his cheating.  
“那是什么鬼东西？！别耍赖皮，伊卡利！”明日香朝他开枪，对他的作弊行为表示不满。

"I don't know what you're talking about" Shinji replied mock innocently.  
“我不知道你在说什么。”真嗣假装天真地回答。

The girl just scowled in response. The boy continued to "subtly" distract her as they played, turning the score completely around, bringing them to a tie of 24 each; first to reach 25 rounds would win the match.  
那个女孩只是回应着皱起了眉头。那个男孩在他们玩的时候继续“巧妙地”分散她的注意力，完全扭转了比分，使他们打成了 24 平手；先达到 25 轮的人将赢得比赛。

"Don't think I don't know what you're doing Shinji. I'm surprised you'd stoop so low just to beat me" she let out, irritated.  
“别以为我不知道你在做什么，真嗣。我惊讶你为了打败我竟然会如此卑鄙。”她恼怒地说。

"Maybe I'm just better than you and you're making up excuses" he replied, holding back a laugh.  
“也许我只是比你强，而你在找借口。”他回答道，忍住笑。

"I'll never let you win again" she declared stubbornly.  
“我再也不会让你赢了。”她固执地宣称。

This time he slowly slipped off the couch onto the floor, before quickly moving under her, pulling her panties down and bringing his head up her skirt to lick her moist vagina. Asuka let out a loud moan, instinctively opening her legs giving him more room to attack, accidentally dropping her controller in surprise. Shinji took advantage of the situation, punishing her character while Asuka was struggling to pick up her controller. The redhead managed to retrieve her controller just as she died, giving Shinji the win. The redhead kicked him away, looking at the TV, noticing it say that Shinji had won. She instantly turned off the console, preventing it from recording the win.  
这次他慢慢地从沙发上滑到地板上，然后迅速移动到她身下，拉下她的内裤，把头伸进她的裙子里舔她湿润的阴道。明日香发出一声响亮的呻吟，本能地张开双腿，给他更多的攻击空间，意外地惊掉了她的控制器。真嗣利用这个机会，惩罚她的角色，而明日香正在努力捡起她的控制器。红发女郎在她死的时候设法拿回了她的控制器，让真嗣赢了。红发女郎把他踢开，看着电视，注意到上面写着真嗣赢了。她立即关闭了游戏机，防止它记录下胜利。

"I don't appreciate you cheating third child and so blatantly too" Asuka said with her arms crossed.  
“我不赞赏你作弊，三子，而且如此明目张胆。”明日香双臂抱胸说道。

"As if I was cheating" he shot back, pretending to sound offended.  
“好像我在作弊一样，”他反驳道，假装听起来很生气。

"Oh really? How stupid do you think I am?" she replied, pointing to her panties around her ankles. "These didn't just magically slip off now did they?"  
“哦，真的吗？你以为我有多蠢？”她回答道，指着脚踝周围的内裤。“它们不会就这样神奇地滑落，对吧？”

"Aww come on Asuka, it's just a game" Shinji said, sticking his tongue out at her.  
“啊，来吧，明日香，这只是一个游戏，”真嗣说道，朝她吐了吐舌头。

"One that didn't count nor was it recorded, you have no proof you won" she refuted, sticking her tongue out in return. "Though I'll admit you played much better than previously, you still can't beat me"  
"她反驳道：“那场不算，也没有记录，你没有证据证明你赢了。”她吐了吐舌头。“虽然我承认你比以前打得好了很多，但你仍然赢不了我。”

Grinning cheekily, the boy pushed the girl up against the wall. He ever so irritatingly brushed his knee against her exposed private region, making her squirm a little.  
“男孩得意地笑着，把女孩推到墙上。他非常讨厌地用膝盖蹭了蹭她暴露的私处，让她有点扭动。”

"I can still beat you in this" Shinji whispered into her ear. He then kissed her hard on the lips, slipping his tongue inside her mouth and using his free hands to roam about her body. "How long haven't we had sex?" he asked, parting.  
“我仍然可以在这个方面打败你。”真嗣在她耳边低语。然后他用力吻了吻她的嘴唇，把舌头伸进她的嘴里，用空闲的手在她的身体上游走。“我们有多久没做爱了？”他问道，分开。

"Don't tell me you actually forgot" she replied aspiratingly, "We only _screwed each other's brains out_ two days ago"
“别告诉我你真的忘了，”她有气无力地回答，“我们才在两天前把彼此的脑子都搞出来了”

"Feels like years" the boy remarked.
“感觉像过了好几年”男孩评论道。

At his comment, Shinji slowly pulled off Asuka's shirt, allowing it to fall to the floor. He held her shoulders while he moved his mouth down to trail kisses along her neck. The boy teasingly licked the hollows in her neck while slowly moving his hand behind her back. Shinji unhooked the girl's bra, pulling it off and throwing it to the other side of the room. The girl followed suit, stepping out of her panties and kicking them off. The boy looked down admiringly at her soft firm breasts before moving further down and kissing her in the valley between her two orbs. Asuka moaned softly and ran her hand affectionately through his thick brown hair. She used her other hand to gradually take off his shirt.
听到他的话，真嗣慢慢地脱下明日香的衬衫，任由它掉落在地板上。他扶着她的肩膀，同时将嘴移到她的脖子上，沿着她的脖子留下吻痕。男孩挑逗地舔着她的脖子上的凹陷，同时慢慢地将手移到她的背后。真嗣解开女孩的胸罩，脱下来扔到房间的另一边。女孩也照做了，脱下她的内裤并踢掉它们。男孩钦佩地看着她柔软而坚挺的乳房，然后进一步向下，吻着她的两个乳房之间的山谷。明日香轻轻地呻吟着，深情地用她的手穿过他浓密的棕色头发。她用另一只手逐渐脱下他的衬衫。

Shinji proceeded to suck her erect nipples, sliding his tongue around the little bud deliciously; the girl wriggled a little at his ministrations. He then moved one hand down her back to fondle her ass, while the other tended to her other breast. Asuka managed to finally pull off the boy's shirt and wrapped her arms around him, pulling him closer to her, enjoying feeling his skin directly. The redhead moaned loudly as Shinji's face was pressed against her chest, gently stimulating her sensitive globes. The boy moved off the girl for a moment and Asuka used the opportunity to mirror him, bringing her face down to his chest. The girl gently suckled and flicked his nipple with her tongue while her hand reached down to unbuckle his trousers. Shinji stroked her silky-smooth hair and traced his finger along her back, making her shiver.
信治开始吮吸她勃起的乳头，舌头在小蓓蕾上滑动，十分美味；女孩在他的抚摸下扭动了几下。然后，他将一只手移到她的背上抚摸她的屁股，另一只手则抚摸她的另一个乳房。明日香终于成功地脱掉了男孩的衬衫，双手环抱着他，把他拉近自己，享受着直接感受他肌肤的感觉。当真嗣的脸贴在她的胸前，轻轻刺激她敏感的乳房时，红发女孩大声呻吟起来。男孩从女孩身上移开了一会儿，明日香利用这个机会与他对视，把脸贴到了他的胸膛上。女孩用舌头轻轻地吮吸和拨弄他的乳头，同时把手伸到下面去解他的裤带。真嗣抚摸着她如丝般顺滑的秀发，手指沿着她的后背划过，让她不禁颤抖起来。

When Asuka finished removing his pants, Shinji returned the favour and started on her skirt. Both their bodies heated up in excitement and the redhead, growing impatient, helped him take off her skirt; the last piece of her clothing. She then kissed him aggressively, rubbing herself against his lower region. Asuka felt his growing member, pleading for attention. The boy kissed her roughly as she slipped off his boxers, rubbing his erect cock against her thighs. They two stood there; Asuka pinned against the wall, Shinji all over her, both completely naked. Shinji positioned himself at the entrance to her lower lips and teased her moist slit with his tip. He planted wet kisses on her breasts, enjoying the frustration the redhead felt as he continued to delay.  
当明日香脱完裤子后，真嗣也回礼，开始脱她的裙子。他们俩的身体都因兴奋而发热，红发女郎不耐烦了，帮他脱掉了裙子，这是她身上的最后一件衣服。然后她激烈的吻了他，用身体蹭着他的下体。明日香感觉到了他不断壮大的成员，恳求着关注。男孩粗暴地吻了她，她脱下他的内裤，用大腿摩擦着他勃起的阴茎。他们俩站在那里；明日香被压在墙上，真嗣压在她身上，两人都赤身裸体。真嗣将自己放在她下唇的入口处，用他的尖端挑逗着她湿润的缝隙。他在她的乳房上种下湿吻，享受着红发女郎因他继续拖延而产生的挫败感。

"Why must you always delay!" Asuka let out impatiently.  
“为什么你总是拖延！”明日香不耐烦地说。

"I don't like to rush" Shinji replied, grinning, "Open your legs wider please"  
“我不喜欢匆忙，”真嗣笑着回答，“请把你的腿张得更开。”

The girl gave a "hmpf" before doing so and Shinji lifted her up, supporting her on his hips while holding her up with his arms. Asuka held onto him tightly, her breasts pressing into his chest. She wrapped her legs around his waist and began to trail kisses along his neck and shoulders. The boy used his leverage to plunge her down onto his cock while thrusting up.  
女孩在这样做之前发出一声“哼”，真嗣将她抱起来，用手臂托住她，让她坐在自己的腰上。明日香紧紧地抱住他，她的胸部压在他的胸前。她双腿缠绕在他的腰上，开始在他的脖子和肩膀上留下吻痕。男孩利用自己的优势将她压在自己的阴茎上，同时向上挺动。

"God!" she cried. "天啊！"她喊道。

Shinji grunted in pleasure as his cock sunk into her tight warm pussy. Asuka pulled him closer to her, trying to get his cock as deep inside her as possible as he continued to penetrate her. The boy continued this rhythm, increasing pace until he was pounding into her relentlessly. The redhead cried with pleasure and ecstasy, her moans so loud Shinji almost lost concentration. He kissed her passionately, feeling her moans on his lips as he pushed inside her. The girl aroused him so much he felt the burning sensation in his cock build up rapidly and he came, his semen spurting up her vagina. Shinji stopped to take a breath and Asuka groaned in frustration.  
真嗣在自己的阴茎沉入她紧致温暖的阴道时发出一声愉悦的呻吟。明日香将他拉得更近，试图让他尽可能地深入她的身体，而他继续贯穿她。男孩继续这种节奏，不断加快速度，直到他无情地撞击着她。红发女孩发出愉悦和狂喜的叫声，她的呻吟声如此响亮，以至于真嗣几乎失去了注意力。他热情地吻着她，在她向他体内推动的同时，感觉到她的呻吟声在他的嘴唇上。这个女孩让他如此兴奋，他感到自己的阴茎中灼烧的感觉迅速增强，他射精了，精液喷涌而出，射进了她的阴道。真嗣停下来喘口气，明日香沮丧地呻吟着。

"Is this now going to be the norm, you cumming before me?" she asked him teasingly.  
“现在这要成为常态了吗，你总在我之前射精？”她挑逗地问他。

"Haha, give me a break, I think that's like only the third time? Your noises were so erotic, I couldn't help it" he retorted.  
“哈哈，别逗了，我想这大概才第三次吧？你的叫声太色情了，我忍不住。”他反驳道。

Asuka laughed before responding, "Well excuse me, you were fucking me so hard I couldn't keep silent"  
明日香在回答之前笑了，“好吧，抱歉，你操我操得太狠了，我忍不住叫出声。”

"Time to get hard again" he said letting her down, planning to give some more foreplay.  
“是时候再次变硬了，”他说着把她放下，打算再做一些前戏。

Eagerly wanting an orgasm, the redhead lowered her head after being let down and began sucking the boy's cock. She licked along his shaft with her tongue expertly, getting it erect in next to no time. Seeing her excitement, Shinji decided to pick Asuka up and carry her over to the dining table before placing her on the table.  
红发女郎渴望高潮，在被放下后低下头，开始吮吸男孩的阴茎。她用舌头熟练地舔着他的阴茎，不一会儿就勃起了。看到她的兴奋，真嗣决定抱起明日香，把她抱到餐桌上，然后把她放在桌子上。

"No fair, I preferred the other position… you always use this damn dining table" the girl protested.  
“不公平，我更喜欢另一个姿势……你总是用这张该死的餐桌，”女孩抗议道。

"I want to last longer for you" he replied, grinning.  
“我想让你更持久一点。”他笑着回答道。

Shinji then pushed open her legs, moving between them and positioning his cock at her entrance again. He held her legs ready to penetrate her; he could feel the moistness and heat radiating out from her pussy. He came again, right then and there; he couldn't believe it, his face shocked. Asuka was growing irritated from the prolonged lack of gratification.  
接着，真嗣推开她的双腿，在它们之间移动，再次将他的阴茎放在她的入口处。他扶着她的双腿，准备进入她；他能感觉到湿润和热量从她的阴道里散发出来。他再次射精，就在那里；他不敢相信，他的脸上充满了震惊。明日香因长时间得不到满足而变得恼怒。

"Shinji, what the hell is wrong?" the redhead asked, sounding annoyed.  
“真嗣，到底怎么了？”红发女郎问道，听起来很恼火。

"I don't know… maybe this is how it usually is for guys" he joked, trying to lighten her mood.  
“我不知道……也许对男人来说通常都是这样，”他开玩笑说，试图让她心情好起来。

Asuka groaned in frustration. "I was pretty close too you bastard. One last chance… if you cum again just give me oral sex… I won't be able to stand this much longer"  
明日香沮丧地呻吟道：“我也快了，你这个混蛋。最后一次机会……如果你再射精，就给我口交……我撑不了多久了”

This time, Shinji moved his hand down to her lower lips and began to run his finger up and down it, finding it dripping wet. His other hand fondled her breast, rolling her nipple in his fingers. Asuka moaned in pleasure, another gush of wetness felt by the boy to which he slipped his finger in easily. As Shinji felt her up, together with the erotic noises the girl made, he felt his member grow to full size again. He did not hesitate another moment and just rammed it straight in, worried about prematurely cumming again. Asuka cried out in pleasure as he used her hips as support, thrusting deep into her.
这一次，真嗣把手移到了她的下唇，开始用手指上下抚摸，发现她的下唇湿漉漉的。他的另一只手抚摸着她的乳房，用手指滚动着她的乳头。明日香发出愉悦的呻吟声，男孩又感觉到一股湿润，他的手指很容易就滑了进去。随着真嗣对她的爱抚，再加上女孩发出的情欲的声音，他感觉到自己的阴茎又长大了一圈。他没有再犹豫，直接插了进去，担心再次早泄。旭日高兴地叫了起来，他用她的臀部作为支撑，深深地插入她的体内。

Shinji could already feel he was close to orgasming and held back as best he could, continuing to plunge into the girl, her cries of pleasure growing louder. The boy could tell Asuka was getting really close and so willed himself to thrust as hard as could, holding back his own release.  
真嗣已经感觉到自己快高潮了，他尽力忍住，继续冲撞着女孩，她愉悦的叫声越来越响亮。男孩可以看出明日香已经非常接近了，于是强迫自己尽可能用力地冲撞，忍住自己的释放。

"Oh God! Oh God I'm gonna cum! Yes, yes, YES!" the girl yelled.  
“哦，天哪！哦，天哪，我要高潮了！是的，是的，是的！”女孩喊道。

No sooner had Asuka said this when she finally orgasmed, screaming with satisfaction. She wrapped her legs around Shinji tightly, pulling him in as far as possible. Her vaginal walls clamped down around Shinji's cock, making him ejaculate again; the boy was relieved at finally being able to let go. Shinji continued to thrust into her pussy, slowing his pace as his cock released its last shot. He then collapsed on top of her, exhausted; they were both breathing deeply. After a bit, the boy withdrew from Asuka, letting her legs down. The redhead sat up unsteadily, having a fairly pleased look on her face. Shinji soon placed his lips over hers and held her gently as they kissed. After parting, they gazed at each other briefly, Asuka with a cheeky expression on her face.  
明日香刚说完这句话，就终于高潮了，她满足地尖叫着。她紧紧地缠住真嗣的腿，尽可能地把他拉近。她的阴道壁夹紧了真嗣的阴茎，让他再次射精；这个男孩终于能够释放了，感到如释重负。真嗣继续冲刺她的阴道，随着他的阴茎释放出最后一次射精，他的速度减慢了。然后他精疲力竭地倒在她身上；他们都呼吸得很深。过了一会儿，这个男孩从明日香身上退了出来，放下了她的腿。红发女郎摇摇晃晃地坐了起来，脸上带着相当满意的表情。真嗣很快把嘴唇贴在她的嘴唇上，轻轻地吻着她。分开后，他们短暂地凝视着对方，明日香脸上带着一个厚颜无耻的表情。

"Best we do no more, Mr. Pointy is a little _too_ excited" the girl teased.  
“我们最好不要再做了，尖先生有点太兴奋了。”女孩取笑道。

Shinji laughed, "Yes good idea… I feel bad though, are you satisfied?" he asked.  
真嗣笑了，“是的，好主意……不过我感觉很糟糕，你满意吗？”他问道。

"Yes, who do you think you're talking to? It's not like I needed it today anyway" she replied.  
“是的，你以为你在和谁说话？反正我今天也不需要它。”她回答道。

The boy smiled and kissed her again, running his hand through her beautiful red hair. He then lifted her to her feet and nuzzled her neck tenderly.  
男孩微笑着再次吻了她，抚摸着她美丽的红发。然后他把她抱起来，温柔地蹭着她的脖子。

"I thought you agreed to stop" she said, pouting.  
“我以为你同意停止了，”她撅着嘴说。

"Fine, fine" he yielded, stopping his actions.  
“好吧，好吧，”他让步，停止了他的动作。

Shinji released her and moved away. Asuka proceeded to pick up her clothes, strewn about the room, and dressed up again.  
真嗣放开她，走开了。明日香开始收拾散落在地上的衣服，重新穿戴整齐。

"I'll go make supper now" the boy announced.  
"我现在去做晚饭""男孩宣布道。

"Sounds good" Asuka replied.  
""听起来不错""明日香答道。

Shinji likewise did as Asuka had and clothed himself, before walking into the kitchen to make supper; it was already quite late, he figured Misato would be back anytime now. He hummed softly as he began to prepare some food for them and their guardian.  
真嗣也像明日香一样穿好衣服，然后走进厨房做晚饭；已经很晚了，他估计美里随时都会回来。他一边哼着小曲，一边开始为他们和他们的监护人准备食物。

---

A distressed Misato had just left the Commander's office. That bastard had told her the truth; everything regarding instrumentality, Seele's intent and the true nature of the evas. The Commander believed "his" scenario was no longer possible and would no longer pursue it. Instead, he started formulating plans to counter Seele. The first part of which was to tell the head of tactical operations, Misato, the truth. She learnt about Rei being a half clone of Shinji's mother and an angel, she found out that the evas each had a soul trapped inside, which was what allowed the evas to be pilotable, among other things.  
痛苦不堪的美里刚刚离开指挥官办公室。那个混蛋告诉了她真相；关于工具性、Seele 的意图和 EVA 的真实本质的一切。指挥官认为“他的”方案不再可行，并且不再追求它。相反，他开始制定反击 Seele 的计划。其中第一步就是告诉战术行动负责人美里真相。她了解到丽是真嗣母亲和一个天使的半克隆人，她发现每个 EVA 内部都困着一个灵魂，这正是 EVA 可以驾驶的原因，除此之外还有其他原因。

"How am I going to tell the children?" the woman thought aloud. "I can't get out of this either, they're going to wonder why I was gone for so long… nor should I keep this from them. I'll have to tell them everything" she continued, before sighing. "Best get this over with"  
“我该怎么告诉孩子们？”这位女士大声思考。“我也不能摆脱这个，他们会想知道我为什么离开这么久……我也不应该对他们隐瞒这件事。我必须告诉他们一切”，她继续说道，然后叹了口气。“最好尽快结束这一切”

Misato decided to get a quick coffee from the cafeteria, to give her a boost before getting back home. The server noticed the Major's downcast appearance and gave her a smile.  
美里决定去自助餐厅买杯速溶咖啡，在回家之前给自己提提神。服务员注意到少校沮丧的表情，对她笑了笑。

"One coffee please, the usual" Misato ordered.  
"来杯咖啡，照旧。""美里点了单。

"No problem! You look down Katsuragi… I've got something that might cheer you up" the NERV cafeteria lady said as she began making the coffee.  
""没问题！你看起来很沮丧，葛城……我这里有些东西可以让你开心一下。""NERV 自助餐厅的女士一边说一边开始煮咖啡。

"Oh really? What is it?" the Major asked, curious.  
“哦，真的吗？是什么？”少校好奇地问道。

"Waffles!" the server exclaimed.  
“华夫饼！”服务员惊呼道。

"I'll pass" Misato replied, hanging her head.  
“我不要。”美里回答道，垂下了头。

The cafeteria lady hesitated for a moment, but sought to help Misato. "Oh come on! You told me the other day how much you loved waffles. You couldn't stop ranting and raving about how your ward made the best waffles you'd ever tasted" she continued, not realising she was making it worse.  
"食堂大妈犹豫了一下，但还是想帮助美里。“哦，拜托！你前几天还告诉我你有多爱华夫饼。你一直喋喋不休地称赞你的病房做了你吃过的最好吃的华夫饼。”她继续说道，没有意识到自己让情况变得更糟了。

"No really! I don't want them" the Major refused, looking a bit sick.  
""真的不要！我不想吃它们。”少校拒绝道，看起来有点恶心。

"I'll put in extra special ingredients just for you" the lady added, not giving up.  
""我会为你添加额外的特殊配料。”这位女士补充道，没有放弃。

Misato pulled out her gun, pointing it at the lady "I DON'T WANT THE WAFFLES!" she yelled.  
美里掏出枪，指着那位女士“我不要华夫饼！”她喊道。

"Alright, alright" the lady replied, sweat dropping.  
“好吧，好吧”那位女士回答，汗流浃背。"

Misato holstered her pistol, before taking her finished coffee and trudging to her car. She entered it and turned on the ignition, before driving out of NERV. The drive back home was far less rushed than usual as the Major pondered how to recount everything to her two wards. Upon arriving at her apartment, she parked her car and downed the remainder of her coffee. Misato slowly entered the building and took the stairs instead of the elevator, trying to delay the inevitable as long as possible. When she eventually reached her floor, the Major mentally prepared herself and opened the door.  
美里将手枪放回枪套，然后端起喝完的咖啡，艰难地走向自己的车。她上了车，发动了引擎，然后驶出了 NERV。回家的路比平时要轻松得多，因为少校在思考如何向她的两个病房讲述这一切。到达公寓后，她把车停好，喝光了剩下的咖啡。美里慢慢走进大楼，爬楼梯而不是乘电梯，尽可能地拖延不可避免的事情。当她最终到达自己的楼层时，少校在心理上做好了准备，打开了门。

"I'm home" Misato called out.  
“我回来了”美里喊道。

Shinji soon came out of the kitchen at her arrival. "Hi Misato, you've been gone a while! I've just finished making supper, I made enough food so you could eat as well" the boy greeted.  
真嗣在她到来时很快从厨房里走了出来。“嗨，美里，你已经离开一段时间了！我刚做完晚饭，我做了足够的食物，所以你也可以吃”男孩打招呼道。

"Thanks Shinji" the woman said gratefully; she hadn't eaten much today and she wanted anything to get her mind off waffles.  
“谢谢真嗣”女人感激地说；她今天没吃多少东西，她想用任何东西来让自己不去想华夫饼。

"Is everything alright Misato?" the boy asked with concern; their guardian was usually a lot more cheerful.  
“没事吧，美里？”男孩关切地问道；他们的监护人通常要开朗得多。

"I'm fine, I'm fine. There's something we will need to discuss after we eat though" Misato answered.  
“我没事，我没事。不过我们吃完饭后需要讨论点事情。”美里回答道。

"Is it serious?" Shinji replied, sounding worried.  
“很严重吗？”真嗣答道，听起来很担心。

"We'll talk after we eat" the Major said firmly.  
“我们吃完饭再说。”少校坚定地说。

"Ok" the boy conceded. He returned to the kitchen to bring the finished meals to the dining table.  
“好的。”男孩让步道。他回到厨房，把做好的饭菜端到餐桌上。

Misato walked over to the dining table and sat down, at which point the other resident showed up.  
美里走到餐桌旁坐下，这时另一位住户出现了。

"Hi Misato!" Asuka said warmly. The young girl had heard her guardian's arrival and figured that supper was probably ready and so came out of her room.  
“嗨，美里！”明日香热情地说。这个小姑娘听到了她监护人的脚步声，猜想晚餐可能已经准备好了，于是从房间里走了出来。

"Hi Asuka" Misato greeted back, giving her a smile.  
“嗨，明日香。”美里回道，对她笑了笑。

Before Asuka could say anything more, Shinji came into the dining room with their meals and placed them onto the table for everyone. The two eva pilots sat down next to each other, ready to dig in.  
在明日香开口之前，真嗣端着他们的饭菜走进了餐厅，把它们放在了桌子上。这两个 EVA 驾驶员坐在了彼此旁边，准备开饭。

"Let's eat!" they all said, before starting their meals.  
“开饭！”他们异口同声地说，然后开始吃饭。

"So Misato, you haven't been here since early morning… did something happen at NERV?" Asuka asked curiously.  
“美里，你从一大早就没来过这里了……NERV 出什么事了吗？”明日香好奇地问道。

Misato stopped eating before responding, "Yeah, we'll talk after we finish eating"  
美里停下来吃饭，然后回答说：“等我们吃完饭再说吧。”

Asuka was a little shocked to hear such a serious tone from her guardian, what could be wrong? "Ok then… does it concern us?" she asked.  
听到监护人如此严肃的语气，明日香有点震惊，出了什么事？“好吧……这和我们有关吗？”她问道。

"It concerns everyone… let's just finish first please" Misato replied sternly.  
“这和每个人都有关……我们先把这吃完好吗？”美里严厉地回答道。

"Ok" Asuka capitulated, not continuing further; she understood this wasn't the time for it.  
“好吧。”明日香屈服了，没有继续追问；她明白现在不是时候。

The trio continued their meal in silence, unable to think of anything to say. Shinji and Asuka were both a little worried about the upcoming discussion. It wasn't long before they all finished eating and the two eva pilots looked at their guardian expectantly.  
三人继续默默地吃饭，谁也想不到该说什么。真嗣和明日香都有些担心即将到来的谈话。没过多久，他们都吃完了，两个 EVA 驾驶员满怀期待地看着他们的监护人。

"Just to alleviate your worries a little, there wasn't any incident at NERV, no accident or anything like that" Misato started, "The nature of this talk is about what the Commander said… something very strange…" she continued.  
“只是为了稍微缓解一下你们的担忧，NERV 没有发生任何事故或类似事件。”美里开始说道，“这次谈话的目的是关于司令说的话……一些非常奇怪的事情……”她继续说道。

"What's that?" Shinji asked.  
“那是什么？”真嗣问道。

"He told me… well… the truth" the Major answered, not sure how to summarise the conversation.  
“他告诉了我……嗯……真相。”少校回答道，不知道该如何总结谈话。

Asuka couldn't help snorting a little. "I'm sure the Commander lies plenty, but surely he's told the truth sometimes?" she retorted.  
明日香忍不住轻哼一声。“我敢肯定司令官撒了很多谎，但他肯定有时也会说实话吧？”她反驳道。

"That's not what I meant Asuka. He told me the truth about NERV, about the evas… about everything…" Misato explained.  
“我不是这个意思，明日香。他告诉我关于 NERV 的真相，关于 EVA 的真相……关于一切的真相……”美里解释道。

"What are you talking about? NERV's purpose is to destroy the angels isn't it?" Shinji replied.  
“你在说什么？NERV 的目的是消灭天使，不是吗？”真嗣回答道。

"Yes and no" Misato answered, "There's a lot to say, but you certainly have a right to know" she started before pausing, getting all the facts ready in her head.  
“是也不是。”美里回答道，“有很多话要说，但你当然有权知道。”她开始说，然后停顿了一下，在脑海中整理好所有事实。

"NERV is funded by an organisation called Seele. They have an ulterior motive for running NERV as did Gendo your father, but they were similar" the Major began. "It'll make more sense if I start by explaining the evas… both of you remember how you lost your mothers don't you?"  
“NERV 由一个名为 Seele 的组织资助。他们经营 NERV 有着不可告人的动机，就像你的父亲源堂一样，但他们是相似的。”少校开始说，“如果我从解释 EVA 开始，会更有意义……你们俩都还记得你们是如何失去母亲的，对吗？”

The two nodded sadly. 两人悲伤地点了点头。

"Well, it turns out that what actually happened in those horrible accidents is that… both your mothers were _absorbed_ by the evas, not unlike how Shinji was absorbed just recently. It would seem the truth is that… the evas cannot run without a soul" Misato elaborated.  
""好吧，事实证明，那些可怕的事故中真正发生的事情是……你们的母亲都被 eva 吸收了，就像真嗣最近被吸收一样。事实似乎是……eva 无法在没有灵魂的情况下运行。""美里解释道。

"You don't mean…?" Asuka said, horrified.  
""你的意思是……？""明日香惊恐地说。

"Yes… both your mother's souls are trapped inside their respective evas. That is why only you two can sync with them properly" Misato answered.  
“是的……你母亲的两个灵魂都被困在各自的 EVA 里。这就是为什么只有你们两个才能与它们正确同步。”美里回答道。

The two eva pilots remained silent, digesting the information; they were unsure of what to think about the revelation. For each of them, the disappearance of their mother caused them such grief and sorrow, and somehow… they had been with them all this time.  
两个 EVA 驾驶员保持沉默，消化着这些信息；他们不确定该对这个启示作何感想。对于他们每个人来说，母亲的失踪都给他们带来了如此巨大的悲伤和痛苦，而不知何故……她们一直与他们在一起。

"Then what about Unit 00?" Shinji asked, breaking the silence.  
“那么 00 号机呢？”真嗣问道，打破了沉默。

"That contains the soul of Ritsuko's mother, Naoko. She committed suicide by jumping off a platform, landing onto Unit 00. Her soul must have been absorbed somehow, that is why it is quite temperamental" Misato answered.  
"里面装着律子的母亲直子的灵魂。她从一个平台上跳下来，落到初号机上，自杀了。她的灵魂一定以某种方式被吸收了，这就是它脾气很暴躁的原因"美里回答道。

"That doesn't add up though, how can Rei pilot it? I mean she's not the daughter of Naoko. What's up with her?" Asuka asked, perplexed.  
"但这说不通啊，丽怎么可以驾驶它？我的意思是，她又不是直子的女儿。她是怎么回事？"明日香困惑地问道。

"You're right Asuka. It shouldn't normally be possible, but Rei is a strange case. You will probably be shocked by what I'm about to tell you" the older woman replied.  
"你说得对，明日香。这通常是不可能的，但丽是一个奇怪的案例。你可能会被我接下来要告诉你这件事震惊到"这位年长的女士回答道。

"I mean… it can't be as bad as anything you've told us already, right?" the redhead responded.  
“我是说……这不可能比你已经告诉我们的任何事情更糟糕，对吧？”红发女郎回答道。

Misato took a deep breath. "Rei is not a normal human… she is actually a clone made from Shinji's mother's DNA and an angel's DNA. Furthermore, there is a tank of these clones in NERV ready to 'replace' her if she dies" she revealed.  
美里深吸一口气。“丽不是正常人类……她实际上是真嗣母亲的 DNA 和一个天使的 DNA 制成的克隆人。此外，NERV 中有一个这样的克隆人储备，如果她死了，随时可以‘替换’她。”她透露。

"That can't be? She's my… 'sister'?" Shinji said in disbelief, not sure how to describe who Rei was to him after finding out she had half his mother's DNA.  
“这不可能？她是我的……‘妹妹’？”真嗣难以置信地说，在发现丽拥有他母亲一半的 DNA 后，不确定如何描述丽与他的关系。

"What the… why is she so important to NERV?" Asuka asked, a little irritated. "Why would the Commander make clones of an angel and his wife?!"  
“什么……她对 NERV 来说为什么那么重要？”明日香问道，有点恼火。“指挥官为什么要克隆一个天使和他的妻子？！”

"I'll get back to that, but I must first explain Instrumentality. It's basically… a process where every human being on earth becomes one" Misato summarised.  
“我会回到那个话题，但我必须先解释一下人类补完计划。它基本上是……地球上的每个人都成为一体的过程。”美里总结道。

"What the hell?" Asuka let out.  
“什么鬼？”明日香脱口而出。

"You know what an AT-field is?" Misato continued.  
“你知道 AT 力场是什么吗？”美里继续说道。

"Yeah" they both answered.  
“知道。”他们俩回答道。

"Well actually… everyone has an AT-field, it is the barrier of your soul, it's what 'holds' you together. Instrumentality supposedly breaks everyone's AT-fields and merges the souls of all humans" Misato explained.  
“嗯，实际上……每个人都有 AT 力场，它是你的灵魂屏障，它能‘维系’你的存在。工具性据说能打破每个人的 AT 力场，并融合所有人类的灵魂。”美里解释道。

"Speaking of AT-fields, since Rei is part angel, does she have one?" Shinji asked, curious.  
“说到 AT 力场，既然丽是天使的一部分，她有吗？”真嗣好奇地问道。

"Everyone has one, but yes she can project it out like angels and evas can" the older woman answered.  
“每个人都有，但是的，她可以像天使和 EVA 一样投射出来。”这位年长的女士回答道。

"Getting back to Instrumentality… what has it got to do with anything?" Asuka asked.  
“回到工具性补完……它和任何事情有什么关系？”明日香问道。

"Well Seele wants Instrumentality to occur. They want to 'evolve' mankind into a new race so we can be closer to God, or something like that. Your father, Shinji, had a similar motive, he wanted to create a controlled Instrumentality to try and be reunited with your mother" Misato elaborated.  
“好吧， Seele 希望仪器化发生。他们想让全人类‘进化’成一个新的种族，这样我们就能更接近上帝，或者类似的事情。你的父亲真嗣也有类似的动机，他想创造一个受控的仪器化来尝试与你的母亲团聚。”美里详细解释道。

"He still cared…" Shinji let out sadly.  
“他仍然关心……”真嗣悲伤地说。

"In any case, Rei is an integral part to controlling Instrumentality" their guardian continued, "That's why Gendo made sure he couldn't lose her and that she was obedient"  
“无论如何，丽是控制仪器化的一个组成部分。”他们的监护人继续说道，“这就是源堂确保他不会失去她并且她会服从的原因。”

"Where did all this Instrumentality hogwash come from?" Asuka asked. "To fund NERV and spend all this money… there has to be some strong source of information for all of this"  
“这些工具性的胡言乱语从何而来？”明日香问道。“资助 NERV 并花费所有这些钱……所有这些都必须有一些强有力的信息来源”

"They found a document called the Dead Sea Scrolls. Myths and legends aside, these scrolls described events that would transpire on earth. That is how they knew the angels would attack and all. It showed a scenario that they had to follow in order for Instrumentality to occur" Misato answered.  
“他们发现了一份名为《死海古卷》的文件。神话和传说暂且不论，这些古卷描述了将在地球上发生的事件。这就是他们知道天使会攻击等等的原因。它展示了一个他们必须遵循的场景，以便实现工具化”美里回答道。

"So, we were just being used?" the redhead shot back angrily.  
“所以，我们只是被利用了？”红发女郎愤怒地反驳道。

"What's to expect from the Commander…" Misato replied.  
"指挥官会有什么期待……”美里回答道。

"Why did the Commander tell you all this?" the young girl questioned, unable to discern a reason to reveal all this now.  
"指挥官为什么要告诉你这些？”这个年轻女孩问道，无法辨别现在透露这一切的理由。

"Now that's the thing I don't get either, he's abandoned the scenario" Misato began. "When Seele find out about this, they'll attack us to force Instrumentality to occur. However, first all the angels must be defeated. They also need Lillith, Adam, Unit 01 and the Lance of Longinus, all of which are in NERV's possession, which is why we are in danger. But it also means we are needed for now to kill the remaining angels that are to come" she finished.  
""现在这是我也搞不懂的事情，他放弃了这个场景”美里开始说。“当 Seele 发现这件事时，他们会攻击我们以迫使工具性发生。然而，首先必须击败所有使徒。他们还需要莉莉丝、亚当、初号机和朗基努斯之枪，所有这些都在 NERV 的手中，这就是我们处于危险之中的原因。但这还意味着我们现在需要杀死剩下的使徒”她结束了。

"Let those assholes come! There is nothing evas can't beat that's human-made" Asuka challenged.  
“让那些混蛋来吧！人类制造的，就没有 eva 打不败的”明日香挑战道。

"Except for other evas" Misato countered.  
“除了其他的 eva”美里反驳道。

"What?" Shinji said, disheartened.  
“什么？”真嗣沮丧地说。

"Seele has created evas 05 to 13, all run by the dummy plug system you're familiar with Shinji…" Misato disclosed.  
“Seele 已经制造了 05 到 13 号机，它们都由你熟悉的虚拟插入栓系统运行，真嗣……”美里透露道。

The boy remembered the time when Touji was used as a candidate to sync with Unit 03, but it was infected by an angel and went rampart. They were sent to stop him, but Shinji refused to attack for fear of hurting the pilot which he didn't know was Touji at the time. Then the Commander ran the dummy plug system which took control over Unit 01, causing the eva to decimate Unit 03. Luckily, Touji survived without any serious injuries.  
男孩记起了当冬治被用作与 03 号机同步的候选人时，但它被使徒感染并暴走。他们被派去阻止他，但真嗣拒绝攻击，因为他害怕伤害驾驶员，当时他并不知道是冬治。然后指挥官运行了虚拟插入栓系统，该系统控制了 01 号机，导致 EVA 摧毁了 03 号机。幸运的是，冬治在没有受到任何严重伤害的情况下幸存了下来。

"This is just… hopeless" Shinji said, starting to despair.  
“这简直是……无望的”真嗣说，开始绝望。

"No it isn't Shinji" Misato reassured.  
“不，不是的，真嗣。”美里安慰道。

"Don't give up so easily baka!" Asuka snapped at him.  
“别这么轻易放弃，笨蛋！”明日香冲他吼道。

"Listen Shinji, Commander Ikari wouldn't have gone against Seele for no reason. He's much smarter than that. Remember, we have the Magi and Ritsuko and we have all the factors which affect Instrumentality. Lastly, and most importantly, we have the two best evas in the entire world, who can easily take on nine evas" the Major explained, trying to cheer up Shinji and herself too; she certainly felt this was a lot to bear, especially for children.  
“听着，真嗣，司令官碇源堂不会无缘无故地反对 Seele。他比那聪明多了。记住，我们有 Magi 和律子，我们掌握着所有影响仪式的因素。最后，也是最重要的一点，我们拥有世界上最好的两个 EVA，它们可以轻松对付九个 EVA。”少校解释道，试图让自己和真嗣振作起来；她当然觉得这很难承受，尤其是对孩子们来说。

At last, all three of them went silent, the large amount of new information being absorbed and digested; it was a lot to take in.  
最后，他们三个都沉默了，大量的新信息被吸收和消化；这需要很多时间。

"This is so weird, it's like a nightmare but real" Asuka said, finally breaking the silence.  
"这太奇怪了，就像一场噩梦，但却是真实的"明日香说，终于打破了沉默。

"This changes… so many things" Shinji began, "I'm not really sure what to think about all this. Why is everything so messed up?" the boy finished, he couldn't just shrug off the fact that after the angels there was going to be another battle for survival.  
""这改变了……很多事情"真嗣开始说，"我真不知道该怎么想这一切。为什么一切都这么混乱？"男孩说完，他无法摆脱这样一个事实：在天使之后，将会有另一场生存之战。

"I know how you feel Shinji… I understand this feels overwhelming and I wish things were different, but this is the unfortunate reality and you have to accept it" Misato said determinedly, trying to help him cope. "Let's forget about all that for now and get back to the present reality… you two have a sync test tomorrow after school"  
“我知道你的感受，真嗣……我理解这让你感到不知所措，我希望事情有所不同，但这是不幸的现实，你必须接受它。”美里坚定地说，试图帮助他应对。“我们现在先把这些都忘掉，回到现实中来……你们两个明天放学后要进行同步测试。”

"_More_ bad news" Shinji replied, trying to sound a little cheerful.  
“更多坏消息。”真嗣回答道，试图让自己听起来有点高兴。

Asuka snorted at his attempt at a joke. "Don't forget dear, we need to bathe in LCL regularly" she reminded.  
明日香对他讲笑话的尝试嗤之以鼻。“别忘了亲爱的，我们需要定期在 LCL 中洗澡。”她提醒道。

"True that" Shinji said, remembering.  
"确实如此"真嗣回忆着说道。

Misato just looked at them confused, "Is there some 'in joke' about LCL between you two or something?"  
美里只是困惑地看着他们，“你们两个之间关于 LCL 有什么‘内部笑话’吗？”

"It's something only a pilot would understand" the redhead retorted cleverly, causing Shinji to chuckle.  
"只有驾驶员才能理解"红发女伶俐地反驳道，逗得真嗣咯咯直笑。

"Speaking of LCL, that reminds me. It was your father, Shinji, that drugged the LCL" Misato divulged.  
"说到 LCL，这让我想起，是你的父亲真嗣，给 LCL 下了药" 美里透露道。

"That's bizarre… why would he do that?" Shinji asked, confused.  
"这很奇怪……他为什么要这么做？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"He didn't say, I tried pressing for more info but he dismissed me" Misato replied.  
"他没有说，我试图向他施压以获取更多信息，但他把我赶走了" 美里回答道。

"What could it possibly be? If his scenario isn't going as planned, he wouldn't have drugged me so that I'd get with Asuka" Shinji pondered aloud.  
“这可能是什么？如果他的计划没有按计划进行，他不会给我下药让我和明日香在一起的。”真嗣大声思考道。

They sat there silently contemplating the Commander's motives, but none of them could think of a compelling reason.  
他们默默地坐在那里思考着司令的动机，但他们谁也想不出一个令人信服的理由。

Misato decided she would change the subject to lighten the mood. "So… I have a feeling you two were 'enjoying your time' with each other while I was out" she teased.  
美里决定改变话题来缓和气氛。“所以……我有一种感觉，在我出去的时候，你们两个正在‘享受你们的时光’。”她取笑道。

"What _exactly_ are you implying Misato?" Asuka asked suspiciously.  
“你到底想说什么，美里？”明日香一脸狐疑地问道。

"I _know_ you two can't keep your hands off each other, I'm not dumb. I thought when I came in, I'd be interrupting something" the Major joked, laughing.  
“我知道你们俩谁也离不开谁，我又不傻。我以为我进来的时候，会打断你们什么事呢。”少校开玩笑地说，边说边笑。

"Misato!" Shinji exclaimed, embarrassed.  
“美里！”真嗣尴尬地叫道。

"That reaction! Caught red-handed! Or maybe… redhead-handed pfft!" Misato shot back.  
“这个反应！当场抓获！或者说……红发当场抓获，噗嗤！”美里反驳道。

"Oh my God, she's making dad jokes" Asuka said, disgusted.  
“天哪，她在讲爸爸笑话。”明日香厌恶地说。

"Deflection hmmm, I sense you're hiding something" Misato mused.  
“转移话题，嗯，我感觉你藏了什么东西。”美里沉思道。

"We're not hiding anything Misato" Shinji refuted, taking her bait.  
“我们什么都没瞒着你，美里”真嗣反驳道，上了她的当。

"Overly defensive hmmm, it must be something embarrassing for Shinji" the Major replied, grinning.  
“过度防御，哼哼，对真嗣来说一定是件尴尬的事”少校回答道，咧嘴一笑。

Asuka just snorted, finding amusement in the tactical operations director's interrogation.  
明日香只是哼了一声，对战术作战指挥的审问感到好笑。

"Laughter from Asuka hmmm, I guess I got it right on the money" Misato continued.  
“明日香的笑声，嗯，我想我猜对了”美里继续说道。

"Hahaha, stop tormenting the boy Misato. I'll just tell you" Asuka began.  
“哈哈，别再折磨这个男孩了，美里。我直接告诉你吧”明日香开始说道。

"Wait Asuka, what are you going to tell her?!" Shinji said, sounding wary.  
“等等，明日香，你要告诉她什么？！”真嗣说道，听起来很警惕。

"You see Misato, there's something problematic with Shinji's 'performance'," the redhead confessed.  
“你看，美里，真嗣的‘表现’有些问题，”红发女坦白道。

"Asuka!" Shinji let out, unable to believe she would tell their guardian about this.  
“明日香！”真嗣脱口而出，不敢相信她会把这件事告诉他们的监护人。

"Don't be such a spoilsport, I get enough bothersome teasing from this woman _and_ you, surely it's your turn for once" Asuka replied, sticking her tongue out.  
“别这么扫兴，我从这个女人和你们那里得到了足够的烦人戏弄，这次肯定轮到你了。”明日香答道，吐了吐舌头。

"Isn't it fun embarrassing Shinji?" Misato teased.  
“捉弄真嗣不是很有趣吗？”美里取笑道。

"Of course!" Asuka said gleefully.  
“当然！”明日香兴高采烈地说。

"I basically have no say in this?" Shinji asked, trying to defend himself.  
“我基本上没有发言权吗？”真嗣问道，试图为自己辩护。

"Nope" the two females said instantly, causing the boy to sigh.  
“不”两个女孩立刻说道，让男孩叹了口气。

"So, let me guess then…" Misato began, "Is it impotence?"  
“那么，让我猜猜……”美里开始说，“是阳痿吗？”

"Hah, no the opposite, if there is such a thing" Asuka rectified.  
“哈，不，相反，如果有这种事的话”明日香纠正道。

The older woman snorted. "What are you talking about? That's what just about every man suffers from" she said, grinning.  
这位年长的女士哼了一声。“你在说什么？那是几乎每个男人都会遇到的问题。”她笑着说。

This time the redhead fell on the floor laughing. At this point, Shinji could not endure the conversation anymore and stood up from the table, walking away and leaving the two girls in the dining room.  
这次，红发女郎笑得倒在了地上。这时，真嗣再也无法忍受这场谈话，他从餐桌旁站起身，走开了，把两个女孩留在了餐厅里。

"I take it Misato you've had to fake many orgasms with a comment like that. Do so many men have no stamina?" Asuka asked, a little curious.  
"我猜三沙子，你一定装过很多次高潮，才会说出这样的话。难道这么多男人都没有耐力吗？”明日香问道，有点好奇。

"You wouldn't believe" Misato replied.  
“你不会相信的”美里回答道。

"Teasing aside, we actually spent most of our time after school hanging with our friends. Seeing as we had to cancel yesterday to see the Commander, we decided to do it today instead" Asuka explained.  
“开玩笑归开玩笑，我们实际上放学后的大部分时间都和朋友们在一起。考虑到我们昨天取消了去见司令，我们决定今天去”明日香解释道。

"Sounds like you had a fun time then" the Major noted.  
“听起来你们玩得很开心”少校说道。

"Yeah, it was good to spend time with Hikari, but I think it was especially good for Shinji to spend time with his friends after the few weeks away" the young girl commented.  
“是啊，和光在一起的时间很好，但我认为新二在离开几周后和朋友们在一起尤其好。”这个年轻女孩评论道。

The subject of their discussion returned and the two women looked at him expectantly. Shinji was still processing all the details from the eye-opening revelation and decided he would leave the apartment to be alone for a bit.  
她们讨论的话题回来了，两个女人满怀期待地看着他。新二仍在处理所有令人大开眼界的细节，并决定离开公寓独自待一会儿。

"I'm going out for a walk" he announced.  
“我要出去走走。”他宣布。

"What? It's really dark now though, not to mention freezing cold" Asuka replied at his sudden declaration.  
“什么？现在真的太黑了，更别提冻得要命了。”明日香回应他突然的宣言。

"That's good reason for me to go, I need a cool refreshing night for myself" Shinji continued unabated.  
“那正是我该出去的理由，我需要一个凉爽清爽的夜晚。”真嗣继续说道，毫不动摇。

"You want me to… tag along?" Asuka offered, though she wasn't really in the mood to go out now.  
“你想让我……一起去？”明日香提议道，尽管她现在真的没有心情出去。

"No thanks, I just want some time to myself" the boy answered.  
“不用了，我只是想自己待一会儿。”男孩回答道。

"Still… are you sure you'll be fine?" the redhead asked.  
“不过……你确定你没事吗？”红发问道。

"Don't worry, the section 2 agents will be following him anyway once he leaves the building" Misato remarked, reassuring the girl.  
“别担心，二课的探员们会在他离开大楼后跟踪他的。”美里说道，安抚着女孩。

Asuka sensed an ulterior motive to just clearing his mind, but decided to leave it. "Well… fine then… see ya Shinji"  
明日香感觉到他清理思绪的背后另有目的，但决定不去管它。“好吧……那好吧……再见真嗣”

"Don't worry about me Asuka" Shinji replied, smiling, "Bye Asuka, bye Misato" he finished, waving at them.  
"别担心我，明日香”真嗣微笑着回答道，“再见，明日香，再见，美里”他说完，向她们挥手。

The boy moved over to the door, opened it and left, closing the door behind him. Taking a breath, he took the stairs down instead of the lift, noticing the tranquil silence in the stairwell. It wasn't long till he made it to the ground floor and exited. As he left the building, he felt the cold, icy wind biting at him and his cheeks turned red from the chill.  
"男孩走到门口，打开门走了出去，关上了门。他深吸一口气，走楼梯下楼，而不是电梯，注意到楼梯间里宁静的寂静。没过多久，他就到了底层，走了出去。当他离开大楼时，他感到寒冷刺骨的寒风扑面而来，他的脸颊被冻得发红。

Shinji looked around, noticing the street lights illuminating the footpaths and mulled over where he wanted to go before deciding to walk to the park. The boy kept his hands in his pockets as he made his way, trying to keep warm as best he could. Shinji felt like he was being watched as he walked, but remembered that section 2 agents were always following the pilots around. Arriving at the park, the boy sat down on a bench and looked up at the night sky. There were many stars visible tonight, a rare sight in the city of Tokyo-3, and Shinji enjoyed the spectacle with awe. He soon thought back to their perturbing conversation; he knew Misato had changed the subject to try and lift the mood, but he couldn't just shrug off what was said and needed time to think about everything.  
真嗣环顾四周，注意到路灯照亮了人行道，并思考着要去哪里，最后决定步行前往公园。男孩一边走一边把手揣在口袋里，尽力保暖。真嗣在走的时候感觉有人在看着他，但他记得第二部门的探员总是跟着驾驶员们。到达公园后，男孩坐在长椅上，抬头望着夜空。今晚可以看到很多星星，在东京 3 市这可是难得一见的景象，真嗣敬畏地欣赏着这一奇观。他很快又想起了他们令人不安的谈话；他知道美里转移了话题是为了试图活跃气氛，但他不能就这样耸耸肩，他需要时间来思考所有的事情。

While Shinji was lost in thought, a ragged man came up to where he was sitting. It would seem the man hadn't shaved for a while as his face was all covered in hair. The stranger had a sad look about him, his features indistinguishable in the darkness of the night.  
就在真嗣沉思的时候，一个衣衫褴褛的男人走到他坐的地方。看起来这个男人已经有一段时间没有刮胡子了，因为他的脸上长满了胡子。这个陌生人看起来很悲伤，他的五官在夜色中难以辨认。

"Mind if I sit here?" the man asked hoarsely, startling Shinji a little.  
""介意我坐在这里吗？""男人沙哑地问道，这让真嗣吓了一跳。

"Not at all sir" the boy answered politely.  
“一点也不，先生。”男孩礼貌地回答道。

"I haven't been called sir for a while" the older male replied. He sat down quietly on the same bench and looked up at the stars with Shinji. "You don't seem to mind my presence at all, most people ignore me or walk away"  
“已经有一段时间没人叫我先生了。”年长的男性回答道。他静静地坐在同一张长椅上，和真嗣一起仰望星空。“你似乎一点也不介意我的存在，大多数人都无视我或走开。”

"Many people have some good inside them, besides I doubt you'll do anything to me and I know everyone needs someone to talk to" Shinji replied, strangely open to talking to this man; he felt at ease with him for some reason.  
“许多人内心都有一些善良，再说，我怀疑你会对我做什么，而且我知道每个人都需要有人倾诉。”真嗣回答道，奇怪的是，他很愿意和这个人交谈；出于某种原因，他感到很自在。

"Such nice words from a stranger" the man said before pausing. "You know I had it all once… money and a good woman, but I lost it all… don't make the same mistake" he reminisced.  
“一个陌生人说这样的话真是好”那人说，然后停顿了一下。“你知道我曾经拥有这一切……金钱和一个好女人，但我失去了这一切……不要犯同样的错误”他回忆道。

"What are you talking about?" the boy asked, confused.  
“你在说什么？”男孩困惑地问道。

"Here take this, you need it more than I do" the man said, pressing a bundle of cloth into Shinji's hand before standing up abruptly. "I must go, thank you for your kindness"  
“拿着这个，你比我更需要”那人说，把一捆布塞进真嗣的手里，然后突然站起来。“我必须走了，谢谢你对我的善意”

At that, the stranger walked off into the night and disappeared. Shinji couldn't help but think his voice sounded familiar. A car drove by taking Shinji out of his reverie and he pocketed the bundle, remembering why he had actually gotten out of the house. The boy stood up from the bench and began to head in another direction. After several minutes of walking, the cold wind making him shiver, Shinji finally reached his destination. He looked up at the rundown apartment in front of him, it was falling apart just like the last time he was here. The boy entered the building, took the stairs up and arrived at Rei's door. He knew her doorbell didn't work and she wouldn't hear him knocking so he immediately opened the door, knowing it had no lock.  
说完，陌生人走进了夜色中，消失了。真嗣不禁觉得他的声音很熟悉。一辆车开过，打断了真嗣的沉思，他把包裹装进口袋，想起了自己为什么要出门。男孩从长椅上站起来，朝另一个方向走去。走了几分钟后，寒风让他瑟瑟发抖，真嗣终于到达了目的地。他抬头看着面前破旧的公寓，它就像他上次来时一样破败不堪。男孩走进大楼，走上楼梯，来到丽的门前。他知道她的门铃坏了，她听不到他敲门，所以他直接打开了门，他知道门没有锁。

"Rei, it's me, Shinji" he called out.  
"丽，是我，真嗣"他喊道。

Shinji, closed the door behind him, walked into her room and looked around; it was just as messy as it was the first time he had arrived. He found himself cleaning up the place, making sure everything was neat and tidy; Rei was still nowhere to be seen. The boy sat down on her bed waiting, looking out the window. It was then he heard a door opening and looked towards the sound; it was the bathroom door. A strange sense of déjà vu came over him and he quickly looked away just in case she came out naked again; to his luck she had just gone to the toilet. Rei made her way into the room and noticed the boy there.  
真嗣关上门，走进她的房间，环顾四周；房间和第一次来时一样乱糟糟的。他发现自己正在打扫房间，确保一切都整洁有序；丽仍然不知所踪。男孩坐在她的床上等待，看着窗外。这时他听到一扇门打开的声音，便朝声音的方向看去；那是浴室的门。一种奇怪的似曾相识的感觉涌上心头，他赶紧把目光移开，以防她再次裸体出来；幸运的是，她只是去上了厕所。丽走进房间，注意到男孩在那里。

"What are you doing here at this time, Shinji?" the girl asked, surprised.  
"你这个时候来这里干什么，真嗣？""女孩惊讶地问道。

"I'm sorry for coming unannounced and so late" Shinji replied.  
"抱歉，不请自来，还这么晚""真嗣回答道。

"It is alright, as long as it is important" she remarked, before coming over to sit down next to him on the bed. "So, what brings you here?"  
“只要它很重要，那就没问题。”她评论道，然后走过来坐在他旁边的床上。“那么，你来找我有什么事？”

The boy took a deep breath. "Rei…" he started, "I found out about your origin, what you are, and I won't lie to you… it disturbs me"  
男孩深吸一口气。“蕾……”他开始说，“我发现了你的起源，你是什么，我不会骗你……这让我不安”

Rei looked a little hurt at his comment.  
蕾对他的评论感到有点受伤。

"But… it also makes you something like a half-sister to me, and I guess it's true in a way since my father made you. Apparently when they came to deciding names for the child when my mother was pregnant, they decided they would call it Shinji if it was a boy and Rei if it was a girl" Shinji continued on.  
"但是……这也让你成了我的一个类似于同父异母的妹妹，我想某种程度上来说这是真的，因为我的父亲创造了你。显然，当他们决定我母亲怀孕时孩子的名字时，他们决定如果是个男孩就叫真嗣，如果是个女孩就叫丽""真嗣继续说道。

"Shinji… I'll understand if you find it difficult to be around me" Rei let out, sounding anxious.  
"真嗣……如果你觉得和我相处很困难，我会理解的""丽发出声音，听起来很焦虑。

"That's not it Rei. You see… I'm _glad_ I have a sister" he reassured, before hugging her gently, wanting to show her that he cared for her.  
""不是这样的，丽。你看……我很高兴我有一个妹妹""他安慰道，然后轻轻地拥抱了她，想向她表明他关心她。

The girl was stunned for a moment but soon embraced him as well, comforting her "brother." Shinji faced her, a somber expression on his face, trying to find the words he sought.  
女孩愣了一下，但很快也抱住了他，安慰着她的“哥哥”。真嗣面对着她，脸上带着严肃的表情，试图找到他想要的话语。

"Why is it my father could never love me… if he could love you?" he asked out loud; he finally understood why Rei was so important to his father and he was somewhat envious.  
"为什么我的父亲永远无法爱我……如果他能爱你呢？""他大声问道；他终于明白为什么丽对他的父亲如此重要，而他有些嫉妒。

"The Commander saw Yui in me and the hope of reviving her" Rei answered, before looking over to her desk where the glasses lay; they were broken. "But you Shinji, have helped me find my independence, I value my life now. I will not blindly follow the Commander's orders. I sincerely thank you Shinji, for showing me…" she finished, breaking off as her eyes started to water. "What is this strange feeling?" she asked, wiping her eyes dry.  
""司令在看到我时看到了唯，看到了复活她的希望""丽回答道，然后看向她的书桌，眼镜放在那里；它们碎了。""但是真嗣，你帮助我找到了我的独立，我现在珍视我的生命。我不会盲目地服从司令的命令。真嗣，我真诚地感谢你，因为你向我展示了……”她说完，停了下来，因为她的眼睛开始流泪。""这是什么奇怪的感觉？""她问道，擦干了眼泪。

"Well, it depends" Shinji started, chuckling softly "Usually humans cry when they are happy or sad"  
“嗯，这要看情况，”真嗣开始说，轻轻地笑着，“通常人类在高兴或悲伤的时候会哭”

"I think I understand" Rei replied.  
“我想我明白了，”丽回答道。

"Listen… I love you Rei" he announced, holding her once again.  
“听着……我爱你，丽，”他宣布，再次抱住她。

The blue haired girl understood and smiled at him, making her look incredibly beautiful. Suddenly self-conscious, Shinji looked at his watch and noticed it was very late.  
蓝发女孩理解并对他微笑，让她看起来美得令人难以置信。真嗣突然变得自觉，看了看手表，发现已经很晚了。

"Forgive me Rei… I best be going as it's extremely late. Misato and Asuka will be worried by now" he remarked.  
“原谅我，丽……我最好走了，因为已经很晚了。美里和明日香现在肯定很担心，”他说道。

"Stay here Shinji, it's too late to go out now. There are many people out there who would do you harm… I'm sure Asuka and Misato would be more upset if they knew I let you out at this time and something happened to you" Rei urged.  
“真嗣，留在这里，现在出去太晚了。外面有很多人会伤害你……我敢肯定，如果明日香和美里知道我让你在这个时候出去，而你出了什么事，她们会更难过的，”丽催促道。

"I guess you're right… well the section 2 agents know I'm safe with you anyway. I'll go sleep on the couch then" the boy conceded.  
“我想你说的对……好吧，第二部门的探员们知道我跟你在一起很安全。那我去睡沙发了。”男孩让步道。

"That is acceptable" the girl approved.  
“可以。”女孩同意道。

Shinji got out a blanket from Rei's cupboard and lay down on the couch, covering himself with it. At the same time, Rei got into her bed and pulled the covers over her. They both settled down comfortably, listening to the strange creaks the old building made.  
真嗣从丽的柜子里拿出了一条毯子，躺在沙发上，用它盖住了自己。与此同时，丽躺进了自己的床上，拉上了被子。他们都舒舒服服地躺了下来，听着这栋老房子发出的奇怪的吱嘎声。

"Goodnight Rei" Shinji said quietly.  
""晚安，丽""真嗣轻声说道。

"Goodnight Shinji" she answered softly.  
""晚安，真嗣""她轻声回答。

They soon both drifted off to sleep.  
他们很快都进入了梦乡。

"Where is that baka?!" Asuka asked out loud, starting to get worried, "He's been gone for quite some time now"  
“那个笨蛋在哪儿？！”明日香大声问道，开始担心起来，“他已经离开好一会儿了”

"Unfortunately, that guy didn't take his mobile" Misato replied, holding his mobile phone up.  
“不幸的是，那个家伙没带手机”美里回答道，举起他的手机。

"Just great! That moron is so stupid sometimes, doesn't he realise he's gonna make us worry?" Asuka said, exasperated.  
“太棒了！那个白痴有时真是太蠢了，难道他不知道他会让我们担心的吗？”明日香恼怒地说。

"I'm sure he's fine Asuka, in the past he's run away and returned in one piece" Misato reassured. "I was going to call the section 2 agents… but it seems I left my phone at NERV, so I can't be too critical of Shinji right now"  
“我敢肯定他没事，明日香，过去他离家出走过，而且都平安无事地回来了。”美里安慰道。“我本来打算给第二部门的探员打电话……但似乎我把手机落在了 NERV，所以我现在也没资格批评真嗣。”

"You're hopeless too" Asuka said, sighing.  
“你也一样没救了。”明日香叹着气说道。

"Don't worry. If there was a problem, they would let me know, even in person if they had to" her guardian encouraged.  
“别担心。如果有问题，他们会告诉我，即使他们不得不亲自来。”她的监护人鼓励道。

"It's so damn late though… I'm gonna go look for him" the redhead said stubbornly.  
“现在已经很晚了……我要去找他。”红发女郎固执地说。

"I can't allow you to go out now, I don't want to have _two_ 'missing' pilots" Misato shot back.  
“我现在不能让你出去，我不想有两个‘失踪’的飞行员。”美里反驳道。

"But what about Shinji then?" the young girl asked.  
“那真嗣怎么办？”年轻女孩问道。

"He's not totally stupid, I'm sure he's taken residence in a hotel or similar" the older woman suggested.  
“他没那么笨，我敢肯定他已经住进酒店或类似的地方了，”这位年长的女士建议道。

"He didn't take any money" Asuka refuted.  
“他没有拿钱，”明日香反驳道。

"Then he's probably at a friend's house, he even came across Kensuke camping once, I'm certain he's fine" Misato figured.  
“那么他可能在朋友家，他甚至还遇到过健助露营，我敢肯定他没事，”美里猜测道。

"But!" the redhead started.  
“但是！”红发女郎开始说。

"No buts! Just go look for him tomorrow morning when it's safe to go out" Misato said, trying to compromise.  
“没有但是！明天早上安全出门的时候去找他就行了。”美里说，试图妥协。

"Let's ring his friends then?" Asuka proposed.  
“那我们给他朋友打电话？”明日香提议。

"It's too late, they won't pick up as they'll be asleep" the older woman refused.  
“太晚了，他们不会接的，他们都睡了。”那个年纪大的女人拒绝道。

At this, Asuka finally let up, feeling defeated. She paced around for a bit, hoping that Shinji was alright.  
这时，明日香终于泄气了，她感到失败。她来回踱步，希望真嗣没事。

"Look Asuka, I know how you feel, but you need to get some rest, if only so that you can get up early tomorrow to search for him" Misato said, comforting her.  
“明日香，我知道你的感受，但是你需要休息一下，这样你才能早点起来去找他。”美里安慰她说。

"Ok fine" Asuka said, finally relenting, "I'll go to sleep then, if you're that confident he's fine, I'll worry about it tomorrow"  
“好吧，好吧。”明日香终于让步了，“那我就去睡觉，如果你那么肯定他没事，我明天再担心吧。”

"Thanks Asuka… goodnight!" Misato replied gratefully.  
“谢谢明日香……晚安！”美里感激地回答道。

"Goodnight" the young girl replied back, yawning.  
“晚安”小姑娘打着哈欠回道。

The redhead went to her room, waving back to her guardian before entering and closing the door behind her. Asuka promptly dressed into her night gear, got into her bed and soon fell asleep as she was absolutely exhausted.  
红发女郎回到自己的房间，在进门并关上门之前向她的监护人挥手告别。明日香迅速换上睡衣，爬上床，很快便睡着了，因为她实在太累了。

End Notes: Zomg Shinji loves Rei? What's happening? Nah, I think it's obvious to the reader he only thinks of her as a sister. On another note, the play is a story I came up with while writing this fanfic, so it's mine trademarked and copyrighted :P. It _is_ crap but it's mine nonetheless lol. This chapter now sits at over 14000 words after being rewritten.
尾注：Zomg Shinji 爱 Rei？发生了什么事？不，我认为读者很明显，他只把她当作妹妹。另一方面，这出戏是我在写这个同人小说时想出来的一个故事，所以它属于我的商标和版权：P。它很烂，但它仍然是我的，哈哈。经过重写，本章现在已经超过 14000 字。

---
Author's Notes: A reader once asked why Asuka twitched her lips in the last chapter. To describe the reason, I explained an example when a teacher is telling you off and you find it funny, but you can't laugh because you'll get in deep shit but you can't help your lips twitching a bit into a smile - that's precisely what Asuka was feeling. There's no sex in this chapter, and may not be for a while; you'll see why :D.  
作者笔记：有读者曾问为何上一章中明日香会嘴角抽动。为了解释原因，我举了个例子，比如当老师训斥你时，你觉得有趣但又不敢笑，因为会惹上大麻烦，但你的嘴角还是忍不住微微上扬——明日香当时就是这种感觉。本章没有性描写，而且可能短期内都不会有；你会明白为什么 :D。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 10 (First rewrite).  
说明：这是重写的第 10 章（首次重写）。

A new note: 一条新笔记：

### Chapter 10: Starting Over Again  
第十章：重新开始

Asuka awoke particularly early in the morning, fighting the pain in her eyes as she forced them open. In comparison to when she usually rose, her room was still quite dark. The girl fought desperately with her weary body to get up. Partially succeeding, Asuka found herself stumbling onto the floor and bit her lip in pain as she stubbed her toe against her desk. She grumbled in irritation and held her injured foot in an attempt to ease the pain; at least it woke her up a bit. The girl found herself looking around the room blearily, noticing how different it looked early in the morning; her lamp stand cast a creepy silhouette across the room and the poster on her wall looked more like a picture of a transvestite than a singer. The redhead silently snickered to herself before remembering why she had gotten up so early in the first place. Asuka turned on the lights, instantly wishing she hadn't as the bright light assaulted her eyes. She felt dazed for a moment as her eyes adjusted to the agonising light. Finally recovering from her temporary blindness, the girl took out her school uniform from the wardrobe and began dressing up. It took her a full 15 minutes to tie her shoelaces as she felt so lethargic; she was growing quite frustrated with herself.  
明日香一大早就醒了，强忍着眼睛的疼痛睁开双眼。与往常起床时相比，她的房间依然相当昏暗。少女拼命与疲惫的身体抗争，试图起身。勉强成功后，明日香踉跄着摔倒在地，脚趾撞到书桌，痛得她咬紧了嘴唇。她恼火地咕哝着，抱住受伤的脚试图缓解疼痛；至少这让她清醒了一些。少女迷迷糊糊地环顾四周，注意到清晨的房间看起来多么不同；她的台灯在房间里投下诡异的影子，墙上的海报更像是一个变装者的照片而非歌手。红发女孩暗自窃笑，随后想起了自己为何这么早起床。明日香打开灯，立刻后悔了，因为刺眼的灯光直射进她的眼睛。她感到一阵眩晕，眼睛适应着这令人痛苦的光线。终于从短暂的失明中恢复过来，女孩从衣柜里拿出校服，开始更衣。 她花了整整 15 分钟才系好鞋带，因为她感到异常疲倦；她对自己越来越感到沮丧。

Asuka opened her door to go to the bathroom and peered out into the dark hallway. Though the apartment was dark, her memory was good enough that she was able to successfully traverse the hallway and reach the bathroom. The girl entered the bathroom and switched on the light. She went over to the sink and splashed cold water over her face in an attempt to wake her from her drowsiness. Feeling more awake, Asuka looked at herself in the mirror; she had dark circles underneath her eyes and her hair was in absolute disarray, looking as if she had been struck by a thunderbolt. The redhead grabbed a brush to fix herself up. She didn't want to waste too much time making herself ready and settled for looking somewhat presentable. After finishing, the girl switched off the bathroom light and made her way back to her room. Asuka then took her keys and looked around her room, making sure she wasn't forgetting anything. Satisfied she had what she needed, she switched off her light plunging the apartment into darkness once again. Her eyes adjusted very quickly this time and she was able to proceed to the exit. Suddenly, the redhead's foot hit something and she crouched down for a better look; it was a can of some sort, which she picked up. Asuka could just make out _**Paolo Pagani's liquid pizza**_ and threw away the object in disgust, wondering how Misato could eat such rubbish, let alone as a midnight snack. The girl opened the entrance door and exited her home, closing and locking the door behind her. She proceeded to run down the stairs and exit the apartment, before beginning her search for her boyfriend.  
明日香打开房门，准备去洗手间，她探头望向昏暗的走廊。尽管公寓内一片漆黑，但她的记忆足够清晰，能顺利穿过走廊到达洗手间。女孩进入洗手间，打开灯。她走到洗手台前，用冷水泼脸，试图驱散睡意。感觉清醒了一些，明日香看向镜子中的自己；眼底有明显的黑眼圈，头发凌乱得仿佛刚被雷劈过。红发女孩抓起梳子，开始整理仪容。她不想花太多时间打扮，只求看起来还算过得去。整理完毕后，女孩关掉洗手间的灯，返回房间。明日香拿起钥匙，环视房间，确保没有遗漏任何东西。确认无误后，她关掉房间的灯，再次让公寓陷入黑暗。这次她的眼睛很快适应了黑暗，顺利走向出口。 突然，红发女孩的脚碰到了什么东西，她蹲下身仔细一看；那是一个罐子，她捡了起来。阿斯卡勉强辨认出那是保罗·帕加尼的液体披萨，厌恶地扔掉了那东西，不明白美里怎么会吃这种垃圾，更别提作为夜宵了。女孩打开家门，走了出去，随后关上门并锁好。她跑下楼梯，离开公寓，开始寻找她的男朋友。

Asuka first headed towards Touji's house, since it was the closest. She ran along the empty streets, noticing the sun slowly starting to come up. It was so early, not one car drove by and she found the silence quite unnerving; it seemed to accentuate her growing feeling of bleakness and helplessness. _'Why did that damn dork have to run off?'_ she thought to herself.  
阿斯卡首先朝东治的家走去，因为那是最靠近的地方。她沿着空荡荡的街道奔跑，注意到太阳慢慢升起。时间还这么早，没有一辆车经过，她觉得这寂静相当令人不安；似乎更加突显了她日益增长的绝望和无助感。'那个该死的呆子为什么要跑掉？'她自言自语道。

The girl soon reached Touji's house and rang the doorbell repeatedly, making sure to wake the slumbering beast. After a few minutes of waiting, Asuka reached up to ring the doorbell again only to have the door answered with a bleary eyed Touji. The boy looked at Asuka, totally surprised to see her there.  
女孩很快到达了东治的家，不停地按门铃，确保把沉睡的巨兽唤醒。等了几分钟后，阿斯卡再次伸手去按门铃，却见门被一个睡眼惺忪的东治打开了。男孩看着阿斯卡，完全没想到她会出现在那里。

"Come to confess your love for me?" he joked.  
"来向我表白吗？"他开玩笑道。

"No you stooge, I was wondering if Shinji stayed here last night" she retorted.  
"你这个笨蛋，我是想问真嗣昨晚是不是住这儿了"她反驳道。

"No he didn't… and why are you here so early looking for him? Are you that concerned?" Touji answered, curious as to why Asuka of all people was searching for Shinji.  
"他没有……你这么早来找他是为什么？这么关心他吗？" 冬二回答，好奇为什么偏偏是明日香在找真嗣。

"He was gone all night and Misato made me look for him" the redhead replied. The girl bit her lip; she hated lying sometimes, it made her sound horrible.  
“他整晚都没回来，美里还让我去找他。”红发女孩回答道。她咬了咬嘴唇；有时候她讨厌撒谎，那让她听起来很糟糕。

"Ah well… sorry I don't know where he is. You're lucky I'm the only one home or you would have woken everyone up. Good luck in your search anyway, I hope you find our lost brother" he replied, putting his hand on his chest.  
“啊，好吧……抱歉我不知道他在哪儿。你运气好，家里只有我一个人，不然你早就把大家都吵醒了。祝你搜索顺利，希望你能找到我们那失踪的哥哥。”他回答着，把手放在胸前。

Asuka just rolled her eyes at him before he closed the door. The girl head off to Kensuke's house next. She noticed the morning had gotten lighter and a few people were out walking; time was passing by. Arriving at Kensuke's house, she rang the doorbell impatiently. Out came Kensuke instantly, alive and full of energy.  
明日香只是对他翻了个白眼，然后他关上了门。女孩接着前往健介家。她注意到天色已经亮了起来，有些人开始外出散步；时间在流逝。到达健介家时，她不耐烦地按响了门铃。健介立刻出现在门口，活力四射。

"Asuka?" he asked, surprised.  
"明日香？" 他惊讶地问道。

"The one and only… how come you're so full of life?" she replied.  
"正是我……你怎么这么精神？" 她回答道。

"I'm a morning person, I like getting up early! But why are you here?" Kensuke inquired; it was unusual for her to come to his place and especially at this time of day.  
"我习惯早起，喜欢清晨的感觉！不过你怎么会来这里？" 真嗣询问；她在这个时间来访实在不寻常。

"I'm looking for Shinji, did he stay here last night?" the girl asked.  
"我在找真嗣，他昨晚住这儿了吗？" 女孩问道。

"No he didn't… sorry I have no idea where he is" he answered, "Was he gone all night?"  
"不，他没有……抱歉，我不知道他在哪儿" 他回答，"他整晚都没回来吗？"

"Yeah, I'm worried something happened" she replied.  
"是的，我担心出什么事了" 她回答道。

"Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine!" Kensuke encouraged, "Let me know if there's anything I can do to help" he offered.  
"别担心，我相信他没事！" 健介鼓励道，"如果有我能帮忙的地方，尽管告诉我。" 他提议。

"Well let me know if you see him… I'll just keep looking" the redhead answered.  
"好吧，如果你见到他，告诉我一声…我会继续找的。" 红发人回答。

"Good luck finding him then, see ya!" Kensuke said, before closing the door.  
"那祝你好运找到他，再见！" 健介说完，关上了门。

Now Asuka was getting worried; he wasn't at either friend's house. _'Where the hell could he be?'_ she thought anxiously. The girl began walking around the streets of Tokyo-3, irritated that she hadn't thought of drinking coffee before leaving the apartment. She absent-mindedly walked into the middle of a crossing and stopped to ponder the whereabouts of the third child. An incessant noise interrupted her thoughts as Asuka looked around and took in the sight of a line of cars on both sides of the crossing, drivers alternating between mashing their horns and yelling out insults at her; it would seem people had started to go to work now.  
现在，明日香开始担心了；他不在任何一个朋友家里。'他到底能去哪儿呢？'她焦虑地想着。女孩开始在第三新东京市的街道上徘徊，懊恼自己离开公寓前怎么没想到喝杯咖啡。她心不在焉地走到十字路口中央，停下来思考第三适格者的去向。一阵持续的噪音打断了她的思绪，明日香环顾四周，看到十字路口两侧排满了车辆，司机们交替按着喇叭并朝她大喊侮辱的话语；看来人们已经开始上班了。

"Shove it up your ass!" Asuka screamed at the motor cars.  
“去你的！”明日香对着那些汽车尖叫道。

The driver in the front of the line seemed to take her comment to heart as he whipped his arm out the window, providing the Unit 02 pilot with a rude gesture. The redhead turned to face the man, her face set into a frightening scowl. He quickly closed his window in fear as she gave him her opinion of his driving skills. In a panic, he clicked the door lock repeatedly when she furiously asked a question regarding the man's sexuality. Satisfied that the foe had been defeated, Asuka placed her hands on her hips as the insults and honking horns continued. With a sigh, she slowly walked off the road, but not before providing the motoring public with a very loud vocal comparison between them and a certain part of the human anatomy.  
排在最前面的司机似乎把她的评论放在了心上，他猛地从车窗伸出胳膊，向二号机驾驶员比了个粗鲁的手势。红发女孩转过身面对那人，脸上挂着吓人的怒容。他迅速关上窗户，害怕地锁上门，因为她对他的驾驶技术发表了看法。慌乱中，他反复点击车门锁，当她愤怒地质问他的性取向时。满意地认为敌人已被击败，明日香双手叉腰，而辱骂声和喇叭声仍在继续。她叹了口气，慢慢离开马路，但在离开前，她大声地将这些司机与人体某个部位进行了比较。

Somewhat feeling better after having vented some anger, the girl went back to thinking on Shinji's location. "Of course!" she said, finally realising.  
发泄了一些怒气后，女孩感觉好些了，她又开始思考真嗣的位置。“当然！”她终于恍然大悟地说道。

At that, she walked off in the direction of Rei's apartment…  
于是，她朝着绫波的公寓方向走去……

---

Shinji and Rei awoke at the same time, the morning sun shone down on them warmly. Rei sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes as she became more lucid. The boy had already gotten off the couch and was stretching his legs. He was used to getting up as soon as he woke up as he was the one who always made breakfast. Rei smiled slightly, glad at how serenely she had slept; she couldn't recall another night that had been as peaceful.  
真嗣和丽同时醒来，清晨的阳光温暖地洒在他们身上。丽缓缓坐起身，揉着眼睛，意识逐渐清醒。男孩已经从沙发上起身，正在伸展双腿。他习惯一醒来就起床，因为他总是负责做早餐。丽微微一笑，庆幸自己能如此宁静地入睡；她记不起还有哪个夜晚如此安宁。

"Good morning Shinji" Rei greeted.  
“早上好，真嗣。”丽问候道。

"Good morning" Shinji replied, grinning at her.  
“早上好。”真嗣回答，对她咧嘴一笑。

The boy walked over and sat on her bed, before looking out the window and noticing a few birds flying by. He looked down below and saw the morning traffic on the roads. Finishing his observations, he then relaxed comfortably on the bed and turned to face Rei.  
男孩走过来坐在她的床上，然后望向窗外，注意到几只鸟儿飞过。他低头看向下方，看到了清晨道路上的车流。观察完毕后，他舒适地躺在床上，转向丽。

"You sleep well Rei?" he asked.  
“你睡得好吗，丽？”他问道。

"I slept comfortably" the girl answered.  
“我睡得很舒服。”女孩回答道。

It was then Shinji started to think about Asuka, causing him to panic and look at his watch, suddenly realising that both his roommates would be quite worried.  
就在那时，真嗣开始想念明日香，这让他慌张地看向手表，突然意识到他的两位室友肯定会非常担心。

"Sorry Rei, but I must go!" the boy announced, sitting up abruptly, "Asuka and Misato are probably worried sick and I have to get ready for school"  
“抱歉，绫波，我必须走了！”男孩突然坐起身宣布道，“明日香和美里可能担心坏了，我还得准备去学校。”

"I understand" Rei replied, before putting her arms around Shinji and hugging him. The boy embraced her back gently as Rei kissed Shinji lightly on the cheek.  
“我明白。”绫波回答，然后伸出双臂拥抱了真嗣。男孩温柔地回抱她，绫波轻轻地在真嗣的脸颊上吻了一下。

"Hey Wondergirl, have you seen Shinji? Did he stay here?" another female voice asked, opening the door to Rei's apartment. As Asuka set her eyes on Shinji and Rei, she stopped in her tracks; Rei, wearing only her nightgown, was kissing Shinji. The redhead stared at them with her mouth open in shock, not sure what to think.  
"嘿，奇迹女孩，你看到真嗣了吗？他留在这里了吗？" 另一个女声问道，推开了绫波的公寓门。当明日香看到真嗣和绫波时，她停下了脚步；绫波只穿着睡裙，正在亲吻真嗣。红发少女震惊地张大了嘴巴，盯着他们，不知该如何是好。

Shinji had heard her walk in and quickly turned to face her. "Asuka, I-!" he started.  
真嗣听到了她的脚步声，迅速转过身面对她。"明日香，我——！" 他开口道。

"Did you keep cumming yesterday because you were so excited about fucking Rei?" Asuka snapped venomously.  
"你昨天是不是因为太兴奋要上绫波而一直高潮？" 明日香恶狠狠地反问道。

"No, what happened is-" he replied weakly.  
"不，发生的是——" 他无力地回答。

"Why didn't you call then? Rei has a phone" the redhead interrupted.  
"那你当时为什么不打电话？丽有手机啊" 红发女孩打断道。

Shinji suddenly felt stupid, but then again Rei hadn't thought of it either.  
真嗣突然觉得自己很蠢，但话说回来，丽也没想到这一点。

"I-I umm d-didn't… I just didn't think about it" he said lamely.  
“我…呃，我…没…我只是没想过”他无力地说道。

"Fuck you Shinji. Fuck. You. I was so worried about you… why? I don't even know! It turns out you were just here all this time fooling around with Rei!" she shouted furiously.  
“去你的，真嗣。去你的。我那么担心你…为什么？我甚至不知道！结果你一直在这里和绫波鬼混！”她愤怒地大喊。

The boy just looked back at her stunned, unable to retort her painful words. Shinji wanted nothing more than to hold her tight, show her that she was totally mistaken, that he loved her, but he was also afraid of her reaction; she seemed so unreasonable right now.  
男孩只是震惊地看着她，无法反驳她那些伤人的话。真嗣只想紧紧抱住她，向她证明她完全误会了，他爱她，但他也害怕她的反应；她现在看起来如此不可理喻。

"Nothing?! You're not going to say anything Shinji?! Fine then, stay here with your slut!" she yelled before turning around and running off.  
"什么都没有？！你什么都不打算说吗，真嗣？！那好吧，你就留在这里和你的荡妇在一起吧！" 她喊完便转身跑开了。

"I do not understand Shinji, isn't it normal for brother and sister to show affection?" Rei asked, confused. "What is a 'slut'? What is 'fucking'?" she continued.  
"我不明白，真嗣，兄妹之间表达感情不是很正常吗？" 绫波困惑地问，"什么是'荡妇'？什么是'操'？" 她继续问道。

The boy snapped out of his paralysis; he had to go after Asuka and make up with her. "Look Rei, I don't have the time to explain and I must go now" he started, any other time Rei's questions would have probably been amusing. "But don't worry, it's not your fault" he answered hastily.  
男孩从僵硬中回过神来；他必须追上明日香并和她和好。"听着，绫波，我没时间解释了，我现在必须走" 他开始说，换作其他时候，绫波的问题可能会很有趣。"但别担心，这不是你的错" 他匆忙回答道。

At that, the boy rushed out of the room, leaving a wide-eyed Rei extremely confused in her bed. Shinji ran down the stairs, taking two steps at a time, praying to God he wouldn't trip. He exited the apartment, just seeing a flash of red turn into an alleyway.  
听到这话，男孩冲出房间，留下一脸茫然的丽躺在床上。真嗣飞奔下楼，一步两阶，祈祷着上帝不要让他摔倒。他走出公寓，刚好看到一抹红色闪进一条小巷。

"Wait!" he shouted before bolting down the street and turning into the alleyway after her. The boy panicked as he ran down the alley noticing many side exits, knowing she could have taken any one of them. On top of that, he was worried he wouldn't be able to catch her as she was very fast. After running through the labyrinth of back alleys, he finally emerged onto a main street. Shinji quickly looked both ways for any sign of his girl. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a red-headed girl running into a store and quickly ran across the road, ignoring the traffic as they honked and yelled at him. The boy entered the store, his eyes searching the shop for red. Shinji felt relief wash over him as he saw the redhead with her back turned towards him next to the counter and he quickly went up to her, grabbed her shoulders and turned her around.  
“等等！”他大喊一声，随即沿着街道狂奔，跟着她拐进小巷。男孩在小巷中奔跑时慌了神，注意到有许多侧出口，知道她可能从任何一个出口逃走。更糟糕的是，他担心自己追不上她，因为她速度极快。穿过迷宫般的后巷后，他终于跑到了一条主干道上。真嗣迅速左右张望，寻找着她的踪迹。眼角余光中，他瞥见一个红发女孩跑进一家商店，便不顾一切地冲过马路，无视那些朝他鸣笛和叫喊的车辆。男孩进入商店，目光在店内搜寻着红色。看到红发女孩背对着他站在柜台旁，真嗣感到一阵释然，他快步上前，抓住她的肩膀，将她转过身来。

"Hey Asu-" he started, before stopping when he noticed the shocked expression on the girl's face.  
"嘿，Asu——" 他刚开口，随即注意到女孩脸上的震惊表情，便停了下来。

"I'm very sorry" he said bowing to her, "I thought you were someone else, I'm sorry"  
"非常抱歉" 他向她鞠躬说道，"我以为你是别人，对不起"

The girl just blushed slightly and turned back to the counter, embarrassed. Realisation then dawned on Shinji that he had lost Asuka. The boy exited the store, kicking a rubbish bin over in frustration.  
女孩微微脸红，尴尬地转回柜台。这时，真嗣才意识到他已经失去了明日香。男孩愤愤地走出商店，一脚踢翻了垃圾桶。

"Shit!" he cursed. "How could I let this happen?"  
"该死！" 他咒骂道。"我怎么会让这种事发生？"

Knowing nothing much would be achieved running around Tokyo-3, he decidedly ran off to their apartment hoping, praying, she went there. The sounds of birds singing filled his ears as the day was starting to commence. The sun shone down on him irritatingly, it felt like the sun was focusing all its rays on his throbbing forehead. Strangers looked on in curiosity as they saw the young boy running down the streets frantically. Sweat was pouring down his brow from the exertion and he moved his hand to wipe it off. Joy filled him as he saw his apartment in the distance and he sprinted towards it. The boy turned into the apartment with such speed he nearly slipped and fell over. Entering the elevator, Shinji collapsed onto the floor in exhaustion. He wasted no time in entering their floor number, panting heavily as the elevator began its torturous ascent. He yelled at the elevator in outrage for moving so slow, but the elevator made no response and continued on as it had previously. Finally, the elevator "pinged" as it reached his floor and the boy hurriedly exited the elevator. He found his door, unlocked it and wrenched it open.  
明知在第三新东京市四处奔波也难有成效，他果断地跑向他们的公寓，希望、祈祷她会去那里。鸟儿的歌唱声充盈着他的耳朵，新的一天正缓缓开始。阳光刺眼地照在他身上，仿佛太阳将所有光线都聚焦在他疼痛的额头上。路人们好奇地看着这个年轻的男孩在街道上狂奔。汗水从他的额头上倾泻而下，他用手抹去。当他看到远处的公寓时，喜悦充满了他的心，他加速向它冲去。男孩以如此快的速度转进公寓，差点滑倒摔倒。进入电梯，真嗣疲惫地瘫倒在地板上。他没有浪费时间输入他们的楼层号码，气喘吁吁地随着电梯开始那折磨人的上升。他愤怒地对着电梯大喊，因为它移动得太慢，但电梯没有任何反应，继续按照之前的节奏运行。终于，电梯"叮"的一声到达了他的楼层，男孩急忙走出电梯。他找到了自己的门，解锁并猛地推开。

Shinji hastily searched their place, first looking in the living room, the kitchen, her room and finally his room; the house was completely empty, he couldn't even hear Misato's snoring, meaning she probably went to NERV in the early morning. The boy bit his lip in frustration, before noticing his mobile phone which had been left on his bed. He swiftly picked it up and dialed Asuka's mobile number. After a few seconds he heard ringing coming from Asuka's room and he swore loudly. Exasperated, he smashed the phone against the wall, breaking it into tiny pieces. Shinji paced around the room, wondering where she would go.  
真嗣急忙在他们住处四处寻找，先是客厅，然后是厨房，她的房间，最后是他的房间；房子里空无一人，他甚至听不到美里打呼噜的声音，这意味着她可能一大早就去了 NERV。男孩咬着嘴唇，感到沮丧，这时他注意到了床上被遗忘的手机。他迅速拿起手机，拨打了明日香的号码。几秒钟后，他听到明日香房间里传来的铃声，不禁大声咒骂。气急败坏之下，他将手机猛地砸向墙壁，摔成了碎片。真嗣在房间里来回踱步，思索着她会去哪里。

"Hikari!" he said out loud.  
“光！”他大声喊道。

It made sense, Hikari was Asuka's best friend and she was the class representative. The redhead probably went to school to be assuaged by Hikari, not to mention Shinji had seen Asuka in her school uniform. Going with this conclusion, he then hurriedly changed himself into his school uniform. The boy went to the bathroom and washed the sweat off his face. Shinji figured he should at least call Misato to let her know he was fine and so returned to Asuka's room. He saw her phone lying on the floor and bent down to scoop it up, noticing the _**You have 1 missed call**_ message on the screen. The boy scrolled through the contacts and dialed Misato's number. The call connected quickly.  
这说得通，Hikari 是 Asuka 最好的朋友，也是班级的代表。红发女孩大概是为了得到 Hikari 的安慰才去学校的，更不用说 Shinji 已经见过 Asuka 穿着校服的样子了。基于这个推论，他急忙换上了自己的校服。男孩走进浴室，洗掉了脸上的汗水。Shinji 认为至少应该给 Misato 打个电话，让她知道自己没事，于是回到了 Asuka 的房间。他看到她的手机躺在地上，弯腰捡了起来，注意到屏幕上显示着“您有 1 个未接来电”。男孩翻阅着联系人，拨通了 Misato 的号码。电话很快接通了。

"Hey Asuka! Did you find Shinji yet? Section 2 said he was at Rei's apartment all night" Misato said through the phone.  
“嘿，Asuka！你找到 Shinji 了吗？第 2 区说他整晚都在 Rei 的公寓里。”Misato 通过电话说道。

"Hi Misato, it's Shinji. Asuka found me at Rei's apartment this morning, I-" he started.  
“嗨，Misato，是我，Shinji。Asuka 今早在 Rei 的公寓找到了我，我——”他开始说道。

"Shinji! Why didn't you take your phone with you last night?! Asuka was worried to death" Misato said cutting him off.  
"真嗣！你昨晚为什么没带手机？！明日香担心死了" 美里打断他说道。

"Sorry! Sorry, I just forgot, I feel really bad about it honestly" Shinji answered.  
"对不起！对不起，我只是忘了，老实说我真的很抱歉" 真嗣回答道。

A sigh could be heard on the other side, "Well at least you were fine. Why are you calling with Asuka's phone, is she with you?" the Major asked.  
电话那头传来一声叹息，"好吧，至少你没事。你怎么用明日香的手机打电话，她跟你在一起吗？" 美里问道。

"I… broke my phone. And Asuka isn't with me, she ran off angry at me when she found me at Rei's apartment. I saw her in her school uniform, so I'm going to go to school, I figure she's probably there right now" he replied.  
"我……弄坏了手机。而且明日香不在我身边，她在发现我在绫波的公寓后生气地跑开了。我看到她穿着校服，所以我打算去学校，我想她现在可能就在那里。"他回答道。

"You two are giving me a headache… can you please make up with her soon, and take Asuka's phone with you so I can call you if need be" Misato requested.  
"你们俩真是让我头疼……请尽快和好，带上明日香的手机，这样我需要时可以打电话给你"美里请求道。

"I will. Sorry again" Shinji responded.  
"我会尽快的。再次抱歉"真嗣回应道。

"Apology accepted, make sure you tell Asuka. Bye now Shinji" Misato said before hanging up.  
“道歉接受，记得告诉明日香。再见，真嗣。”美里说完便挂断了电话。

The boy pocketed Asuka's phone and decided he better get moving. Looking at his watch, he saw it was almost time for school. Shinji thought about his school bag and opted to leave it, not needing nor caring about it. Exiting her room, he rushed out of the residence and closed the door behind him, forgetting to lock it, before making his way down the stairwell.  
男孩将明日香的手机放入口袋，决定赶紧行动。他看了看手表，发现快到上学时间了。真嗣想到了自己的书包，但选择不带，既不需要也不在乎。离开她的房间后，他匆匆跑出住所，关上门，却忘了上锁，然后沿着楼梯下楼。

Shinji felt a horrible pain spreading in his chest as he set off for school. The boy was actually fearful of Asuka's state of mind, she might actually be considering dumping him and he could not bear to live without her. He just wished he had spoken up and not sat there dumbfounded like an idiot at Rei's apartment.  
真嗣在去学校的路上感到胸口一阵剧痛。他其实很害怕明日香的心理状态，她可能真的在考虑和他分手，而他无法忍受没有她的生活。他只希望自己当时能开口说话，而不是像个傻瓜一样呆坐在绫波的公寓里。

As Shinji ran, he collided with some pedestrians. Not having the time to say sorry, he just continued on. The boy was getting annoyed as it seemed everything was purposely slowing him down. He finally arrived at the school, the sun's gaze glaring down on him pitilessly as he fought through his exhaustion and hunger. Shinji entered the front gates alone, feeling unusual as he was so used to walking through the gates with Asuka. He wearily went up the stairs and hurried to his class. Upon entering the classroom, he anxiously looked around the room. Seeing Asuka nowhere in sight, the boy almost broke down and cried, Hikari was gone as well; he now realised the flaw in his plan, Hikari could have stayed at her house. _'Why didn't I think of that before?'_  
当真嗣奔跑时，他撞上了一些行人。没时间道歉，他只是继续前进。男孩感到恼火，似乎一切都在故意拖慢他的脚步。他终于到达了学校，太阳无情地俯视着他，他在疲惫和饥饿中挣扎。真嗣独自走进前门，感觉异常，因为他已经习惯了和明日香一起穿过校门。他疲惫地走上楼梯，急忙赶往教室。进入教室后，他焦急地环顾四周。没有看到明日香的踪影，男孩几乎崩溃哭泣，光也消失了；他现在意识到自己计划的漏洞，光可能留在她家里。'为什么我之前没想到这一点？'

Shinji turned around swiftly and was about to leave the classroom to check Hikari's house, but was halted by the teacher as he walked in; he had no choice but to stay. The boy went over to his desk and sat down grudgingly, silently cursing God at his continuous misfortune today.  
真嗣迅速转身，正要离开教室去检查光的住处，但被走进来的老师拦住了；他别无选择，只能留下。男孩走到自己的座位上，不情愿地坐下，默默地诅咒上帝今天持续的不幸。

With the class representative gone, another student got up and shouted "Rise! Bow! Sit!" Soon after class began, a message came up on Shinji's computer screen.  
随着班级代表的缺席，另一个学生站起来大喊：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”不久后，课程开始，一条消息出现在真嗣的电脑屏幕上。

_**Kensuke: Asuka was looking for you this morning, she came to my house and most likely Touji's too. Guess you're here now, what happened?  
健介：早上明日香在找你，她来过我家，很可能也去了东治家。看来你现在在这儿，发生什么事了？**_

Shinji messaged back. 真嗣回复了消息。

_**Shinji: Yeah I know, she eventually found me… she walked in on me while I was in a precarious situation with Rei and took it the wrong way. I don't know where she is right now, but I'd hazard a guess she's at Hikari's house with Hikari gone.  
真嗣：是啊，我知道，她最后还是找到我了……她撞见我和绫波在一个尴尬的境地，误会了。我不知道她现在在哪里，但我猜她可能在光家里，而光不在。**_

_**Kensuke: Sorry to hear that, I hope you two make up then.  
健介：听到这个真遗憾，希望你们能和好。**_

_**Shinji: Thanks. 真嗣：谢谢。**_

_**Kensuke: No problem. 健介：没事。**_

Shinji waited restlessly for the bell to ring and couldn't help but fidget as he sat there waiting. He was extremely irritated at being stuck at school while Asuka was in strife. The boy looked at the clock, noticing it was exactly one minute later than when he last looked at it. He looked around the room impatiently and concentrated on the bell as hard as he could, hoping that by some miracle he could make it ring with his mind. Shinji clenched and unclenched his hand unconsciously, bashing his head against his desk lightly. He silently cursed himself for destroying his phone as he could have called himself with Asuka's phone to fake a NERV phone call; it was the only excuse he could get out of class with. He had never been more annoyed at the teacher in his life than now, he was usually calm, but today everything weighed down heavily on him.  
真嗣焦躁不安地等待着铃声响起，坐在那里忍不住不停地动来动去。他被留在学校，而明日香正身处困境，这让他极度烦躁。男孩看了一眼时钟，注意到它正好比上次看时晚了一分钟。他不耐烦地环顾教室，全神贯注于铃声，希望能通过某种奇迹用意念让它响起。真嗣无意识地握紧又松开手，轻轻地用头撞着桌子。他暗自咒骂自己毁掉了手机，否则他可以用明日香的手机给自己打电话，假装是 NERV 的来电；这是他唯一能逃课的借口。他一生中从未像现在这样对老师感到如此恼火，他通常很平静，但今天一切都压得他喘不过气来。

It seemed like a lifetime had passed when the bell eventually rang. Sighing with relief, Shinji got out of his chair and walked out of the classroom, not wanting to cause suspicion or give any reason for the teachers to detain him at school. Instead of turning to walk to the lunch area, the boy went down the corridor to exit the school. As he finally left the building, he sped out the front gates and head towards Hikari's house; he had been there just yesterday.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，铃声终于响起。松了一口气，真嗣从椅子上站起身，走出教室，不想引起怀疑或给老师们任何理由在学校里留住他。他没有转向去食堂，而是沿着走廊走向学校出口。当他终于离开大楼时，他快步穿过前门，直奔光的家；昨天他才去过那里。

_'If she's not at Hikari's house, then she'll at least go to the sync test after school and I'm sure I can talk to her then'_ he thought.  
“如果她不在光家，那么她至少会在放学后去同步测试，我肯定到时候能和她谈谈。”他心想。

Upon arriving at her house, Shinji went to her door and rang the doorbell erratically. He immediately heard footsteps as someone walked towards the door. The door opened and he saw Hikari with a puzzled expression on her face as she noticed him.  
到达她家后，真嗣走到门前，急促地按响了门铃。他立刻听到脚步声，有人朝门口走来。门开了，他看到光带着困惑的表情，注意到他站在门外。

"Shinji? School is on right now, what are you doing here?" the girl asked.  
"真嗣？现在不是上课时间吗，你怎么在这里？" 女孩问道。

"Sorry to come unannounced, but I'm looking for Asuka. Is she here?" Shinji replied.  
"未经通知就来了，很抱歉，但我正在找明日香。她在这里吗？" 真嗣回答道。

"No she isn't, sorry" Hikari answered, lying through her teeth.  
"不，她不在，抱歉" 光子回答，撒了个谎。

The boy could tell Hikari wasn't telling the truth, but he figured she was protecting Asuka; Asuka undoubtedly told Hikari not to let him know she was there.  
男孩能看出光并没有说实话，但他猜想她是在保护明日香；明日香无疑告诉过光不要让他知道她在那里。

"Hikari… it's _really_ important, I _must_ see her" Shinji requested resolutely.  
"光…这真的很重要，我必须见她" 真嗣坚决地请求道。

"She's not here" she said in response, more firmly.  
"她不在这里" 她回答得更坚定了。

At that moment, Asuka's mobile phone rang. Shinji was momentarily distracted by it, wondering who would be ringing Asuka right now. Then like a wailing death, the alarm klaxons came on; an angel was attacking. A flurry of red whizzed past Shinji as Asuka ran out the door and headed straight for school. The boy had just missed her arm when she passed him; he was thankful he had finally found her at least.  
就在那一刻，明日香的移动电话响了。真嗣被这突如其来的铃声分了心，好奇谁会在此时给明日香打电话。紧接着，警报声如同哀嚎的死亡之音般响起；有使徒正在袭击。一团红色疾风般掠过真嗣，明日香冲出门外直奔学校。男孩刚错过她的手臂，当她经过时；他庆幸至少终于找到了她。

"Thank you for taking care of her Hikari!" he said, before running off after Asuka.  
“谢谢你照顾她，光！”他说完，便追着明日香跑去。

Shinji could not catch up to the redhead as she was too fast, however, she stopped running upon arriving at the school. The boy realised why as he saw Misato's car parked at the entrance to the school, with Asuka entering it. All the running he did today had his throat particularly dry, the blazing sun didn't help much either. As he neared Misato's car, she beeped her horn at him, obviously wanting him to hurry up; an angel was attacking after all. Shinji noticed Asuka had sat in the front and so he entered the back. The boy sat down completely worn out, his chest felt heavy and he was wheezing.  
真嗣追不上红发女孩，因为她速度太快，然而，她一到学校就停下了脚步。男孩意识到原因，因为他看到美里小姐的车停在学校入口处，明日香正进入车内。今天他跑得喉咙特别干，炽热的阳光也没帮上什么忙。当他走近美里小姐的车时，她按响了喇叭，显然是催促他快点；毕竟有使徒正在袭击。真嗣注意到明日香坐在前排，于是他进入了后排。男孩坐下时已筋疲力尽，胸口沉重，喘息不止。

"I thought you said you were going to school Shinji?" Misato said angrily. "We can't waste time when there's an angel attack"  
"我以为你说你要去学校，真嗣？" 美里生气地说。"天使来袭时我们不能浪费时间"

"Sorry Misato" he simply replied, any reason he gave to defend himself would either sound like an excuse or probably annoy Asuka.  
"对不起，美里" 他简单地回答，任何为自己辩护的理由听起来都像是借口，或者可能会惹恼明日香。

The redhead in question was totally silent, but he could feel that she was deeply hurt. Not having time to waste, Misato quickly drove off, beginning one of her usual crazy races to NERV; though her rush was quite justified right now.  
那位红发少女完全沉默着，但他能感觉到她深受伤害。没有时间浪费，美里迅速开车离开，开始了她惯常的疯狂飙车前往 NERV；尽管现在她的急迫完全有道理。

"Have you two talked to each other yet?" Misato asked as she drove, probing for a response.  
"你们俩已经互相谈过了吗？" 美里一边开车一边问道，试图得到回应。

Seeing as Asuka simply ignored the older woman, Shinji swallowed, trying to moisten his parched throat. "No we haven't, though we sort of didn't get a chance because of the angel attack" he answered; it was mostly true anyway.  
既然明日香只是无视了年长的女性，真嗣咽了咽口水，试图润湿他干涩的喉咙。"不，我们还没谈，不过因为天使袭击，我们也没机会谈" 他回答道；反正大部分也是真的。

"Well for now, just focus on preparing yourself for the upcoming battle" the Major replied, she didn't really want them to get into a fight right now.  
"好吧，现在先专注于为即将到来的战斗做准备" 美里少校回答道，她并不希望他们现在就发生争执。

"Ok…" Shinji said, trailing off. He really wanted to say something to Asuka, but it was difficult to think of what to say. The near heart attacks caused by Misato's driving were just making things harder, plus he wanted to talk to Asuka alone.  
“好吧……” 真嗣说道，话音渐渐消失。他真的很想对明日香说些什么，但很难想出该说什么。美里开车引发的近乎心脏病发作的紧张感只是让事情变得更难，而且他还想和明日香单独谈谈。

"Asuka… we'll talk properly when we get the chance. But I at least want you to know, I only slept over at Rei's apartment last night, nothing else and… I love you" Shinji explained, just hoping that it put the redhead a little bit at ease.  
“明日香……等有机会我们会好好谈谈的。但至少我想让你知道，我昨晚只是在丽那里过夜，没有别的，而且……我爱你。” 真嗣解释道，只是希望能让红发女孩稍微安心一些。

Not surprisingly, the young girl said nothing back and continued to remain silent. Shinji decided it best to just save his strength until they got to NERV and attempt to catch Asuka as he assumed she would run off. The car soon arrived at NERV and Misato stopped the car just before entering the elevator.  
不出所料，年轻女孩没有回应，继续保持沉默。真嗣决定最好保存体力，直到他们到达 NERV，并试图在明日香跑开时抓住她。车子很快到达 NERV，美里在进入电梯前停下了车。

"You guys go straight to the changing rooms and then to the eva cages when you're changed, it'll be faster this way" the Major ordered.  
"你们直接去更衣室，换好衣服后去 EVA 笼子那边，这样更快" 少校命令道。

With that, they both exited Misato's car and she drove into the car elevator, beginning her descent. Just as Shinji turned to face Asuka, he was greeted with an empty void, replacing the space she had previously occupied. The boy scanned around, quickly noticing a retreating figure in the direction of the elevators. _'Well, this is what I saved up my strength for'_ he thought as he sprinted down the hallway as fast as his legs could take him. Unexpectedly he was gaining ground, but Asuka had been given too much of a head start and entered the elevator, pressing the close door button. He saw the two sides of the elevator closing, Asuka's distressed expression forever imprinted into his mind as he collided at full speed into the elevator doors. His head was pounding excruciatingly, additionally from the dehydration of today's activities. Shinji got up dazed, taking the second elevator as he began his descent down to the changing rooms. He sat alone in the corner, nursing his throbbing head.  
说完，两人都离开了美里小姐的车，她开车进入了汽车电梯，开始下降。正当真嗣转身面对明日香时，他面对的是一片空虚，取代了她之前所在的空间。男孩四处扫视，很快注意到一个向电梯方向退去的身影。'好吧，这就是我积蓄力量的原因' 他想，然后以双腿能承受的最快速度沿着走廊飞奔。出乎意料的是，他正在缩短距离，但明日香已经领先太多，进入了电梯，按下了关门按钮。他看到电梯的两扇门正在关闭，明日香焦虑的表情永远印在了他的脑海中，他以全速撞上了电梯门。他的头剧烈地疼痛，再加上今天活动导致的脱水。真嗣晕乎乎地站起来，乘坐第二部电梯，开始下降到更衣室。他独自坐在角落里，抚摸着抽痛的头部。

"God damn, she is so damn stubborn!" he shouted at the ceiling.  
"该死，她真是太固执了！" 他对着天花板喊道。

The elevator seemed unusually slow today, as it irritatingly ticked with each floor. When he reached his floor, he immediately headed to the changing rooms as fast as he could. Shinji had a look of disbelief as he saw Asuka already suited up and heading over to the eva cages. The boy stopped and took a breath, _'how in the world?'_ he pondered.  
今天电梯似乎异常缓慢，每层楼都令人烦躁地发出滴答声。当他到达自己的楼层时，他立即尽可能快地朝更衣室走去。看到明日香已经穿好驾驶服并朝 eva 笼子走去，真嗣露出了难以置信的表情。男孩停下脚步，深吸一口气，'这怎么可能？'他思索着。

Sighing, Shinji entered the changing room, taking out his plugsuit from his locker. He stripped off his clothes and hastily dressed into his plugsuit. There was no point in running anymore and so he walked the rest of the way to the eva cages. He looked up at his entry plug wearily and got inside. The boy felt the familiar sensation of nausea as he was inserted into his eva. The tank filled up with LCL, and he fought back the gag reflex as the liquid entered his mouth; it had been some time since he had been in the entry plug.  
叹了口气，真嗣走进更衣室，从储物柜里拿出他的驾驶服。他脱掉衣服，匆忙穿上驾驶服。再跑也没有意义了，于是他剩下的路都慢慢走着去往 eva 笼子。他疲倦地抬头看着自己的插入栓，爬了进去。男孩感受到熟悉的恶心感，当他被插入 eva 时。LCL 液体充满驾驶舱，他强忍着反胃感，液体进入他的口中；他已经有一段时间没有进入插入栓了。

A screen appeared with Misato's face, "The target is suspended above the city currently doing nothing, our best option is to wait and observe it until we figure out how we can defeat it. Here is a visual of it now" she explained.  
屏幕上出现了美里小姐的脸，"目标目前悬浮在城市上空，没有任何动作，我们最好的选择是等待并观察它，直到我们找出如何击败它的方法。现在给你看它的影像"她解释道。

A giant purple circle came up on the screen, it looked somewhat like the double helix model of the DNA strand. Shinji looked at it in awe as it hovered above the city.  
屏幕上出现了一个巨大的紫色圆圈，看起来有点像 DNA 双螺旋结构模型。真嗣敬畏地看着它悬浮在城市上空。

"Asuka's sync ratio has dropped to 58" Maya called out.  
“明日香的同步率下降到了 58%。” 伊吹玛亚喊道。

"What about Shinji's?" Misato asked, almost balking at the low sync ratio.  
“那真嗣的呢？” 美里问道，几乎对这低同步率感到震惊。

"It's dropped as well, it's at 56" Maya answered.  
"也掉了，现在是 56" 真嗣回答道。

"Alright, what about Rei?" the Major continued.  
"好的，那丽的情况呢？" 司令继续问道。

"It's higher than usual at 53, but still lower than the others" Maya finished.  
"比平时高，达到 53，但仍低于其他人" 真嗣总结道。

No one noticed, but Asuka scowled at hearing that Rei's sync ratio was higher. To her it seemed to prove that something had happened between her and Shinji, more than him just simply sleeping there.  
无人察觉，但听到绫波的同步率更高时，明日香皱起了眉头。对她来说，这似乎证明了她和真嗣之间发生了些什么，不仅仅是他简单地睡在那里。

Misato deliberated momentarily before speaking up. "Alright Asuka, you have the highest sync ratio so you take point. Shinji you go up after her and act as backup"  
美里稍作思索后开口道：“好吧，明日香，你的同步率最高，你打头阵。真嗣，你跟在她后面，负责支援。”

"Hai" they answered, not in unison.  
“是”他们回答，并非异口同声。

Asuka entered the catapult and felt the immense lurching sensation as she was launched to the surface. Unit 02 exited the catapult and took up position to begin observing the angel. No sooner had she setup position, then the perfect loop broke apart and one end of the angel went straight for her eva.  
明日香进入弹射器，感受到巨大的颠簸感，随着她被发射到水面。二号机离开弹射器，准备开始观察使徒。她刚一就位，完美的环形就破裂开来，使徒的一端径直朝她的 EVA 冲来。

"Shinji, go now!" Misato shouted urgently.  
“真嗣，快走！”美里急切地喊道。

Shinji entered his catapult, fighting the nausea he felt in his head as he got launched up to the surface. Asuka reacted fast and erected her AT-field but to no avail as the angel penetrated Asuka's AT-field as easily as if it were tissue paper. It began infecting Asuka's eva, massive veins and bulges appearing all over her eva. Terrified, Asuka looked down at her body, seeing her veins bulge, and screamed out in pain. The angel seemed to push deeper into Unit 02 and the redhead fought it desperately, keeping it at a standstill for the moment. Shinji hurriedly took out a rifle from an armament building and aimed it at the angel. The moment he lined up the perfect shot, the other side of the angel shot towards him and broke the rifle into a thousand pieces. Desperate to save Asuka, the boy took out his prog-knife and stabbed the angel, causing it to scream and spray blood. The female eva pilot screamed in pain as she felt the angel's pain.  
真嗣进入弹射器，强忍着头部的不适感被发射到地表。明日香反应迅速，展开了她的 AT 力场，但无济于事，天使如同穿透薄纸一般轻易突破了明日香的 AT 力场。它开始感染明日香的 EVA，巨大的血管和肿块遍布 EVA 全身。明日香惊恐地低头看着自己的身体，看到血管凸起，痛苦地尖叫起来。天使似乎更深入地侵入了 02 号机，红发少女拼命抵抗，暂时将其阻挡在原地。真嗣急忙从武器库中取出一把步枪，瞄准天使。就在他准备开枪的瞬间，天使的另一侧向他袭来，将步枪击成碎片。为了救明日香，男孩拔出高频刀刺向天使，使其尖叫并喷出鲜血。女 EVA 驾驶员感受到天使的痛苦，也痛苦地尖叫起来。

"Not good! The angel is forming a bond physically and mentally with Asuka's eva!" Ritsuko shouted in alarm.  
“不好了！天使正在与明日香的 EVA 形成身心上的联结！”律子惊慌地喊道。

Shinji found himself preoccupied as the other end of the angel began attacking him. Not wanting to meet the same fate as Asuka, he held it back with his hand, which began getting infected as well. The boy saw his hand bulging with veins, staring in shock as he found himself absolutely helpless.  
真嗣发现自己正忙于应对天使另一端的攻击。他不想遭遇与明日香相同的命运，于是用手挡住了攻击，但手也开始被感染。男孩看到自己的手青筋暴起，震惊地发现自己完全无助。

The angel began directly communicating with the second child's mind, it took on the form of Asuka.  
天使开始直接与二号适格者的心灵沟通，它化身为明日香的模样。

"Give up, you cannot win" her other self said cruelly.  
“放弃吧，你赢不了的。”另一个她残忍地说道。

"Who are you?" the real Asuka asked.  
"你是谁？"真正的明日香问道。

"I am you, the you that exists in other people's minds" the other Asuka said, smirking.  
"我是你，存在于他人心中的你。"另一个明日香说着，嘴角勾起一抹讥笑。

"I am me, you're an imposter" Asuka screamed at the angel.  
"我是我，你是冒牌货。"明日香对着天使尖叫道。

"Pathetic being" the angel retorted.  
"可怜的家伙"，天使反驳道。

Despite being aggravated that she was the one that always suffered the angel mind fuck and despite the hurt she felt this morning when she saw Shinji with Rei, Asuka understood that she could not get out of this situation on her own strength. She did the only thing she could do, knowing that even if the worst had happened… she still loved Shinji.  
尽管她因总是承受天使的心理折磨而感到恼火，尽管今早看到真嗣和绫波在一起时感到心痛，但明日香明白，仅凭自己的力量是无法摆脱这种困境的。她只能做唯一能做的事，心里明白即使最坏的情况发生了……她依然爱着真嗣。

"Shinji, please help me" Asuka pleaded.  
"真嗣，请帮帮我"，明日香恳求道。

"You call for that boy who betrayed you? You truly are pathetic. You deserve to die" the angel said viciously.  
"你呼唤那个背叛你的男孩？你真是可悲。你该死" 天使恶狠狠地说道。

"Shinji, please save me! Save me like you always do" Asuka implored louder.  
"真嗣，请救救我！像你总是做的那样救我" 明日香更大声地恳求道。

Shinji heard her words and they cut through him like a knife; he knew he could not resolve anything unless this stupid angel went down. Deciding on a course of action, the boy used his knife and cut the angel again, making it let go of him. He took advantage of the opportunity to run over to Asuka and the angel quickly moved around to counter-attack. Shinji was expecting this, however, and reacted just in time, leaping up into the air as high as he could and aiming his prog knife down at the angel. As he fell down at phenomenal speed, his eva sliced straight through the angel severing its connection to Asuka. The female eva pilot screamed in pain and fell unconscious, the red eva subsequently slumped.  
真嗣听到她的话，它们像刀子一样刺痛了他；他知道除非这个愚蠢的天使倒下，否则什么问题都解决不了。决定采取行动，男孩用他的刀再次割伤天使，使其松开了他。他利用这个机会跑向明日香，天使迅速移动进行反击。然而，真嗣预料到了这一点，并及时反应，尽可能高地跳入空中，将他的 prog 刀瞄准天使。当他以惊人的速度下落时，他的 eva 直接切断了天使与明日香的连接。女性 eva 驾驶员痛苦地尖叫，随后昏迷过去，红色 eva 随之瘫倒。

"Shinji, the good news is that you saved Unit 02 from being infected and weakened the angel" Misato declared.  
“真嗣，好消息是你成功阻止了 02 号机被感染，并削弱了使徒。”美里宣布道。

"The bad news?" Shinji prompted, holding his breath.  
“坏消息呢？”真嗣追问，屏住了呼吸。

"Such a severe cut off from the angel may have caused mental trauma for Asuka" Misato answered.  
“如此严重的与使徒断开连接，可能给明日香造成了精神创伤。”美里回答。

"What?! That can't be!" Shinji exclaimed.  
"什么？！这不可能！" 真嗣惊呼道。

"Regrettably, the angel was communicating to her directly through the mind. Ritsuko believes there'll be no lasting physical damage, however, her mental state is questionable. Nonetheless, the longer she stays without treatment the worse it could get, you need to finish off that angel" the Major explained.  
"遗憾的是，天使正通过心灵直接与她交流。赤木博士认为不会有持久的身体损伤，但她的精神状态令人担忧。不过，她停留时间越长，情况可能越糟，你需要尽快解决那个天使。" 少校解释道。

"Oh I will" the boy replied determinedly.  
"哦，我会的" 男孩坚定地回答。

"Sync ratio skyrocketing to 203!" Maya announced, astounded.  
"同步率飙升至 203！" 真希波宣布道，震惊不已。

"Is he going berserk again?" Misato asked scared, remembering the last time he had gone berserk; he had eaten the angel with Unit 01 absorbing the S2 engine, followed by Shinji disappearing for three months.  
"他又疯了吗？" 美里害怕地问道，想起了上次他发疯的情景；他用初号机吞噬了使徒并吸收了 S2 引擎，随后真嗣消失了三个月。

"No, it looks like he's in total control this time" Maya replied, looking up at the view screen.  
"不，这次看起来他完全掌控住了局面" 真希波回答道，抬头看向显示屏。

Misato looked at Shinji and saw something frightening; his face was set into pure rage with a cruel smirk and his usually blue eyes were almost dark red. His sync ratio was so high that every movement was fluid. Unit 01 charged at the now sliced ring, the angel saw him coming and instantly prepared for attack. As the eva approached it, it feinted and Shinji fell for it. It used the opportunity to entangle itself around his neck, squeezing tight. With god-like strength, Shinji pulled on the angel and ripped it off. The angel screamed in pain as it was ripped into pieces. Now that the angel's defence was down, he focused his AT-field on either side of the angel. The angel was crushed by the AT-field and with a final sickening "CRACK!" the angel's core broke and it exploded into the familiar cross-shaped explosion. Out of the fire walked Unit 01 in victory.  
美里看着真嗣，看到了令人恐惧的一幕；他的脸上带着残忍的冷笑，原本蓝色的眼睛几乎变成了深红色。他的同步率极高，每一个动作都流畅无比。初号机向着已被切开的圆环冲去，使徒见他来势汹汹，立刻做好了迎战准备。当 EVA 接近时，使徒虚晃一招，真嗣上当受骗。使徒趁机缠绕在他的脖子上，紧紧勒住。真嗣以神一般的力量扯住使徒，将其生生撕下。使徒痛苦地尖叫着，被撕成了碎片。现在使徒的防御已破，他集中 AT 力场于使徒两侧。使徒被 AT 力场碾压，随着最后一声令人作呕的“咔嚓”声，使徒的核心破裂，爆炸成熟悉的十字形。火焰中，初号机胜利地走了出来。

"Sync ratio dropping back down to 60" Maya declared.  
“同步率回落到 60。”玛雅宣布道。

Shinji immediately ran to Asuka's eva. "Eject the entry plug!" he shouted.  
真嗣立刻跑向明日香的 EVA。“弹出插入栓！”他大喊道。

"Confirm that! Do as he says!" Misato shouted.  
“确认一下！照他说的做！”美里喊道。

They sent the signal out to Unit 02, causing the entry plug to shoot out, which Shinji caught.  
他们向二号机发出信号，导致插入栓弹射出来，被真嗣接住了。

"Ritsuko, get to the hospital as fast as you can! I'm bringing her over there" Shinji demanded.  
“律子，尽快赶到医院！我带她过去。”真嗣要求道。

"Hai" Ritsuko replied, understanding the seriousness of the situation.  
“海” 律子回答道，理解了情况的严重性。

Unit 01 ran carrying the entry plug, making exceptional progress due to the sheer size of its bounds. Shinji soon arrived at the NERV hospital and he set down the capsule. Exiting his eva, he made his way down onto the ground where Asuka's capsule lay. The boy didn't hesitate to open the hatch as he rushed to help his girl. Looking inside, he saw Asuka in her plugsuit laying down unconscious in the LCL. Shinji hastily pulled the girl out and picked her up, carrying her gently. He pressed his hand against Asuka's chest and felt it rising up and down; she was still breathing. The boy rushed inside the hospital, carrying the girl. He was instantly greeted by paramedics who had been informed of the situation.  
初号机扛着插入栓奔跑，由于其巨大的步伐，进展异常迅速。真嗣很快到达了 NERV 医院，他将胶囊放下。离开 EVA 后，他走向地面上的明日香胶囊。男孩毫不犹豫地打开舱盖，急忙去帮助他的女孩。往里看，他看到明日香穿着插入栓服，昏迷在 LCL 中。真嗣迅速将女孩拉出并轻轻抱起，他用手按在明日香的胸口，感觉到她的呼吸起伏；她还活着。男孩抱着女孩冲进医院，立刻被事先得知情况的医护人员迎接。

"She needs help quick!" Shinji shouted.  
“她需要快速救助！” 真嗣喊道。

The paramedics, accompanied by nurses and doctors took in the sight of the scared brown-haired boy holding up the unconscious body of the beautiful red head, both soaked in a yellowy orange liquid. They immediately took Asuka into their care, placing her onto a stretcher and hurriedly moving her to a suitable room. Shinji followed them, wanting to make sure Asuka was okay. Arriving at the procedural room, one of the doctors turned around and halted the boy.  
医护人员在护士和医生的陪同下，看到了那个惊恐的棕发男孩抱着昏迷不醒的美丽红发女孩，两人都浸在黄橙色的液体中。他们立刻将明日香接手过来，将她放在担架上，急忙送往合适的房间。真嗣紧随其后，想要确保明日香平安无事。到达手术室时，其中一位医生转过身来，拦住了男孩。

"I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to stay outside" the doctor said, as the second child was taken into the room.  
“对不起，但我得请你留在外面。”医生说道，与此同时，第二个孩子被带进了房间。

"What? Why?" Shinji asked, exasperated.  
“什么？为什么？”真嗣焦急地问道。

"You'll be in the way or simply distract us. Please… this is for her own good" the doctor said compassionately.  
"你会妨碍我们或者只是分散我们的注意力。请……这是为了她好" 医生同情地说道。

"Fine… I understand, but you better take damn good care of her" Shinji requested.  
"好吧……我明白，但你们最好好好照顾她" 真嗣要求道。

"We will sir" the doctor replied, bowing.  
"我们会的，先生" 医生回答，鞠了一躬。

The boy watched closely as the door closed and continued to stare at it; he hoped beyond hope that nothing had happened to her. Shinji was broken out of his staring contest with the door when Ritsuko came rushing in.  
男孩紧盯着门关闭，继续凝视着它；他无比希望她没有发生任何事。当律子急匆匆地进来时，真嗣才从与门的对视中回过神来。

"How is she?" the woman asked, concerned.  
“她怎么样了？”女人关切地问道。

"I don't know, they're treating her now" Shinji answered.  
“我不知道，他们正在治疗她。”真嗣回答道。

"Alright I'll go in and help, I will do everything I can to make sure she recovers" Ritsuko replied, smiling softly at Shinji.  
"好的，我会进去帮忙，我会尽一切努力确保她康复" 赤木律子回答道，温柔地对真嗣微笑。

"Thanks Ritsuko" the boy said, smiling back.  
"谢谢你，律子" 真嗣笑着回应。

With that, Ritsuko went in and shut the door. Shinji felt a little more at ease knowing he had a professional he trusted treating Asuka. Knowing it would probably take a while still, he sat down on the bench outside; there was nothing he could do now but wait. The boy prayed that his swift retrieval prevented anything serious happening to her. As time passed by, he soon became very interested in the floor, noticing how pristine clean it was; NERV maintenance sure was outstanding. Shinji felt a sense of Déjà vu as yet again he was stuck waiting, unable to do anything, though he felt much better than he had at school.  
说完，律子走进去关上了门。真嗣感到稍微安心了一些，因为他信任的专业人士正在治疗明日香。知道这可能还需要一段时间，他坐在外面的长椅上；现在除了等待，他什么也做不了。男孩祈祷他的迅速行动能防止她受到严重伤害。随着时间的流逝，他开始对地板产生了浓厚的兴趣，注意到它是多么一尘不染；NERV 的维护工作确实出色。真嗣感到一种似曾相识的感觉，又一次被困在等待中，无法做任何事情，尽管他感觉比在学校时好多了。

At this point, Misato came rushing in. Noticing Shinji, she sat down beside him. "Here, I brought you some clothes to change into. I'll stay here and make sure everything's ok. If anything happens, I'll know" she reassured.  
就在这时，美里冲了进来。注意到真嗣，她在他旁边坐下。“来，我给你带了些换洗的衣服。我会留在这里确保一切都没问题。如果有任何情况，我会知道的。”她安慰道。

"Thanks Misato" the boy replied appreciatively.  
“谢谢你，美里。”男孩感激地回答。

Shinji took the offered clothes and walked around the hospital, trying to find the nearest bathroom or change room. He spotted one soon enough and entered it. As he closed the door, he noticed the toilet had a shower as well. He figured he should take a quick shower before changing into the new clothes Misato had brought him. After showering and dressing up, he left his plugsuit in the toilet as he couldn't be bothered finding somewhere to put it; he was sure some NERV cleaner would come by it and throw it in the trash or something. Exiting the bathroom, Shinji walked back to Asuka's room and sat back down next to his guardian.  
真嗣接过衣服，在医院里四处寻找最近的洗手间或更衣室。他很快找到了一间并走了进去。关上门时，他注意到马桶旁还有淋浴设施。他想在换上美里带来的新衣服前应该快速冲个澡。洗完澡并穿好衣服后，他把插入栓服留在马桶里，懒得去找地方放；他确信某个 NERV 的清洁工会发现它并扔进垃圾桶之类的。离开洗手间，真嗣回到明日香的房间，再次坐在他的监护人旁边。

"Anything happen?" the boy asked Misato.  
“有什么事吗？”男孩问美里。

"No, and probably not for a while" she answered, giving him a warm hug.  
“没有，而且可能暂时也不会有”她回答，给了他一个温暖的拥抱。

Shinji was a little relieved that he could simply sit down and rest, his day had been long and arduous after all, besides Asuka was just in the next room. He tapped his feet anxiously as he waited together with Misato. Many hours passed by and the two roommates were both beginning to worry. Several times Shinji had gotten up to open the door and check in on her, only to be stopped by Misato holding him back and shaking her head; the redhead was a special person to both of them. At last, Ritsuko walked out of the door, her face impassive.  
真嗣稍感宽慰，他终于可以坐下来休息了，毕竟他的一天漫长而艰辛，何况明日香就在隔壁房间。他和美里一起焦急地等待着，脚尖不安地敲打着地面。时间一小时一小时地过去，两位室友都开始担心起来。真嗣几次起身想去开门查看她的情况，都被美里拦住，摇头示意；红发女孩对他们俩来说都是特别的存在。终于，律子走了出来，面无表情。

"How is she?" Shinji asked eagerly.  
“她怎么样了？”真嗣急切地问道。

"She's fine at the moment, we are not completely sure of the damage though" Ritsuko started. "It seems like nothing is wrong with her physically though, thanks to you bringing her here so quickly. We can't be sure about her mental state till she wakes up though. I did take some brain scans and they're very similar to the ones on file. You can go in and see her now" she said cheerfully.  
“目前她还好，但我们还不能完全确定损伤程度。”律子开始说道，“从生理上看，似乎没有什么问题，这多亏了你及时把她带到这里。不过，在她醒来之前，我们还不能确定她的精神状态。我做了一些脑部扫描，结果与档案中的非常相似。你现在可以进去看她了。”她愉快地说道。

"Thank you Ritsuko" Shinji let out, relieved.  
“谢谢你，律子。”真嗣松了一口气，感激地说。

"No problem, I'm hoping she's okay" the doctor replied, smiling.  
"没问题，我希望她没事" 医生微笑着回答。

Shinji and Misato both rushed impatiently into the room. There they saw Asuka in a hospital gown, sleeping in a bed. Her beautiful red hair was spread out over her pillow, giving her the appearance of a traditional angel. The boy reached over and caressed the girl's face with his hand, causing her to sigh contentedly. Shinji kissed her softly on the forehead, sat down on a nearby chair and held her hand. Asuka's hand gripped his firmly in response. Suddenly, the boy didn't care about the exhaustion today, the panic he felt and the injury from colliding into the elevator; it was all worth it to see Asuka safe and sound. Not wanting to force her awake nor deprive her of rest, he decided to wait for the redhead to wake up herself.  
真嗣和美里都急切地冲进房间。在那里，他们看到明日香穿着医院病号服，躺在床上睡着了。她美丽的红色长发散落在枕头上，使她看起来像一个传统的天使。男孩伸手轻抚女孩的脸颊，让她满足地叹息。真嗣轻轻地吻了她的额头，坐在旁边的椅子上，握住她的手。明日香的手紧紧地回握着他的。突然间，男孩不再在意今天的疲惫、恐慌和撞到电梯的伤；只要看到明日香安然无恙，这一切都值得。他不想强迫她醒来，也不想剥夺她的休息，于是决定等红发女孩自己醒来。

"She looks so peaceful" Shinji commented aloud.  
"她看起来如此平静" 真嗣大声评论道。

"A rare sight for her" Misato said, chuckling.  
"对她来说真是难得一见的景象" 美里笑着说。

"I really hope she's okay" he said, trying to calm his restlessness.  
"我真的希望她没事" 他说，试图平息自己的不安。

"She seems fine at the moment, though I hope so too" his guardian encouraged.  
"目前看来她似乎还好，不过我也希望如此" 他的监护人鼓励道。

Shinji slowly began to close his eyes as the time passed by…  
随着时间的流逝，真嗣缓缓地闭上了眼睛……

---

_After running through the labyrinth of back alleys, he finally emerged onto a main street. Shinji quickly looked both ways for any sign of his girl. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a red-headed girl running into a store and quickly ran across the road, ignoring the traffic as they honked and yelled at him. The boy entered the store, his eyes searching the shop for red. Shinji felt relief wash over him as he saw the redhead with her back turned towards him next to the counter and he quickly went up to her, grabbed her shoulders and turned her around.  
穿过迷宫般的小巷后，他终于来到了一条主干道。真嗣迅速左右张望，寻找着她的身影。眼角余光中，他瞥见一个红发女孩跑进了一家商店，便不顾一切地冲过马路，无视着喇叭声和司机们的叫骂。男孩进入商店，目光在店内搜寻着红色。看到红发女孩背对着他站在柜台旁，真嗣感到一阵释然，他快步上前，抓住她的肩膀将她转了过来。_

_"Hey Asu-" he started, stopping as he noticed Asuka crying. "I'm sorry, I didn't do anything, I still love you, please don't be upset" he continued.  
“嘿，明日香——”他开口道，随即停了下来，注意到明日香正在哭泣。“对不起，我什么都没做，我依然爱你，请不要生气。”他继续说道。_

_"You jerk" she replied, taking his hand and tugging him out the store…  
"你这个混蛋" 她回应道，抓起他的手，拽着他离开了商店……_

---

Asuka finally awoke, her hand tugging on Shinji's hand, breaking him out of his daydream. At first, he didn't realise what had happened until he felt her hand go slack. He turned to look at the girl and saw her eyes opening. Shocked at her revival, the boy released his hold on her hand and sat there staring at her.  
绫波终于醒来，她的手拉着真嗣的手，将他从白日梦中唤醒。起初，他并未意识到发生了什么，直到他感觉到她的手变得无力。他转头看向女孩，发现她的眼睛正在睁开。对她的苏醒感到震惊，男孩松开了握着她的手，坐在那里凝视着她。

"Whoa… what happened? Why am I here? I feel so weird" an inebriated Asuka said aloud.  
"哇……发生了什么？我为什么在这里？我感觉好奇怪" 醉酒的绫波大声说道。

Shinji was so elated, he picked Asuka up and held her tight. Embracing her as warmly as he could, tears threatened to make their way down his cheek.  
真嗣高兴极了，他抱起明日香紧紧拥抱着。尽可能温暖地拥抱着她，泪水几乎要从他的脸颊滑落。

"I'm so glad you're okay Asuka" he professed sincerely.  
“我真高兴你没事，明日香。”他真诚地表白道。

The girl was surprised at first, but soon relaxed. "I appreciate your show of affection Ikari, I didn't realise how much you miss me" she said, sticking her tongue out at him.  
女孩起初有些惊讶，但很快放松下来。“谢谢你的示爱，碇君，我没想到你这么想我。”她说着，朝他吐了吐舌头。

He stroked her hair, causing Asuka to push his hand away immediately. "I have my limits third child"  
他轻抚她的头发，结果明日香立刻推开了他的手。“我有我的底线，第三适格者。”

Shinji looked at her strangely but was soon interrupted as Misato came up and gave them a big bear hug, squeezing them all together.  
真嗣奇怪地看着她，但很快被美里打断，她走过来给了他们一个大大的熊抱，把他们都紧紧搂在一起。

"Gee, did I miss something? I thought you would be happy to be rid of me" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“哎呀，我错过了什么吗？我还以为你会很高兴摆脱我呢。”明日香讽刺地说道。

"Don't ever say that" Shinji replied, now a little worried at how she was acting; it was familiar, but he couldn't quite place it. Additionally, she wasn't at all giving him the cold shoulder like earlier today. "Is anything wrong at all? You suffered head trauma in the last angel battle, any problems you can feel?" the boy asked, concerned.  
"千万别这么说。" 真嗣回答道，现在对她这种行为感到有些担忧；这很熟悉，但他又说不准具体是什么。此外，她完全没有像今天早些时候那样对他冷淡。"有什么不对劲吗？你在上一次使徒战斗中头部受了伤，有没有感觉到什么问题？" 男孩关切地问道。

"Nope! I feel absolutely fine, which also means I wanna get out of here" the girl responded, getting up.  
"没有！我感觉好极了，这也意味着我想离开这里。" 女孩回答道，站起身来。

Shinji automatically went to help her up.  
真嗣自然而然地过去扶她起来。

"I don't need your help Ikari" the redhead snapped.  
"我不需要你的帮助，碇" 红发女孩厉声说道。

It was oddly familiar; that same tone, that same way she talked… then it hit him. "Asuka what's the last thing you remember?" Shinji asked, trying to confirm his suspicions.  
这感觉异常熟悉；同样的语气，同样的说话方式……然后他恍然大悟。"明日香，你记得的最后一件事是什么？" 真嗣问道，试图确认他的猜疑。

"Why are you asking me that? The last thing hmmm… it's the night after the 12th angel, right?" Asuka answered.  
"你为什么问我这个？最后一件事……嗯……是在第 12 使徒之后的那个晚上，对吧？" 明日香回答道。

It felt as if the boy's heart was cut in two and one side was thrown into the trash. There was nothing wrong with her at all, apart from the fact she had lost her memory. Not just any memory, however, all their confessions and all their lovemaking had been forgotten, that's why she was acting this way. Shinji looked at Misato with anguish on his face. His guardian saw his face, understanding immediately that he must be suffering gravely and she gave him a sympathetic look.  
男孩的心仿佛被割成了两半，其中一半被丢进了垃圾桶。她其实并没有什么问题，除了失去了记忆这一点。但不仅仅是任何记忆，他们所有的告白和所有的缠绵都已被遗忘，这就是她如此表现的原因。真嗣看着美里，脸上满是痛苦。他的监护人看到他的表情，立刻明白他一定正遭受着极大的痛苦，于是给了他一个同情的眼神。

Asuka noticed Shinji's mood fall and looked at him curiously. "What's wrong? Is there something wrong?" she asked.  
明日香注意到真嗣情绪低落，好奇地看着他。"怎么了？有什么不对劲吗？"她问道。

"Yes Asuka… it's at least quite a few months from the defeat of the 12th angel. The reason you suffered head trauma is because of our most recent battle against the _16th_ angel, it seems you've lost your memory" Shinji explained, trying not to sound raspy.  
“是的，明日香……距离击败第 12 使徒已经过去至少几个月了。你头部受伤的原因是因为我们最近与第 16 使徒的战斗，看来你失去了记忆。”真嗣解释道，尽量不让自己的声音显得沙哑。

"_16th!_ How did I forget _that_ much?" Asuka exclaimed.  
"第 16 个！我怎么会忘记这么多？" 明日香惊呼道。

"Well, it seems the last angel was communicating directly to your mind during the battle before it was defeated and you went unconscious" Misato replied. "We weren't sure how it affected you, but now we can see its effect has been significant memory loss"  
"嗯，看来在与最后一个使徒战斗时，它直接与你的意识交流，随后它被击败，你也陷入了昏迷" 美里回答道。"我们不确定这对你产生了什么影响，但现在看来，它的影响导致了你严重的记忆丧失"

"Damn that sucks… and that's a lot to forget" the redhead said, sounding a little crestfallen. "Did I… forget anything important?" she asked.  
"该死，这真糟糕……忘记的东西太多了" 红发少女有些沮丧地说道。"我……有没有忘记什么重要的事情？" 她问道。

Shinji almost felt like breaking down, the closeness they had achieved had been completely shattered, his love was now unrequited. _'YES, something insanely important'_ Shinji thought to himself, he really wanted to hold her in his arms and kiss her, but if she had forgotten everything there was no chance for any of that.  
真嗣几乎感到崩溃，他们曾经拥有的亲密关系已被彻底粉碎，他的爱如今变得无望。'是的，有件事极其重要' 真嗣心中暗想，他真的很想将她拥入怀中并亲吻她，但如果她忘记了所有，这一切都无从谈起。

Noticing the boy's continued silence, Misato spoke up again. "Yes… yes you have… there's a lot we have to fill you in on" she answered in a serious tone.  
注意到男孩持续的沉默，美里再次开口。"是的…是的，你确实有…我们有很多事情需要向你解释" 她以严肃的语气回答。

"So, what was-" Asuka started.  
"那么，是什么事情-" 明日香开始问道。

"Not now" Misato interrupted firmly. "I don't think you understand, there's far too much to cover in one simple conversation" she finished. Misato knew that right now, especially with Shinji's mood, it was not a good idea to start this conversation. Besides, it was better if they first reported it to Ritsuko to see what she thought.  
"现在不行" 美里坚定地打断道。"我想你没明白，这事儿太复杂，不是一次简单对话能说清的" 她最后说道。美里知道，尤其是现在，考虑到真嗣的情绪，开始这个话题绝非明智之举。此外，最好先向律子汇报，看看她的意见。

"Ok fine, I'm sure you can understand that I want to know though. For now, I can't change what's happened and I wanna get out this hospital anyway" Asuka conceded. "Any clothes for me to change into?"  
"好吧，我明白你肯定想知道。但眼下，我改变不了已经发生的事，而且我也想尽快离开这家医院" 明日香让步道。"有衣服给我换吗？"

"Yes, I brought some for you" Misato answered, handing them to the young girl.  
"有，我给你带了些" 美里回答，将衣服递给少女。

Asuka grabbed the offered clothes and was about to change, then stopped as she remembered Shinji was still in the room; he had been so silent, she had almost forgotten. The girl looked at the boy expectantly. "Do you mind Shinji?" she said to him harshly.  
明日香接过递来的衣服，正要换上，忽然停下，想起真嗣还在房间里；他一直那么安静，她几乎忘了他的存在。女孩期待地看着男孩。“你介意吗，真嗣？”她严厉地对他说。

Shinji was momentarily surprised when she addressed him. "No" he replied automatically, having no idea what she was talking about.  
真嗣被她突然搭话吓了一跳。“不介意。”他下意识地回答，完全不知道她在说什么。

At this, the redhead just looked at him strangely. "Let me change you perverted baka!" she shot back, thinking he was just spaced out.  
听到这话，红发女孩奇怪地看着他。“让我来帮你换，你这个变态笨蛋！”她回敬道，以为他只是走神了。

"Go ahead" slipped out of his mouth before he even realised what he had said.  
“说吧”这句话从他嘴里溜了出来，他自己都没意识到说了什么。

Asuka did not appreciate it and slapped him. Hard. "Get _out_ hentai!" she shouted.  
明日香对此并不领情，狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。“滚出去，变态！”她喊道。

The boy opened his mouth to say sorry, but bit his tongue instead, knowing she hated that. He promptly walked out of the room and closed the door.  
男孩张嘴想说对不起，却咬住了舌头，他知道她讨厌这样。他随即走出了房间，关上了门。

"Shinji sure is acting strange" Asuka remarked.  
“真嗣最近的行为确实很奇怪。”明日香评论道。

"Give him a break, he had a rough time fighting the angel" Misato explained, defending the boy. There was no way Asuka could comprehend Shinji's torment at the moment.  
“给他点空间吧，他刚和使徒战斗完，经历了不少磨难。”美里解释道，为少年辩护。此刻的明日香根本无法理解真嗣所承受的痛苦。

"Sheesh, big crybaby he is! Although since when did he become a vertebrate? For once he didn't say sorry like a pathetic baka" the redhead retorted.  
“哎呀，真是个大哭包！不过话说回来，他什么时候变得有骨气了？这次居然没像以前那样卑微地道歉。”红发少女反驳道。

The Major cringed; she had just gotten over Asuka using such insults casually. She suddenly understood a little the pain Shinji was about to go through; not only had she forgotten everything, but she was back in full to her arrogant self. _'I kinda hope Shinji gets her to fall in love with him again soon… I don't think I can stand her personality fully amplified again'_ Misato thought, sighing to herself.  
玛丽感到一阵不适；她刚刚才适应明日香随意使用这些侮辱性词汇。她突然有点理解真嗣即将经历的痛苦；明日香不仅忘记了所有事情，还完全恢复了她那傲慢的本性。'我有点希望真嗣能让她再次爱上他……我实在受不了她的个性完全放大了' 美里心想，暗自叹息。

Asuka started changing out of the hospital gown. The girl immediately noticed the scar on her abdomen and traced it with her finger, before looking up at the Major. "What's this from Misato? An angel battle?" she asked curiously.  
明日香开始换下医院的病号服。她立刻注意到自己腹部的伤疤，并用手指轻轻抚摸，然后抬头看向玛丽。"这是什么，美里？天使战斗留下的吗？"她好奇地问道。

Misato was surprised to see it herself. "I… actually don't know… perhaps ask Shinji?" she suggested. The woman vaguely recalled Asuka mentioning, in their discussion a while back, that Shinji cut her during her assault, was it from that?  
美里自己也感到惊讶。"我……其实也不清楚……或许你可以问问真嗣？"她建议道。美里隐约记得，之前讨论时明日香提到过，真嗣在她攻击时砍伤了她，会是那时候留下的吗？

At the mention of Shinji's name, an image of him holding a knife flashed through Asuka's mind. The redhead couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive after seeing that, was it a memory or her imagination? Dismissing it for now, she finished changing and felt much more comfortable now.  
一提到真嗣的名字，明日香脑海中闪过他手持刀具的画面。红发少女不禁感到一丝不安，这是记忆还是她的想象？暂且抛开这些，她换好衣服后感觉舒适多了。

"Anyway, let's go! I can't wait to get out of here" Asuka said eagerly.  
“总之，我们走吧！我迫不及待想离开这里了。”明日香急切地说道。

The two of them exited the hospital room and found Shinji waiting outside.  
两人走出病房，发现真嗣正等在外面。

The redhead moved up to the boy. "Come on Shinji, let's go" she said, tapping him on the shoulder.  
红发女孩走向男孩。“来吧，真嗣，我们走。”她一边说，一边轻拍他的肩膀。

"Wait just a moment" Ritsuko interjected, popping into the hallway.  
“稍等一下。”律子突然插话，出现在走廊里。

"What?" Asuka snapped in irritation. "I just wanna go home"  
“什么？”明日香不耐烦地反问，“我只是想回家。”

"One moment Asuka, I want to be sure everything's ok. Was there anything wrong with her Shinji?" Ritsuko asked.  
"稍等一下，Asuka，我想确认一切都没问题。她的状况有什么不对吗，Shinji？" 律子问道。

"Yeah… she's lost her memory" he answered sadly.  
"是的……她失去了记忆" 他悲伤地回答。

Ritsuko paused for a moment, "Did she forget _everything_?"  
律子顿了一下，"她把一切都忘了吗？"

Shinji understood the doctor's emphasis and responded, "She can't remember past the 12th angel"  
真嗣理解了医生的强调，回应道：“她记不起第 12 使徒之后的事情了。”

At this news, Ritsuko made a pained expression; this wasn't going to be easy for either of the two eva pilots.  
听到这个消息，律子露出了痛苦的表情；这对两位 EVA 驾驶员来说都不会是件容易的事。

The exchange did not go unnoticed by the redhead, who was starting to grow wary. "What's going on? What's the big deal? Is there something very serious that I can't remember?" Asuka asked, getting irritated; it was starting to feel like there was some one thing no one was telling her and she didn't like being left out of the loop.  
"这一交流没有逃过红发少女的眼睛，她开始感到警觉。“发生了什么？有什么大不了的？是不是有什么非常严重的事情我记不得了？”明日香问道，开始感到烦躁；她觉得似乎有什么事情大家都没有告诉她，她不喜欢被排除在外。”

"Shinji come with me" Ritsuko requested, only making Asuka more suspicious.  
"真嗣，跟我来。" 律子请求道，这让明日香更加怀疑。

The boy moved off with the doctor, looking back at Asuka as she turned towards Misato and began interrogating her. He sweat dropped slightly at the display and then faced forward again, continuing to follow Ritsuko. When they were out of ear-shot, the woman stopped and turned around to address him.  
男孩跟着医生离开，回头看向明日香，她正转向美里并开始盘问她。他微微汗颜于这一幕，然后再次面向前方，继续跟随律子。当他们听不见声音时，女人停下并转过身来对他说话。

"She doesn't remember your relationship, does she?" she asked.  
"她不记得你们的关系了，对吧？" 她问道。

"Not at all" he answered, looking downcast.  
"一点也不" 他回答道，神情沮丧。

"Do you think she would believe us if we told her straight out?" the doctor suggested.  
"你觉得如果我们直接告诉她，她会相信我们吗？" 医生提议道。

The boy shook his head sadly. "She's the Asuka from before, she couldn't even comprehend that happening" he answered. "Though I don't think it's fair to just force info like that on someone who doesn't remember"  
男孩悲伤地摇了摇头。"她是从前那个明日香，她甚至无法理解那件事的发生" 他回答。"虽然我觉得强迫把这样的信息强加给一个不记得的人并不公平"

"Yes, you're right… I'm so sorry Shinji, I came as fast as I could" Ritsuko said regretfully.  
“是的，你说得对……真对不起，真嗣，我尽快赶来了。” 律子遗憾地说道。

"It's not your fault" he said reassuringly, "Are you gonna inform the Commander of the situation?" he asked with trepidation.  
“这不是你的错。” 他安慰道，“你要通知司令官当前的情况吗？” 他带着忐忑问道。

"I think it's best that we don't, Asuka may actually recover her memories. Besides, if the Commander finds out, he'll probably do everything to prevent you two getting back together again. For now, let's get back to the group before they get worried" the doctor replied.  
“我认为我们最好不要，明日香可能会恢复记忆。而且，如果司令官知道了，他很可能会尽一切努力阻止你们复合。现在，我们先回到大家那里，免得他们担心。” 医生回答道。

"Or Asuka kills Misato" Shinji said, attempting humour.  
"或者明日香杀了美里" 真嗣说道，试图幽默一下。

Ritsuko chuckled a little, but the boy was far too depressed to even manage a slight smile. They both walked back to Misato and Asuka, noticing the redhead shouting angrily at her guardian.  
律子轻声笑了笑，但男孩太过沮丧，连勉强挤出一个微笑都做不到。他们一起走回美里和明日香那里，注意到红发女孩正愤怒地对着她的监护人大喊大叫。

"What the hell is going on?" the young girl asked Misato, her patience obviously wearing thin; Shinji was impressed how long his guardian had put up with her tirade.  
"到底怎么回事？" 少女问美里，显然她的耐心已经所剩无几；真嗣对监护人能忍受她的怒火这么久而感到惊讶。

"You've lost your memory, it will be quite tiresome getting you up to date. Like I said before, there's a lot of things we need to fill you in on" Misato replied impassively.  
“你失去了记忆，要让你跟上进度会相当费劲。就像我之前说的，有很多事情我们需要向你解释清楚。”美里冷淡地回答道。

"There's more to it than that! There's something specific you guys aren't telling me. I need to know!" she whined.  
“不仅仅是那样！你们有些事情没告诉我。我需要知道！”她抱怨道。

Shinji cringed, _'this will take a while to get used to again'_ he thought. Asuka noticed Shinji and the doctor rejoin the group and gave up trying to get information out of the tactical operations director. She would try and squeeze the information out of a much easier prey; Shinji. At the moment though, all the fuss and probably the angel battle had the girl exhausted and she really wanted to just get out of the hospital.  
真嗣感到一阵畏缩，‘这又要花一段时间来适应了’他想。明日香注意到真嗣和医生回到了队伍中，放弃了从战术操作主任那里获取信息的尝试。她打算从更容易的目标那里套出信息；真嗣。不过眼下，所有的喧闹和可能的天使战斗让女孩筋疲力尽，她真的只想离开医院。

"Whatever… let's just get outta here at least" the redhead relented. "I just wanna go home"  
"随便了……至少我们离开这里吧"红发女孩让步道。"我只想回家"

"I agree. Let's go" Misato said, relieved.  
"我同意。我们走吧"美里松了口气说道。

"I'm on board with that, going home would be great" Shinji agreed with the others; at the very least he could see what things would be like with Asuka and when Ritsuko mentioned the possibility of recovering her memories, it gave him some hope.  
"我也赞成，回家会很好"真嗣同意其他人的意见；至少他能看看和明日香在一起会是什么样子，而且当律子提到有可能恢复她的记忆时，这给了他一些希望。

Ritsuko knew there was nothing physically wrong with Asuka, but wondered whether she should be kept at hospital for a few days anyway. All three of the Katsuragi residents began to head towards the exit and the doctor decided to just let it go for now and waved them off; the situation would be taxing on all them, each for different reasons.  
律子知道明日香身体上并无大碍，但仍考虑是否应让她在医院多待几天。三位葛城家的居民开始向出口走去，医生决定暂时放下此事，挥手送别他们；这种情况对每个人来说都是一种负担，只是原因各异。

The trio walked together in silence, none of them able to think of something to say to the other. Upon reaching the checkout of the hospital, Misato reported the departure of the Unit 02 pilot to the nurse at the counter. When finished, their guardian went back over to the eva pilots and they exited the hospital. By now it was dark, the pale moon shone down upon them against the night blue sky. The parking lot was completely deserted save for Misato's sports car parked in the middle. They resumed their walk, quietly making their way towards the car, the only sound heard being their footsteps as their feet hit the ground. A cold breeze blew about them and Asuka shivered slightly. At this, Shinji instinctively put his arm around her to warm her up.  
三人默默地一起走着，谁也想不出该对其他人说些什么。到达医院出口时，美里向柜台的护士报告了零二号机驾驶员的离开。完成后，他们的监护人回到 eva 驾驶员身边，他们离开了医院。此时天色已暗，苍白的月光洒在他们身上，映衬着夜蓝色的天空。停车场空无一人，只有美里的跑车停在中央。他们继续前行，静静地走向汽车，唯一能听到的声音就是他们的脚步声。一阵冷风吹过，明日香微微颤抖。见状，真嗣本能地伸出胳膊搂住她，为她取暖。

"What are you doing Ikari?" the girl asked, annoyed.  
“你在干什么，真嗣？”女孩不悦地问道。

"Errr umm… you were cold" Shinji answered, just realising what he did.  
"呃，嗯……你刚才冷了" 真嗣回答道，这才意识到自己做了什么。

"Did I say I was?" Asuka retorted, pushing his arm off her.  
"我有说我冷吗？" 明日香反驳道，推开了他的手臂。

"I saw you shiver" he commented.  
"我看到你打了个寒颤" 他评论道。

"Yeah, from your repulsive form" the redhead replied.  
“是啊，从你那令人作呕的形态。”红发女孩回答道。

Shinji would have laughed had the situation been different, but it stung him hearing those words. He knew she didn't really mean them though, so he took his jumper off and placed it over her.  
如果情况不同，真嗣可能会笑出来，但听到这些话让他感到刺痛。不过他知道她并非真心那么说，于是他脱下套头衫，盖在她身上。

"I told you already, I didn't say I was cold" Asuka repeated.  
“我已经告诉过你了，我没说我冷。”明日香重复道。

"I _know_ you're cold, this wind is chilly" the boy countered resolutely.  
"我知道你冷，这风很刺骨" 男孩坚定地反驳道。

"What are you on about? I am NOT cold baka!" the girl said defiantly.  
"你在说什么呢？我才不冷，笨蛋！" 女孩倔强地说。

"Asuka, please stop being so stubborn" he replied, growing annoyed at her antics.  
"明日香，请别再这么固执了" 他回答，对她的小把戏感到越来越恼火。

Asuka just looked at him shocked. "What did you do to him Misato?"  
明日香只是震惊地看着他。“你对他做了什么，美里？”

Misato laughed in response. "Nothing actually, it was _your_ doing not mine" she answered.  
美里笑着回应。“实际上什么也没做，这是你的功劳，不是我的。”她回答道。

"Really? What happened?" the girl asked curiously.  
“真的吗？发生了什么？”女孩好奇地问道。

"Let's just say you taught him a really good lesson" Misato replied.  
“这么说吧，你给他上了很好的一课。”美里回答道。

Asuka sighed. "Fine Ikari, I'll pretend to be cold and keep your jumper" she said as she couldn't be bothered arguing over something so trivial.  
明日香叹了口气。“好吧，碇，我就装作冷了，留下你的毛衣。”她说着，懒得为这种小事争论。

Shinji shook his head in disbelief, _'she is some work'_ he thought.  
真嗣难以置信地摇了摇头，心想：‘她真是难搞。’

"By the way Ikari" Asuka started, "I noticed I have a scar on my abdomen, do you know how I got that?"  
"对了，碇" 明日香开口道，"我注意到我腹部有个伤疤，你知道我是怎么弄的吗？"

Shinji hesitated momentarily, wondering what he should tell her. He figured it probably made most sense to use the same excuse they told Ritsuko. "Yeah, we had a fight in the kitchen and I had a knife in my hand… it was an accident. It doesn't hurt or anything right? It was quite some time ago now"  
真嗣犹豫了一下，思考着该告诉她什么。他觉得可能还是用他们告诉律子的那个借口最合理。"嗯，我们在厨房打了一架，我手里正好拿着刀……那是个意外。不疼吧？已经是很久以前的事了"

"No, it's fine. That makes sense" Asuka replied upon hearing his answer, the image she saw in her mind cohered to her now.  
"不，没事。这样说得通" 明日香听了他的回答后说道，她脑海中的画面现在变得清晰了。

Misato was a bit sceptical about his answer, but she decided not to pursue it right now.  
美里对他的回答有些怀疑，但她决定暂时不深究。

They then arrived at the car and all got in; the boy sat in front, not wanting to give in to temptation. Misato started her engine and drove out of the parking lot. As always, Misato drove like a maniac, although not as extreme because it was night time, still Shinji almost fainted at the near crashes. Fortunately, they arrived at their apartment in one piece and Misato parked the car before they got out. Shinji stole a glance at the young girl, her red hair glowed radiant in the moonlight, giving her the appearance of a celestial spirit. The three of them walked inside the building and took the elevator. Triggering his memory, the boy recalled the hurt expression on Asuka's face when the elevator doors closed on him; he was at least happy that she had forgotten _that_. As the elevator began its ascent, the boy couldn't help but look at the redhead; she was still so beautiful. Asuka noticed his gaze of course.  
随后他们到达了汽车旁，所有人都上了车；男孩坐在前排，不愿屈服于诱惑。美里启动引擎，驶出了停车场。一如既往，美里开车像个疯子，尽管因为现在是夜晚没那么极端，但真嗣几乎因那些差点发生的碰撞而晕倒。幸运的是，他们完好无损地到达了公寓，美里停好车后他们才下车。真嗣偷瞄了一眼那位年轻女孩，她的红发在月光下熠熠生辉，使她看起来像一位天上的精灵。三人走进大楼，乘坐电梯。触发了他的记忆，男孩回想起电梯门在他面前关闭时明日香受伤的表情；他至少感到高兴的是她已经忘记了那件事。随着电梯开始上升，男孩忍不住看向红发女孩；她依然如此美丽。明日香当然注意到了他的目光。

"Stop staring at me baka, I know I'm beautiful but you're not worthy of looking at me" Asuka snapped.  
“别盯着我看了，笨蛋，我知道我很美但你没资格看我。”明日香厉声说道。

At this, Shinji snorted; she was still the same Asuka at heart. "I thought you liked being noticed Asuka" he replied mockingly.  
听到这话，真嗣哼了一声；她的内心依旧是那个明日香。“我还以为你喜欢被人关注呢，明日香。”他嘲讽地回应道。

The young girl scowled in anger. "Rack off. After all, you're a perverted baka" she retorted.  
年轻女孩愤怒地皱起眉头。“滚开。毕竟，你是个变态的笨蛋。”她反驳道。

Her retort didn't faze him in the least. "Gee it's not like you haven't said that a hundred times already. It's getting old, I'd expect the 'great' Asuka to come up with something better" he countered.  
她的反驳丝毫没有影响到他。“哎呀，又不是第一次听你说这种话了。我都听腻了，我以为‘伟大的’明日香能想出点更有新意的东西呢。”他回击道。

Misato couldn't help laughing; the poor boy deserved to tease the girl a little. Asuka herself couldn't believe it and just turned her face away in anger, the "first" time she had been beaten in an argument with Shinji.  
美里忍不住笑出声来；这个可怜的男孩值得稍微逗逗这个女孩。明日香自己也不敢相信，只是生气地别过脸去，这是她第一次在与真嗣的争论中败下阵来。

"Next thing you know, he can beat me in video games" the redhead muttered aloud.  
“接下来你就会知道，他还能在电子游戏中打败我。”红发女孩喃喃自语。

"Nope, still can't" Shinji replied, overhearing.  
“不，还是不行。”真嗣无意中听到后回答道。

"Hmpf" Asuka responded. "哼" 明日香回应道。

Reaching their floor, the elevator doors opened and the three roommates exited it. Misato took out her keys and unlocked the door, but found herself unable to open the door. Her brow creased. She put the keys back in and "locked" the door, finding herself able to open the door now.  
到达楼层后，电梯门打开，三位室友走了出来。美里拿出钥匙准备开门，却发现门打不开。她的眉头紧皱。她把钥匙重新插回去，假装"锁上"门，结果现在门却能打开了。

"Shinji, did you leave the door unlocked?" Misato asked.  
"真嗣，你是不是没锁门？" 美里问道。

"Yeah, I was in a rush chasing after Asu-" he started then stopped as he remembered Asuka was in the vicinity. The girl in question gave him a puzzled look, but decided to leave it alone at the moment as she was too tired.  
"是啊，我急着追赶明日-" 他刚开口就顿住了，想起了明日香就在附近。当事人疑惑地看了他一眼，但决定暂时不追究，因为她太累了。

Misato just shrugged and entered through the door with the two teens following suit. "Home sweet home" she announced.  
美里只是耸了耸肩，推门而入，两个少年紧随其后。“到家了，甜蜜的家”她宣布道。

"I'm hungry. Shinji make something" Asuka ordered immediately.  
"我饿了。真嗣，做点什么" 明日香立刻命令道。

"As you wish" he said sarcastically and bowed, causing Misato to chuckle. _'Some things will never change'_ he thought, smiling to himself.  
"如你所愿" 他讽刺地说道，并鞠了一躬，引得美里轻笑。'有些事永远不会改变' 他心想，暗自微笑。

The boy went over to the kitchen and began preparing a late-night supper, while Asuka went straight to her room. Despite Asuka losing her memory, he was much relieved that at least she wasn't ignoring him or running away from him. Shinji knew they all needed to go to sleep and he didn't have much energy left, so he decided to make a quick meal. His guardian walked into the kitchen while he was preparing.  
男孩走进厨房，开始准备深夜的晚餐，而明日香则直接回了她的房间。尽管明日香失去了记忆，他还是感到非常欣慰，至少她没有无视他或逃避他。真嗣知道他们都需要睡觉，而他也没有多少精力了，所以他决定快速做一顿饭。他的监护人走进厨房时，他正在准备。

"Listen Shinji… I somewhat understand what you're feeling" she said, trying to comfort him. "You must be in so much pain and heartbreak"  
"听着，真嗣……我多少能理解你的感受" 她说道，试图安慰他。"你一定很痛苦，心碎不已"

Shinji just shook his head and ignored her.  
真嗣只是摇了摇头，没有理会她。

Misato placed a hand on his shoulder to still him. "What I want to say is, this might be a blessing in disguise. You have a second chance, a chance to make things right again, to create this relationship anew without… doing things you'll regret"  
美里将手放在他的肩膀上，让他静下来。“我想说的是，这可能是因祸得福。你有了第二次机会，一个重新来过的机会，去修复这段关系，重新建立它，而不去做那些会让你后悔的事情。”

Shinji pondered her words. It was true that he could start again, it would be difficult but it could certainly be worth it. And he did have some advantages now; knowing her past, being aware of the fact that she could come to like him, a boosted ego and plus he knew what she liked physically. Misato's last words stung him a little bit, but it was an important reminder of something he should never ever do again.  
真嗣沉思着她的话。确实，他可以重新开始，虽然会很艰难，但绝对值得一试。而且他现在有一些优势；了解她的过去，意识到她可能会喜欢上他，自信心增强，再加上他知道她喜欢什么。美里最后的话刺痛了他一点，但这是一个重要的提醒，提醒他永远不要再犯同样的错误。

"Thanks Misato, that just might work" he said appreciatively.  
“谢谢你，美里，这或许真的能行。”他感激地说道。

"Also… let me be very clear here. I know you did time in prison and you have shown your remorse… however, and I don't believe I need to say this twice, do not rape Asuka again… or anything of the sort" Misato said firmly.  
“还有……让我在这里说清楚。我知道你坐过牢，也表现出你的悔意……但是，我相信我不需要说两遍，不要再强奸明日香……或者任何类似的事情。”美里坚定地说。

Shinji just stayed silent as he listened, not protesting her words; Misato had every right to grill him about this.  
真嗣只是静静地听着，没有反驳她的话；美里完全有权利就此事盘问他。

"I promised Asuka that I would never neglect her again, so do not betray my trust in you Shinji like you did last time" the Major continued with a frightening look. "I won't be so forgiving another time"  
"我答应过明日香，再也不会忽视她，所以不要像上次那样辜负我对你的信任，真嗣。" 少校继续说道，眼神令人畏惧。"下次我可不会这么宽容了"

"Of course Misato. I promised her _and_ myself I would never do such a thing again and I really appreciate you trusting me again" he replied.  
"当然，美里。我向她和我自己承诺过，再也不会做那样的事了，我真的很感激你再次信任我。" 他回答道。"

Misato sighed. She knew she was justified in going hard on the boy, but she couldn't help but feel a little sympathy for him after he had just lost everything he had built up with Asuka. "Good to hear" she finished.  
美里叹了口气。她知道自己对这孩子严厉是有道理的，但看到他刚刚失去了与明日香建立的一切，她不禁对他产生了一丝同情。"听你这么说我就放心了" 她最后说道。

"Though your words honestly make me wonder if I even deserve to get together with her again. Maybe this is all just cosmic justice" Shinji commented, sighing.  
“虽然你的话真的让我怀疑我是否还配得上和她复合。也许这一切只是宇宙的正义。” 真嗣叹息道。

Misato's intention hadn't been to discourage him from dating Asuka again, but of course someone like Shinji would take it that way. "Look Shinji, I won't lie. I had the same thoughts. Should I even encourage this relationship now that's she forgotten that horrible ordeal? But I thought back to the fact that not only was Asuka happy and in love… she herself, the victim of your cruelty, decided to give you a second chance. I have to believe in her… that she was genuine and honestly forgave you and wanted to spend her life with you" she encouraged.  
美里本意并非要阻止他再次与明日香约会，但像真嗣这样的人自然会那样理解。“听着，真嗣，我不会撒谎。我也有过同样的想法。在她忘记了那场可怕的遭遇后，我是否还应该鼓励这段关系？但我回想起，不仅明日香快乐且恋爱中……她自己，那个被你残忍对待的受害者，决定给你第二次机会。我必须相信她……相信她是真诚的，真心原谅了你，并希望与你共度一生。”她鼓励道。

The boy couldn't help tearing up at her words; it really showed just how much Misato cared about both of them. "Thanks so much Misato, you're the best" he replied genuinely grateful, embracing his guardian.  
男孩听到她的话不禁泪流满面；这真的显示了美里对他们两人的关心有多深。“非常感谢你，美里，你是最棒的。”他真诚地感激道，拥抱了他的监护人。

"No problem Shinji" Misato said warmly, hugging him back. "I understand how frustrating it must be, how you can't tell Asuka about your previous relationship… she wouldn't be ready to accept such a thing, and it's probably not fair on her either" she continued before pulling away.  
"没问题，真嗣。" 美里温暖地说道，回抱了他。"我理解这有多令人沮丧，你无法告诉明日香你之前的恋情……她还没准备好接受这样的事，这对她也不公平。" 她继续说着，然后松开了拥抱。

"Yes, it's not something I can tell her. I'll just have to do things the old-fashioned way" he said, smiling a little. "There are definitely some things we need to retell Asuka though, like all that Instrumentality stuff"  
"是的，这不是我能告诉她的事。我只能用老办法来处理。" 他微笑着说。"不过，确实有些事情我们需要重新告诉明日香，比如所有那些人类补完计划的事。"

"Yeah, I'll take care of that. I will tell her when I get the chance" she volunteered.  
"嗯，我会处理好的。一有机会我就会告诉她。" 她主动提出。

Shinji nodded to show he understood.  
真嗣点头表示他明白了。

"One last thing before I go… how did Asuka actually get that scar on her abdomen?" Misato asked.  
“在我走之前还有最后一件事……明日香腹部的那道伤疤是怎么来的？”美里问道。

Shinji's face went sad before he spoke up. "Asuka mentioned it during the discussion we had about her assault… I cut her just before I… forced myself on her. I was in a rage and swinging the knife in my hand at her and managed to cause that wound…" he explained.  
真嗣的脸色变得悲伤，他开口说道：“明日香在我们讨论她被侵犯的事情时提过……就在我……强迫她之前，我割伤了她。我当时怒火中烧，手里拿着刀向她挥去，结果造成了那个伤口……”他解释道。

"Thanks for telling me… I suspected it was something like that" she replied.  
"谢谢你告诉我……我猜也是这样" 她回答道。

"I won't ever do something like that to her again Misato… I feel so awful when I think about what I did that night" he reassured.  
"我再也不会那样对她了，美里……每当我想到那晚我所做的事，我就感到非常糟糕" 他保证道。

"I believe you are being sincere, sorry for the interrogation" Misato replied, turning around to end the conversation.  
"我相信你是真心的，抱歉刚才审问了你" 美里回答，转身结束了对话。

At that, Misato returned back to the dining table. Shinji resumed making supper, grateful that Misato cared so much about Asuka. After the boy finished making supper, he brought the food to the dining room and set it out on the table.  
听到这话，美里回到了餐桌旁。真嗣继续准备晚餐，感激美里如此关心明日香。男孩做好晚餐后，将食物端到餐厅，摆放在桌上。

"Supper's ready" Shinji called out.  
“晚餐好了。”真嗣喊道。

The redhead came out of her room at Shinji's announcement and sat down at the dining table. Before Shinji could sit down, Misato decided she would give the two of them some time alone and excused herself, saying she wasn't hungry before going off to bed.  
明日香听到真嗣的通知，从房间里出来，坐在餐桌旁。真嗣还没来得及坐下，美里决定给两人一些独处的时间，便借口说自己不饿，然后去睡觉了。

"Let's eat" the two of them said aloud after the boy sat down opposite the girl.  
"我们开动吧"，男孩坐到女孩对面后，两人齐声说道。

Asuka began eating ravenously as she hadn't eaten all day. Shinji also hadn't eaten a single morsel all day and ate just as hungrily. The two finished in record time and sat there looking at each other. The redhead wondering how to get information out of Shinji, and Shinji wondering how to get him and Asuka back together.  
明日香开始狼吞虎咽地吃着，因为她一整天都没吃东西。真嗣也是一整天粒米未进，同样吃得十分急切。两人以创纪录的速度吃完，然后坐在那里互相看着对方。红发女孩在想如何从真嗣那里套出信息，而真嗣则在思考如何让两人重归于好。

"So-" they both began and blushed.  
"那么——" 他们同时开口，随即都脸红了。

Both looked away from the other, not wanting to be embarrassed.  
两人都避开了对方的目光，不想感到尴尬。

"You first" they both continued at the same time; their sync training had not been forgotten it seems.  
“你先”，他们同时说道，看来同步训练的默契并未被遗忘。

Asuka realised this was going nowhere and yawned tiredly; the lack of sleep and exhaustion she felt was catching up. "Never mind" she remarked.  
明日香意识到这样下去毫无进展，疲惫地打了个哈欠；缺乏睡眠和疲惫感正逐渐袭来。“算了”，她淡淡地说道。

"You tired Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
"你累了吗，明日香？" 真嗣问道。

The girl looked back at him, unable to help her eyes blinking. "Yeah, a little" she acknowledged; obviously she was more than a little tired if she willingly admitted it, let alone to Shinji.  
女孩回头看着他，忍不住眨了眨眼。"嗯，有点。"她承认道；显然她不仅仅是有点累，如果她愿意向真嗣承认这一点，那就更不用说有多累了。

"Your muscles must be sore" the boy commented.  
"你的肌肉一定很酸痛吧。" 男孩评论道。

Asuka stretched a little. "Yeah, I'm a little stiff" she replied.  
明日香稍微伸展了一下。“嗯，有点僵硬”她回答道。

The male eva pilot walked over to the redhead and stood behind her. He placed his hands on her shoulders, noting how soft they were, and began to massage her. The boy felt her muscles tense and relax as he released the tension in her muscles. Shinji smiled at the situation, he alone with a half-conscious Asuka in the middle of the night massaging her back; he supposed it was a good sign, though she probably wouldn't even remember this in the morning.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员走向红发女孩，站在她身后。他将双手放在她的肩膀上，注意到它们是多么柔软，并开始为她按摩。男孩感觉到她的肌肉紧绷又放松，随着他释放她肌肉的紧张感。真嗣对这种情况微笑，深夜里只有他和半清醒的明日香，为她按摩背部；他认为这是个好迹象，尽管她可能早上根本不会记得这件事。

"Mmmm, that's real good… please do it harder" Asuka requested.  
“嗯，真舒服……请再用力一点”明日香请求道。

At that comment, Shinji couldn't help but feel a certain activity in his pants. _'Bloody hell, she must be really sleepy to let that slip out of her mouth'_ he thought. To make matters worse, she started moaning, not unlike her moans during sexual stimulation. _'Okay I don't think this was a good idea, it's just gonna make me more anxious.'_ The boy slowly stopped massaging her.  
听到这话，真嗣不禁感到下身一阵躁动。'该死，她一定是太困了才会不小心说漏嘴。'他心想。更糟糕的是，她开始呻吟，那声音与她在性刺激时的呻吟别无二致。'好吧，我觉得这主意糟透了，只会让我更加焦虑。'男孩慢慢地停止了按摩。

"Why'd you stop? My neck still feels sore, keep going" she said impatiently.  
“你为什么停下？我的脖子还疼着呢，继续按。”她不耐烦地说道。

Shinji had no choice but to keep massaging her. His exhaustion was kicking in hard, his eyes threatening to close, but he knew it would not be wise to fall asleep on Asuka and used all his will to stay awake. Thankfully, Asuka beat him in the race as he felt her body go limp after a while; the day's activities had caught up with her and she had fallen sound asleep. Shinji stopped his actions and stood there looking at her peaceful form. The girl was breathing in and out softly and had formed a tender smile on her face. His resolve grew as he admired her splendour. He knew this would take quite some work and maybe some manipulation but hey, he had the Commander's blood in him as much as he hated it.  
真嗣别无选择，只能继续为她按摩。他的疲惫感越来越强烈，眼皮沉重得几乎要合上，但他知道在明日香身边睡着绝非明智之举，于是用尽所有意志力保持清醒。幸运的是，明日香先他一步败下阵来，过了一会儿，他感觉到她的身体变得瘫软无力；一天的活动让她筋疲力尽，她已经沉沉睡去。真嗣停止了动作，站在那里凝视着她安详的睡颜。女孩轻轻地呼吸着，脸上浮现出一抹温柔的微笑。他欣赏着她的美丽，决心愈发坚定。他知道这将需要相当多的努力，或许还得耍些手段，但嘿，他体内流淌着司令的血，尽管他对此深恶痛绝。

"I guess I better put her in bed, I'm quite exhausted myself" he said to himself.  
“我想我还是把她放到床上吧，我自己也累得够呛。”他自言自语道。

Shinji carefully picked her up from the chair, careful not to disturb her slumber. Asuka giggled in her sleep as he began carrying her over to her room. The boy moved slowly, not wanting to trip. Luckily for him, Asuka had left the door open earlier. He entered her room and placed her down gently on the bed. As the boy turned around to exit her room, he slipped on some clothes on the floor and fell back onto her bed. His head hit the bedpost and together with his fatigue, he fell unconscious. The girl instinctively wrapped her arms around the new heat source. Anyone who came in would have laughed at the sight; there was Shinji lying down on the bed with his legs dangling off the edge and Asuka hugging his head. But tonight, the two teens would sleep undisturbed…  
真嗣小心翼翼地从椅子上抱起她，生怕惊扰了她的梦乡。明日香在他怀里咯咯笑着，他则缓缓地朝她的房间走去。男孩移动得很慢，生怕摔倒。幸运的是，明日香之前已经把门打开了。他走进房间，轻轻地将她放在床上。正当男孩转身准备离开时，他踩到了地上的衣服，向后摔倒在床上。他的头撞到了床头，加上疲惫，他昏了过去。女孩本能地抱住了这个新的热源。任何进来的人看到这一幕都会忍不住笑出声；只见真嗣躺在床上，双腿悬在床边，而明日香紧紧抱着他的头。但今晚，两个少年将安然无恙地睡去……

Omake: 番外：

Asuka turned on the lights, instantly wishing she hadn't as the bright light assaulted her eyes. She felt dazed for a moment as her eyes adjusted to the agonising light. Finally recovering from her temporary blindness, the girl took out her school uniform from the wardrobe and began dressing up. It took her a full 15 minutes to tie her shoelaces as she felt so…  
明日香打开灯，随即后悔了，因为那刺眼的光线猛烈地冲击着她的眼睛。她感到一阵眩晕，眼睛适应着这令人痛苦的强光。终于从短暂的失明中恢复过来，女孩从衣柜里拿出校服开始穿衣服。她花了整整 15 分钟才系好鞋带，因为她感到如此……

"Drowsy" “昏昏欲睡”

"Yeah, that's it I feel so drowsy. Hey wait a minute, who the hell said that?"  
“对，就是这样，我感觉好困。等等，谁在说话？”

"Drowsy!" the voice repeated.  
"困倦！" 那个声音重复道。

She looked around finding the source of the noise, it looked like a cross between an aardvark and a hippo. She kicked it angrily out the window, wondering what in God's name it was, instantly she felt much more energetic and she continued to get ready to look for Shinji.  
她环顾四周寻找噪音的来源，那东西看起来像是一只食蚁兽和河马的混合体。她生气地将它踢出窗外，疑惑这到底是什么鬼东西，瞬间她感到精力充沛了许多，于是继续准备去找真嗣。

End Notes: I originally just noted that everyone is probably thinking 'how could you make her lose her memory?' and that this wasn't going to be a short fic. I also mentioned that I sorta had the whole story thought out when I first began writing and from the core plot, there hasn't been much deviation. I also previously apologised for the omake, I have a strange sense of humour I suppose but I really hate pokemon haha.  
尾注：我最初只是注意到大家可能会想‘你怎么让她失去记忆的？’，并指出这不会是一篇短篇小说。我还提到，当我开始写作时，我大致已经构思好了整个故事，从核心情节来看，并没有太多偏离。之前我也为番外篇道歉，我想我有种奇怪的幽默感，但我真的很讨厌宝可梦哈哈。

This chapter is now about 11000 words, previously about 9000, so not too much has changed.  
本章目前约为 11000 字，之前大约 9000 字，因此变动不算太大。

Author's Notes: Originally some reviewers asked why Asuka ran away from Rei and Shinji, I provided the following reasons: 1 – Asuka is insecure, especially after telling Shinji about her past, 2 – Shinji's character has changed a bit and she can't read him like an open book anymore, 3 – She noticed Rei behaving differently, she went up, hugged and kissed Shinji, making her jealous and suspicious, 4 – She noticed Shinji staring at Rei and was also suspicious of Shinji, 5 – Shinji leaves in the middle of the night, right after they make love, to go to Rei's apartment, 6 – Shinji told Asuka that Rei loved him, this has been in Asuka's knowledge for a while, 7 – When she arrives at Rei's apartment they are in a precarious position, 8 – Shinji's vague responses and silence when she confronted him, added to the fact he didn't call her with Rei's phone, 9 – The final reason is subtle, but after Shinji and Asuka fought before the 15th angel, Shinji said 'I went to that slut Rei's apartment and fucked her'. I suppose that was enough reason. I also originally thanked Darknemo for his reviews (saying his reviews felt like 10 reviews in one hehe).  
作者笔记：原本有评论者询问为何明日香会逃离真嗣和绫波，我提供了以下理由：1 – 明日香缺乏安全感，尤其是在向真嗣坦白过去之后，2 – 真嗣的性格有所变化，她不再能像读一本打开的书那样理解他，3 – 她注意到绫波行为异常，她上前拥抱并亲吻了真嗣，这让明日香感到嫉妒和怀疑，4 – 她发现真嗣盯着绫波看，也对真嗣产生了怀疑，5 – 真嗣在他们亲热后半夜离开，前往绫波的公寓，6 – 真嗣告诉明日香绫波爱他，这一点明日香早已知晓，7 – 当她到达绫波的公寓时，他们正处于一个微妙的境地，8 – 明日香质问时真嗣含糊其辞且保持沉默，加上他没有用绫波的手机给她打电话，9 – 最后一个理由较为隐晦，但在第 15 使徒之前，真嗣和明日香争吵时，真嗣曾说‘我去了那个婊子绫波的公寓，和她上了床’。我想这已经足够成为理由。我还原感谢 Darknemo 的评论（称他的评论感觉像是一次性给出了十条评论，哈哈）。

Now onto chapter 11, this chapter is the foundation of what's to happen in future.  
现在进入第 11 章，这一章是未来发展的基础。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 11 (First rewrite - though it's practically the same as the first version).  
说明一下，这是重写的第 11 章（第一次重写——虽然实际上与初版几乎相同）。

A new note: 一条新笔记：

"_Italics in double quotes"_ represent things spoken/heard within one's mind – not a direct thought. Similar to thoughts but with ""  
“双引号中的斜体字”代表内心的话语或听到的声音——并非直接的思想。类似于思想，但带有""

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 11: Planning and Failing  
第十一章：计划与失败

The redhead awoke with a most unusual sensation. It felt like she was tightly hugging something warm. She didn't remember snuggling her pillow, in fact she didn't even remember how she got into her bed. Despite it feeling harder than how a pillow usually felt, she was still half asleep. Finding the "pillow" really nice and warm, she decided to rest for a little while longer. The morning was quiet today, leaving Asuka to ponder her thoughts freely. Something wasn't right in her mind, but she just couldn't seem to grasp it. It suddenly hit her like a sledgehammer; pillows didn't generate heat. She opened her eyes wearily and looked down at what she was holding. To say she was surprised would be an understatement as she looked upon the face of Shinji Ikari. He was snuggled, very tightly too, up against her ample bosom, which had muffled any snoring he might have made. Asuka's face went red with both rage and embarrassment as she instantly released him, quickly retreating to the other side of the bed. She looked at him in disgust as she noticed he was drooling and was not pleased to find her shirt stained with his saliva.  
红发少女醒来时，感到一种非常不寻常的感觉。她觉得自己紧紧地抱着某个温暖的东西。她不记得自己曾蜷缩在枕头上，事实上，她甚至不记得自己是怎么上床的。尽管这感觉比通常的枕头要硬，但她仍然半睡半醒。发现这个“枕头”真的很温暖，她决定再休息一会儿。今天早上很安静，让明日香可以自由地思考。她的脑海中有些不对劲，但她就是抓不住。突然间，她像被大锤击中一样恍然大悟；枕头不会产生热量。她疲惫地睁开眼睛，低头看着自己抱着的东西。说她惊讶都是轻描淡写，因为她看到了碇真嗣的脸。他紧紧地蜷缩在她丰满的胸前，这让她听不到他可能发出的鼾声。明日香的脸因愤怒和尴尬而涨得通红，她立刻放开他，迅速退到床的另一边。她厌恶地看着他，注意到他在流口水，而且她的衬衫被他的口水弄脏了，这让她很不高兴。

_'What the_ _**hell**_ _is this baka doing in my bed?'_ she thought.  
'这个笨蛋到底在我的床上干什么？' 她心想。

Despite the mild amusement and curiosity at Shinji's position, that with which half his body wasn't even on the bed, she could _not_ forgive him for this. Shinji rolled over with the sudden shift in Asuka's position, however with his legs dangling off the edge of the bed he found himself unable to roll over and only succeeded in twisting up his legs. Asuka, fearing an advance, kicked Shinji off the bed and he landed in a sprawled heap on the floor.  
尽管对真嗣的姿势感到一丝好笑和好奇，他的半个身子甚至都没躺在床上，但她无法原谅他。真嗣随着明日香位置的突然变化翻了个身，但由于他的腿悬在床边，他发现自己无法翻身，只是成功地扭了扭腿。明日香担心他会进一步行动，一脚把真嗣踢下了床，他摔成一团躺在地板上。

"What the hell do you think you're doing HENTAI?" she screamed.  
“你到底在干什么，变态？”她尖叫道。

Shinji awoke at both the impact and the scream and looked around, rubbing his head. He saw Asuka and looked at her, confusion evident on his face.  
真嗣在撞击声和尖叫声中醒来，揉着头环顾四周。他看到了明日香，脸上露出明显的困惑。

"Why are you here?" Shinji asked, puzzled.  
“你为什么在这里？”真嗣困惑地问。

"I could ask the same question" she said bitterly.  
“我也可以问同样的问题”她苦涩地说。

"Isn't this my room…?" he said looking around, before noticing that it wasn't his room.  
"这不是我的房间吗…？" 他环顾四周，随后意识到这不是他的房间。

"Uh-huh, that's right. It ain't your room. You better have a damn good explanation for this Ikari" she threatened.  
"嗯哼，没错。这不是你的房间。你最好有个该死的好解释，碇" 她威胁道。

Shinji vaguely remembered the events of last night. "I remember a little, you fell asleep at the table so I carried you into your room and I guess… I was so tired I must have fallen asleep too"  
真嗣隐约记得昨晚的事情。"我记得一点，你在桌子上睡着了，所以我把你抱到你的房间，我想… 我太累了，一定也跟着睡着了"

"Is that it? You expect me to believe that garbage?" she retorted, unconvinced.  
"就这？你指望我相信那堆废话？" 她反驳道，毫不信服。

"Do _you_ even remember how you got into bed? Besides why would I sleep on the floor?" he countered.  
"你还记得自己是怎么上床的吗？再说了，我为什么要睡地板？" 他反问。

She moved to stand over him and pointed a finger at him accusingly. "What are you talking about?! You weren't sleeping on the floor! Before I kicked you off the bed, you were snuggled right up to my-" she began before stopping, suddenly realising what she was saying. It was true that she didn't remember how she got into bed, so it would make sense that someone brought her here. The girl decided to let it go this time.  
她走过去站在他面前，用手指着他指责道："你在说什么？！你根本没睡地板！在我把你踢下床之前，你明明紧贴着我——" 她开始说话，突然意识到自己在说什么。确实，她不记得自己是怎么上床的，所以有人把她带到这里的说法也说得通。女孩决定这次就算了。

"Just get out of my room!" she shouted at him.  
"快滚出我的房间！" 她对他吼道。

Shinji took the hint and stood up to leave, only to find his legs in a tangled mess. He tripped over, barging into Asuka as they fell onto the bed together. He looked up, only to be greeted by Asuka's hand with a resounding smack.  
真嗣领会了暗示，起身离开，却发现自己双腿纠缠成一团。他绊倒了，撞上了明日香，两人一起摔倒在床上。他抬头一看，迎接他的是明日香响亮的一巴掌。

"Get off me, you stupid clumsy oaf!" she screamed into his ear.  
"从我身上滚开，你这个笨拙的蠢货！" 她对着他的耳朵尖叫道。

The boy had forgotten how scary she could be. "Ok I'm going" he squeaked. He got off her and ran out of the room, not wanting to receive any more abuse.  
男孩已经忘记了她有多可怕。“好吧，我走了。”他尖声说道。他从她身上下来，跑出了房间，不想再受到任何虐待。

"Good riddance!" Asuka shouted after him.  
“滚得好！”明日香在他身后喊道。

As Shinji exited her room, he quickly closed her door behind him. He immediately heard something smash against the door and thanked God he closed the door in time. The boy head back to his room and lay down on his bed, still exhausted.  
当真嗣离开她的房间时，他迅速关上了她的门。他立刻听到有什么东西砸在门上，感谢上帝他及时关上了门。男孩回到自己的房间，躺在床上，仍然疲惫不堪。

_'That could've been worse'_ he thought to himself, sweat dropping. Now that he was up, he found it difficult to get back to sleep. _'How in the world did I end up in her bed? More importantly, she said I wasn't originally on the floor. What could have possibly gotten her so mad?'_  
“那还不算太糟。”他暗自思忖，汗水滴落。现在他醒了，却发现很难再入睡。“我到底是怎么跑到她床上去的？更重要的是，她说我原本不在地板上。到底是什么让她这么生气？”

Shinji looked up at his clock, noticing it was almost time to get ready for school. The eva pilot really didn't feel like going to school today and decided he would somehow convince Misato to allow him to skip school. An idea soon formed in his head; he would tell Misato that he'd use today to get Asuka adjusted again. He would help her accustom herself and perhaps revive a few memories. There was also the issue of the play, which he would need to help her practise. It was a brilliant scheme, he got to miss school and it gave him a chance to work out where he stood in his and Asuka's relationship. Content with his plan, the boy stayed in bed and drifted off into slumber again.  
真嗣抬头看了看时钟，注意到快到上学的时间了。这位 EVA 驾驶员今天真的不想去学校，决定无论如何要说服美里让他翘课。一个主意很快在他脑海中形成；他会告诉美里，他要用今天的时间让明日香重新适应。他会帮助她习惯，也许还能唤醒一些记忆。还有那出戏，他需要帮她练习。这是个绝妙的计划，他可以逃学，还给了他一个机会来理清自己和明日香的关系。对这个计划感到满意，男孩躺在床上再次进入了梦乡。

The sound of Shinji's door opening interrupted his nap. For a moment he thought he imagined it, but he soon heard the sound of someone moving towards his bed.  
真嗣的房门打开的声音打断了他的小憩。有那么一会儿，他以为自己幻听了，但很快他就听到了有人朝他床边走来的声音。

"Hey Shinji, I know you're tired and all but you have school today" Misato said softly.  
“嘿，真嗣，我知道你很累，但你今天还得上学。”美里温柔地说道。

He opened his eyes and focused them onto the smiling Major. He was pretty confident that Misato would accept his proposal, but just to be safe he decided to use a little manipulation.  
他睁开眼睛，目光聚焦在微笑的少校身上。他相当有信心美里会接受他的提议，但为了保险起见，他决定稍微运用一点操控手段。

"I know school's on today, but I'm really tired after all, what with the angel battle yesterday and Asuka in the hospital" the boy replied.  
“我知道今天有课，但我昨天和使徒战斗后真的很累，而且明日香还在医院。”男孩回答道。

"Weariness is not a good enough excuse to stay home, besides you need to get Asuka re-adjusted to school" his guardian remarked.  
“疲惫不是待在家里的充分理由，再说你需要让明日香重新适应学校生活。”他的监护人评论道。

Shinji almost smiled, she had fallen straight into his trap. "Well actually… it's probably not a good idea to bring her to school straight away, she doesn't remember anything and it could cause several issues with our classmates" he countered.  
“但实际上……可能不直接带她去学校比较好，她什么都不记得了，这可能会给我们的同学带来不少问题。”他反驳道，几乎要笑出来，她完全落入了他的圈套。

"But she can't stay home alone" Misato retorted.  
“但她不能独自待在家里。”美里反驳道。

Bam, she had fallen for his second trap.  
砰，她又中了他的圈套。

"That's true, maybe I could stay home with her? I'm sure she's pretty weary after yesterday as well, and I could get her re-adjusted to everything before she goes back to school. Plus, we also have the play to practise for school. The only other person who could stay home with her would be you, but with the angel attack I'm sure you have a lot of work at NERV today" he explained, trying to sound as innocent as he could.  
“确实，也许我可以留在家里陪她？我相信她昨天也相当疲惫，我可以让她重新适应一切，然后再回学校。而且，我们还有学校的戏剧要排练。唯一能留在家里陪她的另一个人就是你，但考虑到天使袭击，我肯定你今天在 NERV 有很多工作要做。”他解释道，尽量让自己听起来尽可能无辜。

Misato thought about this for a while; he was right on all accounts and it wasn't like he _really_ needed to go to school anyway.  
美里思考了一会儿；他的每一点都说得没错，而且他去不去学校其实也无所谓。

"Alright, I guess it couldn't hurt. But I think I sense a hidden agenda" she said, winking at him.  
"好吧，我想这没什么坏处。但我感觉你有个隐藏的议程" 她边说边向他眨眼。

The boy chucked a pillow at her face in response.  
男孩抓起一个枕头朝她脸上扔去作为回应。

"That's not very nice third child" she said mockingly.  
"这可不太友好，三弟" 她嘲讽地说道。

He glared at her, turning himself into a stunning image of Asuka.  
他瞪着她，将自己变成了一个令人惊艳的明日香形象。

"I have to go now, so see ya" she said, laughing at his face. Misato walked out of his room sniggering and closed the door. Shinji sat there surprised at his overwhelming success, it had worked like a charm. He suddenly understood the Commander a little better. _'At least I learnt_ _**something**_ _useful from my father'_  
“我现在得走了，再见啦”她笑着说，对他的表情忍俊不禁。美里窃笑着走出他的房间并关上了门。真嗣坐在那里，对自己的巨大成功感到惊讶，这招真是灵验。他突然对司令官有了更深的理解。‘至少我从父亲那里学到了些有用的东西’

The boy waited in bed until he was sure Misato had left the house. He could hear the morning traffic begin as several cars drove by their apartment. He couldn't help feeling a little ecstatic as today he would get to skip school and spend a whole day alone with Asuka. Shinji got out of bed and decided to make breakfast, after all, he needed to make up for this morning's incident. First, he went to the bathroom and turned on the hot water to wash his hands and face. His hands ached a bit from the massage yesterday so he liberally put some heating fluid on to relieve them. Drying his hands with a towel, he exited the bathroom.  
男孩躺在床上，直到确信美里已经离开家。他听到早晨的车流开始，几辆车驶过他们的公寓。他忍不住感到有些兴奋，因为今天他将能逃课，与明日香单独度过一整天。真嗣起床决定做早餐，毕竟，他需要弥补今早的事件。首先，他走进浴室，打开热水洗手洗脸。他的手因昨天的按摩而有些酸痛，所以他慷慨地涂上一些加热液来缓解。用毛巾擦干手后，他离开了浴室。

Walking to the kitchen he looked around, seeing Asuka nowhere in sight. She was obviously still in her room and so he placed his apron on and began preparing breakfast. He whistled softly to himself and occasionally moved his hand away from the stove as bits of oil flew out from the frying pan as he fried some eggs. Shinji silently sniggered to himself as he looked down at his apron, noticing the big _**World's Best Housewife**_. He knew it was true to an extent and wondered which roommate had bought it. With all the rustle and the smell of food, Asuka got out of bed and strolled into the kitchen curious as to what was happening.  
他走向厨房，环顾四周，却不见明日香的踪影。她显然还在房间里，于是他系上围裙，开始准备早餐。他轻声吹着口哨，不时将手从炉子旁移开，因为煎蛋时油花四溅。真嗣默默地窃笑，低头看着自己的围裙，注意到上面印着“世界最佳家庭主妇”的大字。他知道这在某种程度上是真实的，并好奇是哪位室友买的。随着锅碗瓢盆的响动和食物的香气，明日香从床上爬起来，好奇地走进厨房，想知道发生了什么。

"Smells good Shinji, whatcha making?" she asked.  
“闻起来不错，真嗣，你在做什么？”她问道。

He turned to face her and the girl fell on the floor, crying her eyes out in laughter. Shinji was momentarily puzzled at her actions until he realised that she must be laughing at his apron.  
他转过身面对她，女孩笑得前仰后合，眼泪都流了出来。真嗣一时被她的举动弄糊涂了，直到他意识到她肯定是在笑他的围裙。

"It's not that funny Asuka" Shinji said, sighing.  
"Asuka，这并不好笑。" 真嗣叹了口气说道。

"Of course it is! It's so true, our little housewife" she said, wiping the tears from her eyes.  
"当然好笑！太真实了，我们的小家庭主妇。" 她边说边擦去眼角的泪水。

"To answer your previous question, I'm making fried eggs, bacon and sausages" he said, ignoring her comment.  
"回答你之前的问题，我在做煎蛋、培根和香肠。" 他无视了她的评论说道。

"Oh finally! Some decent European food for once, I was getting sick and tired of a Japanese breakfast" she said excitedly.  
"哦，终于！总算有像样的欧洲食物了，我对日式早餐已经厌倦透顶了" 她兴奋地说道。

"Well if you don't mind, this housewife needs to finish making breakfast" he said, turning back to the stove.  
"好吧，如果你不介意的话，这位家庭主妇需要完成早餐的制作" 他说着，转身回到炉子前。

Asuka snickered quietly and then looked up at the clock, noticing it was past school's starting time already. "Why haven't we gone to school yet? Or maybe it's the weekend, I have no idea what day it is…" she asked, wondering.  
明日香轻声窃笑，然后抬头看向时钟，注意到已经过了上学的时间。"为什么我们还没去学校？还是说今天是周末，我完全不知道今天是什么日子……" 她疑惑地问道。

"It's Friday today, however Misato said we can have the day off. I'll be getting you re-adjusted and up to date on Tokyo-3, plus there's also a play we have to practise" he answered.  
"今天是星期五，不过美里说我们可以休息一天。我会帮你重新适应和了解东京-3 的情况，另外还有一出戏需要我们排练" 他回答道。

"What! I have to spend the whole day with _you_?" the girl shot back.  
"什么！我得整天和你在一起？" 女孩反问道。

Shinji chuckled softly; this was definitely the Asuka he knew.  
真嗣轻声笑了笑；这绝对是他所认识的明日香。

"Yes the 'great' Asuka has to spend a whole day with the pathetic perverted housewife Shinji" he said, pretending to be mortified.  
"是啊，伟大的'明日香'得和那个可怜又变态的家庭主妇真嗣度过一整天。"他说着，假装感到非常沮丧。

"Don't mock me third child" she warned, "But at least I get the day off, school is always SO boring. By the way I'm hungry, so hurry with that breakfast you're making" she ordered.  
"别嘲笑我，三号机驾驶员"她警告道，"但至少我今天放假，学校总是那么无聊。顺便说一句，我饿了，快点把早餐做好"她命令道。

"Yes, your highness" he said, bowing to her.  
"遵命，公主殿下"他说着，向她鞠了一躬。

The girl scowled at him but stayed silent, patiently waiting for him to finish breakfast. Shinji risked a glance at the redhead and couldn't help thinking she looked so cute. He quickly returned his concentration to the task at hand. As he finished, he placed the food on the table. Asuka didn't hold back in snatching the food and devouring it like a hungry shark; she was starving after all. Shinji stared at her in amazement, but soon turned his attention to his food so he wouldn't be caught staring at her. Asuka was far too involved in eating her beloved European food to notice anything Shinji was doing. Finishing her meal, she left the table without a word and went off to her room.  
女孩对他皱了皱眉，但保持沉默，耐心地等他吃完早餐。真嗣偷偷瞥了一眼红发女孩，忍不住觉得她看起来很可爱。他迅速将注意力转回手头的任务。吃完后，他将食物放在桌上。明日香毫不客气地抢过食物，狼吞虎咽地吃起来，毕竟她饿坏了。真嗣惊讶地看着她，但很快将注意力转向自己的食物，以免被发现盯着她看。明日香正全神贯注于享用她钟爱的欧洲美食，根本没注意到真嗣的举动。吃完饭后，她一言不发地离开餐桌，回到自己的房间。

The girl still felt a little groggy and decided to have a shower. She pulled out some fresh clothes from her wardrobe and walked to the bathroom. Closing the door behind her, Asuka swiftly undressed, shivering a little as she felt the cool temperature in the bathroom. The girl hurriedly turned on the hot water and stepped under the shower, enjoying the feeling of warm water running all over her. She began to wash herself, not bothering to close the screen.  
女孩仍感到有些昏昏沉沉，决定洗个澡。她从衣柜里拿出一些干净的衣服，走向浴室。关上门后，明日香迅速脱掉衣服，浴室里的凉意让她微微颤抖。她急忙打开热水，站在花洒下，享受着温暖的水流遍全身的感觉。她开始洗澡，懒得拉上浴帘。

---

Shinji was sitting down in silence after having finished his meal. He was thinking about what he would do today, about how he would re-adjust Asuka. Nothing came to mind and he sighed, deciding he would just ask her as she would likely have some ideas. The boy took his and Asuka's dishes and placed them in the sink. He then proceeded to wash them, however soon realised that no hot water was coming out of the taps.  
真嗣在吃完饭后静静地坐着，思考着今天该做些什么，如何重新调整明日香的状态。他毫无头绪，叹了口气，决定直接问她，她可能有些主意。男孩拿起自己和明日香的餐具，放到水槽里。然后开始清洗，但很快发现水龙头里没有热水流出。

_'Strange'_ he thought, _'I must have left the hot water running in the bathroom'_  
“奇怪，”他想，“我一定是忘了关浴室的热水。”

With this, he walked to the bathroom door and opened it as it wasn't locked. What he wasn't prepared to see was a very naked Asuka with hot water streaming all over her body. He stood there, staring at her with his mouth open in total shock. Asuka on the other hand was not gaping like an idiot and instead turned to look at him furiously, the temperature in the room suddenly rising, not just from her anger. He quickly looked away, realising his error and fumbled for an apology.  
于是，他走到浴室门前，门没锁，便打开了。他没料到会看到一丝不挂的明日香，热水正从她身上倾泻而下。他站在那里，目瞪口呆地盯着她，嘴巴张得大大的。而明日香则没有像傻瓜一样张着嘴，反而愤怒地转头看向他，房间里的温度骤然升高，不仅仅是她的怒火。他迅速移开视线，意识到自己的失礼，慌忙寻找道歉的话语。

"I errr… um the door was unlocked and well… you see…" he fumbled, starting to back away.  
"我呃…嗯，门没锁，然后…你看…" 他结结巴巴地说着，开始后退。

The redhead grabbed him before he could escape, pulled him into the bathroom and started pounding her fists into him under the shower.  
红发女孩在他逃跑前抓住了他，把他拽进浴室，在淋浴下开始用拳头猛击他。

"I'll teach you to perve on me you freak!" she shouted at him.  
"我要教你别再偷窥我，你这个变态！" 她对他大喊。

Shinji being blinded by the stream of water gushing into his face, flailed his arms out in an attempt to defend himself. He tried to grab the girl's arms to get her to stop punching him. The boy finally grabbed something soft and she stopped moving. Confused at this sudden pause, he moved his face out of the way of the torrent of water and saw what he had grabbed; in an attempt to defend himself he had "accidentally" grabbed her breasts. He instantly let go.  
被迎面冲来的水流蒙蔽了双眼的真嗣，慌乱地挥舞着手臂试图自卫。他试图抓住女孩的手臂，让她停止对他的拳打脚踢。男孩最终抓住了某个柔软的东西，她停止了动作。对这突如其来的停顿感到困惑，他避开水流，看清了自己抓住的东西；为了自卫，他“不小心”抓住了她的胸部。他立刻松开了手。

_'Oh God I'm in for it now, I can't run this time even if I wanted to'_ he thought. Shinji closed his eyes, accepting his fate, and waited for the oncoming blow. Nothing happened. He risked a peek and saw Asuka still looming over him. The boy opened his mouth to say sorry, but he knew that would infuriate her more and quickly shut it. It looked as if she was deciding the most cruel punishment she could inflict on him. Finally, she just sighed.  
'哦天哪，这下我完了，就算想跑也跑不了了' 他心想。真嗣闭上眼睛，接受了自己的命运，等待着即将到来的打击。什么也没发生。他冒险偷看了一眼，看到明日香仍然俯视着他。男孩张开嘴想说对不起，但他知道这只会让她更加愤怒，于是迅速闭上了嘴。看起来她正在决定能对他施加的最残酷的惩罚。最终，她只是叹了口气。

"Leave now before I beat the crap out of you" she said menacingly.  
“趁我还没把你揍得满地找牙，赶紧滚” 她恶狠狠地说道。

"Yes maam" he squeaked obediently.  
“是的，女士。”他顺从地小声回答。

He gladly turned around to exit the bathroom. _'God she is downright scary sometimes, but that was too easy'_  
他高兴地转身准备离开浴室。‘天哪，她有时候真是吓人，但这也太简单了。’

As if she had sensed his thoughts, she brought up her leg and kicked him straight in the balls. Hard. Shinji let out a cry of pain and cringed, before keeling over and falling onto the floor outside the bathroom clutching his crotch.  
仿佛察觉到了他的想法，她抬起腿，一脚直击他的要害。重重的一击。真嗣痛得大叫一声，缩成一团，随即弯腰倒在了浴室外的地板上，双手紧捂着下体。

"Let that be a lesson to you Ikari" she said, sneering as she closed the door and locked it this time.  
"让这成为你的教训吧，碇" 她冷笑着说，这次她关上门并上了锁。

"God damn that _really_ hurt" he said aloud, "And it wasn't even totally my fault"  
"该死，真的很痛" 他大声说道，"而且这也不完全是我的错"

Soaking wet, he attempted to get up and winced in pain; the ache in his groin prevented him from doing so.  
浑身湿透的他试图站起来，却因胯下的疼痛而皱眉；那股疼痛让他无法这么做。

"Looks like I'm gonna be here for a while" the boy said to himself.  
“看来我得在这儿待上一阵子了。”男孩自言自语道。

Suddenly, he heard the water stop running. Shinji paused to listen and heard a bit of shuffling coming from the bathroom. Out emerged Asuka all too quickly with a towel draped around her, the towel looked familiar. He hurriedly turned away as he realised from her point of view it looked like he was looking up her legs.  
突然，他听到水声停止了。真嗣停下脚步聆听，听到浴室里传来一阵窸窣声。阿斯卡迅速走出浴室，身上裹着一条毛巾，那毛巾看起来颇为眼熟。他急忙转过身去，意识到从她的角度看，自己像是在窥视她的双腿。

She noticed of course. "Still trying to be a hentai, you stupid baka!" the redhead spat, kicking him in the stomach.  
她当然注意到了。“还在试图耍流氓，你这个笨蛋！”红发女孩厉声说道，一脚踢在他的肚子上。

Shinji doubled over in pain. Asuka huffed at him and walked away to her room. He sniggered quietly to himself, _'that stupid bitch didn't realise there was heating fluid on that towel.'_ Soon enough, he heard a cry of shock come from her room and he burst out laughing. His face soon turned into a terrified one as the redhead poked her angry head out of her room and glared straight at him.  
真嗣痛苦地弯下腰。明日香对他哼了一声，转身回自己的房间。他暗自窃笑，'那个蠢女人没意识到毛巾上有加热液。'很快，他听到她房间里传来一声惊呼，随即爆发出大笑。但他的脸很快转为惊恐，因为红发女孩愤怒地探出头来，直直地瞪着他。

"Ikari!" she screamed. “碇！”她尖叫道。

The boy got up, still in pain though much lessened now, and ran for his life still laughing. His shirt was completely soaked so he stopped to take it off. He swiftly threw the offending garment away and gulped as he saw a flaming whirlwind speeding towards him. _'She sure changed fast'_ he thought as he began running again. Asuka chased him all over the house, leaving a wail of destruction in her path. Shinji was growing weary but he knew he'd be decimated if he stopped.  
男孩站起身，尽管疼痛减轻了许多，但还是笑个不停，拔腿就跑。他的衬衫完全湿透了，于是停下来脱掉。他迅速扔掉那件碍事的衣服，咽了口唾沫，只见一团火焰旋风正向他疾驰而来。'她变装真快'，他想，又开始奔跑。明日香追着他满屋子跑，所到之处一片狼藉。真嗣越来越疲惫，但他知道一旦停下来就会被彻底击败。

"Look Asuka, stop this chase!" he called out desperately.  
"看，明日香，别追了！" 他绝望地喊道。

She halted her chase, Shinji and Asuka on opposite sides of the dining table. She was glaring furiously at him. He noticed her fidgeting constantly; something was irritating her.  
她停止了追逐，真嗣和明日香分别站在餐桌的两边。她怒气冲冲地瞪着他。他注意到她不停地动来动去；有什么东西在烦扰她。

"Explain yourself third child" she said, hissing in obvious pain.  
"解释一下，第三适格者" 她咬牙切齿地说，显然很痛苦。

"What makes you think I had anything to do with it?" he asked, trying to sound sincere.  
"你怎么会认为我与此事有关？" 他问道，试图听起来诚恳。

"I heard you laughing Ikari!" she roared, "Don't even _think_ about weaseling out of this, I do NOT think this is funny in ANY way"  
"我听到你在笑，碇！" 她咆哮道，"别想逃避责任，我一点也不觉得这有什么好笑的"

"But…" he started. "但是…" 他开口道。

"What did you do?" she demanded.  
"你做了什么？" 她质问道。

"Look I didn't mean it! I-It was an ac-accident you see-" he stammered.  
"听着，我不是故意的！我——你知道的，这是个意外——" 他结结巴巴地说。

"WHAT DID YOU DO?!" she yelled at him.  
"你到底做了什么？！" 她对他吼道。

"I left some heating fluid on the towel you used" he answered quickly.  
"我在你用的毛巾上留了些加热液。" 他迅速回答道。

"Schiesse! Are you crazy Shinji? Do you know where I placed the heating fluid?" she snapped.  
"该死！真嗣，你疯了吗？你知道我把加热液放哪儿了吗？" 她厉声说道。

He shook his head slowly.  
他缓缓地摇了摇头。

"The worst possible place! It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens when heating fluid makes contact with extremely sensitive skin" Asuka said in outrage.  
"最糟糕的地方！加热液体接触到极度敏感的皮肤会发生什么，这不需要天才就能想明白。" 明日香愤怒地说道。

"But Asuka, I really didn't mean it, it was a total accident" he defended.  
"但明日香，我真的不是故意的，这完全是个意外。" 他辩解道。

"Then why were you laughing?" she asked, aggravated.  
"那你为什么在笑？" 她恼火地问。

"Well I thought it was kinda funny, like you received retribution for causing me pain in a similar area. Besides I didn't think you would be so unlucky as to have placed it _there_" he explained.  
"嗯，我觉得挺滑稽的，就像你因为让我在类似部位受痛而得到了报应。再说了，我没想到你会这么倒霉，居然放在那里。" 他解释道。

She sighed, pacing around the room. "Do you know how irritating this is? How long do the effects last?"  
她叹了口气，在房间里踱来踱去。"你知道这有多烦人吗？效果会持续多久？"

"Well about an hour or so, you won't have to bear it for much longer" he answered.  
"大概一个小时左右，你不用忍受太久了" 他回答道。

"Lucky for you" she said bitterly.  
"算你走运" 她苦涩地说道。

"I'll go err… finish the dishes" he finished, running off to the kitchen.  
"我去……把碗洗了" 他匆匆跑向厨房。

_'When I'm in a better condition, I'll make sure he pays'_ she thought vindictively. Though when she thought about it logically, she knew A: Shinji wasn't really a pervert and B: No one, let alone Shinji would have the guts to intentionally walk in on her in the shower or plant a trap on the towel. The redhead decided she would cut _some_ slack, if she found Shinji in the same position she probably would have laughed as well. The annoying feeling persisted and Asuka gritted her teeth, she could last an hour, she was strong enough.  
'等我状态好些，一定要让他付出代价' 她心怀怨恨地想。但理智一想，她明白：A: 真嗣并非真的变态，B: 无论是谁，更别提真嗣，都不会有胆量故意闯进她的浴室或在毛巾上设陷阱。红发少女决定稍作宽容，如果看到真嗣处于同样境地，她大概也会笑出声。那股恼人的感觉依旧挥之不去，明日香咬紧牙关，她能撑过一个小时，她足够坚强。

The boy entered the kitchen and proceeded to finish washing the dishes. This time the hot water ran through the taps. Shinji relaxed a little while he was washing, it seemed to relieve the tension. _'This certainly was not a good first impression. Just about everything that could go wrong, did go wrong'_ he thought, sighing.  
男孩走进厨房，开始完成洗碗的工作。这次热水从水龙头中流出。真嗣在洗碗时稍微放松了一些，这似乎缓解了紧张感。'这绝对不是个好的第一印象。几乎所有可能出错的事情都出错了' 他想道，叹了口气。

"And to think it wasn't even my fault that I walked in on her" he said to himself.  
“而且想想看，我走进去看到她甚至不是我的错” 他自言自语道。

"So, you're saying that was an accident as well?" Asuka declared.  
“那么，你是说那也是个意外？” 明日香宣布道。

Shinji jumped, startled by her voice and blushed a little, embarrassed that she had heard. She moved up behind him and the boy moved his legs together in fear of another punishment. Asuka smiled slightly, amused at this reaction and flicked him on the head.  
真嗣吓了一跳，被她的声音惊到，脸颊微微泛红，尴尬她听到了。她走到他身后，男孩害怕再次受罚，双腿并拢。明日香微微一笑，对他的反应感到有趣，轻轻弹了一下他的头。

"I'd love to hear how you could _possibly_ walk in on me unintentionally" she said sweetly.  
“我倒想听听你怎么可能无意中闯进来。”她甜甜地说道。

He turned around to face her, putting his thoughts into words. "I was gonna wash the dishes only to find no hot water. I went to check the bathroom to see if I left the tap running and the door was unlocked. I opened the door and you hadn't even closed the screen to the shower, so how can you not accept SOME responsibility for this?" he explained.  
他转过身面对她，将思绪化为言语。“我本来打算洗碗，却发现没有热水。我去检查浴室，看看是不是忘了关水龙头，门也没锁。我打开门，你连淋浴间的帘子都没拉上，你怎么能不承认自己也有责任呢？”他解释道。

"You should have paid more attention to hear the sound of running water" she countered.  
"你本该更注意听那流水声的"她反驳道。

"I thought that was the tap I left running" he argued.  
"我以为是我没关的水龙头"他辩解道。

"You still should have knocked to see if I was in there anyway" she refuted.  
"无论如何，你还是应该先敲门看看我在不在里面"她反驳道。

Shinji stopped; he hadn't thought about that. He closed his mouth embarrassed and seemed to shrink back.  
真嗣停了下来；他之前从未考虑过这一点。他尴尬地闭上嘴，似乎退缩了。

"Any more 'wise comments' from the Great Shinji?" she said mockingly.  
“伟大的真嗣还有更多‘高见’吗？”她嘲讽地说道。

He simply stayed silent. 他只是保持沉默。

"Good boy" she said emphatically.  
"好孩子" 她强调地说。

God he just wanted to grab her, pull her clothes off, bang into her and wipe that stupid smug grin off her face. He sighed, obviously defeated and returned to his work.  
天啊，他只想抓住她，扯掉她的衣服，猛烈地进入她，抹去她脸上那愚蠢的自鸣得意的笑容。他叹了口气，显然是败下阵来，又回到了自己的工作中。

"As compensation, I want you to tell me what you're all hiding from me" she demanded.  
"作为补偿，我要你告诉我你们都在对我隐瞒什么" 她要求道。

Shinji was ready for this; he knew Asuka would turn her interrogation onto him.  
真嗣对此已有准备；他知道明日香会转向他进行盘问。

"We are not 'hiding' anything from you, we will tell you everything we can think of. I plan to do so while I'm re-adjusting you" he replied.  
“我们并没有‘隐瞒’任何事，我们会把能想到的一切都告诉你。我打算在重新调整你的过程中这样做。”他回答道。

Asuka sighed, she didn't think a direct approach would work but it was worth a try. As he finished washing the dishes, he wiped his hands clean and turned to face her.  
明日香叹了口气，她不认为直接的方法会奏效，但值得一试。当他洗完碗碟，擦干双手，转身面对她时。

"Speaking of which, I don't really know where to begin. So Asuka, what do you want to do?" he asked her.  
"说到这个，我真不知道该从何说起。那么，Asuka，你想做什么？" 他问她。

The redhead sat down on the couch and began to think silently. Shinji sat down next to her and unconsciously began to idly stroke her hair with his fingers. Asuka was about to rip his arm off, but thought it was strange that he showed her affection like this. He had done so in the hospital too and she couldn't remember him ever doing it before. _'We must have reached some sort of understanding; I could use this to my advantage. Perhaps all I need to do is prey on every male's weakness to get the information out.'_ The girl had no better plan at the moment and so took his other hand to get his attention.  
红发女孩坐在沙发上，开始静静地思考。真嗣坐在她旁边，不自觉地开始用手指轻抚她的头发。Asuka 差点要把他的手臂扯下来，但觉得他这样表达亲昵很奇怪。他在医院里也这样做过，而她不记得他以前有过这样的举动。'我们之间一定达成了某种理解；我可以利用这一点来获取信息。或许我只需要利用每个男性的弱点，就能套出信息。' 女孩此刻没有更好的计划，于是握住他的另一只手以吸引他的注意。

"I'm sorry Shinji" she struggled to say.  
"对不起，真嗣" 她艰难地说道。

"For what?" he asked puzzled.  
"为了什么？" 他困惑地问道。

"For me being a…" she wondered about the best word, "Bitch, you didn't deserve that"  
"为了我是个……" 她思索着最合适的词，"婊子，你不该受那罪"

He chuckled weakly. "Since when do you apologise?" he asked teasingly.  
他虚弱地轻笑。"你什么时候开始道歉了？" 他打趣地问。

She glared at him. Shinji gulped.  
她瞪着他。真嗣咽了口唾沫。

"I was just joking jeez… anyway don't worry about it, you've done worse before so I'm used to it" he reassured.  
"我只是在开玩笑，真是的……总之别担心，你以前做得更糟，我已经习惯了" 他安慰道。

"I don't know, you seemed to be in a lot of pain over your crown jewels" she said, sounding unconvinced.  
"我不知道，你看起来对你的王冠珠宝很痛苦" 她说，听起来并不相信。

"Well, it did hurt a LOT" he admitted.  
“嗯，确实很疼。”他承认道。

The boy wondered what had gotten into her, one moment she was angry at him, next moment she was apologising to him. "What's with the change of attitude?" he asked.  
男孩疑惑她怎么了，前一刻她还对他生气，下一刻却向他道歉。“态度怎么突然变了？”他问道。

"You're the one that has changed. You're no longer stammering that much, and you don't say your stupid sorry and you've grown a spine. Before, you would always accept the blame and responsibility but this time you tried to convince me it wasn't your fault. It is most definitely _you_ who has changed and maybe I should try being a little nicer" Asuka explained.  
“是你变了。你不再那么结巴，也不再说那些愚蠢的对不起，还变得有骨气了。以前，你总是承担责任和过错，但这次你试图说服我那不是你的错。显然是你变了，也许我也该试着变得更好一些。”明日香解释道。

"Uh-huh" he replied, uncertain.  
"嗯嗯" 他不确定地回答道。

"But you'll never get away with perving on me" she said with a smirk on her face.  
"但你永远别想偷窥我" 她脸上带着一丝得意的笑容说道。

"Why would I want to perv on you?" Shinji shot back, sticking his tongue out at her.  
"我为什么要偷窥你？" 真嗣反驳道，朝她吐了吐舌头。

"Because I have the most beautiful body in all of Tokyo-3" she said proudly.  
"因为我是整个第三新东京市身材最棒的" 她自豪地说道。

"You're less attractive than a pregnant hippo" he joked with a laugh.  
"你还没怀孕的河马有魅力呢" 他笑着打趣道。

The redhead scowled at him. _'You just wait you stupid boy'_  
红发女孩瞪了他一眼。'你等着瞧吧，笨蛋小子'

"Okay Asuka, back to my original question, what do you want to do? The whole point of this day off was to get you re-adjusted" he explained.  
“好的，绫波，回到我最初的问题，你想做什么？今天放假的目的就是为了让你重新适应。”他解释道。

"Hmm… perhaps we could take a walk around and you can show me any new shops or areas. Maybe we could even go to the movies to see films I missed out on. After that we can practise that play you were talking about" she suggested.  
“嗯……也许我们可以四处走走，你带我看看新开的店铺或区域。或许我们还可以去看电影，补上我错过的那些影片。之后我们可以练习你提到的那出戏。”她提议道。

"Ok great, by the way I don't feel like cooking today so I'll buy lunch and dinner" Shinji offered.  
“好的，太好了，顺便说一句，我今天不想做饭，所以我会买午餐和晚餐。”真嗣提议道。

"Fine with me" the girl agreed.  
“我没意见。”女孩同意道。

Asuka got up and decided to have some "fun," jumping down hard onto his lap, making him elicit a yelp.  
明日香站起身，决定找点乐子，重重地跳到他腿上，让他不禁发出一声惊叫。

"Asuka it still hurts 'there!' Get off" he requested.  
“明日香，那里还疼呢！下来吧。”他请求道。

The redhead knew exactly what he meant by "there."  
红发女孩完全明白他所说的“那里”是什么意思。

"Never!" she refused. “绝不！”她拒绝道。

Shinji pushed his hands up her shirt, she blushed startled and surprised at the sudden contact of his hands on her bare skin, she was _not_ going to let him go _that_ far. Before she could react, he began to tickle her ribs and almost instantly she was having uncontrollable fits of laughter.  
真嗣将手伸进她的衬衫，她因这突如其来的肌肤接触而脸红心跳，惊讶不已，她可不打算让他得逞。还没等她反应过来，他就开始挠她的肋骨，几乎立刻让她忍不住大笑起来。

"Please…stop… I…can't… take…anymore" she feebly protested between breaths.  
“请…停下…我…受不…了了”她无力地抗议着，喘息间断断续续。

The boy hesitated for a moment, but it was enough for Asuka to pounce on him as she began to tickle him and now _he_ was laughing madly.  
男孩犹豫了一瞬，但这一瞬已足够让明日香抓住机会扑向他，开始挠他痒痒，现在他疯狂地笑了起来。

"Gah… stop…it… Asuka…" he pleaded.  
“啊…停…手…明日香…”他恳求道。

But the redhead continued on relentlessly. The boy moved his arms to grab her, giving her an opening to tickle him more. He gritted his teeth and tried to push her off of him. She fell back a bit, though holding onto him, she pulled him down with her and they landed on the floor with a crash. They lay there, Shinji on top of her, panting for breath. The boy looked at her, noticing how close they were. Her breasts were pressing into him and her hands were still on his bare chest from where she had been tickling him and where she had grabbed hold when she fell. Shinji felt his member straighten and hoped to God Asuka did not notice.  
但红发女孩毫不留情地继续着。男孩挥动手臂试图抓住她，却给了她更多挠痒的机会。他咬紧牙关，试图将她推开。她稍稍后仰，但仍紧抓着他，将他也拉倒在地，两人砰的一声摔在地板上。他们躺在那里，真嗣压在她身上，喘着粗气。男孩看着她，注意到他们靠得有多近。她的胸部紧贴着他，双手仍停留在他裸露的胸膛上，那是她之前挠痒和跌倒时抓住的地方。真嗣感到自己的下体挺立起来，心中祈祷着明日香没有注意到。

"Excited are you Shinji?" she said, smirking.  
“兴奋了吗，真嗣？”她带着一丝坏笑说道。

He blushed and scratched his head, _'Yep she noticed'_ he thought.  
他脸红着挠了挠头，心想：‘没错，她注意到了。’

"Uh… well…" he started. "呃…这个…" 他开口道。

"You're so perverted" she said, pushing him off of her.  
"你真是太变态了" 她边说边把他从自己身上推开。

Shinji bit back the urge to say "it's not my fault" and instead got up and offered his hand to help her up. The girl slapped his offered hand away and stood up herself.  
真嗣忍住了想说"这不是我的错"的冲动，而是站起来向她伸出手想帮忙。女孩却拍开了他的手，自己站了起来。

"But at least it proves I'm more attractive than a pregnant hippo, unless things like that turn you on third child" she said, winking devilishly.  
"但至少这证明我比怀孕的河马更有吸引力，除非那种东西能让你在第三个孩子时兴奋"，她眨眼调皮地说道。

Shinji blushed furiously. Asuka just grinned; she still had it.  
真嗣脸红得厉害。明日香只是咧嘴一笑；她依然魅力不减。

"O-Okay A-Asuka, let's g-go" he stammered.  
"好-好吧，明-明日香，我们走-走吧"，他结巴着说。

The girl walked to the front door to wait for Shinji while he got ready. The boy went to his room and removed his pants, as they were still wet, and threw them onto his pile of dirty clothes. _'I must remember to do the laundry, I've let it build up a bit'_ he thought. Shinji decided he might as well put all his dirty clothes in the laundry, he could wash them later. As he picked up his clothes, something fell on the floor. He hurried to the laundry depositing his load, not wanting Asuka to catch him almost naked, and returned to his room.  
女孩走到前门等待真嗣准备妥当。男孩回到自己的房间，脱下湿漉漉的裤子，扔到脏衣服堆上。'我得记得洗衣服，已经积了不少了' 他心想。真嗣决定干脆把所有脏衣服都放进洗衣机，晚点再洗。他捡起衣服时，有什么东西掉在了地上。他急忙把衣服放进洗衣机，不想让明日香看到自己几乎赤裸的样子，然后回到房间。

The boy swiftly dressed himself and bent down to pick up the object that fell out of the clothes pile. A small smile formed itself on his face as he looked upon the photo of him and Asuka snuggled up together on the couch. Shinji remembered he had taken the photo just before Asuka ran off, however, he had just thrown his clothes into the pile when he changed, wanting to confront the girl.  
男孩迅速穿好衣服，弯腰捡起从衣服堆里掉出来的东西。当他看到那张自己和明日香依偎在沙发上的照片时，脸上露出了微笑。真嗣记得这张照片是在明日香跑开之前拍的，当时他急着换衣服，想去找她对峙。

_'I could use this'_ he thought.  
'这东西或许有用' 他心想。

Shinji placed the photo in his drawer, took his wallet and keys and re-joined Asuka at the door.  
真嗣将照片放入抽屉，拿起钱包和钥匙，重新回到门口与明日香会合。

"About time" she said as she saw him.  
“终于来了”她看到他时说道。

"Just had a few things to take care of" he replied.  
“只是有些事情要处理一下”他回答道。

Asuka opened the door and exited the room, Shinji followed suit.  
明日香打开门，走出了房间，真嗣也跟着出去了。

"Don't forget to lock the door" she said nonchalantly.  
“别忘了锁门。”她漫不经心地说道。

"Says you" he muttered. “就你说的。”他咕哝道。

The two of them took the elevator down. Both teens waited patiently for the elevator to finish its descent, enjoying the moment of peace between them. The elevator doors opened and they exited the apartment, Asuka following Shinji as he walked off.  
两人一起乘电梯下楼。两位少年耐心等待电梯完成下降，享受着彼此间的片刻宁静。电梯门打开，他们走出公寓，明日香跟着真嗣一起离开。

The morning sun was beginning its daily journey across the Tokyo-3 skyline, promising another gorgeous sunny day. The pair was oblivious to the sounds of traffic and the hustle and bustle of city life as they worked their way through the maze of sidewalks that would eventually lead them to their first destination; the mall.  
清晨的阳光开始在东京-3 的天际线上展开它每日的旅程，预示着又一个阳光明媚的日子。这对情侣对交通的喧嚣和城市生活的繁忙充耳不闻，他们穿梭在错综复杂的人行道上，最终将抵达他们的第一个目的地——购物中心。

"Okay there's only one new shop I remember, it's a clothes store" Shinji declared.  
“好吧，我只记得有一家新店，是个服装店。”真嗣宣布道。

At this, he heard Asuka cry out in glee. The boy rolled his eyes and began to express in words today's plan. "We'll go there first, then we'll take a walk to the park so you can see how the city looks now. By then it'll be lunchtime so we'll eat, then we can watch a movie which you can choose and after that we can go home. At the apartment, we can start practicing the play and have dinner whenever we feel hungry. What do you think?" he detailed.  
听到这里，他听到明日香欢呼雀跃的声音。男孩翻了个白眼，开始详细说明今天的计划：“我们先去那里，然后去公园散步，让你看看这座城市现在的样子。到那时就该吃午饭了，我们吃完饭，你可以选一部电影看，之后我们就回家。在公寓里，我们可以开始排练戏剧，饿了就随时吃晚饭。你觉得怎么样？”他详细地解释道。

"Sounds great" Asuka replied.  
“听起来很棒”明日香回答道。

Shinji continued leading the way to the new store. Darting about in the clear blue skies, small birds sang songs of love as they searched for a mate. Of course, humans were much more complex than common birds. The two eva pilots soon arrived at the new store.  
真嗣继续领路前往新开的店铺。在清澈的蓝天中，小鸟们穿梭飞翔，唱着爱的歌曲，寻找伴侣。当然，人类比普通鸟类复杂得多。两位 EVA 驾驶员很快就到达了新店铺。

"Here it is" he announced.  
"就是这里" 他宣布道。

"I'll give you the privilege of helping me pick my clothes" she declared.  
"我将赐予你帮我挑选衣服的特权" 她宣称。

And so it began; the redhead would pick out some items, go into the changing room and present herself to Shinji for his opinion. He blushed a few times at some of the outfits she chose, he had a feeling she was up to something. Eventually, she had chosen what she wanted and he was forced to buy them for her, Asuka claiming it was a fair deal for allowing him to shop with her. Shinji was sure he was being cheated but didn't argue nonetheless. They exited the shop, Asuka bouncing up and down in joy and Shinji carrying the bags of course.  
于是，这一切开始了；红发女孩会挑选一些衣物，走进试衣间，然后向真嗣展示以征求他的意见。她选的一些衣服让他脸红了好几次，他有种感觉她在搞什么鬼。最终，她选好了想要的，并强迫他为她买单，明日香声称这是允许他陪她购物的公平交易。真嗣确信自己被占了便宜，但也没有争辩。他们离开了商店，明日香兴奋地蹦蹦跳跳，而真嗣当然得提着那些袋子。

"I'll let you lead this time to see if you remember the way to the park" he said to her.  
"这次我让你带路，看看你是否还记得去公园的路。"他对她说。

Asuka nodded and began to lead the way. Despite making a few wrong turns here and there, they eventually wound up at the park. The girl had looked around on the way, noticing many changes, new shops, new buildings and new terrain, probably caused by the evas. The two teens found a park bench under the shade of a tree and sat down together. The pain in Asuka's nether region was long gone. Shinji talked with her over the details of the city and how it had changed. He answered her questions, making sure to update her on all possible events, even school ones. He told her the date, the current weather, and described each angel battle as he could remember it. Of course, he didn't give much detail nor tell her about what was said in the battle against the 15th angel, he just said that she was too strong for the angel and overpowered it. Lastly, the boy let her know about the budding relationship between Hikari and Touji much to Asuka's chagrin.  
明日香点点头，开始带路。尽管途中转错了几个弯，他们最终还是到达了公园。女孩一路上环顾四周，注意到了许多变化，新开的商店、新建筑和新地形，很可能是由 EVA 造成的。两个少年在树荫下找到一张长椅，并肩坐下。明日香下体的疼痛早已消失。真嗣与她聊起了城市的变化细节。他回答她的问题，确保更新她所有可能的事件，包括学校的事情。他告诉她日期、当前的天气，并尽可能回忆起每一次使徒战斗的描述。当然，他没有透露太多细节，也没有告诉她第 15 使徒战斗中的对话，只是简单地说她太强大了，轻易击败了使徒。最后，男孩还告诉了她光和剑介之间萌芽的关系，这让明日香颇为不悦。

"Anyway, I've told you everything I can think of so you shouldn't have too much trouble getting accustomed now" Shinji finished off.  
"总之，我已经把我能想到的都告诉你了，现在你应该不会太难适应了。"真嗣总结道。

Asuka's stomach grumbled loudly and her face went red.  
明日香肚子咕噜咕噜地响了起来，她的脸一下子红了。

"Looks like it's time to eat" he said, grinning.  
"看来是吃饭时间了" 他笑着说。

"Yes lets" she replied. "好的，走吧" 她回答道。

Shinji led the way to a little ramen store and they sat down at a table. The boy swiftly bought both of them a meal and brought it over to their table. As they began to eat silently, Shinji made sure to avoid her gaze as he did not want to be caught "staring" at her. Asuka on the other hand was studying him intently _'he actually looks kinda cute'_ she thought and quickly destroyed that idea, _'What the hell am I thinking? He's nothing but a wimpy perverted baka'_  
真嗣领着路来到一家小拉面店，他们坐到了一张桌子旁。男孩迅速为他们两人点好了餐，并端到了桌上。他们开始默默地吃着，真嗣小心翼翼地避开她的目光，因为他不想被抓到“盯着”她看。另一方面，明日香则专注地打量着他，心想‘他其实看起来挺可爱的’，随即又迅速打消了这个念头，‘我在想什么呢？他不过是个懦弱又好色的笨蛋’

"_Then why are you watching him?"_ her inner voice asked her.  
“那你为什么在看他？”她内心的声音问道。

_'Because he's acting quite different to before'_ she responded in her head.  
‘因为他现在的行为和以前大不相同’她在心里回应道。

"_Maybe it's because you-"_ her other self started.  
"也许是因为你——" 她的另一个自己开口道。

_'No, I DO NOT!'_ she mentally screamed.  
'不，我绝对不是！' 她在心里尖叫。

Asuka nearly jumped out of her seat when Shinji addressed her. "You ok Asuka?" he asked, concerned.  
当真嗣向她搭话时，明日香差点从座位上跳起来。"你还好吗，明日香？" 他关切地问。

"Yeah, I'm fine" she said, continuing her meal.  
“嗯，我没事。”她说着，继续用餐。

Soon, they had both finished their food and got up to leave. The two teens left the store and headed in the direction of the cinema. The sun was shining brightly overhead, they guessed it was a little past midday. Despite the heat, a gentle cool breeze blew about them relieving them of the hot weather. A few empathetic glances were cast at Shinji as they walked by, mainly from males, as they saw him carrying the shopping bags. Upon entering the cinema, they walked around studying the movie posters, contemplating what they would watch.  
不久，两人都吃完了饭，起身离开。两个少年走出商店，朝着电影院的方向走去。阳光明媚，他们估计已经过了正午。尽管天气炎热，一阵凉爽的微风轻轻吹拂，缓解了酷热。一路上，不少人同情地瞥了瞥真嗣，主要是男性，因为他们看到他提着购物袋。进入电影院后，他们四处转悠，研究着电影海报，考虑着要看哪部电影。

"What movie do you want to see Asuka?" Shinji asked wearily on their third pass of the cinema.  
“你想看什么电影，明日香？”真嗣在他们第三次经过电影院时疲倦地问道。

"None of them seem to be anything interesting…" she trailed off and then paused, looking up at a poster she hadn't seen before. "Hey what's that, 'Angels and Evas'?" she asked.  
"这些似乎都没什么意思……" 她话音渐弱，随后停下，目光落在一幅之前未曾注意的海报上。"嘿，那是什么，'天使与使徒'？" 她问道。

"I haven't seen it, but I heard it's meant to portray the eva pilots, our, situation" Shinji replied.  
"我没看过，但我听说它是用来描绘使徒驾驶员，我们的，处境的" 真嗣回答道。

"Well let's see it, I wonder if they got the facts right" she proposed.  
"那我们看看吧，不知道他们有没有把事实讲对" 她提议道。

They moved over to the ticket office and Shinji placed the bags on the floor. The boy asked for some tickets to the movie.  
他们走向售票处，真嗣把包放在地上。男孩询问了一些电影票。

The ticket seller looked at them, recognising them and let out a laugh. "Well, what do you know? The real eva pilots coming to watch this film"  
售票员看着他们，认出了他们并笑了起来。“哎呀，真是没想到，真正的 EVA 驾驶员来看这部电影了。”

"Sshhh" Shinji shooshed. “嘘——”真嗣示意安静。

"We don't want people crowding us" Asuka said quietly.  
“我们不想被人挤来挤去。”明日香轻声说道。

"Ok ok I understand, enjoy your movie! Oh, by the way, leave those bags in the storage just here and pick them up after the movie, it's safe" the vendor explained.  
“好好，我明白了，好好享受电影吧！哦，对了，把那些包放在这里的储物柜里，看完电影再来取，很安全的。”小贩解释道。

Shinji thanked the man and placed the shopping bags into the storage, grateful for finally being relieved of the burden. The young boy examined his ticket, the movie started in a couple of minutes at cinema five. The two eva pilots made their way to cinema five, not bothering with snacks. As they entered the cinema, they looked around for some free seats and spotted a few near the back. They quietly sat down and waited for the movie to begin. During the advertisements, both teens made a mental note not to bring Misato to the cinema as they advertised the new re-hydrate-able pasta, "now with meat balls". As they overcame their nausea, the movie finally started, the title showed up reading _**Angels and Evas, the life of the pilots**_.  
真嗣向那人道谢，将购物袋放入储物柜，终于卸下了负担。少年看了看票，电影几分钟后在五号厅开始。两位 EVA 驾驶员前往五号厅，没有买零食。进入影厅后，他们环顾四周寻找空位，发现后排有几个座位。他们安静地坐下，等待电影开始。在广告期间，两个少年暗自决定以后不要带美里来电影院，因为他们正在宣传新出的即食意面，“现在还有肉丸”。他们强忍着恶心，电影终于开始了，片名显示为《天使与 EVA：驾驶员的生活》。

It began with a red-haired girl, looking similar to Asuka, walking down the streets of Tokyo-3 with a brown-haired boy looking like Shinji.  
一切始于一个红发女孩，酷似明日香，与一个棕发男孩，宛如真嗣，一同走在第三新东京市的街道上。

"Hey baka, let's check out this new apartment we're staying at" the movie Asuka said.  
“嘿，笨蛋，我们去看看我们新住的这个公寓吧。”电影中的明日香说道。

"Ok! I'm sorry for troubling you, I'm sorry for breathing, I'm sorry for being in your way, I'm sorry for existing" the movie Shinji said, practically groveling.  
“好的！对不起给你添麻烦了，对不起我呼吸了，对不起挡了你的路，对不起我存在。”电影中的真嗣几乎是在卑躬屈膝地说。

The real Shinji's brow furrowed, while Asuka silently laughed. "They really got the facts right" she whispered.  
真正的真嗣皱起了眉头，而明日香则默默地笑着。“他们真的把事实搞对了”她低声说道。

In the movie, the teens arrived at the apartment and attempted to open the door. It was near impossible as the two movie eva pilots struggled with all their might to open the door. It finally gave way and inside was an absolute mess, mountains of rubbish were piled up to the ceiling, moving around was impossible unless you wanted to step knee deep into leftover wrappers and beer cans. The movie Asuka gasped in shock, taking the trash can and dumping it onto the floor, actually improving its condition.  
在电影中，青少年们到达了公寓并试图打开门。这几乎是不可能的，因为两位电影中的 EVA 驾驶员用尽全力挣扎着开门。门终于开了，里面简直是一片狼藉，垃圾堆积如山，几乎触到了天花板，要想移动除非你想踩进深及膝盖的剩菜包装纸和啤酒罐里。电影中的明日香惊呼出声，拿起垃圾桶倒在地上，实际上还改善了状况。

"What the hell is all this mess?" the movie Asuka screamed.  
“这他妈的都是些什么乱七八糟的？”电影中的明日香尖叫道。

A purple haired woman walked in, looking like Misato, and she was wearing practically nothing. Both the real eva pilots sniggered at Misato and the messy apartment. Despite being a _little_ exaggerated, they knew it wasn't far from the truth.  
一位紫发女子走了进来，看起来像美里，却几乎没穿什么衣服。两位真正的 EVA 驾驶员对着美里和凌乱的公寓窃笑。尽管有些夸张，但他们知道这并不离谱。

"I can't be bothered cleaning" the movie Misato said, shrugging.  
“我懒得打扫”，电影中的美里耸耸肩说。

She grabbed 10 packs of beer and gulped them down, throwing the empty cans on the floor. Immediately, Shinji began cleaning up the place with Asuka following him around with a whip, making sure he did his job well. Meanwhile the movie Misato just sat around drinking and eating. The two real eva pilots watched in awe as she shoveled heaping mounds of noodles into her gaping maw... never pausing to take a breath. Then all of a sudden, their mobiles rang and the movie Shinji screamed like a girl.  
她抓起十包啤酒一饮而尽，将空罐子扔在地上。随即，真嗣开始打扫房间，而明日香拿着鞭子跟在他后面，确保他好好干活。与此同时，电影中的美里只是坐着吃喝。两位真正的 EVA 驾驶员目瞪口呆地看着她将大堆面条塞进张大的嘴里……从未停下喘口气。突然间，他们的手机响了，电影中的真嗣尖叫起来，像个女孩一样。

"Mustn't run away, mustn't run away" he started chanting before jumping out the window.  
“不能逃跑，不能逃跑”他开始念叨着，然后从窗户跳了出去。

The real Asuka could not hold in her laughter. The real Shinji sweat dropped; they seemed to be picking on him a lot.  
真正的明日香忍不住笑出声来。真正的真嗣则汗颜；他们似乎一直在捉弄他。

Back in the movie, Misato took the two teens into her car and drove like a maniac to NERV, making her pull off impossible moves, though it was almost exactly similar to how she actually drove. When they arrived at NERV, they entered and met a blue haired girl who looked like Rei.  
回到电影中，美里带着两个少年上了车，疯狂地驾驶着前往 NERV，做出了一系列不可能的动作，尽管这与她实际的驾驶方式几乎如出一辙。当他们到达 NERV 时，他们进入并遇到了一个蓝发女孩，看起来很像丽。

"I am Rei, I am an emotionless doll, I'll do anything I'm ordered to, please kill me, I can be replaced" the movie Rei announced.  
“我是丽，我是一个无情的玩偶，我会做任何被命令的事，请杀了我，我可以被替换。”电影中的丽宣布道。

"Shut up you freak" Asuka replied, breaking her neck.  
“闭嘴，你这个怪物。”明日香回答，扭断了她的脖子。

Almost instantaneously, another Rei popped up. "I am Rei, I am an emotionless doll, I'll do anything I'm ordered to, please kill me, I can be replaced"  
几乎在瞬间，另一个丽出现了。“我是丽，我是一个无情的玩偶，我会做任何被命令的事，请杀了我，我可以被替换。”

"Ridiculous, we don't have time for this" Asuka said with irritation.  
"荒唐，我们没时间搞这个了" 明日香带着烦躁说道。

They three movie pilots rushed off down to the eva cages and quickly got ready for battle.  
三位电影版驾驶员急忙冲向 EVA 格纳库，迅速准备投入战斗。

"Waiting for strategy from Operations Director Misato" the movie Ritsuko declared.  
"等待作战部长美里小姐的战术指令" 电影版中的律子宣布道。

"Just kill the damn thing" Misato ordered, gulping down some beer.  
“直接干掉那该死的东西。”美里命令道，同时灌下几口啤酒。

The evas got launched up and started to fight the angel. It seemed that while the evas were fighting, they managed to destroy absolutely every building in the city. The two real eva pilots decided they might consider suing the producer of this movie, he was very obviously anti-eva; though they were curious as to where he got his information from. The angel was defeated and the movie continued.  
初号机被发射升空，开始与使徒战斗。似乎在初号机战斗的过程中，它们成功摧毁了城市中的每一座建筑。两位真正的初号机驾驶员考虑过起诉这部电影的制片人，他显然是反初号机的；尽管他们好奇他从哪里得到这些信息的。使徒被击败，电影继续。

They sat there and watched the rest of the movie. At times it was extremely funny, at other times they took it too far. Asuka almost choked when they showed her wearing a tight leather costume playing dominatrix with Shinji, the real Shinji collapsed to the floor from blood loss. Asuka soon joined him on the floor when Rei joined the picture. The movie ended and the two eva pilots walked out of the cinema completely bewildered.  
他们坐在那里看完了剩下的电影。有时极其搞笑，有时又太过分。当屏幕上显示她穿着紧身皮衣，扮演支配者与真嗣互动时，明日香几乎噎住，真正的真嗣因失血过多倒在地上。明日香很快也加入了他的行列，当绫波加入画面时。电影结束，两位初号机驾驶员完全困惑地走出了电影院。

"Well, that was certainly interesting, but we are NEVER watching it again" Asuka said, shuddering.  
"嗯，那确实挺有意思的，但我们绝对不会再看了" 明日香说着，打了个寒颤。

"Agreed… I think they exaggerated my character way too much" Shinji remarked.  
"同意……我觉得他们把我的角色夸张过头了" 真嗣评论道。

"Oh?" she said cheekily, "I thought they did that part perfectly"  
"哦？" 她调皮地说，"我觉得那部分演得恰到好处"

"I thought they did Misato pretty well" he said quickly, changing the subject.  
"我觉得他们把美里演得挺好的" 他迅速转换了话题。

Asuka laughed. "No doubt about it"  
明日香笑了。"毫无疑问"

"I think that movie should be taken up with the Commander, there must be a leak at NERV, and I certainly don't think the rating PG is a proper classification" the boy commented.  
"我认为这部电影应该向指挥官报告，NERV 肯定有泄密，而且我当然不认为 PG 分级是合适的分类" 男孩评论道。

Asuka nodded her head in agreement and they returned to the ticket seller to retrieve their shopping bags. The man kindly asked how the movie was only to cower in fear as Asuka threatened to destroy the cinema with her eva in the next angel attack. Shinji took their bags and pulled the redhead away before the man would suffer permanent hearing loss from her screaming. The two eva pilots began their return journey to their apartment, laughing and discussing the movie until they had returned. Shinji felt much better, here he was finally spending enjoyable time with Asuka and having proper conversations. Taking the elevator, he slowly tuned her voice out and just looked at her as she continued talking to him. There was a sparkle in her eyes as she did her favourite pastime; complaining. The boy couldn't help thinking she was so gorgeous, the way she would put her hair back as it moved in front of her face, the smug superior face she had on; damn she was cute.  
明日香点头表示同意，两人回到售票处取回购物袋。那人友好地询问电影如何，却因明日香威胁下次使徒袭击时要用她的 EVA 摧毁影院而吓得缩成一团。真嗣赶紧拿过袋子，拉着红发女孩离开，以免那人因她的尖叫而遭受永久性听力损失。两位 EVA 驾驶员笑着讨论电影，踏上返回公寓的路途。真嗣感觉好多了，终于能和明日香愉快地共度时光，进行正常的对话。乘电梯时，他渐渐不再听她说话，只是凝视着她。她边抱怨边做着最喜欢的活动，眼中闪烁着光芒。少年忍不住想，她真是美极了，每当发丝拂过脸庞，她会将其拨回，那副得意洋洋的表情；该死，她真可爱。

The girl waved her hand in front of his face. "You there Shinji?" she asked him, noticing he had spaced out.  
女孩在他眼前挥了挥手。“你在听吗，真嗣？”她注意到他走神了。

"Yeah, I errr just… ah never mind" he replied.  
“嗯，我，呃，只是……算了”他回答道。

The two teens entered their place, closing the door behind them. The redhead sat down on the couch, while Shinji placed the bags outside Asuka's room and chucked his wallet and keys into his room. He went to the kitchen, pouring himself a drink as he had been carrying those bags all day in the blazing sun. The boy entered the living room where Asuka was laying down on the couch and she looked up at him lazily.  
两个少年走进他们的住处，关上了门。红发少女坐在沙发上，而真嗣将袋子放在明日香房间外，随手把钱包和钥匙扔进自己的房间。他走进厨房，为自己倒了一杯饮料，毕竟他在烈日下提着那些袋子走了一整天。男孩走进客厅，看到明日香正懒洋洋地躺在沙发上，她抬头看着他。

"You wanna start practising the play?" he asked her.  
“你想开始排练剧本吗？”他问她。

"Ah might as well, we don't really have anything else to do" she said, getting up.  
“也好，反正我们也没别的事可做。”她说着，站起身来。

Shinji took out their two copies of the play and handed one to Asuka. He re-read his lines just in case, but he pretty much knew them off by heart now; him knowing his lines while she didn't was a little ironic, taking into account his three-week hiatus. The redhead was studying her lines intently.  
真嗣拿出他们的两份剧本，递给明日香一份。他又重新读了一遍自己的台词，以防万一，但现在他几乎已经烂熟于心了；考虑到他那三周的缺席，他记得台词而她却不记得，这多少有些讽刺。红发女孩正专注地研究着她的台词。

"It's strange, it definitely feels like I've read this before, and I'm finishing statements in my head before I read them. I'm remembering whole chunks of the play" she commented aloud.  
"真奇怪，我确实感觉好像以前读过这个，我甚至在读之前就能在脑中完成句子。我记得剧本中的整段整段内容"她大声评论道。

"That's great, glad to see your memory is improving" he said sincerely; maybe she would remember everything.  
"那太好了，很高兴看到你的记忆力在提高"他真诚地说；也许她会记起一切。

Asuka was reading the part about the bandit fight in the night and blushed as an image of her and Shinji kissing popped into her head. _'What the hell?'_ she thought. The girl shook her head in puzzlement and continued reading.  
明日香正在阅读关于夜袭盗贼的那部分，突然脑海中浮现出她和真嗣接吻的画面，脸颊不禁泛红。'搞什么鬼？'她心想。女孩困惑地摇了摇头，继续阅读。

"Wait a second, did I read this wrong? It says here I have to kiss you" she asked, confused.  
“等等，是我理解错了吗？这里写着我要吻你”她困惑地问道。

'_Hmm, actually that's right we do have a kiss. I'll be a bit cheeky and not inform her that we're just supposed to pretend'_ Shinji thought deviously.  
“嗯，确实是有个吻戏。我就稍微调皮一下，不告诉她我们只是假装吻一下”真嗣狡黠地想道。

"No, it's true you have to" he confirmed.  
"不，你确实得这么做"他确认道。

"What? I'm not kissing you! I remember the last time and I had to clean my mouth out!" she shouted.  
"什么？我才不要亲你！我记得上次的事，我还得漱口呢！"她喊道。

"That wasn't the last time, you did it at our practice before. You had a problem back then but you got over it" he countered.  
"那不是最后一次，我们在练习前也做过。你当时有点问题，但后来克服了"他反驳道。

Asuka suddenly understood why she saw Shinji and her kissing in her mind. "I think I might talk to the teacher about this but let's start practising already, I think I can say my lines now up to that point"  
明日香突然明白为什么她脑海中会出现自己和真嗣接吻的画面。“我想我可能需要和老师谈谈这件事，但我们还是先开始练习吧，我觉得我现在可以说到那句台词了。”

And so, the two teens began practicing the play together, saying their lines and doing a few enactments. Amazingly, Asuka only stumbled a few times and they got through the beginning of the play with remarkable progress. They soon came up to the kiss and Asuka blatantly refused to go along with it.  
于是，两个少年开始一起排练戏剧，念台词并进行一些表演。令人惊讶的是，明日香只绊了几下，他们就以惊人的进度完成了戏剧的开头部分。很快到了接吻的环节，明日香直截了当地拒绝继续。

"Come on Asuka we did it before, it's not that big a deal" Shinji said, trying to convince her.  
“来吧，明日香，我们之前已经做过一次了，没什么大不了的。”真嗣说道，试图说服她。

"It certainly is a big deal! What if the main character was Kensuke? I would rather combust into flames than kiss him. The school shouldn't enforce something so stupid" Asuka refuted.  
"这当然是个大事！如果主角是健介怎么办？我宁愿自燃也不愿吻他。学校不该推行这么愚蠢的规定" 明日香反驳道。

Shinji sighed; he knew what buttons to press. "Well, it looks like the Great Asuka is afraid of kissing a little boy like me" he provoked.  
真嗣叹了口气；他知道该按哪个按钮。"好吧，看来伟大的明日香害怕吻我这样的小男孩" 他挑衅道。

He got just the reaction he wanted.  
他得到了他想要的反应。

"Oh fine, I'll do the stupid kiss!" she said, defending her pride.  
"哦好吧，我就做个愚蠢的吻吧！" 她说道，捍卫着自己的骄傲。

'_Yes!'_ Shinji thought happily, glad to get to kiss her again. He moved next to her and moved his face towards hers, then she pulled away.  
'太好了！' 真嗣开心地想，很高兴能再次吻她。他移到她身边，将脸凑向她，然后她却躲开了。

"Asuka we have to get this right. If we can't do it here, how can we do it in public?" he stated.  
"明日香，我们得把这个做好。如果在这里都做不好，那在公众场合又怎么能行呢？" 他陈述道。

Asuka sighed defeated and nodded. _'Well, I might as well use this opportunity to initiate my plan, all that acting nice today was so urghh and it's not going to be all for naught. He_ _**will**_ _tell me everything'_  
明日香叹了口气，无奈地点头。'好吧，我或许可以借此机会启动我的计划，今天装得那么好真是够了，不能白费力气。他会告诉我一切的'

He once again moved his face towards her and kissed her softly on the lips. The boy quickly wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer, deepening the kiss. He didn't realise how much he'd missed kissing her. Asuka tried her best to show the boy what she could do, finding it extremely difficult with the power of his kiss. He soon parted, realising he was dragging it out a little too long. Asuka blushed and looked at him questioningly. Her heart was racing and she had butterflies in her stomach, _'God, where did he learn to kiss like that?'_ she thought.  
他再次将脸凑近她，轻轻吻在她的唇上。男孩迅速用双臂环抱住她，将她拉得更近，加深了这个吻。他没意识到自己有多想念吻她的感觉。明日香尽力展示自己的能力，却发现他的吻力道之大让她难以招架。他很快分开了，意识到自己拖得太久了。明日香脸颊泛红，疑惑地看着他。她的心跳加速，胃里像有蝴蝶在飞，'天哪，他是在哪儿学会这么吻的？'她心想。

"W-we should keep practising" Asuka finally said, stammering. _'What's wrong with me? I never stammer!'_ she thought.  
“我、我们应该继续练习”明日香终于结结巴巴地说道。'我这是怎么了？我从不结巴的！'她心想。

"Want to try it again Asuka, so you get used to it?" Shinji asked innocently.  
"想再试一次吗，明日香，这样你就能习惯了？" 真嗣天真地问道。

Asuka was astounded, no blush, no stammer; it hadn't fazed him in the least. _'What is with this baka? How could it not have affected him?'_  
明日香震惊了，没有脸红，没有结巴；他丝毫没有受到影响。'这个笨蛋是怎么回事？怎么可能对他毫无影响？'

"Yes" she said, deciding to give it another go.  
"好的" 她决定再试一次。

This time she took the initiative and kissed him, Shinji once again deepened the kiss and Asuka wrapped her arms around him as well. The boy fought back the urge to slip in his tongue. They parted and Asuka turned her face away in embarrassment, her face was flushed and she felt a familiar slickness between her legs. She might have forgotten what happened, but her body had not; when Shinji kissed her, her body responded to it.  
这次她主动出击，吻了他，真嗣再次加深了这个吻，明日香也环抱住他。男孩强忍着伸出舌头的冲动。他们分开后，明日香羞涩地别过脸去，她的脸颊通红，感到双腿间熟悉的湿润。她或许忘记了发生的事，但她的身体没有；当真嗣吻她时，她的身体做出了反应。

_'I don't believe this! I am getting aroused from kissing Shinji'_ Asuka thought embarrassed. She looked at Shinji, who was looking at her slightly confused. _'And this baka did it so casually, what's wrong with me? Screw that, what the hell is wrong with him? This plan is completely backfiring, I need to abort now'_  
'这不可能！我居然因为吻真嗣而兴奋起来' 明日香尴尬地想。她看着真嗣，他正略带困惑地看着她。'这个笨蛋做得这么随意，我这是怎么了？管他呢，他到底怎么回事？这个计划完全搞砸了，我现在需要立刻停止'

"Asuka your face looks a bit flushed, are you ok?" he asked, concerned.  
“明日香，你的脸看起来有点红，你还好吗？”他关切地问。

Asuka thanked God Shinji was naïve sometimes, he only thought that she might be feeling a little under the weather and did not suspect anything else.  
明日香感谢上帝，有时真嗣是如此天真，他只以为她可能有点不舒服，并未怀疑其他。

"I'm fine" she said, getting up and looking away from him, attempting to calm down her body.  
“我没事。”她说着站起身，避开他的目光，试图平复自己的身体。

"Are you sure?" he asked.  
“你确定吗？”他问道。

"Yeah, just leave me alone" she snapped.  
“是啊，别管我。”她厉声说道。

"But Asuka-" he started. “但是明日香——”他开口道。

"Just fuck off!" she shouted at him furiously. Shinji just looked at her in shock as she went to her room, grabbed the shopping bags and slammed the door behind her.  
“滚开！”她愤怒地对他吼道。真嗣震惊地看着她走进房间，抓起购物袋，然后砰地一声甩上了门。

_'She really is so stubborn sometimes'_ Shinji thought.  
"'她有时候真是固执得要命' 真嗣心想。

Asuka lay down on her bed, contemplating the best course of action. _'Ok being nice and seducing him does not work, I guess I'll have to bring Asuka's reign of terror back into place. Fear might work better at getting the information out of him.'_ The girl involuntarily moved her hand down to her panties. She didn't realise until she felt something damp, _'Schiesse what am I doing? How can I be this wet?'_ She pondered whether she should relieve herself or not. Asuka could feel her sexual frustration and couldn't understand why it was so strong, on the other hand Shinji was right outside.  
明日香躺在床上，盘算着最佳行动方案。'好吧，温柔引诱他行不通，看来我得重新祭出明日香的恐怖统治了。恐惧或许更能逼他说出情报。' 女孩不由自主地将手移向内裤。直到感觉到湿润，她才意识到自己在做什么，'该死，我在干什么？怎么这么湿？' 她犹豫是否该自慰。明日香能感受到自己的性欲煎熬，却不明白为何如此强烈，另一方面，真嗣就在门外。

The redhead decided on an action, knowing she would not be able to think clearly around Shinji in her current state. She hesitantly began moving her finger up and down her slit, gasping at the pleasure. Asuka bit her lip knowing it would not be good to be discovered and stayed silent. She slowly slipped her finger in, still wondering how she had convinced herself to do this. She hastily began to move it in and out, while also stimulating her clit with her thumb. The girl pleasured herself but it wasn't good enough, she needed some arousing thoughts.  
红发女孩决定采取行动，深知以自己目前的状态无法在真嗣附近保持清醒。她犹豫地开始用手指上下抚摸自己的阴唇，因快感而轻声喘息。明日香咬着嘴唇，知道被发现就糟了，于是保持沉默。她缓缓将手指插入，仍疑惑自己是如何说服自己这么做的。她急促地来回抽动手指，同时用拇指刺激阴蒂。女孩自慰着，但感觉还不够，她需要一些挑逗的念头。

Asuka desperately tried to think of Kaji naked or something, but it just didn't work. Reluctantly, she began to think about Shinji doing the most dirty things imaginable, which for some reason easily popped into her head; little did she know they were actually her memories.  
明日香拼命试图想象加持裸体的样子，但就是不管用。无奈之下，她开始想象真嗣做着最肮脏的事情，不知为何这些画面轻易地浮现在脑海中；她不知道这些其实是她自己的记忆。

_'I can't believe I'm fantasising about Shinji to get myself off, and that it's actually working.'  
'真不敢相信我居然靠幻想真嗣来让自己兴奋，而且居然还奏效了。'_

The redhead bit down on her tongue hard as she climaxed; she would _not_ cry out for Shinji. Despite feeling a little dirty at what she had just done, she certainly felt much better than before. The girl removed her soaked panties and put on fresh ones. Asuka recomposed herself and exited her room. She walked back to the living room, finding Shinji reading over his lines. She very quickly dismissed the thought of inviting Shinji to bed with her. _'Cmon Asuka, you are always in control, do not let this stupid slip of a boy get to you!'_  
红发女孩咬紧舌头，在高潮时硬是没让自己叫出声来；她绝不会为真嗣而呼喊。尽管对自己刚才的行为感到有些不齿，但她确实感觉比之前好多了。女孩脱下湿透的内裤，换上干净的。明日香重新整理好自己，走出房间。她回到客厅，发现真嗣正在复习台词。她很快打消了邀请真嗣上床的念头。'加油，明日香，你总是掌控一切，别让这个愚蠢的小子影响你！'

"Shinji I'm hungry now, let's go have dinner" she ordered.  
"真嗣，我现在饿了，我们去吃晚饭吧" 她命令道。

Shinji looked up at her with a puzzled look, he honestly could not understand her. "You feeling better now?" he asked.  
真嗣带着困惑的表情抬头看着她，他真的无法理解她。"你现在感觉好些了吗？" 他问道。

"I was always feeling fine, now get up before I kick you out the door!" she threatened.  
"我一直都感觉很好，快起来，不然我把你踢出门去！" 她威胁道。

"Asuka-" he started. "明日香——" 他开口道。

"You are this close to becoming the next Japanese astronaut, we are going now!" she said firmly.  
"你离成为下一位日本宇航员就差这么一点了，我们现在就走！" 她坚定地说。

"Ok" he agreed and got up, knowing he could not argue with a hungry Asuka.  
"好吧" 他同意了，站起身来，知道无法与饥饿的明日香争论。

_'Good'_ Asuka thought, _'He still recognises my authority'_  
'好' 明日香心想，'他依然承认我的权威'

Shinji hastily went to his room to grab his wallet and keys. He looked through his wallet with a little despair, his money was depleting rapidly. He returned to the living room to find Asuka waiting at the door. He soon joined her and they exited the room and locked the door behind them.  
真嗣急忙回到自己的房间拿钱包和钥匙。他带着一丝绝望翻看钱包，钱正在迅速减少。他回到客厅，发现明日香已经在门口等着了。他很快加入她，两人一起走出房间并锁上了门。

"Alright Asuka follow me, I know a great place where we can eat" he invited.  
“好吧，明日香跟我来，我知道一个很棒的地方可以吃饭”他邀请道。

"Yeah right, your idea of great food is that Japanese rubbish I'm already sick of eating" she replied, unconvinced.  
“得了吧，你所谓的美食不过是那些我已经吃腻的日本垃圾。”她回答道，并不相信。

"You'll see" he said simply.  
“你会看到的。”他简单地说。

She curiously wondered where they would eat. Asuka followed Shinji out of the apartment and through the streets of Tokyo-3. The cool fresh air had a pleasant effect on the girl and she relaxed a bit. They quietly walked along, enjoying the calm atmosphere. Shinji stopped in front of a building and Asuka looked up at the sign. She read _**Bistro de Europa**_ and couldn't help smiling a little.  
她好奇地想知道他们会去哪里吃饭。明日香跟着真嗣走出了公寓，穿过东京-3 的街道。凉爽的新鲜空气让女孩感到愉悦，她稍微放松了一些。他们静静地走着，享受着宁静的氛围。真嗣在一栋建筑前停下，明日香抬头看向招牌。她读着“欧洲小馆”，不禁微微一笑。

"Well Shinji, I certainly didn't expect this" she remarked. "Isn't this a bit too expensive though?"  
“好吧，真嗣，我确实没想到会这样。”她评论道，“不过这会不会太贵了点？”

"I can afford it. Besides, you need something to cheer you up from all the stress of today, what with the re-adjusting and all" he replied.  
“我负担得起。再说了，你需要点什么来缓解今天所有的压力，毕竟重新适应这一切也不容易。”他回答道。

_'You wouldn't believe'_ she thought.  
“你不会相信的。”她心想。

"I couldn't imagine how hard it is to deal with such a big memory loss and waking up finding everything so different" he continued.  
"我无法想象处理如此巨大的记忆丧失，醒来发现一切都变得如此不同，会有多么艰难。" 他继续说道。

"Not at all! I am the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley, I can do anything" she said proudly.  
"一点没错！我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，没有什么是我做不到的。" 她自豪地说道。

They both entered the restaurant and found a table to sit down at. Shinji took two menus from the counter and sat back down at the table. They looked around the restaurant, admiring the decor. They had many paintings on the walls, many of which Asuka recognised. The windows were draped with lush red curtains and the tables and seats were elegantly crafted. Not many people were in the restaurant tonight, which was good because Asuka was not in the mood for a crowd at the moment.  
他们一起走进餐厅，找了一张桌子坐下。真嗣从柜台拿了两个菜单，回到桌前坐下。他们环顾餐厅，欣赏着装饰。墙上挂着许多画作，其中不少明日香都能认出。窗户上挂着华丽的红色窗帘，桌椅都制作得十分精致。今晚餐厅里人不多，这对明日香来说正好，因为她现在不想面对人群。

"Ok Asuka, tell me what you want and I'll order it for you" Shinji offered.  
“好的，绫波，告诉我你想吃什么，我帮你点。”真嗣提议道。

She quickly scanned the menu, not being able to decide on what to eat. There was so much European food and she hadn't eaten it for so long, it was hard to choose a meal. Asuka finally decided upon having a chicken schnitzel and roast potatoes and told Shinji her choice. A waiter came over to their table with a pen and paper, his expression a little stuck up. He had a curly black moustache and he spoke with a heavy foreign accent.  
她迅速浏览着菜单，难以决定吃什么。这里有太多欧洲菜，而她已经很久没吃过了，选择一顿饭变得困难。绫波最终决定要一份炸鸡排和烤土豆，并告诉了真嗣她的选择。一位服务员拿着笔和纸走到他们的桌前，表情略显傲慢。他留着卷曲的小胡子，说话带着浓重的外国口音。

"Make I take your order please?" the waiter requested.  
“请问我可以记录您的点单吗？”服务员询问道。

"Yes, I would like the cream and mushroom steak, rare please, and this lady would like the chicken schnitzel with roast potatoes" Shinji ordered.  
"是的，我要一份奶油蘑菇牛排，请做三分熟，这位女士要一份鸡肉炸肉排配烤土豆" 真嗣点餐道。

"Very good, would you like any drinks?" the waiter asked.  
"很好，您需要点什么饮料吗？" 服务员问道。

"Water will be fine" Shinji replied.  
"水就可以了" 真嗣回答。

The waiter walked away to give their order in.  
服务员走开去下单了。

"You know Asuka, if there's something wrong, you can tell me" the boy said sincerely.  
"你知道吗，明日香，如果有哪里不对劲，你可以告诉我" 男孩真诚地说道。

"How corny was that? Leave me alone you stupid baka! If I need your concern, I'll ask for it" she shot back immediately.  
"这话多老套啊？别烦我，你这个笨蛋！如果我需要你的关心，我会主动说的" 她立刻回敬道。

Shinji opened his mouth to say something but just sighed instead, dismissing it as her usual antics.  
真嗣张开嘴想说些什么，但最终只是叹了口气，将这归咎于她一贯的古怪行为。

"If you've got something to say, just say it" she hissed.  
“如果你有话要说，就直接说出来”她低声咆哮道。

"Says you, I don't understand why you can't just tell me what's wrong" he countered.  
“你说的倒轻巧，我真不明白你为什么不能直接告诉我哪里不对劲”他反驳道。

"Read my lips Shinji: No-thing-is-wrong. Would you just shut up about it already?" she replied, growing irritated at his constant badgering.  
“看清楚我的唇语，真嗣：没—有—任—何—问—题。你能不能别再提这事了？”她回答道，对他的不断追问感到越来越恼火。

Shinji stopped, knowing he would have no success today; for some reason she had suddenly stopped being open to him.  
真嗣停了下来，知道今天不会有任何进展；不知为何，她突然对他关闭了心扉。

A sense of relief came over her as Asuka noticed Shinji had given up. _'About fucking time! Any more and I would have punched his face in.'_  
当明日香注意到真嗣放弃了时，她感到一阵解脱。‘终于消停了！再啰嗦下去，我就要揍他了。’

They both sat in silence, patiently waiting for the food to be prepared. It didn't take long for the waiter to arrive at their table with their meals. He swiftly placed the food on their table and hurried off for the next order. Asuka dug in quickly, taking her mind off the situation and just being glad to finally eat "real" food. She grinned as she ate the potatoes, such a nice change to all the rice she had been eating. Shinji smiled as he saw her eat her food happily and dug into his own food.  
他们俩静静地坐着，耐心等待食物准备好。没过多久，服务员就端着他们的餐点来到了桌前。他迅速将食物摆上桌，又匆匆赶去处理下一单。明日香迅速开动，暂时抛开眼前的烦恼，庆幸终于能吃到“真正”的食物。她一边吃着土豆，一边露出笑容，这比起她一直吃的米饭真是太好了。真嗣看着她开心地吃着，也微笑着开始享用自己的餐点。

The two eva pilots finished their meals in no time and Asuka let out a content sigh, her stomach filled up nicely. Shinji paid for the bill and they exited the restaurant. As both of them were full, they decided to walk a little to burn off some of the food. Shinji took them up to the cliff that overlooked all of Tokyo-3. The sun had set as it had gotten late and the scene looked beautiful in the dark night.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员很快便吃完了饭，明日香满足地叹了口气，肚子填得饱饱的。真嗣结了账，两人离开了餐厅。由于都吃饱了，他们决定散散步，消耗一些食物。真嗣带她来到了俯瞰整个第三新东京市的悬崖上。太阳已经落山，天色已晚，夜幕下的景色显得格外美丽。

"So Asuka, have you re-adjusted fine?" the boy asked randomly.  
“那么，明日香，你适应得还好吗？”真嗣突然问道。

"Yeah, I'm more or less good" she replied.  
"嗯，我基本上还好" 她回答道。

"I think we should get back home" he stated.  
"我想我们应该回家了" 他陈述道。

Asuka just nodded in affirmation. The two teens made their way back along the streets of Tokyo-3 to their apartment. Both were weary from the day's activities; they had practically gone all over the whole city. When they arrived at their apartment, they took the elevator, both too exhausted to walk up the stairs. They entered their place and were greeted warmly by Misato.  
明日香只是点头表示同意。两个少年沿着东京-3 的街道返回他们的公寓。两人都因一天的活动而疲惫不堪；他们几乎走遍了整个城市。当他们到达公寓时，他们乘坐电梯，两人都太累了，不想爬楼梯。他们进入住处，受到了美里热情的迎接。

"You two were out for a while. You guys have fun today?" their guardian asked.  
"你们俩出去了一阵子。今天玩得开心吗？" 他们的监护人问道。

"Yeah" they said in unison.  
"嗯" 他们异口同声地说。

Misato for once did not notice it.  
美里这次没有注意到。

"That's good, I hope you appreciate what Shinji did. He took the day off school to re-adjust you Asuka" Misato remarked.  
"那很好，我希望你能感激真嗣所做的事。他特意请了一天假来帮你调整状态，明日香。" 美里评论道。

"Because missing school is so hard" Asuka retorted sarcastically.  
"因为逃课这么难做到似的" 明日香讽刺地反驳。

"I did carry those bags of yours all day" Shinji reminded.  
"我可是帮你拎了一整天的包" 真嗣提醒道。

"Oh?" Misato inquired. "What did you guys get up to?"  
"哦？" 美里询问道。"你们都做了些什么？"

"We did lots of stuff" Shinji started. "In summary, I showed her all around Tokyo-3 to familiarise her with all the differences. I also filled her in on her gaps in knowledge as best as I could. We also had lunch and dinner, and we practised the play… it was pretty full on" the boy explained.  
"我们做了很多事情" 真嗣开始说道。"简而言之，我带她逛遍了第三新东京市，让她熟悉所有的不同之处。我还尽可能地填补了她的知识空白。我们还一起吃了午饭和晚饭，并且排练了戏剧……真是相当充实的一天" 男孩解释道。"

"Yeah, it got me totally beat" Asuka added, yawning. "And that wasn't even everything, you forgot the movie we watched and the shopping we did"  
"是啊，我都累坏了" 明日香打着哈欠补充道。"而且那还不是全部，你忘了我们看的电影和购物了"

"I guess the shopping is where those bags Shinji mentioned came from" the older woman teased.  
"我猜购物就是那些真嗣提到的袋子的来源" 年长的女人打趣道。

"Right you are" Shinji confirmed.  
"你说得对" 真嗣确认道。

"It's a privilege to shop with me" Asuka said proudly.  
"能和我一起购物是你的荣幸" 明日香自豪地说。

"In any case, it sounds like you guys did a lot, you're probably both exhausted" Misato replied, ignoring the young girl.  
"无论如何，听起来你们做了很多事，可能都累坏了" 美里回答道，忽略了那个年轻女孩。

"Like I said earlier, I'm totally beat" the redhead agreed.  
"就像我之前说的，我完全筋疲力尽了" 红发女孩同意道。

"Me too. But Misato, are you hungry? You weren't home earlier when we went out to eat. I can make you something now?" he offered.  
"我也是。不过美里，你饿了吗？我们之前出去吃饭时你不在家。我现在可以给你做点什么吗？" 他提议道。

"Thanks for the offer Shinji, but I'm good. I ate some food already. I figured you two were busy enough" Misato answered.  
"谢谢你的好意，真嗣，但我已经吃饱了。我猜你们俩已经够忙的了。" 美里回答道。

"Sorry about that" Shinji apologised.  
"抱歉打扰了" 真嗣道歉说。

"Don't apologise baka" Asuka retorted. "And here I thought I had drilled it out of you or something. Misato's an adult, she can take care of herself"  
"别道歉了，笨蛋" 明日香反驳道。"我还以为我已经把你这习惯给纠正过来了呢。美里是个成年人，她能照顾好自己的"

"That's just who Shinji is" Misato replied, grinning, "But anyway guys, it is late. I'm not gonna keep you up if you want to rest, I'm quite sleepy myself" she finished.  
"那就是真嗣的个性" 美里笑着回答，"不过话说回来，已经很晚了。如果你们想休息，我就不打扰了，我自己也很困了" 她最后说道。

"Ok" they both replied at the same time. "Goodnight Misato!"  
"好的" 他们俩同时回答。"晚安，美里！"

"Goodnight" Misato replied.  
"晚安" 美里回答道。

The two teens nodded and went to their respective rooms. Misato switched off the lights and went to bed herself. Shinji and Asuka lay in their respective beds thinking about today. Both their plans had failed miserably. Asuka didn't manage to squeeze out one bit of information from Shinji and her plan even backfired. Shinji wasn't anywhere closer to Asuka than the start of the day. He had tried so many things, taking her shopping, taking her to the movies, to dinner, being nice to her but to no avail. The two eva pilots both sighed and went to sleep, deciding that tomorrow was another day…  
两个少年点了点头，各自回房。美里关掉灯，自己也上床睡觉。真嗣和明日香躺在各自的床上，回想着今天发生的一切。两人的计划都惨败收场。明日香没能从真嗣那里套出半点信息，甚至她的计划还适得其反。真嗣与明日香的距离并未因一天的努力而拉近。他尝试了许多方法，带她购物、看电影、共进晚餐，对她体贴入微，却毫无成效。两位 EVA 驾驶员都叹了口气，决定明天又是新的一天，便沉沉睡去……

End Notes: Asuka in this chapter is at a great disadvantage with her lost memory. Shinji's character has changed a little without her knowing or getting used to it. Shinji has a major advantage against her and she is finding it difficult to keep up, especially since he has more courage and confidence. For those of you wondering, heating fluid is a substance used to relieve muscle aches. It warms up the skin but it can cause discomfort or pain on sensitive skin like a female's private region.  
尾注：在这一章中，失去记忆的明日香处于极大的劣势。真嗣的性格在她不知情或未适应的情况下发生了些许变化。真嗣对她有着明显的优势，她发现很难跟上，特别是他现在更加勇敢和自信。对于那些好奇的人，加热液是一种用于缓解肌肉疼痛的物质。它能温暖皮肤，但对于女性私密区域这样敏感的皮肤可能会引起不适或疼痛。

Author's Notes: Not much to say here I guess. A reviewer once asked me before if I was inspired by the manga 'Re-take' and I answered no and that I hadn't even read it when I started writing this story. In any case, as always, enjoy the chapter.  
作者的话：这里似乎没什么可说的。曾有一位评论者问我是否受到漫画《Re-take》的启发，我回答说没有，而且我在开始写这个故事时甚至还没读过它。无论如何，一如既往，享受这一章吧。

Original Author's Notes: 原作者的话：

_Man this took so long to get ready, I think it's been two weeks since the last update, but I had a slight problem. First off I was being lazy, as it's getting more annoying to write this story. But then unbelievably my hardrive died. Damn I was annoyed, had to buy a new hardrive and reinstall Windows XP, which was a pain in the bum. For some reason the CD didn't have the drivers to read from the hardrive so I had to connect it so that the CD drive and hardrive where connected to the same IDE controller and the hardrive had to be master which was extremely difficult to do because of the damn ribbon cables arrgh. Anyway for those of you who are computer illiterate it took long to set it up so that I could install my operating system. Yeah reinstalling programs, transferring files takes long and eventually I finished and yeah I finished this damn chapter.  
天哪，准备这个花了太长时间，我觉得距离上次更新已经过去两周了，但我遇到了一点问题。首先，我有点懒，写这个故事越来越烦人。但接下来，难以置信的是，我的硬盘坏了。该死，我真的很恼火，不得不买了一个新硬盘并重新安装了 Windows XP，这真是麻烦透顶。出于某种原因，CD 没有驱动程序来读取硬盘，所以我不得不将它连接起来，使得 CD 驱动器和硬盘连接到同一个 IDE 控制器上，并且硬盘必须作为主盘，这非常困难，因为那该死的带状电缆，唉。总之，对于那些不太懂电脑的人来说，设置好以便安装操作系统花了很长时间。是的，重新安装程序、转移文件很费时，最终我完成了，是的，我完成了这个该死的章节。_

_On another note while the hardrive was dead I killed the 50 million health boss called Yiazmat in Final Fantasy 12. Before you say anything I will say the damage cap is 9999 and because square enix wanted him to take even longer at half health the damage cap becomes 6999. Took me about 4 and a half hours to down him, now it took me 45 minutes to kill penance in Final Fantasy 10, so yeah I'm telling you this guy was a bitch. And what's even better for killing him you get the ultimate sword, but guess what you already killed the hardest boss in the game so its fucken useless. I hope in future Final Fantasy's this does not happen again, a 4 and a half hour boss only proves patience and the ability to stay sane.  
另一方面，虽然硬盘挂了，但我还是在最终幻想 12 中击败了拥有 5000 万生命值的 Boss——耶扎玛特。在你说什么之前，我要先声明伤害上限是 9999，而因为史克威尔艾尼克斯想让他半血时战斗时间更长，伤害上限降到了 6999。我花了大约四个半小时才把他打倒，相比之下，最终幻想 10 中的审判之光我只用了 45 分钟就解决了，所以没错，我得说这家伙真是个麻烦。更讽刺的是，击败他后你得到了终极之剑，但猜怎么着，你已经打败了游戏中最难的 Boss，这把剑就变得毫无用处了。希望未来的最终幻想系列不会再有这样的情况，一个需要四个半小时的 Boss 只能证明玩家的耐心和保持理智的能力。_

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 12 (First rewrite - though it's practically the same as the first version).  
附注：这是重写的第 12 章（第一次重写——虽然实际上和初版几乎一样）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 12: Asuka's Counterattack  
第 12 章：明日香的反击

_She was walking along the streets of Tokyo-3 early in the morning; early enough that school hadn't started, but late enough that people were driving their cars to work. The redhead looked up at the old rundown building, wondering how anyone could live here, but then this was Rei after all. The redhead sighed frustrated; if he wasn't here, she wouldn't know where else to look. She began to walk up the stairs, calling out his name. There was no response as she continued to climb the stairs to her destination. She decided to call his name out a bit louder…  
她一大早漫步在第三新东京市的街头；早到学校尚未开始上课，但晚到人们已驱车上班。红发女孩抬头望向那座破旧不堪的建筑，疑惑怎么会有人住在这里，但毕竟这是绫波。红发女孩沮丧地叹了口气；如果他不在这里，她真不知道还能去哪儿找。她开始走上楼梯，呼唤着他的名字。没有回应，她继续攀登至目的地。她决定再大声点呼喊他的名字……_

"SHINJI!" Asuka shouted as she woke up.  
“真嗣！”明日香醒来时喊道。

The young teen looked around in confusion, slowly realising she was back in her room. The morning light was shining through her blinds and she was sitting up in her bed, her hand clutching her head. _'Just a dream? Or something else? It felt familiar…'_ However, the redhead's thoughts were interrupted as her door opened and in came the boy whose name had just been called.  
年轻的少年困惑地环顾四周，慢慢意识到自己回到了房间。晨光透过百叶窗洒进来，她坐在床上，手捂着头。‘只是个梦？还是别的什么？感觉很熟悉……’然而，红发女孩的思绪被开门声打断，进来的正是刚刚被呼唤名字的男孩。

"What do you want Asuka?" he asked, a little puzzled.  
“你想要什么，明日香？”他问道，略感困惑。

_'Shit, did I scream that out loud?'_ she thought.  
“该死，我是不是真的喊出来了？”她心想。

Asuka looked at him blankly as he stood there patiently waiting. She had to say something quick before she looked like an idiot, calling him to her room for no reason was just stupid and she knew Shinji would start thinking something perverted.  
明日香面无表情地看着他，他则耐心地站在那里等待。她必须尽快说些什么，否则看起来就像个白痴，无缘无故叫他来房间简直是愚蠢，而且她知道真嗣会开始想些下流的事情。

"Make me breakfast in bed" was the first thing that came to mind.  
"让我在床上吃早餐" 是第一个浮现在脑海的想法。

He arched an eyebrow at her.  
他挑了挑眉毛看着她。

"Well?" she asked, irritated.  
"那么？" 她不耐烦地问。

"Fine Asuka" he said as he walked out.  
“好的，明日香。”他说着走了出去。

The girl fell back onto her bed and sighed in relief. She turned on her side to look around the room while she waited. The redhead noticed the large pile of dirty clothes near her bed. It seemed like she had been letting her laundry accumulate a bit. Not wanting to run out of clothes, she decided to take her dirty clothes to the laundry herself. Upon picking up her pile of clothes, something fell to the floor. Asuka sighed and dropped the bundle of garments to pick up the object; it was a piece of paper. She looked at it closely to examine it.  
女孩向后倒在床上，松了一口气。她侧过身来环顾房间，等待着。红发女孩注意到床边的一大堆脏衣服。看来她已经积攒了一些衣物。不想没衣服穿，她决定自己把脏衣服拿去洗。拿起那堆衣服时，有东西掉到了地上。明日香叹了口气，放下衣服去捡那件物品；那是一张纸。她仔细查看，想要辨认清楚。

_**This certificate of good community service is presented to:  
此社区服务良好证明授予：**_

_**Sohryu Asuka Langley 惣流·明日香·兰格雷**_

_**Signed: Tamako Yuji, Principle of Tokyo-3 high school  
签名：东京-3 高校校长 环悠二**_

_'Community service? What a load of crock, I've never done something for another person at school, well not really anyway'_ she thought.  
‘社区服务？真是胡扯，我在学校从没为别人做过什么，好吧，确实没有’她心想。


_**Asuka and Shinji were standing up in the middle of class.  
明日香和真嗣在课堂上站了起来。**_

_**"I'd like to give a special thanks to you Miss Sohryu, it's not everyday people act courageously for others, especially when there is a personal cost to themselves" the principal praised.  
“我想特别感谢你，惣流小姐，不是每天都有人为了别人勇敢行事，尤其是在自己要付出代价的时候。”校长赞扬道。**_

_**"I accept your gratitude sir" Asuka responded.  
“我接受您的感谢，先生。”明日香回应道。**_

_**"I didn't come here just to give nice words, I'd like to give you something for your efforts" the principal continued.  
"我来这里不仅仅是为了说些好听的话，我想为你的努力给予一些实质性的奖励。" 校长继续说道。**_

_**He held up a piece of paper and handed it to Asuka. She examined it briefly; it was a certificate for good community service.  
他举起一张纸递给明日香。她迅速看了一眼；这是一张优秀社区服务证书。**_

_**"I rarely give these out, only when a student does something special. This is quite a special certificate; when applying for a job, people will recognise this and your chances of getting employed are much higher" the principal explained.  
"我很少颁发这些证书，只有在学生做出特别贡献时才会授予。这是一张非常特别的证书；在求职时，人们会认可这一点，你的就业机会将大大增加。" 校长解释道。**_

_**"I thank you very much sir" Asuka thanked.  
“非常感谢您，先生。”明日香致谢道。**_


The redhead shook her head slightly as she returned from her short flashback. The girl could see that she had been given the certificate by the principal, however she couldn't remember what for. _'I'll ask Shinji about this'_ she thought as she placed the slip of paper on her desk. She got back into bed, deciding she would take her clothes to the laundry another time as Shinji was probably almost finished making breakfast for her. Asuka lay idly under her covers, pondering what she could have possibly forgotten; it seemed a lot had happened in the last few months that she couldn't remember. _'Well regardless, Shinji is definitely hiding something and today I will initiate Plan B'_  
红发女孩轻轻摇了摇头，从短暂的闪回中回过神来。她能看到自己被校长颁发了证书，却不记得是为了什么。‘待会儿问问真嗣吧’，她想着，将那张纸条放在桌上，然后重新躺回床上，决定改天再把衣服送去洗衣房，毕竟真嗣可能已经快为她准备好早餐了。明日香懒洋洋地躺在被窝里，思索着自己可能遗忘了什么；过去几个月似乎发生了许多她记不起来的事。‘无论如何，真嗣肯定隐瞒了什么，今天我得启动 B 计划’

Shinji came back into her room holding a tray laden with food and set it down in front of her to eat. _'Well, he really made it. I've got to use my authority over him to my advantage'_ Asuka thought. She immediately began filling her empty stomach. The boy just watched her in amazement, wondering how she could eat so fast, her hands were moving faster than the eyes could see.  
真嗣端着满满一盘食物回到她的房间，放在她面前让她享用。‘看来他真的做了，我得利用对他的影响力为自己谋利’明日香心想。她立刻开始填满自己空空的肚子。男孩只是惊奇地看着她，好奇她怎么能吃得这么快，她的手速快得让人眼花缭乱。

"What are you still doing here?" Asuka asked him through mouthfuls of food.  
"你还在这里做什么？" 明日香边吃边问他。

"Well seeing as you couldn't be bothered to get out of bed to have breakfast, I figured you wouldn't take your empty tray back to the kitchen either" he replied, slightly annoyed.  
"既然你连起床吃早餐都嫌麻烦，我想你也不会费心把空盘子拿回厨房的。" 他略带不悦地回答。

"If you're just gonna stand there, make yourself useful and take my dirty clothes to the laundry" she said, smirking.  
"如果你只是站在那里，那就做点有用的事，帮我把脏衣服拿到洗衣房去。" 她带着一丝得意的笑容说。

"Anything else your highness?" he asked sarcastically.  
"还有别的吩咐吗，殿下？" 他讽刺地问道。

"Not at the moment, so hop to it!" she commanded.  
"暂时没有了，那就快去吧！" 她命令道。

The boy walked over to her pile of dirty clothing and picked it up. He exited Asuka's room, carrying his hoard as he headed to the laundry. As Shinji entered the laundry, he dumped her clothes onto the now bigger pile of clothing to be washed. He sighed and then turned around to return to the girl's room. He found the redhead just finishing her meal as he arrived at her room.  
男孩走过去，拿起她那堆脏衣服。他带着这堆东西离开了明日香的房间，朝洗衣房走去。当真嗣进入洗衣房时，他把她的衣服倒在了已经更大的待洗衣物堆上。他叹了口气，然后转身回到女孩的房间。当他到达她的房间时，发现红发女孩刚刚吃完饭。

"Oh just in time, here you go third child" she said, handing the now empty tray to the boy.  
"哦，正好赶上，给你，三娃" 她说着，将现在已经空了的托盘递给了男孩。

He took it grudgingly and turned around to exit her room.  
他勉强接过，转身准备离开她的房间。

"Come back when you're done, I need to ask you something Ikari" she said as he walked out of her room.  
"完成后再回来，我有事要问你，碇" 他走出她的房间时，她这样说道。

Shinji went to the kitchen and placed the tray in the sink. All was silent except for the occasional snore that came from Misato's room. The morning rays had begun to warm up the apartment as Shinji stood there idly. He quietly thought about this morning, he had gotten up early and began to start preparing breakfast when he heard Asuka shout out his name. It was strange though, he couldn't recall Asuka ever calling him to her room just to make her breakfast in bed. But then again, the redhead was always unpredictable. The male eva pilot decided he should return to her room to see what she wanted of him.  
真嗣走进厨房，将托盘放在水槽里。四周一片寂静，只有偶尔从美里房间传来的鼾声。晨光开始温暖整个公寓，真嗣无所事事地站在那里。他静静地回想着今早的事，他早早起床开始准备早餐，这时听到明日香喊他的名字。虽然奇怪，但他不记得明日香曾叫他去她房间只是为了做早餐。不过话说回来，红发女孩总是难以预测。这位男性 EVA 驾驶员决定应该回到她房间看看她想要什么。

Shinji entered her room to find her waiting for him with her arms folded across her chest. Asuka looked up at him when he entered her room and pointed to her desk.  
真嗣进入她的房间，发现她正双手交叉在胸前等着他。明日香在他进屋时抬头看向他，指了指她的书桌。

"See that slip of paper on my desk, I found it this morning. I want you to tell me how in the hell I received it" she demanded.  
“看到我桌上的那张纸条了吗，我今早发现的。我要你告诉我，我到底是怎么收到它的”，她要求道。

Curiously, Shinji moved over to her desk to pick up the slip of paper and examine it. He recognised it soon enough as the certificate she was given after having saved him from drowning in the pool. He had forgotten about that incident and so hadn't brought it up with Asuka yesterday. The boy decided he might as well tell her; she could easily find out at school anyway.  
好奇之下，真嗣走到她的桌旁拿起那张纸条仔细端详。他很快认出这是她在泳池救他后获得的证书。那次事件他早已遗忘，所以昨天也没向明日香提起。男孩决定还是告诉她吧；她很容易在学校里发现的。

"Well, you were given that by the principal after you saved me" he answered.  
“嗯，那是校长在你救了我之后给你的”他回答道。

"I saved you? What could little boy Shinji possibly have gotten himself into that required my help?" she asked, bemused.  
“我救了你？小男孩真嗣能遇到什么需要我帮忙的事呢？”她带着几分戏谑问道。

"We had swimming lessons and I was pushed into the deep end and began to start drowning as I couldn't swim, you rescued me" he explained.  
"我们上了游泳课，我被推到深水区，因为我不会游泳，我开始溺水，是你救了我" 他解释道。

"Trust you. But why would _I_ dive in to save you, there were other people around weren't there?" she queried.  
"相信你。但为什么我会跳进去救你，周围不是还有其他人吗？" 她质疑道。

"Well yes, but everyone except you thought I was pretending that I couldn't swim. And so, you did the honourable thing and jumped in to pull me out" he clarified.  
"嗯，是的，但除了你，所有人都以为我在假装不会游泳。所以，你做了件高尚的事，跳进水里把我拉了出来" 他澄清道。

Shinji decided to leave out the details that she had practically stripped to save him and that she had done mouth to mouth resuscitation because he wasn't breathing.  
真嗣决定不提她为了救他几乎脱光衣服，以及她进行了口对口人工呼吸因为他当时没有呼吸这些细节。

"Still, diving into a pool when we are having swimming lessons isn't hard even if it is to pull someone up to the surface. I mean if we were already in our swimming costumes it would be easy. How is that worthy of community service?" she continued, not entirely convinced.  
“不过，在游泳课上跳进泳池救人并不难，即使是为了把某人拉上水面。我的意思是，如果我们已经穿上了泳衣，那就更简单了。这怎么能算是社区服务呢？”她继续说道，并没有完全被说服。

"…"

"There's something you're not telling me Shinji, don't make me pound the crap out of you" she threatened, raising her fist menacingly.  
"有些事你没告诉我，真嗣，别逼我把你揍得满地找牙。" 她威胁道，恶狠狠地举起了拳头。

"Umm well, you saved my life after all, so it is worth-" he started.  
"嗯，好吧，毕竟你救了我的命，所以值得——" 他开口道。

"Third child! I don't want any bullshit! I swear I'll make sure you won't be able to have children if you don't tell me what you're hiding" she shouted.  
"第三适格者！我不想听废话！我发誓，如果你不告诉我你在隐瞒什么，我会让你这辈子都别想有孩子。" 她吼道。

"Ok fine… I'll tell you. The problem was that we both had our school uniforms on, we weren't in our swimming costumes. I was too heavy for you to pull up with your uniform as well so you stripped down to your underwear in front of the whole class and jumped in to save me" he admitted.  
"好吧好吧……我告诉你。问题在于我们都穿着校服，没有换上泳装。你穿着校服拉我太重了，所以你在全班面前脱到只剩内衣，跳进水里救我" 他坦白道。

"WHAT!" she snapped. "什么！" 她厉声道。

"You didn't hear what I said?" he asked, confused.  
"你没听清我说的话吗？" 他困惑地问。

"It's not that! I just don't believe it. There's no way I'd do that to save your sorry ass! Maybe, and that's a BIG maybe, if there was no one around I would, but in front of the whole class?" she replied, unable to comprehend what her past self was thinking.  
"不是那样的！我只是不敢相信。为了救你那可怜的屁股，我绝不会那么做！也许，那是一个非常大的也许，如果周围没人的话我可能会，但在全班面前？" 她回答道，无法理解过去的自己是怎么想的。

The situation was getting out of hand so Shinji improvised a little. "Well… you said that you weren't gonna let me die on you when you still needed someone to prove their skill in eva piloting to, especially because Rei wasn't anything to compare against. You also said that we were even now since I saved you in the volcano and that I was lucky that Sohryu Asuka Langley never keeps anyone in debt, otherwise you wouldn't have done it"  
情况变得难以控制，于是真嗣临时想了个办法。"嗯……你说过不会让我在你还需要证明 eva 驾驶技术的时候死去，尤其是因为丽没有任何可比性。你还说过，自从我在火山中救了你，我们就算扯平了，因为惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不欠任何人情，否则你也不会这么做。"

_'Wow'_ he thought _'That actually sounded genuine and plausible'_  
'哇' 他想 '这听起来居然真实可信'

Asuka nodded slightly at his explanation. "Hmm that makes sense, I guess you must have caught me in a good mood. Still, I hope none of those perverted boys took pictures or anything. Man, that must have been embarrassing and just to save _you_. What happened to me in all this time, honestly" she said, finally relenting.  
明日香对他的解释微微点头。“嗯，这么说有道理，我猜你一定是碰上了我心情好的时候。不过，希望那些变态男生没拍什么照片之类的。天哪，那一定很尴尬，只是为了救你。这段时间我到底经历了什么，老实说。”她终于松口说道。

Shinji hid his sigh of relief. "So Asuka, you need anything else?" he asked, trying to change the subject.  
真嗣掩饰住松了一口气的叹息。“那么，明日香，你还需要什么吗？”他试图转移话题。

"No nothing, you can go now" she said, dismissing him with her hand.  
“不用了，你可以走了。”她挥手打发他离开。

The brown-haired boy walked out of her room, closing the door behind him. Asuka was delighted she had been successful in obtaining some information from him. It proved that, first of all, he still obeyed her and, second, that she could pressure information out of him that he was hiding. _'With a little work, I can find out what everyone is keeping from me, after all no one can stand up to the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley! I guess this means plan B is working for the moment'_ she thought. Content for the moment, the redhead decided to take a little nap.  
棕发男孩走出了她的房间，随手关上了门。明日香对此感到高兴，因为她成功地从他那里获取了一些信息。这证明了两点：首先，他仍然服从她；其次，她能够逼问出他隐藏的信息。'只要稍加努力，我就能发现每个人都在对我隐瞒什么，毕竟没有人能抵挡伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！看来计划 B 目前正在奏效'她心想。心满意足的明日香决定小憩一会儿。


_**Just outside the classroom, a blue haired girl came up to them to confront them before they could enter. The first child had a strange look on her face, however seemed focused on Shinji. Asuka raised her eyebrow at Rei questioningly.  
就在教室外，一个蓝发女孩走上前来，在他们进入之前拦住了他们。第一个孩子脸上带着奇怪的表情，但似乎专注于真嗣。明日香疑惑地对绫波皱起了眉头。**_

_**"Shinji… I heard about the incident yesterday and…" Rei started.  
“真嗣……我听说了昨天的事故……”绫波开口道。**_

_**The blue haired girl went over to and embraced Shinji. The boy was completely shocked at her display and stood there dumbly. Breaking out of his momentary shock, Shinji returned her affection and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her back. The redhead frowned slightly but said nothing.  
蓝发女孩走过去拥抱了真嗣。男孩对她的举动完全震惊，呆立在那里。从短暂的震惊中回过神来，真嗣回应了她的感情，伸出双臂回抱她。红发女孩微微皱眉，但什么也没说。**_

_**"I… I am very thankful you are still alive" Rei continued.  
“我……我很感激你还活着。”绫继续说道。**_


'_Weird… why am I remembering this? Perhaps this was after the drowning incident… do those two like each other now?'_ the girl thought sleepily before dozing off.  
“奇怪……我为什么记得这个？也许这是溺水事件之后的事……他们现在互相喜欢吗？”女孩困倦地想着，然后睡着了。

Shinji on the other hand was alone in the kitchen preparing his own breakfast. He quietly contemplated how he would get through school on Monday. With Asuka's memory loss, she wouldn't remember many things that had occurred recently. Also, if she were to ask about the drowning incident at school, all details of the event would be disclosed. If she found out he was hiding more information, it wouldn't be good. There had to be a way to avoid any type of confrontation regarding the past for now. The situation was becoming increasingly difficult for Shinji; he not only had to try and get back together with Asuka, but on top of that he had to lie about and hide certain events of the past.  
另一方面，真嗣独自在厨房准备自己的早餐。他静静地思考着周一如何应对学校的生活。由于明日香失去了记忆，她不会记得最近发生的许多事情。而且，如果她在学校问起溺水事件，所有细节都会被揭露。如果她发现他在隐瞒更多信息，那就不好了。目前必须设法避免任何关于过去的对峙。情况对真嗣来说变得越来越困难；他不仅要努力与明日香重归于好，还要隐瞒和隐藏过去的一些事件。

_'It seems she's really trying to pry information out of me too, but I can't tell her what happened between us and now I'm kinda hoping she doesn't remember it… at least not yet. As much as that's the easy way out for me, I know now it wouldn't even work. She's not ready to consider a relationship with me, besides it's not fair to her'_ he thought.  
“看来她真的在试图从我这里套取信息，但我不能告诉她我们之间发生了什么，现在我甚至有点希望她不要记得……至少暂时不要。尽管这对我是逃避的简单方法，但我知道这根本行不通。她还没准备好考虑与我的关系，而且这对她也不公平。”他心想。

The boy finished preparing breakfast and sat down at the dining table to begin eating it. He considered for a moment whether he should wake up Misato and make her breakfast as well, but lost his resolve when he heard a rather loud snore come from her room. As Shinji ate his breakfast, he wondered what a direct approach to Asuka might do; if he flat out told her he liked or loved her, what would she do? She would probably get suspicious rather than believe it to be genuine at this point in time. No, he had to wait to reveal his feelings.  
男孩准备好了早餐，坐到餐桌前开始享用。他犹豫了一会儿是否该叫醒美里，也给她做份早餐，但听到她房间里传来的响亮鼾声后，便打消了这个念头。一边吃着早餐，真嗣一边思索着直接向明日香表白会有什么后果；如果他直截了当地告诉她自己喜欢或爱她，她会怎么做？她大概会怀疑而非相信这是真心的。不，他得等待时机再表露心迹。

The male eva pilot finished his breakfast, placing his dish in the sink before returning in front of Asuka's room. Shinji decided he would ask her what she wanted to do today, as he didn't really have a plan for the present day. He knocked on her door, quietly waiting for a response. After a while, the boy opened her door curiously to see why the redhead wasn't responding. He looked into her room and saw her still figure on the bed; she had fallen asleep. He watched her for a while, loving the peaceful look she had on her face when she slept, breathing in and out softly. Another feeling started to rise up inside him, his bodily desires reacting to the sight of his beloved; God how he wanted her. To add to all Shinji's problems, he also had to control and restrain himself from pouncing onto her.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员吃完早餐，将餐具放入水槽后，又回到了明日香的房间前。真嗣决定问问她今天想做什么，因为他自己并没有什么计划。他轻轻敲了敲门，静静等待回应。过了一会儿，男孩好奇地推开门，想知道为什么红发女孩没有反应。他向房间内望去，看到她依旧躺在床上，已经睡着了。他凝视了她一会儿，喜欢她睡觉时脸上那平静的表情，呼吸轻柔。另一种感觉开始在他内心升起，他的身体欲望因看到心爱的人而反应；天啊，他多么渴望她。除了真嗣的所有问题，他还必须控制自己，不让自己扑向她。

Shinji quickly calmed himself down, but he knew he had to relieve the sexual tension just to make it more bearable for him. He sighed and tore his face away from the girl. The boy exited Asuka's room quietly and went over to his. Shinji entered his room and closed the door behind him. He sat down on his bed and listened for any noise. Both roommates were asleep and so he unzipped his pants.  
真嗣迅速让自己冷静下来，但他知道他需要释放一下性紧张，以便让自己更能忍受。他叹了口气，把目光从女孩身上移开。男孩悄悄离开明日香的房间，走向自己的房间。真嗣进入房间，关上门。他坐在床上，倾听任何声响。两位室友都睡着了，于是他解开了裤子拉链。

He ran his hand up and down his cock, getting it erect. The boy smiled slightly as he began to think about Asuka, remembering what had happened the day before she rescued him from drowning; his member had received _much_ attention from the girl that time. He grunted a little with the exertion of moving his hand up and down his shaft. Shinji was smiling blissfully, as his relief got closer and closer. Suddenly, his door opened and in walked Asuka. Her eyes bulged as she saw what he was doing and he quickly covered himself, his face blushing a very deep shade of red.  
他用手上下撸动着自己的阴茎，使其勃起。男孩微微一笑，开始想起明日香，回忆起她救他溺水前一天发生的事情；那次他的阴茎得到了女孩的不少关注。他随着手上下移动的动作微微哼了一声。真嗣正幸福地微笑着，因为他的解脱越来越近。突然，他的门开了，明日香走了进来。她的眼睛瞪得大大的，看到他在做什么，他迅速遮住自己，脸颊涨得通红。

"Um… hi Asuka" he said weakly.  
“呃……嗨，明日香。”他虚弱地说道。

"HENTAI!" she screamed and slammed the door shut. The redhead turned around to scream through the door. "That is so disgusting, what the hell is wrong with you?! You've mentally scarred me for the rest of my life!"  
“变态！”她尖叫着猛地关上门。红发女孩转过身来，对着门大喊。“太恶心了，你到底怎么回事？！你让我这辈子都留下了心理阴影！”

"You were supposed to be asleep!" Shinji shouted back.  
"你应该已经睡着了！" 真嗣回喊道。

"I don't care. If you are ever going to do something so gross, make sure you are alone first!" she refuted.  
"我不在乎。如果你要做这么恶心的事，先确保你一个人！" 她反驳道。

"YOU should knock on my door first!" he retorted.  
"你才应该先敲我的门！" 他反驳道。

He got her there; she couldn't go back on what she had said yesterday with the shower incident and so she stayed silent.  
他确实抓住了她的把柄；昨天淋浴事件后她说过的话无法收回，所以她保持沉默。

"Anymore 'wise' comments from the Great Asuka?" he mocked.  
“伟大的明日香还有更多‘智慧’的评论吗？”他嘲讽道。

It took all her will to restrain herself from storming through the door and beating the living hell out of him. She was however surprised at his size, despite his perverted actions and how much she disliked Shinji, she had to admit he was certainly large enough. The girl furrowed her brow; just yesterday she was helping herself while Shinji was in the other room. She didn't like being a hypocrite, so she sighed and faced his door once more.  
她竭尽全力克制自己冲进门去把他打得半死不活的冲动。然而，尽管他的行为令人厌恶，她对真嗣的反感也颇深，但她不得不承认他的体型确实不小。女孩皱起眉头；就在昨天，真嗣在另一个房间时，她还在自顾自地忙活。她不喜欢自相矛盾，所以她叹了口气，再次面对他的房门。

"You done yet?" she asked.  
"你好了吗？" 她问道。

She could almost feel Shinji's blush.  
她几乎能感觉到真嗣的脸红。

"Yeah, I'm done" he answered.  
"嗯，我好了" 他回答道。

She opened the door cautiously and found him sitting on his bed, avoiding her gaze.  
她小心翼翼地打开门，发现他坐在床上，避开了她的目光。

"I didn't mean to interrupt your morning ritual, it's none of my business so let's just drop the matter" she said, wanting to get past this as quickly as possible.  
“我不是有意打断你的晨间仪式，这跟我无关，我们还是别提这事了”，她想尽快结束这个话题。

Shinji nodded, slightly relieved.  
真嗣点点头，稍感宽慰。

Asuka moved up to him and slapped him hard across the cheek. "But make sure this NEVER happens again, you got it?"  
明日香走上前，狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。“但确保这种事再也不会发生，明白吗？”

The boy just nodded again, while nursing his red cheek.  
男孩只是再次点头，同时揉着发红的脸颊。

"Anyway, what I originally planned to do was ask you what we were going to do today" she explained.  
“总之，我原本打算问你今天我们要做什么”，她解释道。

He looked up at her with an almost amused expression on his face. "I was going to ask you the exact same thing" he said, grinning.  
他抬头看着她，脸上几乎带着一丝戏谑的表情。“我正想问你同样的问题呢。”他笑着说。

"Get your mind out of the gutter already!" she said slapping him once more, not liking the way he was smiling. "You can fantasise about Rei later!" she exclaimed, recalling the girl hugging Shinji.  
“别老想那些乱七八糟的！”她再次拍了他一下，不喜欢他那种笑容。“你可以晚点再幻想丽！”她喊道，回想起女孩拥抱真嗣的情景。

"I wasn't fantasising about Rei" he muttered, nursing his cheek once again; how many times did she need to hit him?  
“我没有在幻想丽。”他咕哝着，再次揉着脸颊；她到底还要打他多少次？

Asuka heard him and looked at him curiously. "Oh really? Who then?"  
明日香听到他的话，好奇地看着他。“哦，真的吗？那会是谁呢？”

"It's not important" he replied, avoiding the question.  
“这不重要”他回答道，避开了这个问题。

"Don't try to evade the question! Don't get the wrong idea here, I couldn't care less about your perverted mind, but I need to know who to warn of your advance" she said, smirking.  
“别想逃避问题！别误会了，我对你的变态心理毫无兴趣，但我需要知道该警告谁提防你的接近。”她带着一丝嘲笑说道。

Shinji wasn't totally dumb; he knew she was curious because it wasn't Rei, but he didn't think it wise to mention he was thinking about the person standing in front of him.  
真嗣并不完全傻；他知道她好奇是因为那不是丽，但他认为提到他正在思考站在面前的人并不明智。

"Answering your previous question, we could finish practising the play and-" he started.  
"回答你之前的问题，我们可以完成排练这部剧——"他开始说道。

"Honestly third child you're asking to get severely injured, now spill or you'll wish you were never born" she demanded.  
"老实说，第三适格者，你这是在自找重伤，现在快说，否则你宁愿自己从未出生"她命令道。

He momentarily considered saying Misato, but thought better of it. He knew he couldn't say Hikari, Asuka already knew he didn't like her that way and there really weren't any other girls he knew.  
他短暂地考虑过说 Misato，但转念一想还是放弃了。他知道他不能说 Hikari，Asuka 已经知道他不喜欢她那种方式，而且他真的没有其他认识的女孩了。

_'Well, what's she gonna do? She'll scream at me about being a pervert and that I'm not worthy, which is better than anything Asuka has planned for me if I don't say anything'_ he thought.  
“好吧，她会怎么做？她会对我大喊大叫，说我是个变态，我不配，这总比 Asuka 计划好的如果我不说什么要好。”他心想。

"It's you. I was fantasising about you, so can we drop this already" he said quietly.  
“是你。我刚才在幻想你，所以我们能别再提这个了吗？”他轻声说道。

She looked at him surprised. Though when she thought about it, she was a pretty girl and a part of almost everything in his life, including home life and NERV. In light of this, her actions yesterday now made more sense to her; it was just because she had so much contact with him is all.  
她惊讶地看着他。不过仔细一想，她确实是个相当漂亮的女孩，几乎参与了他生活中的方方面面，包括家庭生活和 NERV。这么看来，她昨天的行为现在对她来说更有意义了；只是因为她和他接触太多罢了。

"Well I _am_ the most beautiful girl in Tokyo-3 after all, at least you have good taste. However, you keep all those perverted thoughts in your head because it ain't ever going to happen" she said, sneering at him.  
“好吧，我毕竟是第三新东京市最漂亮的女孩，至少你的品味还不错。不过，你还是把那些变态的想法留在脑子里吧，因为这永远不可能发生。”她嘲讽地对他说。

Shinji just rolled his eyes up at the ceiling in response.  
真嗣只是翻了翻白眼，抬头看向天花板作为回应。

Without warning, Asuka brought her hand down to his face and traced his jaw line. To say Shinji was shocked was an understatement.  
毫无预警地，明日香将手伸向他的脸庞，沿着他的下颌线轻轻划过。说真嗣感到震惊都算是轻描淡写了。

"And how do I behave in your fantasy?" she said seductively.  
“在你的幻想中，我又是如何表现的呢？”她挑逗地说道。

Shinji's face burned bright red as she sat on his lap and caressed his face.  
真嗣的脸颊因她的坐膝和抚摸而变得通红。

"A-Asuka, what are you doing?" he asked softly.  
"A-明日香，你在做什么？" 他轻声问道。

"What's wrong Shinji? You don't want me now? I can be _very_ pleasing" she continued.  
"怎么了，真嗣？你现在不想要我了吗？我可以很讨人喜欢的" 她继续说道。

"B-but-" he started, stammering; he couldn't understand what had gotten into her.  
"但——" 他开始结巴；他无法理解她怎么突然变成这样了。

"You do like me, right?" she asked coquettishly.  
"你确实喜欢我，对吧？" 她娇嗔地问道。

"Y-yes of c-course, but-" he attempted, he needed to get back in control of the situation.  
"是-是的，当然，但是——" 他试图说，他需要重新掌控局面。

"Did you already forget what happened between us?" she interrupted.  
"你已经忘了我们之间发生的事了吗？" 她打断道。

"No, I mean… well um…" he replied, unsure exactly what she was referring to.  
“不，我是说……呃，嗯……”他回答道，不太确定她指的是什么。

"What happened between us?" she asked curiously.  
“我们之间发生了什么？”她好奇地问道。

"We had-" Shinji started, before stopping. He could see the girl had dropped her mask and he realised he was being played. He regained his composure, wondering how he could fall for such a cheap trick. Probably because he had been musing about telling her his feelings directly earlier and he had just been fantasising about her. His heart had grasped onto that small glimmer of hope that maybe she was being genuine, but clearly, she was just trying to manipulate him; at least now he knew what she was willing to try and how aggressively she was pursuing her goal. It also didn't help that he was incredibly anxious, holding himself back so he wouldn't jump on Asuka.  
“我们有过——”真嗣开口道，随即停了下来。他看到女孩放下了面具，意识到自己被耍了。他恢复了镇定，想知道怎么会中了这么低级的圈套。大概是因为他之前一直在想直接告诉她自己的感情，而且他刚刚还在幻想她。他的心抓住了那一丝微弱的希望，也许她是真心的，但显然，她只是在试图操纵他；至少现在他知道了她愿意尝试的手段以及她追求目标的积极程度。再加上他极度焦虑，克制自己不扑向明日香，这也无济于事。

"Look Asuka, I've told you everything I can think of. Stop this constant prying already" he said calmly.  
"看，明日香，我能想到的都告诉你了。别再这样不停地追问了" 他平静地说道。

Asuka looked at him shocked, which soon turned to anger. "Well at least you're smart enough to realise that I would never _ever_ do something like this with you" she spat, before jumping off his lap as if it were hot coals. She turned to face him, "But don't lie Ikari, you _are_ hiding something. _Something_ happened between us two, but you won't tell me and I don't know why"  
明日香震惊地看着他，随即转为愤怒。"至少你还算聪明，知道我绝不会和你做这种事" 她厉声说道，然后像避开烫手山芋一样从他腿上跳开。她转身面对他，"但别撒谎，碇，你在隐瞒什么。我们之间发生了什么，但你就是不说，我也不明白为什么"

"Are you DEAF? There is nothing to tell, I already said I told you everything" he shot back.  
"你聋了吗？没什么可说的，我已经说了都告诉你了" 他反驳道。

"What about the stupid swimming pool incident?" she countered.  
"那次愚蠢的泳池事件呢？" 她反问道。

"I had simply FORGOTTEN. Though in the end it wasn't that important right?" he explained.  
"我只是忘记了。不过最终那也没那么重要，对吧？" 他解释道。

"So, you've also _conveniently_ 'forgotten' what happened between us as well?" she asked sarcastically.  
"那么，你也顺便'忘记'了我们之间发生的事吗？" 她讽刺地问。

"I've only forgotten a few minor incidents. I have told you everything else I can think of, so just drop it" he said stubbornly.  
"我只忘了几件小事。其他我能想到的都告诉你了，别再提了。" 他固执地说。

"You _will_ tell me third child what I want to know right _now_!" she demanded.  
"三儿，你现在就得告诉我我想知道的！" 她要求道。

"Just leave me alone, you damn whore!" he shouted at her, frustrated with her behaviour.  
"别烦我了，你这个该死的婊子！" 他对着她大喊，对她的一再追问感到沮丧。

In response, Asuka slapped him on the face in rage. "Oh please, even you know I wasn't trying to come onto you. As if I ever would!"  
作为回应，明日香愤怒地扇了他一巴掌。“拜托，连你都知道我不是想勾引你。我才不会那样呢！”

The boy just sneered at her, the argument becoming less rational. "Oh you only wish you could have me, I know you fantasise about me"  
男孩只是对她冷笑，争论变得越来越不理智。“哦，你只是希望得到我，我知道你对我有幻想”

This time the redhead punched him in the face, not appreciating his comment. Both teens were extremely pissed now. Asuka prepared another blow, only to have her arm caught by Shinji.  
这次红发女孩一拳打在他脸上，对他的评论感到不满。两个青少年现在都非常生气。明日香准备再打一拳，却被真嗣抓住了手臂。

"I am sick and tired of your childish behaviour Asuka! You are just a spoilt-" he started, before being interrupted by a sharp kick from the girl. Shinji just didn't care anymore and began to fight back. He punched her in the jaw; she staggered back, shocked he would attack back. She quickly dodged his second attack and did a roundhouse kick to his head, causing him to fall. The boy got up dazed and charged towards her, making her crash into his chair breaking it completely.  
“我已经受够了你那幼稚的行为，明日香！你只不过是个被宠坏的——”他刚开口，就被女孩一脚踢断。真嗣已经不在乎了，开始反击。他一拳打在她的下巴上；她踉跄后退，震惊于他会还手。她迅速躲开他的第二次攻击，并一记回旋踢踢向他的头部，使他倒地。男孩晕乎乎地站起来，冲向她，让她撞上了他的椅子，椅子彻底散架。

_'Damn that hurt'_ she thought.  
“该死，真疼”她心想。

The girl shoved him off of her and stood up quickly. He attempted to get up quickly, but fell back onto the bed when he received a blow to the nose. His nose began bleeding heavily and he got up swiftly ready to retaliate, only to get winded as Asuka punched him straight in the gut. He collapsed to the floor and Asuka kicked him in the chest. Shinji grabbed her legs and tripped her over, causing her to fall over and hit her head on the floor hard. She looked up, her vision swimming, as her head pounded unbearably. Finally, the boy got on top of her and held her arms down, effectively pinning her.  
女孩用力推开他，迅速站起身。他试图快速起身，但被一拳打中鼻子后跌回床上。他的鼻子开始大量流血，他迅速站起来准备反击，却被明日香一拳直击腹部，喘不过气来。他倒在地上，明日香又踢了他的胸口一脚。真嗣抓住她的腿，将她绊倒，使她重重地摔在地上，头部受到撞击。她抬起头，视线模糊，头痛欲裂。最后，男孩压在她身上，按住她的手臂，有效地制住了她。

"God damn it Asuka, is this your solution to everything? Do you hate me that much?" he rebuked.  
"该死的，明日香，这就是你解决一切的办法吗？你真的那么恨我吗？" 他责备道。

"An asshole like you, keeping information from me, calling me a whore. Do you expect me to just sit there and take it?!" she shouted up at him.  
"像你这种混蛋，对我隐瞒信息，还骂我是婊子。你以为我会乖乖坐在那里忍受吗？！" 她朝他大声喊道。

"I want to get along with you Asuka, really! Are we not close friends? We've been to hell and back together!" he retorted.  
"我想和你好好相处，明日香，真的！我们不是好朋友吗？我们一起经历了那么多风风雨雨！" 他反驳道。

"Fuck off! You're being way too familiar, even if we are friends!" she spat angrily.  
"滚开！你太自来熟了，就算我们是朋友也不行！" 她愤怒地吐出这些话。

"I know you're proud Asuka, but you gotta stop pushing people away!" he countered.  
"我知道你很骄傲，明日香，但你得停止推开别人！" 他反驳道。

"What right do you have to say that? You're so weak and cowardly, always running away from something if it's too hard or putting the blame onto yourself" she refuted.  
"你有什么资格说这话？你那么软弱又胆小，一遇到难事就逃避，要不就把责任全揽到自己头上。" 她反驳道。

"If you haven't noticed, I have changed! Do you think the old Shinji would have the guts to do what I'm doing right now? You're right, I am cowardly and weak, I struggle with it a lot. But at least I'm honest about it and try to work on it" he defended.  
"如果你还没注意到，我已经变了！你觉得以前的真嗣会有胆量做我现在做的事情吗？你说得对，我确实胆小懦弱，我为此挣扎不已。但至少我对此坦诚，并努力改进" 他辩解道。

"It doesn't matter anyway, how could you possibly understand me? You have no idea about anything about me, so just rack off" she snapped.  
"反正你也无所谓，你怎么可能理解我？你对我一无所知，所以别烦我了" 她厉声说道。

"I know what happened with your mother! And I'm sorry you had to see that, but you can't just take it out on everyone because you found her hanging from the ceiling. Everyone has their own problems, my mother also died in front of my eyes as well! You can't keep pushing everyone away just because you think anyone who you open your heart to will betray you" he blurted out in outrage.  
"我知道你母亲的事！我为你不得不看到那一幕感到难过，但你不能因为发现她吊在天花板上就对每个人都发泄。每个人都有自己的问题，我母亲也是在我眼前去世的！你不能因为担心向谁敞开心扉就会被背叛，就一直推开所有人" 他愤怒地脱口而出。

"How did you know?" she asked, taken aback; his words had stung her hard.  
"你怎么知道的？" 她吃惊地问，他的话深深刺痛了她。

"You told me" he answered, instantly regretting mentioning her past. He shouldn't have brought it up like this, not to mention she didn't yet know the truth about the evas.  
"你告诉我的。" 他立刻后悔提起了她的过去。他不该这样提起，更不用说她还不知道关于那些逃亡者的真相。

The girl stayed silent for a while, suddenly feeling weak. "Why would I tell you about my past?" she asked disbelievingly.  
女孩沉默了一会儿，突然感到无力。"我为什么要告诉你我的过去？" 她难以置信地问。

"Asuka… I shouldn't have said that really. That was my bad, I take it back so just forget about it alright?" he entreated, getting off of her.  
“明日香…我真的不该那么说的。那是我的错，我收回，你就忘了吧，好吗？”他恳求道，从她身上下来。

The redhead got up and moved towards Shinji's door before turning to face him. "Listen here third child, you keep your stupid information! I don't care anymore. You just stay the hell away from me. Understand? I hate you" she said angrily.  
红发女孩起身走向真嗣的房门，转身面对他。“听着，第三适格者，你那些愚蠢的信息自己留着吧！我再也不在乎了。你离我远点，明白吗？我讨厌你。”她生气地说。

Asuka opened his door ready to slam it behind her, but Shinji couldn't give up now. He grabbed her wrist holding her there. "Please Asuka, don't do this! I didn't mean it! I was just angry" he pleaded, tears threatening to flow down his cheeks.  
明日香打开门准备用力甩上，但真嗣此刻无法放弃。他抓住她的手腕，让她停在那里。“求你了，明日香，别这样！我不是故意的！我只是太生气了。”他恳求着，泪水在眼眶中打转。

"Didn't you hear what I said? I hate you. I hate _you_. I HATE YOU!" she shouted, shaking his hand off her and slamming the door in his face.  
“你没听到我说的话吗？我恨你。我恨你。我恨你！”她喊道，甩开他的手，当着他的面砰地一声关上了门。

The boy stood there stunned at the turn of events, it had spiralled out of control rapidly and from something so small. _'Man, this is gonna be much tougher than I thought'_  
男孩站在那里，对事态的急转直下感到震惊，一切失控得如此迅速，而起因却是如此微不足道。‘天啊，这比我想象的要难得多’

Shinji opened his door curiously after not hearing another door slam. He hoped she hadn't run off or anything. He was completely surprised to find the object of all his pain and pleasure slumped against the wall just next to his door. The redhead looked up at him when she heard his door open. She glared menacingly at him, just daring him to do anything.  
真嗣在没听到另一声门响后好奇地打开了自己的门。他希望她没有跑掉或别的什么。他完全没想到，那个让他痛苦与快乐交织的对象，正瘫坐在他门旁的墙边。红发女孩听到他开门的声音，抬头看向他。她恶狠狠地瞪着他，仿佛在挑衅他敢做什么。

"Do you really hate me?" Shinji asked softly.  
"你真的讨厌我吗？" 真嗣轻声问道。

She heard the question but stayed silent. Shinji stood there patiently waiting for an answer. As the minutes passed by, he was about to leave.  
她听到了这个问题，却保持沉默。真嗣耐心地站在那里等待回答。随着时间一分一秒过去，他正准备离开。

"No" she said so quietly he almost didn't hear. Despite her anger and her behaviour towards the pilot of Unit 01, she did care for him deep down.  
"不" 她轻声说道，声音小得他几乎听不见。尽管她愤怒且对初号机驾驶员态度恶劣，但她内心深处确实关心他。

"Look, we both said things there that perhaps we shouldn't have. I'm willing to forgive you, if you can do the same for me" Shinji said with a hint of hope.  
“看，我们俩刚才可能都说了些不该说的话。如果你能同样原谅我，我愿意原谅你。” 真嗣带着一丝希望说道。

She sighed and turned around to face him fully. "Apology accepted. But that doesn't mean that I've gone soft or anything, you're just lucky I feel particularly forgiving today" she conceded.  
她叹了口气，转过身来完全面对他。“道歉接受。但这并不意味着我变软弱了，你只是今天特别幸运，我恰好心情宽恕。”她让步道。

Shinji smiled brightly. "Of course. The great Asuka rules with an iron fist"  
真嗣灿烂地笑了。“当然。伟大的明日香以铁腕统治。”

"You bet I do" she said, playfully hitting him on the head.  
"当然啦" 她笑着拍了拍他的头。

Both of them grimaced as the adrenalin wore off and their entire body ached with bruises and cuts. Dried blood covered Shinji's face as his nose had been bleeding. Asuka also had some blood on her chin from her cut lip where Shinji had punched her. Both teens looked at each other and laughed, and instantly regretted it as pain tore through their torsos.  
随着肾上腺素消退，两人都因瘀伤和割伤而全身疼痛，不禁皱起了眉头。真嗣的脸上覆盖着干涸的血迹，他的鼻子一直在流血。明日香的下巴上也有血迹，那是被真嗣打裂的嘴唇流出的。两个少年对视一眼，笑了起来，随即因为胸口的剧痛而后悔不已。

"Man, we really went all out didn't we? I'm not paying for the chair by the way" Asuka commented, smirking.  
"伙计，我们真是拼尽全力了，对吧？顺便说一句，我可不赔那把椅子" 明日香带着一丝坏笑评论道。

"We really did haha. I think we should fix ourselves up though, you go to the bathroom first and I'll get the first aid kit from the kitchen cupboard" he remarked.  
"我们真的搞砸了，哈哈。不过我觉得我们应该收拾一下自己，你去洗手间先，我去厨房柜子里拿急救箱" 他建议道。

"Fine, but don't touch me with your hand" she said, grinning cheekily.  
"好吧，但别用你的手碰我" 她笑着调皮地说。

Shinji blushed, remembering the initial incident that had occurred. "Alright" he replied, quickly walking off, not wanting to be teased further.  
真嗣脸红了，想起了最初发生的那件事。"好的" 他回答，快步走开，不想再被取笑。

The boy made his way to the kitchen and scrambled through the medicinal cupboard for bandages and the first aid kit. He hurriedly washed his hands, smiling slightly. Even though he had gotten beaten up badly by Asuka, he felt they had progressed somewhat. Though he was amazed Misato had been able to sleep through all that, Asuka screamed "I hate you" pretty loudly, not to mention they broke a chair.  
男孩走向厨房，在药柜里翻找绷带和急救包。他匆忙洗净双手，微微一笑。尽管被明日香狠狠揍了一顿，他觉得他们之间还是有所进展。他惊讶于美里竟然能睡过这一切，明日香可是大声喊着“我恨你”，更不用说他们还打碎了一把椅子。

Shinji stood there in the radiance of the sun coming through the window for a moment, enjoying the warmth flowing onto him. The sound of an angry voice calling him broke him out of his daze and he rushed to the bathroom with the medical equipment. The boy opened the door, finding that Asuka had cleaned up all her blood and was waiting impatiently.  
真嗣站在窗边，阳光洒在他身上，享受着这份温暖。一声愤怒的呼唤打断了他的恍惚，他带着医疗用品冲向浴室。男孩打开门，发现明日香已经清理掉了所有的血迹，正不耐烦地等着。

"Took you long enough. What were you doing? Having another session in the kitchen?" she asked, slightly irritated.  
“你可真慢。在干嘛呢？又在厨房里忙活吗？”她略带不悦地问道。

"No Asuka" he replied, blushing.  
“没有明日香。”他回答道，脸颊泛红。

"Whatever, just hurry up and give me that stuff while you wash your face. You look dreadful" she ordered.  
“随便你，快点把那东西给我，然后去洗脸。你看起来糟透了。”她命令道。

The boy did so and began to wash the dry blood off his face. Luckily, she hadn't broken his nose. The water turned crimson as he washed himself. After finishing, he wiped himself dry with a towel and turned his attention to the redhead. She was grimacing slightly as she dabbed her wounds with iodine-soaked cotton wool. The girl took out some bandages and was finding difficulty in placing them on the cuts on her arms.  
男孩照做了，开始清洗脸上的干血迹。幸运的是，她没有打断他的鼻子。水被染成了深红色，他洗完后用毛巾擦干，然后转向红发女孩。她正微微皱眉，用浸了碘酒的棉球轻拍伤口。女孩拿出一些绷带，正费力地将其贴在手臂的伤口上。

"I can't really place them on my elbows and fingers properly so you do it" she requested of Shinji.  
"我实在没法把它们正确地戴在肘部和手指上，你来帮我吧" 她向真嗣请求道。

"Sure" he agreed, acknowledging her request.  
"当然" 他同意了，接受了她的请求。

"Wait, did you wash your hands?" she asked, hesitating for a moment.  
"等等，你洗手了吗？" 她犹豫了一下问道。

"Yes of course" he answered.  
"当然可以" 他回答道。

"Good" she said, relieved.  
"太好了" 她松了一口气说道。

Shinji quickly placed bandages over the redhead's wounds and looked up at her when he finished his work. "By the way Asuka" he started.  
真嗣迅速地在红发少女的伤口上贴上绷带，完成工作后抬头看向她。"对了，明日香" 他开口道。

"Yeah?" she prompted. "嗯？" 她催促道。

"I didn't wash my hands" he joked.  
"我没洗手" 他开玩笑说。

"What?!" she snapped, slapping him hard; how many times was it now?  
"什么？！" 她厉声道，狠狠地拍了他一下；这已经是第几次了？

"Relax, I was just kidding" he replied, nursing his once again abused cheek.  
“放松，我开玩笑的。”他回答道，轻抚着再次受创的脸颊。

"Don't joke with me Ikari! Especially about that" she shot back.  
“别跟我开玩笑，碇！尤其是那件事。”她反击道。

Shinji looked himself over, discovering he was mainly covered in bruises. Asuka had received most of her cuts from crashing into the chair. Since she had taken the brunt of it, he didn't receive any cuts from the wooden splinters. He patched up the few open wounds he had and turned back to face Asuka.  
真嗣仔细检查了自己，发现身上主要是些瘀伤。明日香则多半是因为撞到椅子而受了些擦伤。由于她承受了大部分冲击，真嗣并没有被木屑划伤。他处理了自己仅有的几处开放性伤口，然后转身面对明日香。

"You should put an ice pack on your head or you'll get a large bump" Shinji remarked.  
"你应该在你的头上敷个冰袋，不然会肿个大包的" 真嗣说道。

"Definitely… I hit my head pretty hard thanks to you" she replied, sticking her tongue out him.  
"肯定的……我头撞得这么狠都怪你" 她回答道，向他吐了吐舌头。

Both teens got up and began to walk to the kitchen. Shinji went to the fridge to take an ice pack out of the freezer, while Asuka sat down at the dining table. The boy took out a cloth and covered the ice pack with it. He moved over to Asuka and gave it to her. The redhead positioned it on the place she had hit her head and sighed in relief. The boy then sat down next to her.  
两个少年起身走向厨房。真嗣走到冰箱前，从冷冻室里拿出一个冰袋，而明日香则坐在餐桌旁。男孩拿出一块布，将冰袋包好。他走到明日香身边，把冰袋递给她。红发女孩将其放在她撞到头的地方，松了一口气。然后，男孩坐在她旁边。

"So, what did you initially come to my room for again?" Shinji asked.  
"那么，你最初来我房间是为了什么来着？" 真嗣问道。

"I was going to ask what to do today" she answered.  
"我想问今天该做什么" 她回答道。

"So, do you have any ideas?" he asked.  
"那么，你有什么想法吗？" 他问道。

"Why do you think I came to you, dumbass?" she shot back.  
"你以为我为什么来找你，傻瓜？"她回敬道。

"Well, I did say earlier we could finish the play. Other than that, nothing comes to mind" Shinji suggested.  
"嗯，我之前确实说过我们可以完成那出戏。除此之外，我想不出别的了" 真嗣提议道。

"Fine then, let's get this play over and done with" she agreed. "Who knows, we might get an idea after we finish it"  
"那好吧，让我们赶紧把这出戏演完" 她同意了。"谁知道呢，演完后我们可能会有新点子"

"Fine with me" he replied.  
“我没意见。”他回答道。

The two eva pilots both got up and walked into the living room. Their copies of the play were already there, where they had left them yesterday. They commenced reading over their lines, Asuka remembering fairly quickly and soon they had begun reciting. The redhead placed her ice pack on the table as they began to enact their parts. By now Misato had gotten up and was lazing around as usual, taking some curiosity in her ward's activities. Partway through the play, the older woman began to lose interest and started drinking a couple beers.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员都站起身，走进客厅。他们的剧本已经放在那里，正是昨天他们留下的地方。他们开始复习台词，明日香记得相当快，不久他们就开始背诵。红发女孩把冰袋放在桌上，他们开始扮演各自的角色。此时，美里已经起床，像往常一样懒洋洋地四处晃荡，对她的监护人的活动产生了些许好奇。戏剧进行到一半时，这位年长的女性开始失去兴趣，开始喝起了几罐啤酒。

After much time, Shinji and Asuka finished the play. "So, what you'd think?" the boy asked, right after they finished the final scene.  
经过很长时间，真嗣和明日香完成了剧本。“那么，你觉得怎么样？”男孩在最后一幕结束后立刻问道。

"The play was interesting, though I have to say it was a bit too soapy. I mean a happy ending like that it's so unrealistic" the redhead remarked.  
"这部剧挺有意思的，不过我得说有点太狗血了。我是说，那样的幸福结局太不现实了" 红发女孩评论道。

Shinji laughed at her answer.  
真嗣被她的回答逗笑了。

"What's so funny?" she asked, puzzled.  
"有什么好笑的？" 她困惑地问。

"That's exactly what you said the first time we did the play, word for word" he answered.  
"那正是我们第一次排练时你说的话，一字不差" 他回答道。

Asuka just shrugged. 明日香只是耸了耸肩。

"Do you need to go over any scene or are you good?" Shinji offered.  
"你需要再过一遍某个场景吗，还是已经准备好了？" 真嗣提议道。

"I'm good, except maybe for that kissing part…" she said, trailing off.  
"我没事，除了那个接吻的部分……" 她说到一半，声音渐渐低了下去。

Misato spat out her beer. "You two have to kiss?" she asked, laughing.  
美里一口啤酒喷了出来。"你们俩得接吻？" 她笑着问。

"Don't blow in Misato" Asuka snapped angrily.  
"别对着美里吹气！" 明日香生气地喊道。

"I will take the day off work just to see you two kiss in that play, man it'll be worth it" Misato teased, giggling.  
"我特意请了一天假，就为了看你们俩在剧里接吻，绝对值了。" 美里打趣道，咯咯笑着。

"Misato!" Asuka threatened.  
"美里！" 明日香威胁道。

"Oh don't let me stop you, go ahead and practise it. Or are you afraid of kissing a little boy like Shinji?" Misato said mischievously.  
"哦，别让我妨碍你们，继续练习吧。还是说，你怕亲吻像真嗣这样的小男孩？" 美里调皮地说。

"I'm not afraid of anything!" the redhead said indignantly.  
“我什么都不怕！”红发女孩愤愤地说道。

The young girl grabbed Shinji by the neck and pulled him into a deep lip lock. Misato gave Shinji two thumbs up as she grinned cheekily. Shinji sweat dropped at his guardian's behaviour but soon got lost in the kiss. He thought it ironic that this morning they had been beating the crap out of each other and now they were in a deep kiss. _'That's Asuka for you'_ he thought.  
年轻女孩抓住真嗣的脖子，将他拉进一个深吻。美里调皮地笑着，竖起两个大拇指。真嗣对他的监护人的行为感到汗颜，但很快就在这个吻中迷失了。他觉得讽刺的是，今早他们还在互殴，现在却深吻在一起。“这就是明日香”他想。

Asuka parted, deciding she had proved her point to her disbelieving guardian. "I told you I can do it!" she said pompously.  
明日香分开，决定已经向她那不相信的监护人证明了她的观点。“我说过我能做到！”她得意地说。

"You sure convinced me. Are you sure you two aren't lovers or something?" Misato said playfully.  
"你确实说服我了。你确定你们俩不是恋人之类的吗？" 美里打趣地说道。

"What?" Asuka replied, her face turning red.  
"什么？" 明日香回答，脸颊泛起了红晕。

"If you want, I can leave you two alone so you can have fun together" the older woman suggested.  
"如果你们愿意，我可以离开，让你们俩单独相处，好好享受一下。" 那位年长的女士提议道。

"That's it!" the redhead snapped, jumping onto Misato and attacking her wildly.  
“就是这样！”红发女孩厉声喝道，猛地跳到美里身上，疯狂地攻击她。

"Are you always this wild with Shinji?" Misato joked, unable to contain herself.  
“你对真嗣也总是这么狂野吗？”美里打趣道，忍不住笑出声来。

This just infuriated the young girl even more as she began attacking her more viciously. Shinji sweat dropped as he looked at the convulsed mass made up of the two females. He decided he should step in as it seemed to be getting out of control. The boy pulled Asuka off the still laughing Misato.  
这番话让少女更加恼火，她开始更加凶狠地攻击美里。真嗣看着这两个扭打在一起的女性，额头上冒出了汗珠。他觉得应该介入，因为场面似乎快要失控了。男孩把明日香从仍在笑个不停的美里身上拉开。

"What are you doing Shinji?! She deserves to have her heart ripped out" Asuka spat angrily.  
"你在干什么，真嗣？！她活该心碎" 明日香愤怒地吐出这句话。

"You know getting this angry about it only works against you Asuka" Shinji replied calmly.  
"你知道对这件事这么生气只会对你不利，明日香" 真嗣平静地回答。

"Fine" the young girl said, pushing his arms off her. "That also concludes our play practice, since I seem to remember it fully. I don't think we need to rehearse it again"  
"好吧" 少女说着，推开了他的手臂。"这也意味着我们的排练结束了，因为我似乎已经完全记住了。我想我们不需要再排练了"

Misato had stopped laughing and returned her attention to her beer. Asuka tossed her hair back and turned to face Shinji. "I forgot to have a shower this morning and I really need one now. I don't want any incidents like yesterday occurring and none of this morning's stuff either you got it?" she warned him.  
美里停止了笑声，重新将注意力转回到她的啤酒上。明日香甩了甩头发，转向真嗣。“我今早忘了洗澡，现在真的很需要洗一个。我不想再发生昨天那样的事故，也不想有今早那些破事，明白吗？”她警告他。

Misato looked at them curiously but dismissed it.  
美里好奇地看着他们，但随即置之不理。

"Right" he affirmed, blushing.  
“好的”他肯定道，脸颊泛红。

"Also, you better do the laundry. I need all my clothes washed as a lot of them are dirty" Asuka commanded.  
“还有，你最好把衣服洗了。我需要所有的衣服都洗干净，因为很多都脏了。”明日香命令道。

"Yeah that's because with all that happened, I haven't done the laundry since Monday" he explained. Together with going to Rei's house then the angel attack the next day and finally all of Friday with Asuka, he hadn't had the time. Right now was as good as ever to finally wash their clothes and so he hurried off to do his errand.  
“是啊，那是因为发生了这么多事，我从周一就没洗过衣服了。”他解释道。先是去了绫波家，然后第二天天使袭击，最后整个周五都和明日香在一起，他根本没时间。现在正是洗衣服的好时机，于是他急忙去完成这项任务。

Asuka went to her room, picked out new clothes, went to the bathroom and made sure to lock the door. She undressed and stepped under the shower, turning on the taps. The warm water running over her helped her relax a bit and she made sure to wash herself thoroughly. The girl pondered today's events as she washed her hair. Shinji knew about her past, surprisingly, and they had had the largest fight that had ever occurred between them. It hadn't been easy to forgive him, his words had stung her hard, but she had walked in on him and then tried to use him to get information out of him so she supposed she should. Besides, she didn't actually hate him and he was the one who understood her more than anyone, even more so that he knew her past.  
明日香回到自己的房间，挑了新衣服，走进浴室并确保锁上门。她脱掉衣服，站在淋浴下，打开水龙头。温暖的水流让她放松了一些，她仔细地清洗自己。女孩一边洗头一边思考今天发生的事情。真嗣竟然知道她的过去，这让她感到意外，他们之间爆发了前所未有的争吵。原谅他并不容易，他的话深深刺痛了她，但她闯进他的房间试图从他那里套取信息，所以她觉得应该原谅他。此外，她并不真的讨厌他，他是唯一比任何人都更理解她的人，尤其是他知道她的过去。

But she had found out one thing, something _had_ happened between them and he was about to say it. Of course, "we had" could be followed by "gone to the moon" so she still had no clue, but she had pinpointed _what_ he was hiding and she supposed she could get more information at school on Monday. The girl halted her thoughts and began to relax. Asuka remained standing there for a while, enjoying the peace of mind. After a while, she turned off the water and dried herself, wrapping the towel around her. She exited the bathroom and headed towards her room.  
但她已发现了一件事，他们之间发生了什么，而他正要开口说出来。当然，“我们曾经”后面可能跟着“去了月球”，所以她仍毫无头绪，但她已锁定他隐藏的秘密，猜想周一在学校或许能了解更多。女孩止住思绪，开始放松。明日香依旧站在那里片刻，享受着内心的宁静。过了一会儿，她关掉水，擦干身体，裹上毛巾。她走出浴室，朝自己的房间走去。

Shinji had gone to do the laundry and was separating clothes and looking through their pockets in case someone left something in one by accident. When searching one of his own pants, he felt something in one of the pockets. He pulled it out and found himself looking at a bundle of cloth. It took a while for his mind to click and he remembered what it was. On Wednesday night before going to Rei's house, a ragged man had given it to him for showing him kindness; he had totally forgotten about it. Curious, he began to unravel it. He found a golden ring; it was extremely beautiful, set with a powerfully red stone. He checked the inside of the ring and there was an inscription reading, _**Semper Amemus**_. There was also a tape, not unlike the ones he played in his SDAT. He pocketed the tape and began placing the clothes in for washing, making sure not to mix anything incorrectly.  
真嗣去洗衣服了，正在分拣衣物并检查口袋，以防有人不小心遗留了什么。在搜查自己的一条裤子时，他感觉到口袋里有东西。他掏出来一看，是一块布团。过了一会儿他才反应过来，想起了这是什么。周三晚上去绫波家之前，一个衣衫褴褛的男人因为他的善意给了他这个；他完全忘记了这件事。出于好奇，他开始解开布团。里面是一枚金戒指；非常美丽，镶嵌着一颗鲜红如血的宝石。他检查了戒指内侧，上面刻着一行字：Semper Amemus。还有一盘磁带，和他 SDAT 播放器里的那些很像。他把磁带放进口袋，开始把衣服放进洗衣机，确保没有混淆。

As the machine began its work, Shinji began to walk towards his room examining the ring more closely. The jewel had such a deep red that it looked like an endless crimson abyss.  
洗衣机开始工作时，真嗣开始走向自己的房间，更仔细地观察那枚戒指。宝石的红如此深邃，仿佛是无尽的深红深渊。

"This ring has such excellent workmanship, why would that man have given me something so valuable?" he said aloud.  
“这戒指工艺如此精湛，那人为何会给我这么贵重的东西？”他自言自语道。

Shinji saw the bathroom door open and quickly hid the ring in his pocket. Asuka emerged from the bathroom with a towel around her. She had begun to head towards her room when Shinji stopped her.  
真嗣看到浴室门打开，迅速将戒指藏进口袋。明日香裹着一条毛巾从浴室出来，正要走向她的房间时，真嗣叫住了她。

"Can I ask a question Asuka?" he requested.  
“我可以问你一个问题吗，明日香？”他请求道。

"Go ahead" she permitted, a little curious.  
“问吧”她允许道，略感好奇。

"What does ummm 'Semupa Amamusu' mean?" he asked, trying to pronounce it like it looked like in English.  
"'Semupa Amamusu' 是什么意思？" 他问道，试图按照英文的发音方式来念这个词。

"You mean 'Semper Amemus'?" she corrected.  
"你是说 'Semper Amemus' 吗？" 她纠正道。

"Yeah, that's it" he confirmed.  
"对，就是这个" 他确认道。

"Where did you see that?" she asked him, "It's Latin"  
"你在哪儿看到的？" 她问他，"这是拉丁文"

"It doesn't matter… do you know what it means?" he inquired.  
"这无关紧要……你知道它是什么意思吗？" 他询问道。

"It means 'love is forever' in Latin" she answered. "But nobody uses Latin these days, I still had to study it in college for God knows what. Is that all?"  
"在拉丁语中，它的意思是'爱是永恒的'。" 她回答，"但如今没人用拉丁语了，我上大学时还不知为何要学它。就这些吗？"

"Yes, thank you" he replied.  
“是的，谢谢。”他回答道。

"Fine whatever" she said, losing interest. Asuka went off and entered her room, closing the door behind her.  
“随便吧。”她说着，失去了兴趣。明日香走开并进了自己的房间，关上了门。

The boy smiled; the ring he had been given was perfect for his situation. _'How in the blazes did that man know? Or how did he even know I had an SDAT player?'_ he thought.  
男孩笑了；那枚戒指对他目前的处境来说再合适不过了。‘那人是怎么知道的？他又怎么会知道我有 SDAT 播放器？’他心想。

Shinji shook his head and entered his room to check out the tape. The boy looked at his clock, surprised to see it was already in the afternoon. But then again, a lot had already happened today.  
真嗣摇了摇头，走进房间查看那盘磁带。男孩看了看时钟，惊讶地发现已经是下午了。不过话说回来，今天已经发生了很多事。

He reached into his pocket and took out the tape. Taking out his SDAT from his drawer, he placed the tape inside. Shinji placed his earplugs in and pressed play, on came some pre-impact music very different to the ones he had in his possession.  
他伸手从口袋里拿出磁带。从抽屉里取出他的 SDAT，将磁带放入其中。真嗣戴上耳塞，按下播放键，传来的前冲击音乐与他拥有的那些截然不同。

"_You only see what your eyes want to see  
“你只看到你眼睛想看到的东西”  
How can life be what you want it to be  
生活如何才能如你所愿  
You're frozen 你如冰封  
When your heart's not open  
当你的心未曾敞开_

_You're so consumed with how much you get  
你如此沉迷于自己得到了多少  
You waste your time with hate and regret  
你浪费时间在仇恨和悔恨上  
You're broken 你已支离破碎  
When your heart's not open…"  
当你的心未曾敞开……_

The boy thought it was pretty nice and decided to keep it, however he'd listen to all the songs later. Though he still thought it quite strange that the man given him a tape, when almost no one had an SDAT player these days. He pressed pause, placed his SDAT player back in his drawer and then changed into some new clothes. Shinji exited his room to prepare some food as it was afternoon and he was hungry, he was sure the others were as well. On his way to the kitchen, he noticed Misato was lying down on the couch in the living room.  
男孩觉得这挺不错，决定留下它，尽管他打算稍后再听所有的歌曲。尽管他仍觉得奇怪，那人给了他一盘磁带，而如今几乎没人有 SDAT 播放器了。他按下暂停，将 SDAT 播放器放回抽屉，然后换上新衣服。真嗣走出房间准备弄些吃的，因为已是下午，他饿了，他确信其他人也一样。去厨房的路上，他注意到美里正躺在客厅的沙发上。

"Hey Misato, Asuka and I have nothing to do for the rest of the day" he commented.  
“嘿，美里，明日香和我今天下午没事可做。”他评论道。

"And?" Misato prompted. "然后呢？" 美里催促道。

"Well now is as good a time as any to tell Asuka about Instrumentality and the evas. She deserves to know and I'm about to make dinner, so you can tell her after" he explained.  
"现在正是时候告诉明日香关于人类补完计划和 EVA 的事。她有权知道，而且我正要做晚饭，所以你可以在那之后告诉她" 他解释道。

"Good point! It is certainly a suitable time to tell her, while everything is all calm. Dinner sounds good too, I'm starving" she replied.  
"说得好！现在确实是个合适的时间，一切都那么平静。晚饭听起来也不错，我饿坏了" 她回答道。

Shinji continued on to the kitchen, ready to start making their meals. He looked through the fridge, disheartened to find many instant food packages had been added. _'When did Misato go shopping?'_ he thought curiously. _'How in the world did she survive eating this junk?'_ he thought as he eyed the can of liquid pizza.  
真嗣继续走向厨房，准备开始做饭。他翻看着冰箱，发现多了许多速食食品，感到有些沮丧。'美里什么时候去购物的？'他好奇地想。'她是怎么靠吃这些垃圾食品活下来的？'他看着那罐液体披萨，心中疑惑。

The boy took out some items and began cooking dinner for everyone. Misato had sat down at the dining table, awaiting the food. A pleasant aroma began to fill the kitchen and soon drifted off to every corner of the house. Asuka came out from her room, smelling the food, and followed the scent to its source. The redhead noticed Shinji preparing dinner and sat down at the table with Misato.  
男孩拿出一些食材，开始为大家准备晚餐。美里已经坐在餐桌旁，等待着食物。一股宜人的香气开始在厨房弥漫，并很快飘散到屋子的每个角落。明日香从她的房间出来，闻到了食物的香味，跟着香气找到了源头。红发的她注意到真嗣正在准备晚餐，便坐到了美里旁边的餐桌旁。

"When's dinner gonna be ready" Asuka asked impatiently.  
“晚饭什么时候好啊？”明日香不耐烦地问道。

"Not too long" he answered.  
"不算太久" 他回答道。

Asuka waited in silence while Shinji finished his cooking. Misato and Shinji were both awkwardly quiet, giving the young girl a sense of foreboding; she felt as if something was coming. Wishing to drop the gloomy atmosphere, Misato piped up.  
明日香静静地等待着真嗣完成烹饪。美里和真嗣都尴尬地沉默着，这让少女感到一种不祥的预感；她觉得有什么事情即将发生。为了打破这阴沉的气氛，美里开口了。

"So, how are you doing now Asuka?" Misato asked warmly.  
"那么，你现在感觉怎么样，明日香？" 美里温和地问道。

"Fine" Asuka replied abruptly.  
“好”明日香简短地回答道。

Asuka's response derailed the Major's attempt at conversation and so the older woman stopped. Misato figured it would be pointless to start small talk with the redhead right now. Shinji finally finished the meals and placed them on the table. As the group began to eat, Asuka's anxiety grew rapidly with every passing moment. When they had all finished eating, they sat down in silence for a few minutes until Shinji decided to break it.  
明日香的回应打断了少校试图进行的对话，于是这位年长的女性停了下来。美里认为现在和红发女孩闲聊毫无意义。真嗣终于完成了饭菜并摆放在桌上。随着大家开始用餐，明日香的焦虑感随着每一刻的流逝迅速增长。当他们都吃完后，他们沉默地坐了几分钟，直到真嗣决定打破沉默。

"Misato, I think it's about time we told her the truth about NERV" the boy suggested.  
“美里，我想是时候我们告诉她关于 NERV 的真相了。”男孩提议道。

Misato nodded in response.  
美里点头回应。

"What are you talking about?" Asuka asked curiously.  
“你们在说什么？”明日香好奇地问。

"We didn't want to push this revelation onto you right after you had just recovered from the angel battle. We wanted you to re-adjust a little first as it's a lot to take in" Misato answered. "Shinji if you don't mind, it'd probably be best if I explain this alone to her"  
“我们不想在你刚从使徒战斗中恢复过来时就告诉你这个消息。我们希望你先稍微调整一下，因为这信息量很大。”美里回答道，“真嗣，如果你不介意的话，最好还是由我单独向她解释。”

"Yes, I understand" he replied, nodding.  
“是的，我明白。”他点头回答道。

The boy walked out of the kitchen, seeing Misato turn to face Asuka in the corner of his eye. Their voices drifted off as he entered his room. Explaining Instrumentality would take a while, so he decided he'd pass the time by listening to the new tape. He took out his SDAT, put his earphones in and lay down on his bed. He once again pressed play and music filled his ears as he lay there waiting for Misato to finish with Asuka.  
男孩走出厨房，眼角瞥见美里转向面对着明日香。他们的声音随着他进入房间而渐渐消失。解释人类补完计划需要一些时间，所以他决定边听新磁带边打发时间。他拿出 SDAT，戴上耳机，躺在床上。他再次按下播放键，音乐充盈耳际，他躺在那里等待美里和明日香谈完。

"_Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart  
"“嗯——，如果我能融化你的心”  
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart  
嗯嗯嗯嗯，我们永不分离  
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me  
嗯嗯嗯嗯，将自己交给我  
Mmmmmm, you hold the key  
嗯嗯嗯嗯，你掌握着钥匙_

_Now there's no point in placing the blame  
现在追究责任已毫无意义  
And you should know I suffer the same  
你也该明白，我承受的痛苦与你相同

让所有内心的伤痛逝去  
You're frozen 你被冻结了  
When your heart's not open…"  
当你的心未曾敞开……_

The music cut off abruptly, replaced by silence. Then a voice.  
音乐戛然而止，取而代之的是一片寂静。随后，一个声音响起。

_"Yo, you're late"_ a man said aloud.  
“哟，你迟到了。”一个男人大声说道。

The man's voice sounded familiar; one he had heard recently actually. Then a gunshot was heard and a pair of footsteps running off. Shinji listened on in shocked silence, the only sound was the occasional moan. After a few minutes, he heard a grunt.  
那男人的声音听起来很熟悉，实际上他最近才听过。接着传来一声枪响和一阵急促的脚步声。真嗣震惊地沉默着，唯一的声音是偶尔的呻吟。几分钟后，他听到了一声闷哼。

_"You missed Katsuragi" “你没打中葛城。”_

At that point, Shinji realised the man was Kaji. The boy heard a sound like someone getting up before it stopped, only to come back to Kaji speaking.  
就在那时，真嗣意识到那个男人是加持。男孩听到一阵像是有人起身的声音，随后停了下来，接着又听到加持说话。

_"Yo Shinji, I know you might be wondering what's going on, but this is Kaji. I have given you this tape because I am not ready to present myself to Misato yet. Don't worry if you didn't recognise me, I wanted it that way. In any case, I want you to know I'm still alive. Misato shot me but only wounded me as you heard in the recording. One favour I ask is not to tell Misato about this, not yet anyway. I know she's probably grief stricken over thinking that she killed me, but I will show myself soon enough. I wanted you to know though…"  
哟，真嗣，我知道你可能在想发生了什么，但这是加持。我给你这盘磁带是因为我还没准备好向美里现身。如果你没认出我，别担心，我本意如此。无论如何，我想让你知道我还活着。美里朝我开枪，但只让我受了伤，正如你在录音中听到的。我有一个请求，就是暂时不要告诉美里这件事。我知道她可能因为以为杀了我而悲痛欲绝，但我很快就会现身。不过，我想让你知道……_

The tape seemed to pause for a moment.  
磁带似乎暂停了一会儿。

_"That ring I gave you was the one I was planning to propose to Misato with a long time ago, except I never had the courage to do so. I think you need it more. You might be wondering how I know you would need it, well let's just say I infiltrated NERV and discovered what happened in the battle with the 15th angel. If you want to know how I found you, I followed you when you exited the apartment alone; I am a spy after all. One last thing… I warn you, DO NOT go see the movie 'Angels and Evas'. I was desperate for money, so I sold some information about NERV. I'd never think they'd go so far as to make a movie and an awful one at that…"  
"那枚戒指，是我很久以前打算向美里求婚时用的，只是我从未有勇气这么做。我想你更需要它。你可能好奇我是怎么知道你需要它的，这么说吧，我潜入了 NERV 并发现了与第 15 使徒战斗时发生的事情。至于我是如何找到你的，你独自离开公寓时我跟踪了你；毕竟我是个间谍。最后一件事……我警告你，千万别去看电影《天使与 EVA》。我那时急需用钱，所以卖了一些 NERV 的情报。我从未想过他们会做到这种地步，拍成电影，还是那么糟糕的一部……"_

Shinji sweat dropped, _'Too late Kaji'_ he thought, _'Well at least we know who the leak was'_  
真嗣额头冒汗，心想：'太迟了，加持'，'不过至少我们知道泄密者是谁了'

_"So yeah, sorry about that movie and don't try looking for me, I will come soon enough. I hope you're doing good kid"  
"所以，关于那部电影我很抱歉，也别试图找我，我很快就会回来的。希望你一切都好，孩子"_

Shinji sat there as the message finished and the music resumed playing. He slowly digested the information he just heard and started crying. The boy had figured there was something up; every time he asked Misato about Kaji she began acting strangely, now he knew why. However, with the discovery that Kaji was still alive he felt so happy. Shinji couldn't believe the person he had met that night was Kaji, he couldn't believe he didn't recognise him. The boy wiped his eyes dry and placed the tape and SDAT back in his drawer, before laying back down and smiling at the good news. If Kaji showed himself soon, surely he could help him with his relationship issues, especially since Kaji knew Asuka well. Shinji lay on his bed, patiently waiting for Misato or Asuka to tell him they were finished.  
消息播放完毕，音乐再次响起，真嗣坐在那里，慢慢消化着刚刚听到的信息，泪水渐渐涌出。他早就觉得有些不对劲；每次问美里关于加持的事，她都会表现得异常，现在他终于明白了原因。然而，得知加持还活着，他感到无比高兴。真嗣不敢相信那晚遇见的人就是加持，他竟然没有认出来。男孩擦干眼泪，将磁带和 SDAT 放回抽屉，然后躺下，对着这个好消息微笑。如果加持很快现身，他肯定能帮自己解决感情问题，尤其是加持对明日香很了解。真嗣躺在床上，耐心等待美里或明日香告诉他她们已经忙完了。

After a while, Asuka came to his door and knocked. "Well your father is certainly one fucked up bastard and I knew something was up with Wondergirl. Also, the truth about our evas… that they have the souls of our mothers is quite disconcerting" she said after entering his room.  
过了一会儿，明日香来到他的门前敲了敲。“你父亲真是个混蛋，我早就觉得绫波有什么问题。还有，关于我们的 EVA……它们拥有我们母亲的灵魂，这真是令人不安。”她走进房间说道。

"It was a lot to take in when we were first told too…" Shinji remarked, "At least it's like our mothers are with us when we pilot the evas… and I guess also that… your mother didn't abandon you"  
"一开始听到这些确实很难消化……" 真嗣说道，"至少当我们驾驶 EVA 时，感觉就像我们的母亲和我们在一起……我想这也意味着……你的母亲并没有抛弃你"

"I don't wanna talk about that now… I still can't believe I told you" Asuka replied sharply.  
"我现在不想谈这个……我还是不敢相信我告诉了你" 明日香尖锐地回答道。

"So… you know everything now?" he continued. "Did this make you remember anything else?" he asked.  
"那么……你现在知道所有事情了？" 他继续问道，"这让你想起了其他什么吗？" 他询问道。

"Yeah, I believe Misato told me everything and my mind did register a few glimpses of the past. I could see myself sitting with you while she was explaining the same thing. Though there was one thing I didn't understand… why do we need to bathe in LCL regularly?" the girl asked.  
"嗯，我相信美里已经告诉我一切了，我的脑海中也确实闪现了一些过去的片段。我能看到自己和你坐在一起，而她在解释同样的事情。不过有一件事我不明白……为什么我们需要定期在 LCL 中洗澡？"女孩问道。

Shinji blushed and turned his face away. _'She just_ _**had**_ _to remember_ _**that**_ _didn't she?'_  
真嗣脸红了，把脸转开。'她偏偏记得这个，不是吗？'

"It's really not important" he replied.  
"这真的不重要"他回答道。

"Not this again! Everyone knows all these things that I don't recall, it's so irritating not being able to remember what happened!" Asuka shot back angrily. "Everyone has been keeping information from me, that Instrumentality rubbish is just another great example"  
"又来了！大家都知道这些我不记得的事，真是烦人，记不起来发生了什么！" 明日香愤怒地回击。"大家都在对我隐瞒信息，那个‘人类补完计划’就是又一个绝佳的例子"

"We were planning to tell you that from the beginning, it's not something we could burden you with immediately. We have not hidden anything from you" Shinji countered.  
"我们原本就打算从一开始就告诉你，这不是我们能立刻让你承担的事情。我们没有对你隐瞒任何事" 真嗣反驳道。

"If you're not hiding anything from me, why can't you tell me why we have to bath in LCL regularly? Surely, you've got nothing to hide right? And we certainly have enough time for an explanation, it's not like we're doing anything else anyway" Asuka rebuked.  
"如果你们没有对我隐瞒什么，那为什么不能告诉我为什么我们得定期泡在 LCL 里？肯定没什么好隐瞒的吧？而且我们有足够的时间解释，反正我们也没别的事做" 明日香反驳道。

Shinji gritted his teeth; he really didn't see an easy way out of this one, besides it's not like he didn't sympathise with her situation. Unfortunately, this was something that was difficult to explain innocently without touching on their previous relationship. All day she had been trying to get him to reveal information to her and he was exhausted of ideas to make up.  
真嗣咬紧牙关；他确实没看到轻松脱身的办法，而且他也不是不同情她的处境。不幸的是，这种事情很难在不触及他们之前关系的情况下无辜地解释清楚。一整天她都在试图让他透露信息给她，而他已经筋疲力尽，想不出新的借口了。

"I'm not in the mood right now, just drop it" he said, hoping she would leave it alone for now.  
“我现在没心情，别提了”他说，希望她能暂时放下这个话题。

"No, I won't! You will tell me now" she demanded.  
“不，我不会！你现在就得告诉我”她要求道。

"Drop it!" "放下它！"

"No!"

"Yes!" "是的！"

"No!"

Shinji got up and began to walk to his door. Asuka moved in front of him to stop him. "You're not getting away Ikari" she declared tenaciously.  
真嗣站起身，开始向他的房门走去。明日香移动到他面前阻止他。“你别想逃，碇”她坚定地宣称。

"I need to go to the toilet" he requested.  
“我需要去洗手间。”他请求道。

The expression on Asuka's face visibly showed she was annoyed. However, she stepped aside to allow him to pass through. "Fine, but I'll be waiting outside the bathroom, you're not escaping this time"  
明日香脸上的表情明显显示她很不耐烦。然而，她还是侧身让他通过。“好吧，但我会等在浴室外面，这次你别想溜走。”

Shinji exited his room and moved to the bathroom, followed closely by the girl. She stood to the side while he opened the door and entered, closing the door behind him. The redhead leaned against the wall, waiting for the Unit 01 pilot to finish his business.  
真嗣走出房间，朝浴室走去，女孩紧随其后。她站在一旁，看着他打开门进入，随后关上门。红发少女靠在墙上，等待着初号机驾驶员解决他的事情。

The boy sat down on the toilet, racking his brain for a way to get out of this. The truth in this case would reveal the need for contraceptives; it didn't take a genius to figure out why they would be needed. Additionally, she had remembered that they both needed it. After learning the truth, it wasn't farfetched to deduce that they were sleeping with each other.  
男孩坐在马桶上，绞尽脑汁想找个脱身之计。在这种情况下，真相会暴露出避孕的必要性；这并不需要天才就能明白为什么需要避孕。此外，她记得他们俩都需要这个。得知真相后，不难推断出他们在互相发生关系。

"Hurry up or I'll break down this door and kick you so hard not even NERV will be able to find you!" Asuka shouted through the door.  
“快点，不然我就破门而入，踢得你连 NERV 都找不到你！”明日香隔着门大喊。

_'Why did I fall in love with someone so cruel and evil?'_ he thought. _'Wait NERV! That's it! How come I didn't think of that before? It's the perfect excuse'_  
“我怎么会爱上这么残忍邪恶的人呢？”他心想。“等等，NERV！对了！我怎么之前没想到呢？这简直是完美的借口。”

"I'm almost done" he called out.  
"我快好了" 他喊道。

Shinji got up and flushed the toilet. He went over to the sink and washed his hands. The boy mentally prepared himself and moved to the door before opening it to face Asuka. As he walked through the doorway, a hand shot out to stop him.  
真嗣起身冲了马桶。他走到洗手池边洗了洗手。男孩在心里做好了准备，走向门口，然后打开门面对明日香。当他穿过门口时，一只手伸出来拦住了他。

"Alright Shinji you've done your business, now talk" the girl ordered.  
"好了，真嗣，你解决了个人问题，现在该谈谈了" 女孩命令道。

"Fine alright. Now how do I say this…" he started, trailing off.  
"好吧，好吧。现在我该怎么说呢……" 他开口道，话音渐渐消失。

"For starters, you use your mouth to produce sounds that form a coherent and intelligible language" she replied, irritated.  
"首先，你用嘴发出声音，形成连贯且可理解的语言。" 她不耐烦地回答。

"Well, umm you see… LCL acts as a contraceptive if you bathe in it regularly" he answered nervously.  
"嗯，呃，你看……如果你经常泡在 LCL 里，它有避孕作用。" 他紧张地回答。

Asuka raised her eyebrow at him. "What, is that some kind of sick perverted joke?"  
明日香对他挑了挑眉。“什么，这是什么变态的恶心笑话吗？”

"No, I'm serious" he affirmed.  
“不，我是认真的。”他肯定道。

"Why in God's name would we need to use a contraceptive…?" she asked incredulously, before realising there could be no other reason why the two of them would need it unless they were having sex with someone.  
“看在上帝的份上，我们为什么要用避孕套…？”她难以置信地问道，随即意识到除非他们和别人发生关系，否则没有其他理由需要这东西。

"You don't mean that I… we… you…?" she started, unsure of how to phrase the question.  
"你不是说我要…我们…你…？" 她开始说道，不确定如何表达这个问题。

"I'm not sure what conclusion you're coming to, but let me explain. It has become standard procedure at NERV to make sure we have our regular sync tests now that they have discovered this property. The reason is, in case we are kidnapped and raped we won't get anything unexpected. It was to make sure we could keep piloting no matter what" he lied. Shinji felt his throat go a bit dry at the mention of rape, hoping it wouldn't trigger her memory of that incident.  
"我不确定你得出了什么结论，但让我解释一下。现在 NERV 已经发现了这个特性，确保我们进行定期的同步测试已成为标准程序。原因是为了防止我们被绑架和强奸时出现意外情况。这是为了确保我们无论如何都能继续驾驶，" 他撒谎道。真嗣提到强奸时感到喉咙有些发干，希望这不会触发她对那次事件的记忆。

"I should have known" she replied, shaking her head from her previous thoughts. If she was impregnated, it was obvious she couldn't pilot. If he impregnated a woman, there was a chance she might leave the child to him. NERV was just covering all its bases as usual. Fortunately, Asuka's memory of her rape remained sealed.  
"我早该想到的，" 她回答道，摇摇头摆脱了之前的思绪。如果她怀孕了，显然她就不能驾驶了。如果他让一个女人怀孕，她有可能把孩子留给他。NERV 只是像往常一样在各方面都做了准备。幸运的是，明日香对她的强奸记忆仍然被封存着。

_'I think she bought it. As long as she doesn't ask Misato or anyone else at NERV and we continue having regular sync tests, it will stick'_ he thought, relieved.  
'我觉得她信了。只要她不问美里或 NERV 的其他人，我们继续定期进行同步测试，这事就能糊弄过去' 他想，松了口气。

"Well I can understand why you didn't want to explain, I could have gotten the wrong idea… but at least I know now" she remarked.  
“好吧，我能理解你为什么不想解释，我可能会误解……但至少我现在知道了” 她评论道。

"Yeah, that's why I was a bit hesitant. I wanted to make sure I explained it properly" he replied. "In any case, I must get back to finishing the laundry now" Shinji said, suddenly remembering.  
“是啊，所以我有点犹豫。我想确保解释得当” 他回答。“无论如何，我现在得回去把衣服洗完” 真嗣突然想起来说道。

"Yeah go ahead, it's getting late after all" she said, walking back to her room.  
“嗯，去吧，毕竟已经很晚了。”她说着，走回了自己的房间。

The boy returned to the laundry, finding that the washing machine had finished its round. He pulled out all the clean clothes and placed them into the dryer. He switched the dryer on and it began its incessant noise as it twirled around drying the wet clothes. He placed the remaining dirty clothes into the washing machine, placed the washing powder in and began the wash again.  
男孩回到洗衣房，发现洗衣机已经完成了一轮工作。他取出所有干净的衣服放入烘干机。他打开烘干机，随着它不停地旋转，发出持续的噪音，湿衣服开始被烘干。他把剩下的脏衣服放进洗衣机，加入洗衣粉，再次启动了洗涤程序。

Shinji began the trip to the kitchen when he noticed Misato leaving the house.  
真嗣开始向厨房走去，这时他注意到美里正离开房子。

Seeing Shinji, Misato turned to face him. "Hey Shinji, I have a late-night shift at NERV so I'll be leaving now. You should have supper and go to bed soon. I'll be back in the morning"  
看到真嗣，美里转向他。“嘿，真嗣，我今晚要在 NERV 值夜班，所以现在就得走了。你应该吃晚饭然后早点睡觉。我早上回来。”

"Alright, no worries Misato. Thanks for explaining all that stuff to Asuka, see ya!" he replied, waving to her.  
“好的，别担心美里。谢谢你向明日香解释那些事情，再见！”他回答道，向她挥手。

"You're welcome, goodbye Shinji" she replied, before opening the door and walking through. The boy saw the door close, heard the lock click and then a couple of footsteps walking away growing quieter.  
“不客气，再见真嗣。”她回答，然后打开门走了出去。男孩看着门关上，听到锁扣的声音，接着是几声脚步声逐渐远去，越来越轻。

Shinji returned from his detour and moved to the kitchen. Since they had dinner not that long ago, he decided not to make that big a supper. For one of the first times today, he could rest and enjoy the quiet and peaceful atmosphere. With Asuka's constant nagging, it was a surprise he hadn't broken down yet; she was scary and persuasive and he found it difficult to refuse her. However now that the day was almost over, he could at least enjoy the sleep that was to come.  
真嗣绕道回来后，走进了厨房。既然他们不久前刚吃过晚饭，他决定不准备太过丰盛的宵夜。今天难得有一次，他能放松下来，享受这份宁静平和的氛围。有明日香不断的唠叨，他居然还没崩溃，真是奇迹；她既吓人又说服力十足，他发现自己很难拒绝她。不过，既然这一天即将结束，他至少可以享受即将到来的睡眠。

With all the quiet he suspected that, despite her initial reaction to hearing the truth about NERV, Asuka was still digesting all the information. Shinji began preparing their supper, wearing the same apron he had yesterday. He soon finished and called out to Asuka to come to the dining table. The redhead came and sat down at the dining table quietly. Shinji brought the food to the table and the girl snickered slightly at the apron. The boy removed the apron and sat down at the dining table, beginning to eat supper with Asuka. A friendly silence was kept as the two teens ate their meal. Shinji looked at Asuka longingly when she wasn't looking; the shower she had today had made her hair once again look so radiant. He resolved that anything was worth it to have her back in his arms and suddenly today seemed like just another obstacle on the path to Asuka's heart.  
在一片静谧中，他猜测尽管阿斯卡最初听到 NERV 真相时的反应激烈，她仍在消化所有信息。真嗣开始准备晚餐，穿着昨天那件围裙。他很快完成了烹饪，呼唤阿斯卡来餐桌旁。红发的她安静地走来坐下。真嗣将食物端上桌，女孩看到围裙时轻声笑了。他脱下围裙，坐下与阿斯卡共进晚餐。两位少年在友好的沉默中享用着餐食。真嗣趁阿斯卡不注意时深情地凝视她；今天她洗过的头发再次显得如此光彩夺目。他决心为了让她重回怀抱，任何事都值得，而今天似乎只是通往阿斯卡心路上的又一道障碍。

The boy resumed his meal as the girl had finished hers. The redhead placed her dish in the sink and returned to her room. Soon, Shinji had also finished and he placed his dish in the sink as well. He travelled down to the laundry, seeing that both the drying and washing had been completed. He removed the dry clothes and placed them in a basket, deciding to distribute the clothes tomorrow. The boy then took out the washed clothes from the washing machine and placed them into the dryer.  
男孩继续他的晚餐，而女孩已经吃完了。红发女孩将餐盘放入水槽，回到了自己的房间。不久，真嗣也吃完了，同样将餐盘放入水槽。他走到洗衣房，发现洗衣和烘干都已经完成。他取下干衣服放入篮子，决定明天再分发。接着，男孩从洗衣机中取出洗净的衣物，放入烘干机。

After switching it on, he moved about the house switching off all the lights. Shinji walked back to his room in the darkness. The pale moon shone through the window, allowing him to traverse the dark hallway back to his room. He entered his room, lay down on his bed and swiftly drifted off to sleep.  
启动烘干机后，他在屋内四处走动，关闭所有灯光。真嗣在黑暗中走回自己的房间。苍白的月光透过窗户，让他得以穿过黑暗的走廊回到房间。他进入房间，躺在床上，很快便沉沉睡去。

As for Asuka, she was still awake in her room, slowly dozing off. One thought kept nagging at the back of her mind as she finally found herself falling asleep; Shinji had admitted he liked her…  
至于明日香，她还在自己的房间里，渐渐陷入半睡半醒。一个念头在她即将入睡时不断萦绕在脑海；真嗣承认他喜欢她……

End Notes: This chapter was originally quite a bit different, but I changed it because I didn't like how too many things were resolved. I wonder who figured out the man that night was Kaji before it was revealed?  
尾注：这一章原本有很大不同，但我修改了，因为我不喜欢太多事情被解决的方式。我想知道是谁在那晚真相揭晓之前就猜到了那个男人是加持？

Also, a brief explanation for the part where Asuka was 'hitting' on Shinji; after hearing he had been fantasising about her she used the opportunity to prey on his current state, attempting to get information out of him.  
另外，关于明日香对真嗣‘调情’的那部分，简要解释一下；在得知他一直在幻想她之后，她利用这个机会趁虚而入，试图从他那里套取信息。

For those of you wondering, the song lyrics are from a song called 'Frozen' by Madonna, they are not my own creation.  
对于那些好奇的人，歌词来自麦当娜的歌曲《Frozen》，并非我自己的创作。

An extra note in regards to the what the ring said. Previously I had incorrectly written Spanish instead of Latin (my mistake), kind thanks to my reviewer AsukaIkari for noticing and letting me know.  
关于戒指所言的额外说明。先前我误将西班牙语写成了拉丁语（我的错），非常感谢我的审稿人 AsukaIkari 注意到并告知我。

### Chapter 13: The Commander Finds Out  
第 13 章：指挥官发现了真相

"You know why you are here?" he asked in his cold dispassionate tone.  
"你知道你为什么来这里吗？"他用他那冷漠无情的语气问道。

"No sir" she answered. "不知道，先生"她回答道。

"I have summoned you for a very important matter, I would like you to answer me with honesty" he replied.  
"我召见你是为了一个非常重要的事情，我希望你能诚实地回答我"他回答道。

"Yes sir" she affirmed. "是的，长官" 她确认道。

"Very well, I would like to know the current state of the second child. I was not given an adequate report on the effects the angel had on her" the Commander inquired.  
"很好，我想了解第二个孩子的当前状况。关于天使对她造成的影响，我没有得到充分的报告。" 指挥官询问道。

"She has recovered well and is doing fine, there is nothing more to report sir" she answered.  
"她恢复得很好，一切正常，没有更多需要报告的，长官" 她回答道。

"As head of tactical operations, you should know the danger of lying to your superior officer Major Katsuragi" he remarked.  
"作为战术行动的负责人，你应该知道对上级军官——葛城美子少校撒谎的危险性。"他评论道。

Sweat formed on Misato's brow as she stayed silent, thinking of something to say.  
汗水在美里额头上形成，她保持沉默，思考着该说些什么。

"I do not wish to lose such valuable personnel, however if you force me to, I will make sure you won't work here again and perhaps anywhere else as I don't like to leave loose ends" he said, grinning slightly. "I will ask you again, what is the current state of the second child?"  
"我不希望失去如此宝贵的人员，但如果你逼我这么做，我会确保你不会再在这里工作，甚至可能无处可去，因为我讨厌留下隐患。"他微微一笑，"我会再问你一次，二号机的现状如何？"

"She has lost her memory sir" the Major admitted.  
"她失去了记忆，长官。"少校承认道。

"How far back has she lost her memory?" the Commander asked.  
"她失去了多少记忆？"指挥官问道。

"She said she couldn't remember after the defeat of the 12th angel sir" she replied.  
"她说她记不得在第 12 使徒被击败之后的事情了，长官。"她回答道。

The Commander stayed silent as he pondered the new information for a while. He turned to face Misato as he came to a decision.  
指挥官沉默了一会儿，思考着新得到的信息。随后，他转身面对美里，做出了决定。

"Very well, arrange a sync test as soon as possible, I must see her ability to pilot. I also request to see the pilot of Unit 01 after the sync test. That is all"  
“很好，尽快安排同步测试，我必须亲眼看看她的驾驶能力。同步测试结束后，我还要求见一见零一机的驾驶员。就这样。”

"Sir!" she said, saluting him.  
“是，长官！”她向他敬礼道。

The Tactical Operations Director exited the Commander's office wearily, wondering what she had just set in motion. She had been given no choice but to tell him, he had practically threatened to kill her. Misato sighed tiredly as it was very early in the morning and she hadn't had any sleep yet. The Major walked back to her office to finish her paperwork and arrange a sync test today. The only thing keeping her awake was the fact that if she finished now, she could still have some sleep before the sync test.  
战术作战部长疲惫地离开了指挥官的办公室，心中疑惑自己刚刚启动了什么。她别无选择，只能告诉他，他几乎威胁要杀了她。Misato 叹了口气，疲惫不堪，因为时间还很早，她还没睡过觉。少校走回自己的办公室完成文书工作，并安排今天的同步测试。唯一让她保持清醒的是，如果现在完成，她还能在同步测试前睡一会儿。

"…_In the event it comes into conflict with your work, I will have you two separated immediately" he threatened. "And while we are here, Shinji do not disobey my orders again" he finished off._  
“…如果它与你的工作发生冲突，我会立即让你们两个分开”他威胁道。“而且既然我们在这里，真嗣，不要再违抗我的命令了”他最后说道。

"_Excuse me Commander, but I do not know what you are referring to" Shinji asked, confused._  
“对不起，指挥官，我不明白您指的是什么”真嗣困惑地问道。

"_In the last angel attack, I told you to stay in system freeze, yet you moved up the catapult to the surface" the Commander replied._  
“在上一次使徒袭击中，我命令你保持在系统冻结状态，但你却移动到了弹射器表面。” 司令回答道。

_Asuka spoke up to one up him. "Sir! With all due respect, the third child was coming out to save the star pilot of NERV" she said resolutely, "NERV can't afford to lose a pilot at a time like this"  
明日香不甘示弱地回敬道：“长官！恕我直言，第三适格者是出来拯救 NERV 的明星驾驶员的。”她坚定地说，“在这种时候，NERV 可承受不起失去一名驾驶员的损失。”_

"_And what is your point Sohryu?" he asked coldly._  
"那你想表达什么，双龙？" 他冷冷地问道。

"_I'd say the end justifies the means sir" she replied vindictively._  
"我认为结果能证明手段的正当性，长官。" 她报复性地回答。

_The Commander merely looked at the girl shocked; she had just used his life motto against him. The Sub-Commander behind him laughed shortly, before the older Ikari recomposed himself.  
指挥官只是震惊地看着女孩；她刚刚用他的生活信条反驳了他。他身后的副指挥官短暂地笑了一声，随后年长的碇重新调整了自己的情绪。_

"_One last thing" the Commander began, "I'm sure you are both aware of the issue with underage…"_  
“还有最后一件事，”司令官开口道，“我相信你们俩都清楚未成年……”

Asuka woke to the feeling of another presence in the room. The girl groaned, clearly annoyed. The unknown visitor had opened her door _very_ quietly and was sneaking towards her. The redhead lifted her head up to yell at Shinji for sneaking into her room. Suddenly, the girl had a look of terror on her face as she saw a man brandishing a gun aimed at her. Asuka reacted quickly, throwing her blanket up and leaping off the bed. The man fired several times and missed her completely.  
明日香醒来时感觉到房间里多了一个人。女孩咕哝着，显然很不高兴。这位不速之客悄无声息地推开了她的门，正偷偷摸摸地向她靠近。红发少女抬起头来，正要朝偷偷溜进她房间的真嗣大吼。突然，她脸上露出了惊恐的表情，因为她看到一个手持枪械的男人正瞄准着她。明日香反应迅速，猛地掀开被子，从床上跳了下来。那人连开数枪，却完全没打中她。

"SHINJI! MISATO!" she screamed.  
"真嗣！美里！" 她尖叫道。

The man turned to aim his gun at her, only to have it kicked out of his hand by Asuka. The man grabbed her leg and threw her across the room. She quickly lifted her head to see the man pull out a knife. The girl attempted to get up, but the man had already thrown the knife straight at her. She turned her head away, shielding her face with her arms.  
男子转身将枪对准她，却被明日香一脚踢飞。男子抓住她的腿，将她甩到房间另一边。她迅速抬起头，只见男子拔出一把刀。女孩试图起身，但男子已经将刀直直掷向她。她转过头，用双臂护住脸庞。

"Aahhhh" a voice cried out.  
"啊——" 一个声音哭喊道。

The redhead looked up, surprised to see Shinji with the knife pierced through his hand.  
红发少女抬头一看，惊讶地发现真嗣手上插着一把刀。

"You have to kill me first!" Shinji shouted at the man.  
“你得先杀了我！”真嗣对着那人大喊。

The young boy then pulled the knife out from his hand with a great cry of pain and threw it as hard as he could at the man. Surprised at the attack, the man didn't manage to dodge it completely and received a knife pierced through his shoulder. The man cried in outrage as he pulled the knife out and dropped it to the floor. Shinji clutched his injured hand in pain as it bled heavily. The assassin swiftly moved towards them and punched Shinji in the jaw. The male eva pilot fell over but before he received another blow, Asuka had kicked the man in the shins. He cried out in pain and Asuka picked up Shinji and began to move him to the door. However, the man quickly moved to block their path.  
少年随即痛苦地大叫一声，将手上的刀拔出，用尽全力朝那人扔去。那人被这突如其来的攻击吓了一跳，没能完全躲开，肩膀被刀刺穿。他愤怒地大叫，拔出刀丢在地上。真嗣紧握着受伤的手，鲜血直流，痛苦不堪。刺客迅速向他们逼近，一拳打在真嗣的下巴上。男性 EVA 驾驶员倒下了，但就在他即将再次受到攻击之前，明日香踢中了那人的小腿。他痛得大叫，明日香抱起真嗣，开始向门口移动。然而，那人迅速移动，挡住了他们的去路。

The man seemed to think the situation over and decided they would be too difficult to kill by normal means now and so he took out a grenade. The two teens looked at the weapon in shock. The man sneered as he pulled the pin out and held it up with his hand. The two eva pilots had no escape and Asuka held onto Shinji tight, at least happy that she wouldn't die alone.  
那男人似乎在仔细考虑当前的局势，认为现在用常规手段杀掉他们太过困难，于是他掏出了一枚手榴弹。两个少年看着那武器震惊不已。男人冷笑着拔出保险销，用手举起手榴弹。两位 EVA 驾驶员无处可逃，明日香紧紧抱住真嗣，至少欣慰自己不会孤独地死去。

The man's face exploded into a mass of flesh and blood as two gunshots were fired. Misato immediately appeared in front of them, grabbing the grenade and throwing it out the window. No sooner had it broke through the glass of the window when it exploded and Misato pulled the two teens down to the ground. After the explosion had dissipated, the guardian lifted her head up.  
那男人的脸突然炸裂成一团血肉模糊，两声枪响随之响起。美里立刻出现在他们面前，夺过手榴弹并将其扔出窗外。手榴弹刚打破窗户玻璃便爆炸了，美里迅速将两个少年按倒在地。爆炸声消散后，这位守护者抬起头来。

"You guys ok? I came into the house and heard noises coming from Asuka's room. I rushed here and you know the rest" Misato explained.  
“你们没事吧？我进屋听到明日香房间有动静，就冲了过来，剩下的你们都知道了。”美里解释道。

"I'm alright, but Shinji is wounded badly, we should take him to the hospital" Asuka replied immediately.  
"我没事，但真嗣伤得很重，我们应该送他去医院。" 明日香立刻回答道。

The two girls looked at the now unconscious brown-haired boy.  
两个女孩看着现在昏迷不醒的棕发男孩。

"Shit he's unconscious. What happened to him Asuka?" Misato asked, worried.  
"该死，他昏过去了。明日香，他怎么了？" 美里担忧地问道。

"He received a knife blow to the hand, it pierced right through and he's probably gone unconscious from blood loss" the young girl explained.  
"他的手被刀刺穿了，可能因为失血过多已经昏迷了" 年轻女孩解释道。

Misato looked at Shinji's hand in shock and hastily looked around for something to cover the wound and stop the bleeding.  
美里震惊地看着真嗣的手，急忙四处寻找可以包扎伤口、止血的东西。

"Asuka rip off some of your skirt! We need to stop the bleeding now" the Major directed.  
"明日香，撕下你裙子的一部分！我们现在需要立即止血" 美里指挥道。

The young girl was about to retort to tearing up her dress, but Shinji's life was in danger and she knew it was more important than a bit of fabric. She ripped off some fabric from the bottom of her skirt and handed it to Misato who wrapped it tightly around Shinji's hand. It quickly turned crimson as it became soaked in his blood.  
年轻女孩本想反驳撕破她的裙子，但知道真嗣的生命危在旦夕，这比一块布料重要得多。她从裙摆撕下一些布料，递给美里，美里紧紧包扎在真嗣的手上。布料很快被他的鲜血染成深红色。

"Come on Shinji, don't die on me now" Misato let out as she picked him up. "Come with me to the hospital Asuka, I'm sure you don't want to stay here after all that and besides there's a dead man in your room"  
“加油，真嗣，别现在就死在我面前。”美里说着抱起他。“跟我去医院吧，明日香，经历了这一切你肯定不想留在这里，再说你房间里还有个死人呢。”

"Agreed" Asuka replied. “同意。”明日香回答道。

The two girls hurriedly exited the apartment, running down the steps two at a time and rushing to Misato's parked car. Misato swiftly placed Shinji in the back as carefully as she could and turned to face the young girl.  
两个女孩急忙离开公寓，一步两阶地跑下楼梯，冲向美里停着的车。美里迅速而小心地将真嗣安置在后座，然后转身面对那位年轻女孩。

"Asuka I want you to stay in the back with Shinji, make sure he's okay and keep pressure on his wound to make sure he stops bleeding" the Major ordered.  
“明日香，我要你和真嗣一起待在后面，确保他没事，并持续按压他的伤口，确保他不再流血。”美里少校命令道。

"But-" Asuka started in protest.  
“但是——”明日香开始抗议。

"I don't care if you don't want to do this, I am giving you a direct order now do it!" Misato commanded.  
“我不在乎你是不是不想做这件事，我现在直接命令你去做！”美里命令道。

Asuka could see Misato was both immensely angry and worried; the redhead knew she should not argue with Misato in her current state. The young girl complied and got into the back with Shinji. Immediately, Misato drove off speeding as fast as she could to the hospital. Asuka took Shinji's hand, keeping pressure on his wound as Misato had asked. She could feel his pulse, it was weak but it was still there and she could hear him breathing; he was still alive.  
明日香可以看出美里既极度愤怒又担忧；红发女孩知道她不应该在美里目前的状态下与她争论。年轻的女孩顺从地和真嗣一起坐到后座。美里立刻开车疾驰，尽可能快地赶往医院。明日香握住真嗣的手，按照美里的要求保持对伤口的压力。她能感觉到他的脉搏，虽然微弱但依然存在，她还能听到他的呼吸；他还活着。

The redhead couldn't help but think about her actions earlier. She had held onto Shinji when she thought she was about to die. Asuka wanted to put it off as the fact that Shinji was the only one there, but she couldn't. Even now she could feel her distress at his current state and the feeling of dread in her heart. She couldn't stand this feeling; Shinji was slowly making his way past her defences and she couldn't figure out when it started. The young girl couldn't comprehend how all her efforts to push him away resulted in naught, he was like a barnacle stuck on a rock; he just wouldn't budge.  
红发女孩忍不住回想起自己早些时候的举动。当她以为自己快要死的时候，她紧紧抓住了真嗣。明日香想把这归咎于真嗣是当时唯一在场的人，但她做不到。即使现在，她也能感受到自己对他目前状况的焦虑和心中的恐惧感。她无法忍受这种感觉；真嗣正慢慢突破她的防线，而她却不知道这一切是从何时开始的。年轻的女孩无法理解，她所有试图推开他的努力都化为乌有，他就像岩石上的藤壶一样，怎么也不肯动摇。

It irritated her to no end how much everything had changed, how much he had changed. She couldn't control him or insult him like she used to, she wanted to go back to being totally independent and in power. Asuka hated the way he made her feel, but she couldn't hate him. Deep down inside she did not want to be alone. All these conflicting emotions stirred up unrest within the redhead. Very soon, however, they had arrived at the hospital. Misato slammed the brakes and promptly pulled the unconscious eva pilot out of the car, not caring where she had stopped the car. Asuka followed after her guardian with speed.  
一切都变了，他变了，这让她无比烦躁。她再也不能像以前那样控制他或侮辱他了，她渴望回到完全独立且掌控一切的状态。明日香讨厌他让她产生的感觉，但她无法恨他。内心深处，她并不想孤单一人。这些矛盾的情绪在红发少女心中激起了不安。然而，很快他们就到达了医院。美里猛踩刹车，迅速将失去意识的 EVA 驾驶员从车里拉出来，丝毫不关心自己把车停在了哪里。明日香紧随她的监护人，速度飞快。

"This boy needs medical attention fast!" Misato shouted when they got inside the hospital.  
“这孩子急需医疗救助！”美里一进医院就大声喊道。

At once, a few nurses and doctors took the young boy into their care and moved him into a suitable room to begin tending to his wound. As Misato tried to enter the room, she was stopped and told to wait outside. The Major sighed and sat down on the bench outside and motioned for Asuka to sit down next to her.  
立刻，几位护士和医生接过少年，将他转移到合适的房间开始处理伤口。美里试图进入房间，却被拦下并被告知在外面等候。少校叹了口气，坐在外面的长椅上，示意明日香坐在她旁边。

"I don't wanna hang around here for Shinji to be fixed, it's always such a boring wait" the redhead complained.  
“我不想在这里等真嗣修好，每次都这么无聊。”红发女孩抱怨道。

"Asuka, Shinji has recently waited for you twice in hospital, which both took a considerable number of hours. At least return the favour and wait here for him this time" Misato requested sternly.  
“明日香，真嗣最近在医院里等了你两次，每次都花了好几个小时。至少这次你该还个人情，在这里等他。”美里严肃地要求道。

The redhead grumbled but sat down next to Misato, waiting impatiently for the door to open. Hours passed by with no reports from the doctors, Asuka tapped her heel on the floor and sighed in irritation; waiting was just not her cup of tea. She looked around the hallway for about the thousandth time, as if expecting it to change from when she last looked.  
红发女孩嘟囔着，但还是坐在美里旁边，不耐烦地等待着门打开。几个小时过去了，医生没有任何消息，明日香用脚跟敲打着地面，叹了口气，显得很不耐烦；等待从来不是她的强项。她第无数次环顾走廊，仿佛期待着它与上次看时有所不同。

"Misato I can't wait any longer! I'm gonna go insane if I have to wait another hour" Asuka let out, nearing her limit.  
"美里，我不能再等了！再等一个小时我就要疯了" 明日香喊道，接近她的极限。

"You should learn to have some patience, besides, I have to go back to NERV now since I still have many things to arrange. You have to stay here in case he recovers" the older woman declared.  
"你应该学会有点耐心，再说了，我得回 NERV 了，因为还有很多事情要安排。你得留在这里以防他恢复" 年长的女人宣布道。

"Wait! You're gonna leave me here all alone?" Asuka asked incredulously.  
"等等！你要把我一个人留在这里？" 明日香难以置信地问道。

"Sorry but I have to go, we have a sync test today after all" Misato replied.  
"抱歉，但我得走了，毕竟今天我们有同步测试" 美里回答道。

"We do? But what about Shinji?" the young girl replied, surprised.  
"我们有吗？那真嗣怎么办？" 年轻女孩惊讶地回答。

"The Commander won't care. As soon as Shinji recovers, he'll make us start the sync test. He was very adamant about having one today" the older woman explained.  
"指挥官不会在意的。一旦真嗣恢复，他就会让我们开始同步测试。他今天非常坚持要进行一次测试" 年长的女人解释道。

"Fine! I'll wait one more hour and if he doesn't recover, I am leaving I don't care" Asuka declared.  
“好！我再等一个小时，如果他还不醒，我就不等了，管他呢。”明日香宣布道。

"Alright Asuka" Misato said, smiling slightly.  
“好吧，明日香。”美里微微一笑说道。

With that, the tactical operations director walked down the hallway and out of sight, leaving Asuka alone on the bench waiting for her co-worker. The redhead looked down at her hands, noticing Shinji's dried blood on her. He had saved her life, well at least saved her from getting badly injured. This was troublesome as now she was in Shinji's debt and Asuka did not like being in debt to someone. Maybe she could do one favour for him, she supposed she would ask him when he was well again.  
说完，战术作战部长沿着走廊走远，消失在视线中，留下明日香独自在长椅上等待她的同事。红发少女低头看着自己的双手，注意到上面沾着真嗣干涸的血迹。他救了她的命，至少是让她免受了重伤。这很麻烦，因为现在她欠了真嗣一个人情，而明日香不喜欢欠别人的。也许她可以为他做一件事，她想等他康复后再问他。

The door opened, interrupting her thoughts, and a doctor came out. "The boy has been treated and will survive. You may go see him now, but keep note he is exhausted due to loss of blood so don't make him more exhausted" he explained.  
门开了，打断了她的思绪，一位医生走了出来。“男孩已经接受了治疗，会活下来的。你现在可以去看他，但请注意，他因失血过多而非常疲惫，不要让他更加劳累。”他解释道。

"Err… thank you" she answered, walking into the room.  
“呃……谢谢”她回答着，走进了房间。

_'Might as well go see him, I didn't wait here for nothing'_ she thought.  
“不妨去看看他，我在这里等了这么久总不能白等”她心想。

As she entered the room, the doctor closed the door and walked off. Asuka looked at the sleeping form of Shinji on the bed. He had a peaceful face and was smiling slightly; she couldn't help thinking he looked cute. The girl looked down to his injured hand and saw it was properly bandaged and cleaned. Shinji looked a little paler than usual but otherwise appeared fine.  
当她走进房间，医生关上门离开了。明日香看着床上熟睡的 Shinji，他面容安详，嘴角微微上扬；她不禁觉得他看起来很可爱。女孩低头看向他受伤的手，发现它已经被妥善包扎和清洁。Shinji 看起来比平时苍白一些，但除此之外似乎并无大碍。

"Honestly you're just a big drama queen making all this fuss by going unconscious, you look absolutely fine" she said aloud to him.  
“老实说，你只是个大戏精，昏过去搞得这么大惊小怪，你看起来完全没事。”她大声对他说。

The redhead sighed, wondering if she should wait for him to wake up or just shake him awake herself. Her decision was never made as the boy decided to wake up himself. She noticed him stir and sat down next to him. Shinji looked around sleepily and noticed Asuka looking at him with curiosity.  
红发女孩叹了口气，不知道是该等他醒来还是自己摇醒他。她的决定还未做出，男孩就自己决定醒来了。她注意到他动了动，便坐到他旁边。Shinji 睡眼惺忪地环顾四周，注意到明日香正好奇地看着他。

"Asuka?" he asked. "明日香？" 他问道。

"The one and only" she answered.  
"如假包换" 她回答道。

At this, Shinji smiled. "Do I get a kiss to make me feel better?"  
听到这话，真嗣笑了。"那我能得到一个吻让我感觉好些吗？"

"Most definitely not, I only stayed here to wait for your recovery because Misato told me to. How's your hand you baka?" she retorted.  
“绝对不是，我留在这里只是因为美里让我等你康复。你的手怎么样了，笨蛋？”她反驳道。

"Why do you want to know? You gonna miss my expert fingers?" he joked.  
“你为什么想知道？你会想念我的专业手指吗？”他开玩笑说。

Asuka's face went red. _'What the hell?'_ she thought, before slapping Shinji hard.  
绫波的脸红了。‘搞什么鬼？’她想，然后狠狠地打了真嗣一巴掌。

"Look here you hentai, I was only curious if your hand was injured permanently" she retorted angrily.  
"听着，你这个变态，我只是好奇你的手是不是永久性受伤了" 她愤怒地反驳道。

The boy rubbed his red cheek, finally waking up fully. Realising what he had just said, Shinji blushed embarrassed; lucky she had slapped him or who knows what he would have said.  
男孩揉着他发红的脸颊，终于完全清醒过来。意识到自己刚才说了什么，真嗣尴尬得脸红；幸好她扇了他一巴掌，否则谁知道他还会说出什么来。

"Ah… I wasn't being serious Asuka!" he replied quickly. "Anyway, about my hand, the doctors said I was lucky. The knife pierced through without damaging any nerves or muscles, it went straight through flesh. However, it will take a while to heal and I'll have a permanent scar. Thankfully, full use of my hand will return so it's not so bad. The worst thing that happened to me was blood loss" he explained.  
"啊…我不是认真的，明日香！" 他迅速回答道。"不管怎样，关于我的手，医生说我运气不错。刀子穿透时没有伤到任何神经或肌肉，直接穿过了肉。不过，愈合需要一段时间，而且会留下永久性伤疤。幸运的是，我的手将完全恢复功能，所以还不算太糟。最糟糕的是失血过多。" 他解释道。

"Next time don't try to be such a hero, I can handle myself just fine" she said, poking him in the ribs.  
"下次别再逞英雄了，我完全能照顾好自己" 她一边说，一边戳了戳他的肋骨。

"I'll try to remember that next time" Shinji replied.  
"我会记住的，下次" 真嗣回答道。

"But still, you did prevent me from getting a serious injury so I kinda owe you one. Nevertheless, I don't like being in debt so… I'll give you one favour" Asuka offered.  
"不过，你确实阻止了我受重伤，所以我欠你一个人情。不过，我不喜欢欠债，所以……我会还你一个人情" 明日香提议道。

The boy thought for a bit, however, couldn't come to a decision on the spot. He decided he would choose it later. "You know I can't really think of anything at the moment, but I'll let you know when I do"  
男孩思索了一会儿，却无法当场做出决定。他决定稍后再作选择。“你知道我现在真的想不出什么，但我想到时会告诉你的。”

Asuka moved towards the room's exit and opened the door, before turning around to face him. "Alright, I better report your recovery to Misato. But you had better not even _think_ about trying to use this body as a favour"  
明日香走向房间的出口，打开门，然后转过身面对他。“好吧，我最好向美里报告你的恢复情况。但你最好别想着用这副身体来讨人情”

"It won't be anything like that" Shinji replied, "I promise"  
“不会那样的” 真嗣回答，“我保证”

Asuka eyed him in disbelief, "Really? You aren't going to ask me to do something nasty?" she said sceptically.  
明日香难以置信地盯着他，“真的吗？你不会是想让我做些恶心的事吧？”她怀疑地说。

"No Asuka" he said, rolling his eyes, "And don't sound so disheartened"  
“不，明日香。”他翻了个白眼，“别那么失望。”

Asuka exited the room, quietly pondering what the boy might eventually decide if it didn't involve her body. Then she finally registered what he had just said and turned around, fists raised.  
明日香走出房间，静静地思索着如果这件事与她的身体无关，男孩最终会做出什么决定。然后她终于反应过来他刚才说的话，转过身来，拳头紧握。

"Just wait till I get my hands on you third child!" she said, running back into the room, ready to pound the living hell out of Shinji.  
“等我抓到你这个老三，你就等着瞧吧！”她一边说，一边跑回房间，准备狠狠教训真嗣一顿。

The boy just laughed and threw a pillow at her in an attempt to slow her advance. Having no effect, he then covered himself with his arms in a pitiful attempt to defend himself. The girl broke through his defences almost immediately and proceeded to torture the pilot of Unit 01 with relentless poking. The redhead's actions were becoming unbearable as Shinji began to beg for her to stop.  
男孩只是笑着，试图用枕头减缓她的攻势。然而这毫无效果，他只好可怜兮兮地用双臂护住自己。女孩几乎立刻就突破了他的防线，开始无情地戳刺零一机驾驶员。随着真嗣开始恳求她停手，红发女孩的行为变得越发难以忍受。

"Please Asuka…ahhh…I can't take anymore" he said desperately.  
“求你了，明日香……啊……我受不了了”他绝望地说道。

"Not until you've learnt your lesson you perverted baka!" she refuted.  
"直到你吸取了教训，你这个变态笨蛋！"她反驳道。


_**"The boy has been treated and will survive. You may go see him now, but keep note he is exhausted due to loss of blood so don't make him more exhausted"  
"那男孩已经接受了治疗，会活下来的。你现在可以去见他了，但记住他因失血过多而非常疲惫，别让他更累了。"**_


Suddenly remembering what the doctor had said, Asuka decided to stop. Shinji looked up at her curiously.  
突然想起医生的话，明日香决定停下来。真嗣好奇地抬头看着她。

"I think you've learnt your lesson; besides I don't want you to pass out again. You're lucky this time third child, but next time I'll be sure to make you pay" she warned.  
"我想你已经吸取教训了；再说了，我不想你再晕过去。这次算你走运，老三，但下次我一定会让你付出代价"她警告道。

"Alright Asuka" Shinji replied, sweat dropping.  
"好的，明日香" 真嗣回答道，汗珠滑落。

The pilot of Unit 02 exited Shinji's room and closed the door. As she didn't have her mobile, she went looking around in the hospital for a phone. There was something depressing about the long white hallways and Asuka grew a bit uneasy travelling them alone. There were surprisingly few people at the hospital currently and thus Asuka did not make contact with any human life as she sought out a phone. Upon finally spotting one, she moved over to it and grabbed the receiver. She dialled Misato's number and listened to the dial tone as the phone rang.  
二号机驾驶员离开了真嗣的房间，关上了门。由于没有带手机，她开始在医院里寻找电话。长长的白色走廊给人一种压抑感，明日香独自穿行其中，感到有些不安。医院里出奇地人少，因此明日香在寻找电话的过程中没有遇到任何人。终于看到一部电话时，她走过去拿起听筒，拨通了美里小姐的号码，听着拨号音等待电话接通。

"Hello, this is Major Katsuragi speaking" Misato answered.  
"你好，我是葛城美里少校" 美里回答道。

"Hi Misato, it's me Asuka. Shinji has woken up and seems fine. He only looks a little paler than usual from blood loss and his hand is not permanently damaged" Asuka explained.  
"嗨，美里，是我，明日香。真嗣已经醒了，看起来没事。只是因为失血脸色比平时苍白一些，手也没有永久性损伤" 明日香解释道。

"That's good news Asuka! Glad to hear he's okay. I'll come by to pick you guys up soon then, thank you for waiting" Misato replied gratefully.  
"那真是好消息，明日香！很高兴听到他没事。我很快就来接你们，谢谢你们的等待" 美里感激地回答。

"Yeah yeah, but I'm still wondering what in the hell an assassin was doing in my room" Asuka remarked.  
“是是是，但我还是想知道，一个刺客到底在我的房间里干什么。”明日香说道。

"The situation has been reported to the Commander and he is currently 'briefing' Section 2, he was quite outraged at such a security breach. Also, a recording was found on the man. The contractor is unknown, however, he had specific orders to kill you and not Shinji if possible" Misato revealed.  
“情况已经报告给司令了，他正在向第二支部‘简报’，对这种安全漏洞非常愤怒。此外，在那个男人身上发现了一段录音。承包商身份不明，但他接到明确指令，尽可能杀掉你而不是真嗣。”美里透露道。

"Who do you think is behind this?" Asuka asked.  
“你觉得会是谁在背后指使？”明日香问道。

"No doubt it's Seele, probably required Shinji to finish the last angel but wanted to be rid of you so they could attack much easier" Misato answered.  
"毫无疑问是 Seele，可能要求真嗣完成对最后一个使徒的战斗，但想摆脱你，这样他们就能更容易发动攻击" 美里回答道。

"That isn't good, am I no longer safe?" Asuka replied, concerned.  
"那可不妙，我不再安全了吗？" 明日香担忧地回应。

"Don't worry Asuka, security will be increased significantly and be more alert, another incident should not occur" Misato reassured.  
"别担心，明日香，安保措施会大幅加强并更加警觉，应该不会再发生类似事件" 美里安慰道。

"It better not" Asuka shot back.  
"最好别这样" 明日香回敬道。

"Alright Asuka, I can't chat any longer. Just stay with Shinji until I arrive" Misato replied.  
"好了，明日香，我不能再聊了。你就待在真嗣那里，直到我过来" 美里回答。

Misato hung up and Asuka placed the receiver back down to its original position. The girl began her trip back to Shinji's room, making sure she didn't get lost. Upon arriving at her destination, she opened the door and entered the room. After closing the door behind her, she looked at the sleeping form of the male eva pilot. He was snoring slightly and a bit of drool trickled down his chin. Asuka grabbed a tissue and wiped off the offending saliva, thinking he looked ridiculous. She noticed she still had Shinji's dried-up blood on her hands and went over to the washroom to wash her hands. The water turned scarlet as she washed her hands clean. The girl finished and re-entered the room. She sat down next to Shinji's bed as she waited for Misato to come by and pick them up.  
美里挂了电话，明日香将听筒放回原位。女孩开始返回真嗣的房间，确保自己没有迷路。到达目的地后，她打开门进入房间。关上门后，她看着躺在床上熟睡的男性 eva 驾驶员。他轻微地打着呼噜，口水从下巴上滴落。明日香拿起一张纸巾，擦掉了那令人不快的口水，心想他看起来真是滑稽。她注意到手上还沾着真嗣干掉的血迹，便走到洗手间去洗手。水变成了鲜红色，她把手洗干净。女孩洗完后重新回到房间。她坐在真嗣的床边，等待美里来接他们。

The redhead suddenly recalled the dream she had in the morning. She and Shinji were discussing something with the Commander. The first thing he had said was a threat to separate them if something came into conflict with NERV. What was that something? Then Asuka had defended Shinji; even though she was proud she outsmarted the Commander, she still found it strange she would defend Shinji. Finally, the most annoying part being that she was interrupted in her dream because of that assassin. The Commander was about to say something but all she had caught was "underage." Well, they were underage for drinking, smoking, voting, nightclubs, marriage, purchasing knives and God knows what else; if only she had heard the next word.  
红发少女突然回想起早晨的那个梦。她和真嗣正与指挥官讨论着什么。他首先说的话是，如果有任何事物与 NERV 发生冲突，他将把他们分开。那究竟是什么事物呢？随后，明日香为真嗣辩护；尽管她为自己能智胜指挥官而感到自豪，但她仍觉得奇怪，自己会为真嗣辩护。最后，最令人恼火的是，她的梦因那个刺客而中断。指挥官正要说些什么，但她只听到了“未成年”这个词。好吧，他们在饮酒、吸烟、投票、夜店、结婚、购买刀具等方面都是未成年的，天知道还有什么；要是她能听到下一个词就好了。

The girl was broken out of her thoughts by the pilot of Unit 01 yawning quite loudly.  
女孩被初号机驾驶员相当大声的哈欠打断了思绪。

"You keep that gaping maw shut!" she shouted at him.  
“你给我闭上那张大嘴！”她朝他喊道。

"Hello to you too" Shinji said, chuckling, "I take it you talked to Misato already"  
"你也好" 真嗣笑着说，"我猜你已经和美里谈过了"

"I have and she's coming to pick us up soon" she replied.  
"是的，她很快就来接我们" 她回答道。

"What for? I've just been hospitalised" the boy said sitting up, confused.  
"为什么？我刚出院" 男孩坐起身，困惑地说。

"Don't be such a crybaby, a sync test has been arranged today and it's important that we both go. You should be happy that you're getting out of the hospital early" she explained.  
"别这么爱哭，今天安排了同步测试，我们俩都得去。你应该高兴能提前出院" 她解释道。

"Well that's true I guess. It won't be that much trouble either since I arrived here pretty quickly and have rested a bit" he conceded.  
"嗯，我想也是。既然我来得挺快，也休息了一会儿，应该不会太麻烦" 他让步道。

Seeing that she had some time before Misato came, the redhead decided to bring up this morning's dream, certain that it was a memory. "I have a question for you Shinji"  
看到 Misato 还没来，红发女孩决定提起今早的梦，确信那是记忆。"我有件事想问你，真嗣"

"Go ahead" he replied. “说吧”他回答道。

"I remembered us having a discussion with the Commander and he threatened to separate us. Then he brought up something about 'underage' and I couldn't remember past that. What was coming into conflict with NERV and what underage activity was he referring to?" Asuka asked.  
“我记得我们和指挥官讨论过，他威胁要把我们分开。然后他提到了什么‘未成年’，之后我就记不清了。NERV 和我们发生了什么冲突？他指的是哪种未成年活动？”明日香问道。

Shinji was really caught off guard, however thanked God she hadn't remembered any of the incriminating parts of the discussion. He didn't really have much time to come up with an excuse, so he said the first thing that came to his head.  
真嗣完全措手不及，但庆幸她没记起讨论中任何有罪的部分。他没太多时间编借口，于是脱口而出脑海中的第一个念头。

"He was scolding us for underage drinking" he lied.  
"他因为我们未成年饮酒而训斥我们" 他撒谎道。

"Huh?" she responded. "啊？" 她回应道。

"Well you see, alcohol's effect would be disastrous to an eva pilot" he continued.  
"嗯，你看，酒精对 EVA 驾驶员的影响将是灾难性的" 他继续说道。

"I get that part dumbass, but what has underage drinking got to do with anything?" she asked.  
"我知道那部分，傻瓜，但未成年饮酒跟这有什么关系？" 她问道。

"Well you see, one day Misato was at NERV and we were in the house alone. You challenged me to a beer drinking contest, saying that Misato wouldn't notice the beer missing as she had so much. I accepted the challenge and we started going through her beer like crazy, we were drinking so fast we didn't feel the effects till later. Suffice to say the Commander was not happy to see a pair of drunken eva pilots repainting Unit 01 to red" he explained.  
"你看，有一天美里在 NERV，我们独自在家。你挑战我进行啤酒比赛，说美里不会注意到啤酒少了，因为她有那么多。我接受了挑战，我们开始疯狂地喝她的啤酒，喝得太快，直到后来才感觉到效果。可以这么说，指挥官看到一对醉酒的 EVA 驾驶员把 01 号机重新涂成红色时，非常不高兴" 他解释道。

Asuka pissed herself, almost crying her eyes out with laughter. After she had started to breathe normally again, she eyed the boy with an amused expression. "Now damn, I wish I could remember that. I will admit the thought of drinking Misato's beer has crossed my mind, but I never thought we'd actually do it. Man, I would have loved to see the Commander's face"  
明日香笑得几乎要哭出来，眼泪都快笑出来了。等她开始正常呼吸后，她用一种好笑的表情看着男孩。"现在真该死，我真希望能记得那件事。我承认想过喝美里的啤酒，但从没想过我们真的会这么做。天哪，我真想看看指挥官的脸"

"The Commander had said that if our activities came into conflict with our work, we would be separated and that's what he was talking about" Shinji finished.  
"指挥官说过，如果我们的活动与工作发生冲突，我们就会被分开，他就是这个意思。" 真嗣总结道。

"Why wouldn't you have told me about that incident? It's absolutely hilarious" Asuka inquired.  
"你为什么不告诉我那件事？真是太搞笑了。" 明日香问道。

"I honestly forgot Asuka" he answered.  
"我真的忘了，明日香。" 他回答道。

"You seem to be forgetting a lot of things Shinji" Asuka said, eyeing him suspiciously.  
"你似乎忘记了很多事情，真嗣" 明日香说道，怀疑地盯着他。

Her stare-down was interrupted when the door to the room opened. In entered the tactical operations director with a slightly irritated expression on her face. The older woman's face softened a little when she saw Shinji. "How are you feeling Shinji? Are you ok?"  
她的盯视被房间门的打开打断了。战术作战部主任带着略显烦躁的表情走了进来。当她看到真嗣时，这位年长女性的表情稍微缓和了一些。"你感觉怎么样，真嗣？还好吗？"

"I'm much better now Misato, thanks" he replied, "Asuka already informed me about the sync test too"  
"我现在好多了，美里，谢谢" 他回答道，"明日香已经告诉我同步测试的事情了"

"Ok good… sorry to rush you, but we're going as soon as you change into some clothes Shinji. Come on Asuka, we'll wait outside while he changes" Misato announced.  
“好的，很好……抱歉催你，但你一换好衣服我们就出发，真嗣。快点，明日香，我们在外面等他换衣服。”美里宣布道。

Asuka exited the room and Misato chucked Shinji some new clothes before closing the door. The boy got up and hurriedly changed into his new attire. He let out a sigh at the close call between him and Asuka, she was really determined to catch him off guard and make him let slip some information. She was really good at it too, but he was surprisingly good at lying to her.  
明日香离开了房间，美里扔给真嗣一些新衣服后关上了门。男孩起身，匆忙换上新衣服。他松了一口气，庆幸自己差点被明日香逮个正着，她真的很坚决要让他措手不及，逼他说出一些信息。她在这方面真的很擅长，但他却出奇地擅长对她撒谎。

As he finished dressing up, he moved to the door and opened it. Outside, Misato and Asuka were waiting with their arms folded across their chests. They both looked up at the sound of the door opening and noticed Shinji exiting the room.  
当他穿好衣服，走向门口并打开门时，外面美里和明日香正双手交叉抱在胸前等待着。听到开门声，她们都抬头看向门口，注意到真嗣走出了房间。

"You ready Shinji?" Misato asked.  
"准备好了吗，真嗣？" 美里问道。

The boy nodded. 男孩点了点头。

"Let's go then" the Major declared.  
"那我们走吧" 少校宣布道。

The three of them walked out of the hospital together, Misato making sure to check Shinji out of the hospital. The three roommates walked through the parking lot towards their car. It was already early afternoon as the sun blazed down on them; the wait in the hospital had taken a while and thus much time had passed. This time, Asuka sat in the front as they entered the car and Shinji in the back.  
三人一同走出医院，美里确保为真嗣办理了出院手续。三位室友穿过停车场走向他们的车。此时已是午后，阳光炽烈，他们在医院等待了许久，时间已悄然流逝。这次，明日香坐在了前排，而真嗣则坐在了后排。

As Misato drove off, both teens were surprised to see the lack of recklessness she usually drove with. Misato on the other hand was not in any hurry to return to NERV and besides she didn't want the boy to pass out. The two eva pilots enjoyed a peaceful ride to NERV with their heartbeats steady for once. The two teens looked out the window, finally being able to, and enjoyed the cool wind sweeping past them as they drove. They didn't see many cars out, but it was Sunday and many people didn't work today and rested instead.  
当美里开车离开时，两位少年惊讶地发现她这次驾驶得异常平稳，没有了往常的鲁莽。美里并不急于返回 NERV，而且她也不希望男孩再次昏倒。两位 EVA 驾驶员享受着难得的平静旅程，心跳也难得平稳。两位少年望向窗外，终于有机会这么做，享受着疾驰中迎面而来的凉风。路上车辆不多，毕竟今天是周日，许多人选择休息而非工作。

Shinji turned his attention to the wonderful view of Asuka and her windswept hair. Her beautiful red hair blew across her face as she looked out the open window, seemingly caressing her graceful features. No matter where and when, Asuka was always just as beautiful as ever. Shinji hoped he could settle their relationship before he got lost in her charm.  
真嗣将注意力转向了明日香和她那被风吹乱的秀发所构成的美景。她美丽的红色长发随风飘扬，掠过脸庞，仿佛在轻抚她那优雅的五官。无论何时何地，明日香总是那么美丽动人。真嗣希望能在自己沉醉于她的魅力之前，能妥善解决他们之间的关系。

The boy quickly averted his gaze as the redhead turned around for a moment. He set his mind to the task at hand; he too was curious to see Asuka's results in the sync test. Finally, they arrived at NERV and Misato drove the car into the car elevator. As they went deeper and deeper into the earth, Misato started to dread what would happen. The older woman really didn't want to see her two charges upset and hoped the Commander wasn't planning anything miserable. Silence filled the car as they went further down.  
当红发少女转身的一刹那，男孩迅速移开了视线。他集中精神于手头的任务；他也对明日香在同步测试中的结果感到好奇。最终，他们抵达了 NERV，美里将车驶入了汽车电梯。随着他们越来越深入地下，美里开始担心即将发生的事情。这位年长的女性真的不想看到她的两个孩子沮丧，并希望指挥官没有计划什么糟糕的事情。随着他们继续下降，车内充满了沉默。

After reaching their destination, the three of them exited the car. As the two eva pilots began heading in the direction of the changing rooms, Misato stopped them.  
到达目的地后，三人下了车。当两位 EVA 驾驶员开始朝更衣室方向走去时，美里叫住了他们。

"That is not required, you will be doing this sync test naked" Misato announced.  
“不需要穿衣服，你们将裸体进行这次同步测试。”美里宣布道。

"What?" Asuka snapped, stopping in her tracks.  
“什么？”明日香突然停下脚步，厉声问道。

"Not now Asuka alright. You've done this before so get over it. This was a direct order from the Commander" Misato quickly refuted.  
“现在不是争论的时候，明日香。你以前也做过，就别纠结了。这是司令的直接命令。”美里迅速反驳道。

"Are all the Ikaris perverted or something?" the young girl shouted.  
“难道所有的伊卡洛斯都是变态吗？”年轻女孩大声喊道。

Misato couldn't help laughing while Shinji just sweat dropped at the comment.  
美里忍不住笑了起来，而真嗣则对这番评论汗颜。

"Look the sooner you do this, the sooner its over" Misato persuaded.  
“你看，你越早做这件事，就越早结束。”美里劝说道。

"Yeah, I just don't trust Shinji here not to peek at this perfect body" the redhead remarked warily.  
"是啊，我就是不相信真嗣这家伙不会偷看我这完美的身材" 红发女孩警惕地说道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes. "Let's just do this Asuka" he replied.  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼。"我们还是快点开始吧，明日香" 他回答道。

"Fine" Asuka shot back. "好吧" 明日香回敬道。

The two of them walked towards the eva cages while Misato headed to command. The two eva pilots walked in silence but both of them were thinking furiously. Shinji was debating whether or not he really could resist the temptation, and if not, whether he would survive or not. Asuka, on the other hand, was throwing every German curse she knew at the Commander. They arrived at the entry point for sanitation and noticed Rei was there as well.  
两人走向 EVA 笼舱，而美里则前往指挥室。两位 EVA 驾驶员沉默地走着，但各自心中思绪如潮。真嗣在纠结自己是否真的能抵挡住诱惑，如果不能，他是否能活下来。另一方面，明日香则在心中将她所知的所有德语脏话都骂向了司令官。他们到达了清洁入口，发现绫波也在那里。

"Please enter your entry cubicles" Ritsuko said over the P.A.  
“请进入各自的入口隔间。”律子通过扩音器说道。

The three eva pilots entered their individual cubicles and pulled up the screens. They stripped off their clothes and the cubicles went up as they were also elevators. The cleaning cycle began, washing the three teenagers several times, decontaminating them. The elevators stopped at a long white hallway.  
三位 EVA 驾驶员进入各自的隔间，拉起屏幕。他们脱下衣服，隔间升起，同时也作为电梯。清洁循环开始，多次冲洗着这三个青少年，对他们进行消毒。电梯停在一个长长的白色走廊上。

"Turning off visual cameras now" the voice said over the P.A.  
“现在关闭视觉摄像头。”广播中传来声音。

The three screen doors opened and Rei walked forward while the other two hesitated.  
三扇屏幕门打开，丽向前走去，而其他两人犹豫不决。

"What are you waiting for Ikari?" Asuka said, annoyed.  
“你在等什么，碇？”明日香不耐烦地说。

"Why are you waiting as well?" Shinji refuted.  
“你为什么也在等？”真嗣反驳道。

"Fine, we'll go at the same time" Asuka conceded, "On three, one…two…three"  
“好吧，我们一起走。”明日香让步道，“三二一，走！”

Both eva pilots began walking forward.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员开始向前走去。

"Don't you dare even think about looking" Asuka stated as they walked.  
"你敢看一眼试试" 明日香边走边说。

"Yes Asuka" he replied. "知道了，明日香" 他回答道。

"Pilot Sohryu, why are you concerned about Shinji seeing you without your clothes on? As I am aware of your current relationship, it shouldn't bother you" Rei commented.  
"驾驶员惣流，你为何担心真嗣看到你没穿衣服的样子？据我所知，你们现在的关系，这应该不会困扰你" 绫波评论道。

"WHAT!" Asuka shouted. "什么！" 明日香大喊道。

Shinji just looked at Rei incredulously; had she not been informed on Asuka's current state of mind?  
真嗣难以置信地看着丽；难道她不知道明日香现在的心情吗？

Rei then smiled slightly. "As Suzuhara said, you two act like a married couple, surely you wouldn't mind?" she joked.  
丽随后微微一笑。"正如铃原所说，你们俩表现得像一对夫妻，肯定不会介意吧？"她开玩笑道。

Asuka looked at her shocked. "Is that a joke? Coming from you Rei? Well, I never thought that was possible. Next thing you know, Kensuke has a girlfriend"  
明日香看着她，震惊不已。“你在开玩笑吧？绫波，你居然会这么说？我可从没想过这有可能。接下来你是不是要说，剑介都有女朋友了？”

Shinji sighed in relief, but grinned slightly at Asuka's comment.  
真嗣松了口气，但对明日香的话微微一笑。

"You three hurry up already, you're wasting too much time chatting" Ritsuko announced impatiently.  
“你们三个快点，别再浪费时间聊天了。”赤木律子不耐烦地宣布道。

"Hai" they all said. "嗨" 他们齐声说道。

In Shinji's peripheral vision, he caught Asuka's gaze upon him and he turned to face her grinning.  
在真嗣的余光中，他捕捉到了明日香注视着他的目光，他转过身来面对她，露出了笑容。

"Who's the one peeking?" he asked her.  
“谁在偷看呢？” 他问她。

She blushed embarrassed and looked away. Of course, Shinji used this opportunity to take a full view of her body. _'Mmhmm just as I remember, God that body was carved by angels I swear.'_ Her ample breasts bounced up and down slightly as she walked, mesmerising Shinji. The boy quickly snapped out of it, grateful for the chance to peek without injury; he would not risk it just for a longer glance. Asuka had returned her gaze forward just as he turned away. _'Phew that was close'_ he thought.  
她羞涩地脸红了，转过头去。当然，真嗣利用这个机会好好打量了她的全身。'嗯哼，和我记忆中一样，天哪，那身材简直是天使雕刻出来的，我发誓。' 她丰满的胸部随着步伐微微上下弹跳，让真嗣看得入迷。男孩迅速回过神来，庆幸有机会偷看而没有受伤；他不会为了多看一眼而冒险。明日香刚好在他转开视线时重新看向前方。'呼，好险' 他想。

They reached the end of the hallway and the access point into their simulation plugs. The three eva pilots entered their respective simulation plugs and closed the hatch. LCL filled their entry plugs and all three pilots inhaled the liquid. As the entry plugs were lowered, Shinji recalled the last time they did their sync test with the simulation bodies and wondered why his father wanted to do it again. Last time, the three of them had been ejected not long after the test had started. They had later been briefed that a virus like angel had attacked NERV.  
他们走到了走廊的尽头，到达了进入模拟驾驶舱的接入点。三位 EVA 驾驶员各自进入了自己的模拟驾驶舱并关闭了舱门。LCL 液体充满了他们的驾驶舱，三位驾驶员吸入了这种液体。随着驾驶舱被放下，真嗣回想起上次他们用模拟身体进行同步测试的情景，不明白为什么父亲这次又要他们做同样的测试。上次，测试开始不久后他们就被弹射了出来。后来他们被告知，一种类似使徒的病毒攻击了 NERV。

"Begin the test" Ritsuko announced.  
“开始测试” 律子宣布道。

"Hai" Maya replied, starting the process.  
"嗨" 玛雅回应道，启动了程序。

The three young faces on the screen were impassive as they concentrated, feeling the familiar yet odd sensation of synchronisation; they weren't yet connected to their actual evas. As the pressure in the plug stabilised, Asuka's face changed slightly before resuming its look of concentration.  
屏幕上的三张年轻面孔毫无表情，他们全神贯注，感受着熟悉却又奇异的同步感；他们尚未与实际的 EVA 连接。当插入栓内的压力稳定后，明日香的脸色微微一变，随即又恢复了专注的神情。

"Start synchronisation with the evas" Ritsuko ordered.  
"开始与 EVA 同步" 律子命令道。

As the pilot's entry plugs made contact with their evas, Ritsuko began calculating data. The sound of typing was heard throughout the lab as Ritsuko and Maya did their work.  
随着驾驶员的插入栓与 EVA 连接，律子开始计算数据。实验室里回荡着键盘敲击声，律子和真希波忙碌着。

"What are the results?" Misato said impatiently, after a while.  
“结果如何？”过了一会儿，美里不耐烦地问道。

"Rei is at 60 percent, much higher than usual" Maya answered.  
“零的同步率达到了 60%，比平时高很多。”真希波回答道。

"What about the others?" Misato asked.  
"其他人呢？" 美里问道。

"Still working on it. Their sync ratios seem to be fluctuating from around 70 to 90 percent and we are waiting for a stable result" Maya replied.  
"还在进行中。他们的同步率似乎在 70%到 90%之间波动，我们正在等待一个稳定的结果。" 真耶回答道。

"Increase the synchronisation bandwidth for Shinji and Asuka" Ritsuko suggested.  
"增加真嗣和明日香的同步带宽。" 律子建议道。

Maya subsequently did so and both pilots' faces twitched slightly, feeling as if their mind was being fed lots of information. Soon after, Asuka's sync ratio slowly became more stable. Shinji's sync ratio also seemed to start stablising.  
随后，玛雅照做了，两位驾驶员的脸部微微抽动，仿佛大量信息涌入脑海。不久后，明日香的同步率逐渐趋于稳定。真嗣的同步率也似乎开始稳定下来。

"Shinji's ratio has finally stabilised at 91.2 percent, Asuka's is still fluctuating" Maya announced.  
“真嗣的同步率终于稳定在 91.2%，明日香的还在波动。”玛雅宣布道。

The technicians waited patiently, while analysing all the data, for Asuka's sync ratio to become apparent. Asuka on the other hand was having a hard time syncing with her eva; with her memory being a couple months different, the eva took a while to re-adjust.  
技术人员耐心等待，同时分析所有数据，以期明日香的同步率显现。而明日香这边，与 EVA 的同步却颇为艰难；由于记忆相差数月，EVA 需要一段时间重新调整。

"Asuka's sync ratio has finally stabilised at 99.9 percent!" Maya declared.  
“明日香的同步率终于稳定在 99.9%了！”玛雅宣布道。

"What? How is that possible?" Misato asked in disbelief.  
“什么？这怎么可能？”美里难以置信地问道。

"The Magi concludes there is a 0.000000001 percent chance of the data being wrong, we all know what the 'o' nine means. This data is accurate" Ritsuko replied.  
“MAGI 计算出数据出错的几率只有 0.000000001%，我们都知道那个‘零’九意味着什么。这份数据是准确的。”律子回答道。

"Shinji, Asuka great news" Misato announced through the comms.  
"真嗣，明日香，好消息" 美里通过通讯器宣布道。

Both Shinji and Asuka opened their eyes, looking at Misato's face on the viewscreen expectantly.  
真嗣和明日香都睁大了眼睛，期待地看着显示屏上美里的脸。

"Well go ahead and tell us" Asuka said impatiently.  
"快说吧，别卖关子了" 明日香不耐烦地说。

"Shinji your sync ratio is at 91.2, not much lower than what it was the last time. Asuka your sync ratio is at an amazing 99.9 and as always you are in the lead. It would seem your current state has not affected your sync ratio" Misato explained.  
"真嗣，你的同步率是 91.2，比上次没低多少。明日香，你的同步率惊人地达到了 99.9，一如既往地领先。看来你目前的状态并没有影响你的同步率" 美里解释道。

Asuka smiled smugly. "Was there ever any doubt at my superior skill?" she said arrogantly.  
明日香得意地笑了。"我的超凡技艺有过任何疑问吗？" 她傲慢地说道。

Suddenly, alarms sounded and the screens were soon covered with _**Error**_.  
突然，警报声响起，屏幕很快被错误信息覆盖。

"What's wrong Ritsuko?" Misato asked, worried.  
“怎么了，律子？”美里担忧地问道。

"Synchronisation is out of control with Asuka's plug! The simulation body seems to be interfering with the communication to Unit 02!" Ritsuko answered quickly.  
“同步率在明日香的插入栓中失控了！模拟体似乎正在干扰与 02 号机的通讯！”律子迅速回答。

Asuka's face went pale as she suddenly felt sick, the urge to vomit becoming intense. "What's going on?" the redhead struggled to ask.  
明日香的脸色变得苍白，她突然感到一阵恶心，呕吐感变得强烈。“发生了什么？”红发少女挣扎着问道。

"Stop the test!" Misato ordered.  
"停止测试！" 美里命令道。

"But-" Ritsuko began. "但是——" 律子刚开口。

"Now!" Misato demanded. "现在！" 美里要求道。

Maya stopped the synchronisation process and Asuka's eyes rolled back as the abrupt cutoff caused her to pass out.  
玛雅停止了同步过程，明日香的双眼翻白，突如其来的中断让她昏了过去。

"Asuka has gone unconscious! Quickly, raise her entry plug" Ritsuko ordered.  
“明日香失去意识了！快，升起她的插入栓。”律子命令道。

Her entry plug, as well as the other two, were quickly raised up.  
她的插入栓，连同其他两个，迅速被升了起来。

"Opening hatches now!" Ritsuko called out.  
"现在打开舱门！" 律子喊道。

At once, LCL poured out into the hallway as the entry plugs were emptied. Shinji jumped out and quickly ran over to Asuka's vessel and pulled her out. He held the naked girl in his arms and shook her in an attempt to wake her up.  
随即，LCL 涌入走廊，插入栓被清空。真嗣跳出来，迅速跑到明日香的驾驶舱旁，将她拉出。他抱着赤裸的女孩，摇晃着试图唤醒她。

"Come on Asuka, wake up!" he said desperately.  
"快醒醒，明日香！" 他绝望地说道。

The redhead stirred slowly and opened her eyes finding the concerned face of Shinji. The boy noticed her return to consciousness and smiled happily. "It's alright, she woke up" he called out.  
红发女孩缓缓动了一下，睁开眼睛，看到了真嗣关切的面庞。男孩注意到她恢复了意识，开心地笑了。“没事了，她醒了。”他大声喊道。

Everyone at command sighed in relief.  
指挥室里的每个人都松了一口气。

"Alright, that will conclude our sync tests for today. I'm not sure we will use the simulation bodies again for further sync tests" Ritsuko said over the P.A.  
“好了，今天的同步测试就到这里。我不确定我们还会不会再用模拟身体进行进一步的同步测试。”律子通过扩音器说道。

At this point, the redhead became self-conscious of her position; she was stark naked and being held up by Shinji who was also naked.  
此时，红发女孩开始意识到自己的处境；她一丝不挂，被同样赤裸的 Shinji 抱在怀里。

"Are you ok Asuka?" he asked.  
“你还好吗，明日香？”他问道。

He received a large hand-shaped mark on his cheek as his answer.  
他的脸颊上留下了一个大大的手掌印，作为回答。

"Let go of me, you hentai! I will not stand by while you violate me" Asuka shouted.  
“放开我，你这个变态！我不会坐视你侵犯我的。”明日香大喊道。

Everyone, even Rei, sweat dropped and felt a little sympathy towards the boy. Shinji let her down, while Asuka was blushing furiously. She quickly covered herself with her arms.  
所有人都，包括绫波，都汗颜了，对那个男孩产生了一丝同情。真嗣放下了她，而明日香则满脸通红，迅速用双臂遮住自己。

"You were unconscious Asuka, I was only checking if you were ok" Shinji replied, defending himself.  
“你当时昏迷了，明日香，我只是检查你是否没事。”真嗣回答道，为自己辩解。

"Bullshit! You wanted to sneak a peek! Well, you're _not_ getting any more peeks" the redhead retorted.  
“胡说八道！你就是想偷看！哼，别想再看了。”红发女孩反驳道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes at her behaviour. "Alright Asuka, I'll go first" he said, shaking his head. The boy turned around and begun to walk down the hallway towards the exit.  
真嗣只是对她翻了个白眼。“好吧，明日香，我先走。”他说着摇了摇头。男孩转身开始沿着走廊向出口走去。

"Shinji was only concerned about your well-being pilot Sohryu, there is no need to be angry with him" Rei stated.  
“真嗣只关心你的安危，草薙驾驶员，没必要对他生气。”丽陈述道。

"Shut up Rei! If I wanted _your_ opinion, I would just buy a doll and pull its string" Asuka shot back nastily.  
"闭嘴，丽！如果我想听你的意见，我会买个玩偶然后拉它的线" 明日香恶狠狠地回击道。

SLAP!

Asuka looked shocked as she felt the sting of Shinji's hand on her cheek.  
明日香感到震惊，因为她的脸颊感受到了真嗣手掌的刺痛。

"Asuka, you have no right to say such a thing about Rei. She has improved, if you haven't noticed, but you're still the same bitch" he snapped.  
"明日香，你没有权利这样评价丽。如果你没注意到，她已经进步了，而你还是那个泼妇" 他厉声说道。

"Why you-" Asuka started.  
“你为什么——”明日香开口道。

"Your arrogance never ceases to amaze me" Shinji said interrupting her before turning around and walking off, not looking back.  
“你的傲慢真是无时无刻不让我惊叹。”真嗣打断她，转身离开，没有回头。

The redhead just looked at the retreating form of the boy in stunned silence. Never would she be questioned, never would she be ignored, but this boy had done both. She gritted her teeth in anger; she hated how much his words affected her. Why couldn't she just shrug off what he said? Why did it hurt her to hear it coming from him? The redhead broke out of her stupor and began walking down the hallway towards the exit. The P.A. was silent as she traversed down the hallway. Shinji's words kept repeating in her head.  
红发少女只是呆呆地看着男孩远去的背影，陷入了沉默。她从未被质疑过，从未被忽视过，但这个男孩却两样都做了。她咬紧牙关，心中愤怒；她讨厌他的话对她影响如此之大。为什么她不能对他的话置之不理？为什么从他嘴里说出来会让她感到受伤？红发少女从恍惚中回过神来，开始沿着走廊向出口走去。当她穿过走廊时，广播系统一片寂静。真嗣的话在她脑海中不断回响。


…_**you're still the same bitch… your arrogance never ceases to amaze me…**_  
…你还是那个婊子…你的傲慢真是让我叹为观止…


'_Why should it matter if he thinks I'm a bitch? He's just a perverted baka! One who's probably having an affair with Rei or something, what the hell does he see in her…'_ she thought.  
'他觉得我是婊子又怎样？他不过是个变态的笨蛋！八成还和丽有一腿什么的，他到底看上她哪点了…'她心想。

Asuka continued to sulk until she reached the exit. Her body was cleaned by the automatic cleaning system and she dressed into her clothes. The elevator went back down to the eva cages and she exited her cubicle.  
明日香继续闷闷不乐地走到出口。她的身体被自动清洁系统清洗干净，然后穿上衣服。电梯回到 eva 笼区，她走出自己的隔间。

"Shinji, the Commander has requested your presence. Go see him now" Misato announced over the P.A.  
“真嗣，司令官要见你。现在就去见他。”美里通过广播宣布道。

Asuka just swore loudly in German. She noticed Shinji running off in the direction of the elevators. The boy had not seen her and she decided to follow him. The girl was quite curious as to what the Commander had to say to him and not to her, besides she was still angry at the boy. Asuka waited out of sight until Shinji entered the elevator. She then quickly ran down the corridor and entered the second elevator. She pressed the floor number for the Commander's office and the elevator began its ascent.  
明日香刚刚用德语大声咒骂了一句。她注意到真嗣朝电梯的方向跑去。男孩没有看到她，而她决定跟上去。女孩很好奇司令官要对他说些什么，而不是对她，此外，她仍然对那个男孩感到愤怒。明日香躲在暗处，直到真嗣进入电梯。然后她迅速跑过走廊，进入第二部电梯。她按下了司令官办公室的楼层号码，电梯开始上升。

She tapped her heels impatiently as the elevator moved slowly as always. Finally, the elevator reached the level and Asuka stood at the door ready to walk through. After the doors opened, she jumped back in surprise as she saw the amused expression of Shinji Ikari.  
她不耐烦地用高跟鞋敲打着地面，电梯一如既往地缓慢移动。终于，电梯到达了楼层，明日香站在门口准备走进去。门一打开，她惊讶地跳了回来，因为她看到了真嗣·碇那副好笑的表情。

"I knew it was you" he said, smiling.  
"我就知道是你" 他笑着说。

"How did you-?" she started.  
"你怎么会-？" 她开口问道。

"When I reached this level, I noticed the other elevator had begun to move to this level" he interrupted. "I was curious as to who would have followed me"  
"当我到达这一层时，我发现另一部电梯也开始向这一层移动" 他打断道。"我很好奇是谁跟着我"

"I just wanted to know what the Commander was going to tell you" she said indignantly.  
"我只是想知道指挥官要告诉你什么" 她愤愤不平地说道。

"Look Asuka… about before, I know you hate it but… I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry. I shouldn't have hit you" he apologised.  
"听着，明日香……关于之前的事，我知道你讨厌这样……但，我很抱歉，我是真心的道歉。我不该打你的" 他道歉道。

The girl looked at him curiously. "Honestly Ikari, I don't know where you got the courage to confront me like that and why you even care what I say about Rei" she remarked.  
女孩好奇地看着他。"老实说，真嗣，我不知道你哪来的勇气那样面对我，还有你为什么在乎我说绫波什么" 她评论道。

"She is a human, well half human, as well. She has feelings, she's just a little different from others" he replied. "Anyways, I've decided upon your favour"  
"她是个半人半神，也有人类的情感，只是和别人有点不同。" 他回答道，"无论如何，我已经决定支持你了。"

"Oh?" Asuka prompted, raising her eyebrow at him.  
"哦？" 明日香催促道，挑起眉毛看着他。

"I want you to stop insulting Rei, stop calling her a doll or wondergirl" he answered.  
"我希望你不要再侮辱丽，不要再叫她人偶或是奇迹女孩。" 他回答说。

"What…? You're gonna waste my favour on _that_?" the redhead let out, perplexed.  
"什么…？你要把我的恩惠浪费在那上面？" 红发女孩困惑地喊道。

Shinji just laughed at Asuka's remark. "You are so unbelievable Asuka, yes I'm gonna 'waste' it on that"  
真嗣对明日香的话只是笑了笑。"你真是不可理喻，明日香，没错，我就是要'浪费'在这上面。"

"Ok fine, but I still get to call her wondergirl" she refuted.  
"好吧，好吧，但我还是能叫她'奇迹女孩'。" 她反驳道。

"Only to me" he countered.  
"只对我一个人" 他反驳道。

"Fine" she agreed. "好吧" 她同意道。

Shinji turned around, ready to begin walking to the Commander's office.  
真嗣转过身来，准备开始走向指挥官的办公室。

"I get it… your favour, defending her… I also remember her hugging you after the drowning incident… you like Rei, don't you? Why don't you just have sex already or whatever" Asuka remarked; he had to have feelings for the first child, though just mentioning those words made the redhead feel perturbed.  
"我明白了……你的偏爱，保护她……我也记得她在你溺水后拥抱你的情景……你喜欢丽，对吧？为什么不干脆做爱或者别的什么呢" 明日香评论道；他肯定对第一适格者有感情，尽管只是提到这些词就让红发女孩感到不安。

Shinji faced Asuka again, shaking his head. "I most definitely do _not_ like Rei in that way, nor do I wish to sleep with her" he rebuked. "And Rei hugged me because she was just relieved I was alive"  
真嗣再次面对明日香，摇了摇头。"我绝对不是那种喜欢丽的方式，也不想和她发生关系"他反驳道。"而丽拥抱我只是因为她很庆幸我还活着"

"Bull crap! Prove it to me right now or the deal is off!" the redhead replied obstinately.  
"胡说八道！现在就证明给我看，不然交易取消！"红发女孩固执地回答。

Spontaneously, Shinji grabbed Asuka and kissed her hard on the lips. Asuka stood there stunned as the boy began to kiss her deeply. Finally comprehending what was happening, the girl shoved him off her.  
突然间，真嗣抓住明日香，用力吻上了她的唇。明日香愣在原地，男孩开始深情地吻她。终于明白发生了什么，女孩猛地将他推开。

"There's your proof Asuka" he said, walking off.  
“这就是证据，明日香。”他说着，转身离开。

The redhead contemplated the boy's actions; he hadn't hesitated at all, not even slightly, maybe he really didn't feel that way about Rei. But still, why did he care about the first child? More importantly, why did she care about Shinji's likes or dislikes. _'When we get home, I'll be sure to give Shinji what he deserves. There's no way I'll let him get away with that!'_ she thought.  
红发女孩思考着男孩的行为；他完全没有犹豫，一点都没有，也许他真的对绫波没有那种感觉。但即便如此，他为什么在乎第一适格者？更重要的是，她为什么在乎真嗣的喜好或厌恶。‘回家后，我一定要让真嗣得到他应得的。绝不会让他就这样逃脱！’她心想。

Asuka hurried after Shinji and walked beside him. She wondered why Shinji had not stayed angry at her and wondered even more why she hadn't stayed angry at him either. Dismissing her thoughts, the two eva pilots arrived at the Commander's office together. The two hesitated momentarily before Shinji reached out and opened the door. The two teens walked into the darkness of the Commander's office, blinking to adjust their eyes. The Commander sat in his usual pose at his desk and looked down upon them.  
明日香急忙跟上真嗣，走在他身旁。她不明白为什么真嗣没有继续生她的气，更不明白为什么她也没有继续生他的气。抛开这些思绪，两位 EVA 驾驶员一同来到了司令的办公室。两人犹豫了一下，真嗣伸手推开了门。两个少年走进了司令办公室的黑暗中，眨眼适应着光线。司令坐在他惯常的位置上，俯视着他们。

"I requested to see the pilot of Unit 01 only, why are you here Pilot Sohryu?" the Commander remarked.  
“我只要求见初号机驾驶员，为什么你也在这里，惣流·明日香？”司令说道。

"Anything concerning a fellow eva pilot, concerns me" Asuka retorted.  
“任何关于 EVA 驾驶员的事，都与我有关。”明日香反驳道。

"While you are right that the matter to be discussed concerns you, you do not have the privilege of being an audience to the discussion. Dismissed" the Commander simply replied.  
"虽然你确实有权参与讨论，但你没有旁听的特权。退下。"指挥官简短地回答道。

Asuka looked at the Commander in disbelief and stayed where she was in defiance.  
明日香难以置信地看着指挥官，倔强地站在原地不动。

"Did I not make myself clear Pilot Sohryu? Do not make me repeat myself" the Commander warned.  
"我表达得不够清楚吗，惣流·明日香？别让我重复自己。"指挥官警告道。

"Yes sir" she huffed, turning around and exiting the office.  
“是的，长官。”她哼了一声，转身离开了办公室。

After hearing the door close, the Commander turned his attention to his son.  
听到门关闭的声音后，指挥官将注意力转向了他的儿子。

"I have brought you here to discuss a very important matter, given the nature of the second child you would do well to listen" Gendo started.  
“我带你来这里是为了讨论一件非常重要的事情，鉴于你第二个孩子的性质，你最好仔细听，”源渡开始说道。

"What exactly do you want to discuss?' Shinji asked, confused.  
"你究竟想讨论什么？' 真嗣问道，感到困惑。

The older man allowed a small smile to form on his usually cold expression. "It has come to my attention that the relationship between you and the second child has ended due to her loss of memory" he commented.  
年长的男人在他通常冷漠的表情上露出一丝微笑。"我注意到，你和二号机驾驶员的关系因她失忆而结束了"他评论道。

"That is correct sir" Shinji responded, wondering how he had found out.  
"确实如此，先生" 真嗣回答，好奇他是如何得知的。

"However, your sync ratios are still high at the moment and I have decided on a course of action that should prove to be beneficial" the Commander continued.  
“然而，你的同步率目前仍然很高，我已决定采取一项措施，应该会证明是有益的。”指挥官继续说道。

"I'm listening" Shinji replied.  
“我在听。”真嗣回答。

---

Asuka waited outside in irritation. She had tried several times to listen in on the conversation, but alas the door was soundproof. _'Stupid Commander, who does he think he is? The saviour of the world?'_ Then she thought about it, he actually was in a way. _'Well, it still doesn't give him the right to order me out like that.'_ The girl sighed as she knew another secret was now being kept from her.  
明日香在外面焦躁地等待着。她尝试了好几次想偷听对话，但遗憾的是门是隔音的。‘这个愚蠢的指挥官，他以为自己是谁？世界的救世主吗？’随即她又想了想，某种程度上他的确是。‘好吧，这依然不能成为他那样把我赶出来的理由。’女孩叹了口气，她知道又一个秘密即将被瞒着她。

She paced around wondering how long it could possibly take for them to finish their discussion. "I bet they're arguing if I look better in a swimsuit or a bikini" she said aloud to herself.  
她来回踱步，心想他们的讨论到底要多久才能结束。“我打赌他们肯定在争论我穿泳装好看还是比基尼好看。”她自言自语道。

Someone behind her laughed and Asuka jumped, startled. The redhead turned around to see her guardian walking up to her.  
身后有人笑了一声，明日香吓了一跳。红发女孩转过身，看到她的监护人正向她走来。

"What are you doing here Misato?" the young girl asked.  
“美里，你在这里做什么？”少女问道。

"I could ask you the same thing" Misato replied.  
"我也可以问你同样的问题" 美里回答道。

"I think my presence here is self-explanatory, however, yours is not" Asuka refuted.  
"我认为我在这里的存在是不言自明的，然而，你的却不是" 明日香反驳道。

"I couldn't find you Asuka, so I came here to see if you went here. I'll be taking us back to the apartment after the Commander and Shinji have finished" the older woman answered.  
"我找不到你，明日香，所以来这里看看你是不是来了这儿。等司令和真嗣结束后，我会带我们回公寓" 年长的女人回答道。

"They've been at it for a while" Asuka commented, "But doesn't our apartment have a dead guy as well as a half-exploded room?"  
"他们已经忙活了一阵子了" 明日香评论道，"但我们公寓里不是还有个死人和半炸毁的房间吗？"

"Not to worry, it has all been cleaned and fixed up. Your room is back to normal and no trace is left of what happened" Misato explained.  
"别担心，一切都已清理修复完毕。你的房间恢复如初，发生过的事情没有留下任何痕迹" 美里解释道。"

"Good" Asuka replied with relief.  
"那就好" 明日香松了口气回答道。"

The two girls waited outside the Commander's office in silence for Shinji to finish. After a few more minutes, the door finally opened and out emerged Shinji with a surprised look on his face.  
两个女孩静静地等在指挥官办公室外，直到真嗣结束。几分钟后，门终于打开，真嗣带着一脸惊讶的表情走了出来。

"What did the Commander say?" Asuka asked immediately.  
“指挥官说什么了？”明日香立刻问道。

"Don't worry, it's not important" Shinji said dismissively. "Oh! Hey Misato" he greeted, trying to change the subject.  
“别担心，不重要。”真嗣不以为意地说。“哦！嘿，美里。”他打招呼，试图转移话题。

"Hey Shinji!" Misato replied, "We're going back to the apartment now. Thankfully, it has all been cleaned up so there should be no issue"  
"嘿，真嗣！" 美里回答道，"我们现在要回公寓了。谢天谢地，那里已经全部打扫干净了，应该不会有问题。"

"Great, we've already spent too much time here" he replied.  
"太好了，我们在这里已经待得太久了" 他回答说。"

Asuka did not appreciate how he had just brushed her off but remained silent; she already knew he wasn't going to tell her. The three roommates made their way to the elevator, glad that they could finally leave. Today had been quite hectic and incident after incident had left the three quite exhausted. They entered the elevator and Misato pressed the floor number where she had left the car. The elevator began its long journey down through the depths of NERV.  
明日香并不喜欢他这样轻描淡写地打发她，但还是保持沉默；她早已知道他不会告诉她。三个室友走向电梯，庆幸终于可以离开了。今天真是忙得不可开交，一连串的事件让三人都疲惫不堪。他们进入电梯，美里按下了她停车楼层的按钮。电梯开始缓缓下降，穿过 NERV 深邃的地下空间。

"So, have you two made up already? I heard the argument back after the sync test" Misato prodded.  
“那么，你们俩已经和好了吗？我听到同步测试后你们在吵架。”美里试探性地问道。

"No! I plan to give Shinji what he deserves when we return to the apartment and then I _might_ consider forgiving him" Asuka retorted.  
“没有！我打算回到公寓后给真嗣他应得的教训，然后再考虑是否原谅他。”明日香反驳道。

Shinji sweat dropped while Misato snickered quietly; she wondered how in the hell these two ended up in love. The elevator continued its descent as the occupants continued to converse about the day's happenings. Many laughs and bitter remarks were shared as the small family made fun of the other. After the elevator reached their floor, the doors opened and the three roommates exited.  
真嗣汗颜，而美里则偷偷窃笑；她好奇这两个人究竟是怎么陷入爱河的。电梯继续下降，里面的人继续谈论着当天的事情。笑声和尖刻的评论交织在一起，这个小家庭互相取笑着对方。电梯到达他们的楼层后，门打开了，三个室友走了出来。

"And Asuka peeked on me, can you believe it? After all that she accused me of, she peeked on me" Shinji remarked.  
"而且明日香还偷看我，你能相信吗？毕竟她之前还指责我那么多，她居然偷看我" 真嗣说道。

"I did not! I was merely looking in that direction, as if I would ever want to look at you!" Asuka rebuked.  
"我没有！我只是恰好朝那个方向看了一眼，好像我会有兴趣看你似的！" 明日香反驳道。

"Sounds like denial" Misato said, laughing.  
"听起来像是在否认" 美里笑着说。

"No way! I saw enough of him yesterday when he-" the young girl started before stopping, not wanting to incriminate herself any further.  
"不可能！我昨天已经看够了他的——" 年轻女孩开口说道，随即停了下来，不想进一步牵扯自己。

Shinji blushed embarrassed, but was a little surprised Asuka had seen his member. Though he didn't really think she could have missed it.  
真嗣脸红得尴尬，但也有点惊讶明日香看到了他的那个。尽管他并不认为她会错过。

"Oh? What were you two doing yesterday?" Misato asked, curious.  
"哦？你们俩昨天在做什么呢？" 美里问道，好奇心驱使。

"Nothing like that" Shinji interjected, trying to stop where the conversation was heading.  
“不是那样的” 真嗣插话道，试图阻止对话朝那个方向发展。

Misato let it slide this time. "Ok"  
美里这次放过了这个话题。“好吧”

"Let's go home already" Asuka said impatiently.  
“我们快回家吧” 明日香不耐烦地说。

They all began to walk to Misato's car. This part of NERV was unusually quiet as they traversed the long metal corridors. The trio walked the whole trip in silence as none of them could think of something to say and they were also quite tired. As they arrived at Misato's car, the two eva pilots both sat in the back seat this time. The car began rising up as it was slowly brought up to the surface.  
他们开始走向美里小姐的车。NERV 的这一区域异常安静，他们穿过长长的金属走廊。三人一路沉默，谁也想不出该说什么，而且他们也相当疲惫。到达美里小姐的车时，两位 EVA 驾驶员这次都坐在了后座。车子开始上升，慢慢地被带到地面上。

Asuka turned to Shinji and whispered in his ear. "Do not ever kiss me again without my permission you hear? We are doing it only for the play"  
明日香转向真嗣，在他耳边低语：“没有我的允许，不要再吻我了，明白吗？我们只是为了演戏。”

"You asked for proof, so I gave it" he whispered back.  
“你要求证据，所以我给了。”他轻声回应。

"At least warn me or something you baka" Asuka refuted.  
“至少提前告诉我一声啊，你个笨蛋。”明日香反驳道。

The car finally reached the surface and Misato drove out of NERV and towards their apartment. Now that Misato wanted to return as soon as possible, she drove her usual way, rendering it impossible for the two charges to communicate any further. _'Schiesse why did they send an assassin to kill me when Misato could do the job for them'_ the young girl thought.  
汽车终于驶上了地面，美里驾驶着离开了 NERV，朝着他们的公寓开去。既然美里想尽快回去，她便选择了平时常走的路，这样一来，两个孩子便无法再继续交流了。‘该死，他们派了个杀手来杀我，而美里就能替他们完成任务’，少女心中暗想。

It had become really dark as much time had passed while at NERV. The night sky was not illuminated with the usual presence of the moon, however, as it was covered by clouds. Fortunately, they arrived safely at their apartment and the two teens were quick to exit the car.  
在 NERV 待了许久，天色已经变得非常暗了。夜空没有被月亮照亮，因为月亮被云层遮住了。幸运的是，他们安全抵达了公寓，两个少年迅速下了车。

The three roommates entered the apartment and took the stairs to their door as they were sick of elevators for the moment. Upon opening their door, they were all relieved to finally be back home. Asuka immediately checked her room, indeed finding it in perfect condition.  
三位室友走进公寓，选择了爬楼梯，因为暂时对电梯感到厌烦。打开房门的那一刻，他们都松了一口气，终于回到了家。明日香立刻检查了自己的房间，确实发现一切都井然有序。

"Don't make me supper, I'll be going to bed now" Misato declared tiredly to Shinji.  
“别给我准备晚饭了，我现在要去睡觉。”美里疲惫地对真嗣说道。

"Sure thing mum… err I mean Misato" Shinji said, a little embarrassed at his slipup.  
“当然，妈妈……呃，我是说美里。”真嗣说道，对自己的口误感到有些尴尬。

Misato turned to face him and smiled slightly. "You can call me mum if you want to"  
美里转过身面对他，微微一笑。“如果你想的话，可以叫我妈妈。”

"Goodnight" he replied. “晚安。”他回答道。

Misato turned around and went off to her room. Asuka snuck up behind Shinji and jabbed her fingers into his waist, causing him to jump up in surprise and pain.  
美里转身走向自己的房间。明日香悄悄溜到真嗣身后，用手指戳了戳他的腰，让他惊跳起来，又痛又惊。

"Good old electric shock" she said, smirking.  
"老式的电击疗法" 她带着一丝嘲讽地说道。

"A-Asuka" Shinji stuttered.  
"A-明日香" 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

"So where did mum go?" she asked innocently.  
"那么妈妈去哪儿了？" 她天真地问道。

Shinji blushed. "You heard that?"  
真嗣脸红了。“你听到了？”

"You are so pathetic baka" the girl replied with mock disgust.  
“你真是没用的笨蛋”女孩带着假装的厌恶回答。

"You want supper?" the boy asked, changing the subject.  
“你想吃晚饭吗？”男孩问道，改变了话题。

"Sure, I am quite hungry. I don't think I've eaten anything today" Asuka answered eagerly.  
“当然，我饿极了。今天好像什么都没吃。”明日香急切地回答。

"Alright then, it won't take long. Just sit down at the table" he informed, happy to be of use.  
“那好，不会太久的。坐到桌边来吧。”他告知，很高兴能帮上忙。

Asuka sat down at the dining table while Shinji went into the kitchen to prepare a quick late-night meal. After a few minutes of preparing, Shinji had finished their meals and returned to the dining room, setting the meals down onto the table. The boy sat down opposite Asuka and both eva pilots began eating their meals quietly.  
明日香坐在餐桌旁，而真嗣走进厨房准备一顿简单的深夜餐食。几分钟后，真嗣完成了两人的餐点，回到餐厅，将食物摆上桌。男孩坐在明日香对面，两位 EVA 驾驶员开始静静地用餐。

Shinji thought over today's happenings and couldn't believe he had actually slapped her. Though truth be told it had hurt him physically much more due to slapping her with his injured hand. Soon after he had kissed her, it had seemed the perfect thing to do and it did work. Besides, her punishment wasn't anything dreadful so he supposed it hadn't been a bad idea. The boy looked up at her and wondered how much he had progressed. Though he knew she had warmed up to him a bit, this was only due to a little more courage and confidence and therefore less of the wimpy Shinji she disliked. Other than that, she still behaved as usual and any effort to crack her defences were met with equal force. Reaching this conclusion and additionally considering the advice he was given, Shinji decided to take on a different and risky approach which would hopefully start tomorrow.  
真嗣回想着今天发生的一切，不敢相信自己真的打了她。虽然说实话，由于是用受伤的手打的，他受到的物理伤害更大。不久后他吻了她，那时似乎是完美的举动，而且确实奏效了。此外，她的惩罚并不严重，所以他想这并不是个坏主意。男孩抬头看着她，想知道自己在她心中进步了多少。尽管他知道她对他稍微热情了一些，这只是因为他多了些勇气和自信，因此少了些她不喜欢的懦弱真嗣。除此之外，她的行为一如既往，任何试图打破她防线的努力都遭到了同等力量的抵抗。得出这个结论并考虑到别人给他的建议后，真嗣决定采取一种不同且冒险的方法，希望从明天开始能有所成效。

The redhead finished her meal, placed her dish in the sink and moved off to her room.  
红发女孩吃完饭，把盘子放在水槽里，然后走向自己的房间。

Shinji remembered what he was supposed to do today but was too tired; he could distribute the clean clothes tomorrow if nothing happened. After finishing his meal, he placed his dish in the sink and proceeded to his room. He switched off the lights and lay down on his bed.  
真嗣记得今天该做什么，但实在太累了；如果没什么事，他可以把干净衣服明天再分发。吃完饭后，他把盘子放在水槽里，然后回到自己的房间。他关掉灯，躺在床上。

Both eva pilots were exhausted and so went off to sleep quite swiftly. Asuka felt a little happy that tomorrow she would get to see Hikari…  
两位 eva 驾驶员都筋疲力尽，很快就睡着了。明日香感到一丝高兴，因为明天她又能见到光……

End Notes: I'm not super clear exactly what goes on with sync tests or with the simulation bodies (that they used in one of the episodes). If I got it wrong, I apologise. Hope you enjoyed the chapter.  
尾注：我不太清楚同步测试或模拟身体（他们在某一集中使用过）的具体情况。如果我弄错了，我道歉。希望你喜欢这一章。

Author's Notes: The original notes mentioned how I lacked some character development for the side characters – this could still be an issue with the current version of the story, but I believe I improved it. This chapter had originally been one of the longest and took me a while to write, but it was overtaken easily by the rewrites.  
作者的话：原注中提到我缺乏对配角的角色发展——这在当前版本的故事中可能仍然是个问题，但我相信我有所改进。这一章原本是最长的之一，我花了很长时间来写，但重写后很容易就被超越了。

In any case, everything is starting to come together now, enjoy this next chapter.  
无论如何，现在一切都在逐渐融合，享受接下来的这一章吧。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 14 (First rewrite, I added some dialogue and extra flashbacks but otherwise it's quite similar to the original chapter).  
说明一下，这是重写的第 14 章（第一次重写，我增加了一些对话和额外的闪回，但总体上与原章节相当相似）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 14: Back to School Again  
第十四章：重返校园

"Good morning Commander" the man greeted.  
“早上好，指挥官。”那人问候道。

Gendo Ikari looked down at the individual, a little surprised.  
碇源堂低头看着那个人，略感惊讶。

"I wasn't aware you were still alive. What is your business?" the Commander asked.  
"我没想到你还活着。你来此有何贵干？" 指挥官问道。

"I have come to ask on the situation of the second and third children" the man answered.  
"我来询问第二和第三适格者的情况" 那人回答道。

The Commander gave a slight smile and moved his hands to shift his glasses. "I see, very well. The third child is the same, however, the second child has lost her memory right up to after the 12th angel"  
指挥官微微一笑，伸手调整了一下眼镜。"我明白了，很好。第三适格者情况依旧，但第二适格者失去了直到第十二使徒之后的所有记忆"

"I see… then my services may still prove to be useful" the man replied.  
"我明白了…那么我的服务或许仍能派上用场" 那人回答道。

"My thoughts exactly" the Commander replied, now looking down at the person with an amused expression.  
"我也是这么想的" 指挥官回答，现在低头看着那人，脸上带着一丝戏谑的表情。

"However, there is something else that bothers me" the person continued.  
"然而，还有一件事困扰着我" 那人继续说道。

"I'm listening" Gendo prompted.  
"我在听着" 碇源堂催促道。

"The scenario depicts the last angel was meant to be the fifth child sent by Seele, however, as far as I can see, the pilot of Unit 02 is still capable. How does Seele manage to bring about instrumentality?" the man asked.  
"这个剧本描述的是最后一个使徒本应是 Seele 派来的第五个孩子，但就我所见，二号机的驾驶员依然有能力。Seele 是如何促成人类补完计划的呢？" 那人问道。

"I suspect they will try something totally unexpected, however this is not of any concern at the moment. If you have no further business, you may leave" the Commander answered.  
"我怀疑他们会采取完全出乎意料的行动，不过这目前并不值得担忧。如果你没有其他事务，可以离开了" 指挥官回答道。

"Yes sir" the person replied, before leaving the Commander alone in his dark office.  
“是的，长官。”那人回答后，便让指挥官独自留在他昏暗的办公室里。

"I hope you help him" the Commander said aloud.  
“我希望你能帮助他。”指挥官大声说道。

---

_The young redheaded girl rang the doorbell; she had a sad look about her covered by a mask of anger. She waited for her friend to open the door.  
红发少女按响了门铃；她面带悲伤，却被愤怒的面具所掩盖。她等待着朋友来开门。_

"_Asuka? It's almost time for me to start going to school, did you want to walk with me? Where's Shinji?" Hikari asked._  
“明日香？我快到上学时间了，你想和我一起走吗？真嗣呢？” 洞木光问道。

_At the mention of his name, the redhead seemed to grow even more miserable._ "_Hikari, can I please stay here? I really don't feel like going to school today. I don't want to see Shinji either" Asuka replied._  
一提到他的名字，红发女孩似乎变得更加沮丧。“洞木，我可以留在这里吗？我真的不想今天去上学。我也不想见到真嗣。” 明日香回答。

"_What's wrong Asuka?" Hikari asked, concerned._  
“怎么了，明日香？” 洞木光关切地问。

"_If you wouldn't mind, I don't feel like talking about it" the redhead responded._  
"如果你不介意的话，我不想谈论这件事" 红发女孩回答道。

"_That's ok Asuka. You can definitely stay… I'll even stay home with you" Hikari offered._  
"没关系，明日香。你当然可以留下来……我甚至可以陪你一起待在家里" 光提议道。

"_Thanks Hikari. you're a good friend" Asuka said with a slight smile._  
"谢谢你，光。你真是个好朋友" 明日香带着一丝微笑说道。

"_No problem! Please get inside, I'll make you something to eat after I show you to my room" the class rep said, motioning for her to come in._  
"没问题！请进，我先带你去我的房间，然后给你弄点吃的" 班长说着，示意她进来。

"_Yes, I would like that" Asuka replied._  
"好的，我很期待" 明日香回答道。

_The redhead entered her friend's house and found solace in the warm atmosphere inside. Hikari's parents were asleep but a few of her sisters were up and looked at the guest with curiosity.  
红发女孩走进朋友的家，感受到屋内温暖的氛围带来的慰藉。光的双亲已经睡下，但她的几个妹妹还醒着，好奇地打量着这位客人。_

"_You remember my friend Asuka? We'll be staying in my room, so tell mum and dad before they go to work so they know where I am" Hikari said to her sisters._  
"你记得我的朋友明日香吗？我们要待在我的房间里，所以在爸妈上班前告诉他们一声，让他们知道我在哪儿。" 光对她的姐妹们说。

"_Okay Hikari" one of her sisters answered._  
"好的，光" 她的一个姐妹回答道。

_The redhead followed Hikari to her room, taking in the details of the house. Just like the other times she had been here, she noted that it was much bigger than their apartment, but then again much more people lived here. For the most part it was quite an ordinary house; the walls painted a nice pale green and the architecture simple but elegant. However, the house contained a friendly environment and it made Asuka feel a little more at ease.  
红发的明日香跟着光来到她的房间，仔细观察着房子的细节。就像她之前来过的几次一样，她注意到这里比她们的公寓大得多，但话说回来，这里住的人也多得多。大部分来说，这是一栋相当普通的房子；墙壁涂着淡雅的浅绿色，建筑风格简约而优雅。然而，房子里洋溢着友好的氛围，这让明日香感到稍微放松了一些。_

_After entering Hikari's room, the redhead sat down on Hikari's bed. The class rep closed her door and turned to face Asuka._ "_Look you don't have to tell me what happened or anything, but answer me one question" she started._  
进入光房间后，红发女孩坐在光的床上。班长关上门，转身面对明日香。“听着，你不必告诉我发生了什么，但回答我一个问题”她开始说道。

_The eva pilot looked up. "Alright" she replied.  
eva 驾驶员抬起头。“好吧”她回答道。_

"_Is it to do with Shinji?" Hikari asked._  
“是和真嗣有关吗？”光问道。

_Slowly the redhead nodded…  
慢慢地，红发女孩点了点头……_

"Yeeaaaahhhh!" "耶——！"

The redhead groaned as she woke up to Misato's shout and silently cursed her guardian for waking her up. Asuka then thought about what she had just experienced; she had gone to Hikari's house to skip school due to something that had happened concerning Shinji. She was absolutely sure this is what they had been hiding from her and was extremely annoyed her dream had yet again been interrupted. However now that she knew, she could confront Shinji and if he weaseled out of it, Hikari would know. The girl smiled; she would find out for sure this time.  
红发女孩被美里的一声大喊吵醒，心中默默咒骂着她的监护人把她吵醒。明日香随后回想起她刚刚经历的事情；她去了光的家，为了逃避学校里发生的一些与真嗣有关的事情。她确信这就是他们一直对她隐瞒的，而且非常恼火她的梦又一次被打断。但现在既然她知道了，她可以找真嗣对质，如果他逃避，光也会知道。女孩笑了；这次她一定会弄清楚真相。

A pleasant aroma wafted into her room and she suspected Shinji had started making breakfast. Her suspicions were confirmed when she heard the frantic cries of Shinji trying to calm down Misato. Asuka wanted to get as much rest as possible, so she decided to stay in bed until one of her roommates decided to get her. Even though her room had been cleaned and fixed, because of the explosion some of her furniture had been replaced. Added to that, some of her things were destroyed in the process. However thankfully, most of her clothes had been in the wash and Shinji had not distributed them yet.  
一股宜人的香气飘入她的房间，她怀疑是真嗣开始做早餐了。当她听到真嗣试图安抚美里时那慌乱的叫喊声，她的怀疑得到了证实。明日香想尽可能多休息一会儿，所以决定躺在床上，直到她的某个室友来叫她。尽管她的房间已经打扫和修复过，但由于爆炸，一些家具被更换了。再加上，过程中有些东西被毁了。不过幸运的是，她的大部分衣服都在洗，真嗣还没来得及分发它们。

She sighed annoyed at how most of her stationery had been destroyed and decided to go to Shinji's room and loot his drawer later. _'So troublesome, it seems everything bad happens to me. Memory loss, an assassination attempt, what next? My eva self-destructs?'_ she thought, feeling irritated. Suddenly, a large laugh broke out followed by some incoherent mumbling who she suspected was coming from Shinji.  
她叹了口气，对大部分文具被毁感到恼火，决定稍后去真嗣的房间搜刮他的抽屉。'真是麻烦，好像所有坏事都发生在我身上。失忆，暗杀企图，接下来是什么？我的 EVA 自爆吗？'她想着，感到烦躁。突然，一阵大笑声爆发，紧接着是一些含糊不清的嘟囔，她怀疑这是真嗣的声音。

"What in God's name are they doing?" she said aloud.  
“他们到底在搞什么鬼？”她大声说道。

"Misato! Asuka's breasts are just fine!" Shinji shouted, embarrassed.  
“美里！明日香的胸部很完美！” 真嗣尴尬地喊道。

_'What the?'_ the young girl thought, confused.  
“什么鬼？” 年轻女孩困惑地想。

"Because Asuka is more than just a pretty girl, she has a hundred times more depth and intelligence. She taught me how to be stronger and how to persevere, she is irreplaceable" Shinji said, a little less loud.  
“因为明日香不仅仅是个漂亮女孩，她有着百倍于人的深度和智慧。她教会了我如何变得更强，如何坚持不懈，她是无可替代的。” 真嗣稍稍降低了声音说道。

_'Damn straight, but what in the hell are they talking about?'_ the redhead thought as she got out of bed. The young girl stealthily made her way to the kitchen so that she was in proper hearing range of the conversation. She noticed Shinji had stopped preparing breakfast and was currently facing Misato, while Misato was sipping some beer at the dining table looking somewhat amused.  
“该死，他们到底在说什么？”红发女孩心想，她从床上爬起来。年轻的女孩悄悄地走向厨房，以便能清楚地听到对话。她注意到真嗣已经停止准备早餐，正面对着美里，而美里则在餐桌旁喝着啤酒，看起来有些好笑。

"Alright Shinji no need to get so defensive. We all know Asuka's a great girl, but surely she is proving to be extremely difficult" Misato replied.  
“好了，真嗣，没必要这么戒备。我们都知道明日香是个好女孩，但她确实很难相处。”美里回答道。

"It doesn't matter I-" Shinji started.  
“这无关紧要，我——”真嗣开口道。

"Shhh" Misato interrupted, "We have a mouse listening in on us"  
"嘘——" 美里打断道，"有只小老鼠在偷听我们说话"

Asuka looked at Misato shocked, wondering how she had noticed her. But Misato was looking in the complete opposite direction. Asuka followed Misato's line of sight and saw a figure in the window disappear abruptly. _'So, she didn't notice me after all… but who was that?'_ she thought.  
明日香震惊地看着美里，想知道她是怎么注意到自己的。但美里却完全看向了相反的方向。明日香顺着美里的视线望去，看到一个身影在窗户边突然消失。'原来她并没有注意到我……但那人是谁？' 她心想。

"Alright Shinji, you finish making breakfast already. Asuka will be up soon, I'll investigate this eavesdropper. Funny though, I thought the person had something familiar about him…" Misato announced.  
"好了，真嗣，你赶紧把早餐做完。明日香马上就起来了，我去查查这个偷听的家伙。不过说来也怪，我觉得那人有点眼熟……" 美里宣布道。

_'It couldn't be…?'_ Shinji thought.  
'这不可能……？' 真嗣心想。

The boy turned his attention back to preparing breakfast as Asuka silently cursed whatever divine power was out there that was always interrupting vital information. Misato got up and rushed out the door, determined to catch the listener before he got away. The redhead decided to make her presence known as she was getting hungry and she wanted to confront Shinji about this morning's dream and the conversation he just had with Misato. The girl got up and walked into the kitchen, sneaking up behind Shinji. She grabbed Shinji's ear and painfully pulled it, eliciting a sharp cry of pain from the boy.  
男孩将注意力转回准备早餐上，而明日香则在心中默默咒骂着那些总是在关键时刻打断重要信息的神明。美里起身冲出门外，决心在那个偷听者逃走之前抓住他。红发女孩决定现身，因为她饿了，并且想就今早的梦境和刚刚与美里的对话与真嗣对质。她起身走进厨房，悄悄来到真嗣身后。她抓住真嗣的耳朵，用力一扯，男孩随即发出一声痛苦的尖叫。

"I am very curious as to why my _breasts_ were in discussion this morning" Asuka remarked sweetly.  
“我很好奇，为什么今早我的胸部会成为讨论的话题。”明日香甜甜地说道。

"A-Asuka? You heard all that?" he asked.  
"A-明日香？你都听到了？" 他问道。

"You did shout it out Shinji" she replied, increasing her grip on his ear.  
"你确实喊出来了，真嗣" 她回答，加重了捏他耳朵的力道。

"Ow ow, alright I'll tell you, just let go of my ear" he pleaded.  
"哎哟哎哟，好吧，我会告诉你的，快放开我的耳朵" 他恳求道。

Reluctantly, the redhead released his ear from her grasp and the boy nursed his ear, which was now an angry red. Shinji turned to face her and noticed she was looking at him with a smug face. Her red hair hung loosely about her, the expression she had made her appear really cute. Her gorgeous blue eyes were focused on him with a somewhat amused look. Shinji couldn't help getting lost once again in her magnificence. It seemed Asuka, however, was growing impatient and knocked him on the head.  
不情愿地，红发女孩松开了他的耳朵，男孩揉着那已经变得通红的耳朵。真嗣转过身面对她，注意到她正带着得意的表情看着他。她的红发随意地披散着，那表情让她显得格外可爱。她那美丽的蓝眼睛带着几分戏谑的神情专注地盯着他。真嗣不禁再次沉醉于她的魅力之中。然而，明日香似乎越来越不耐烦，敲了一下他的头。

"Stop gawking at me and tell me already" she said, irritated.  
“别再盯着我看了，快告诉我”她不耐烦地说道。

"Misato was just teasing me as usual, comparing your chest with hers and asking me very strange questions. She might be jealous of your good looks" he answered, grinning.  
“美里小姐又在像往常一样逗我，拿你的胸部和她自己的比较，还问我一些很奇怪的问题。她可能是嫉妒你的美貌吧”他笑着回答。

"Oh really? While I'm glad you deem my breasts _worthy_" she said sarcastically, "You are honestly just one really perverted baka. That wasn't all you said either, not that I mind the compliment about my superior personality and intelligence, however you must have been discussing more than just my good looks"  
"哦，真的吗？我很高兴你觉得我的胸部值得称赞" 她讽刺地说，"你真是个十足的变态。你说的可不止这些，虽然我不介意你夸我性格和智力出众，但你肯定不止在讨论我的外表"

Shinji just looked at her with a bemused expression. _'Why did I have to shout that out?'_  
真嗣只是带着一种好笑的表情看着她。'我为什么要大声说出来？'

"Where you by any chance discussing the effects of thermal expansion?" she said, smirking.  
"你是不是在讨论热膨胀效应？" 她带着一丝嘲笑说道。

Shinji let out a small laugh as he remembered the day he was doing homework and Asuka had come over to see what he was doing. Then she had teased him about whether thermal expansion would make her breasts bigger or not. Back then he had been extremely embarrassed, but now that he thought about it, it looked like Asuka had been flirting with him.  
真嗣轻笑一声，回想起那天他在做作业，明日香过来查看他在做什么。然后她调侃他，问热胀冷缩会不会让她的胸部变大。那时他非常尴尬，但现在想来，似乎明日香当时是在向他调情。

"Misato was just concerned on how I was managing with you, after all, we're not the best two people at getting along. But I was telling her I was managing just fine… I mean we've had a few fights but we already resolved them" Shinji explained.  
“美里只是担心我和你相处得如何，毕竟我们俩不是最擅长相处的一对。但我告诉她我应付得很好……我是说我们有过几次争吵，但已经解决了。”真嗣解释道。

"Misato should just keep her nose in her own business, my dealings with you are not of her concern…" Asuka started.  
“美里应该管好自己的事，我和你的关系不关她的事……”明日香开口道。

Shinji didn't dare point out the fact that Misato was their guardian and had a right to know.  
真嗣不敢指出一个事实，那就是美里是他们的监护人，有权知道这一切。

"…But Shinji, I'm surprised you actually defended me. I wonder how I fixed you up so much" Asuka finished.  
“……但真嗣，你居然真的为我辩护，我倒是好奇我是怎么把你调教得这么好的。”明日香说完。

"But of course, the Great Asuka can do anything if she puts her mind to it" he replied, trying not to laugh.  
“当然，伟大的明日香只要下定决心，什么都能做到。”他回答道，努力忍住不笑。

"That goes without saying" she said, smiling arrogantly, "Alright I'm hungry, go finish making breakfast"  
"那是当然的"，她傲慢地笑着说，"好了，我饿了，去把早餐做完吧"

The girl sat down at the dining table while Shinji returned to his interrupted work once again. He was surprised he hadn't ruined the meal yet; he supposed he did have some skill in cooking after all, even with an injured hand. Asuka stretched in her chair as she waited for Shinji to finish. The morning sun was shining brightly through the window, today seemed like it would be a great day. As Shinji completed breakfast, he set down the food on the table feeling Asuka's exuberance.  
女孩坐在餐桌旁，而真嗣再次回到他被打断的工作中。他惊讶自己还没有把早餐搞砸；他猜想自己毕竟还是有些烹饪技巧的，尽管手受伤了。明日香在椅子上伸展着身体，等待真嗣完成早餐。早晨的阳光透过窗户照进来，今天似乎会是个好日子。当真嗣完成早餐时，他将食物摆上桌，感受到了明日香的热情。

"You sure seem lively this morning Asuka" Shinji said to her.  
"你今天早上看起来很有活力啊，明日香"，真嗣对她说。

"Yeah, spending this whole weekend with you has been so depressing" she said, grinning mischievously, "I actually started to miss school, I'm happy to finally go back today and talk to Hikari"  
"是啊，整个周末都和你在一起真是太郁闷了" 她调皮地笑着说，"我居然开始想念学校了，今天终于能回去和光聊天，真是太好了"

The boy sat down at the table. There was something else, like she had won a secret game they were playing or similar. The redhead started eating her meal and Shinji watched her, always fascinated at the way she ate. She looked up and caught his gaze. He instantly looked away but she had noticed and flicked him on the forehead.  
男孩在桌边坐下。她似乎赢得了他们之间某种秘密游戏的胜利，或者类似的事情。红发女孩开始吃她的餐点，真嗣注视着她，总是对她吃饭的方式感到着迷。她抬起头，捕捉到了他的目光。他立刻移开视线，但她已经注意到了，并轻轻弹了一下他的额头。

"Stop staring at me you hentai baka, regardless if no guy can resist looking at me" Asuka remarked.  
"别再盯着我看了，你这个色狼笨蛋，不管有没有男生能抵挡住看我" 明日香说道。

"Why?" he shot back. "为什么？" 他反问道。

"Eh?" she said looking at him, not expecting him to question her. The two of them focused on each other, wondering what the other was thinking.  
"嗯？" 她看着他，没想到他会质疑她。两人对视着，各自揣测对方的心思。

"I was gone for only a few minutes and you two are already looking at each other with love-love expressions" Misato suddenly announced.  
"我才离开几分钟，你们俩就已经用含情脉脉的眼神看着对方了" 美里突然宣布道。

Both eva pilots blushed red. "WHAT?" Asuka shouted, turning to Misato, who was having trouble keeping a straight face.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员脸都红了。“什么？”明日香大喊，转向美里，后者正努力保持严肃的面孔。

"Sorry, did I interrupt your game? Were you about to play 'hide the salami'?" the older woman teased.  
“抱歉，我打断你们的游戏了吗？你们正要玩‘藏香肠’吗？”年长的女性打趣道。

"You are treading on thin ice Misato" the redhead warned.  
“你这是在走钢丝，美里”红发少女警告道。

Shinji had no clue what Misato was talking about; surely hiding a salami was a pointless game, why in the world would they play it?  
真嗣完全不明白美里在说什么；藏香肠显然是个毫无意义的游戏，他们为什么要玩这个？

"What are you talking about Misato? What has hiding a salami got to do with anything?" Shinji asked, genuinely confused.  
“美里，你在说什么啊？藏香肠和这有什么关系？” 真嗣问道，真的感到困惑。

Misato burst out laughing and Asuka turned to face him with a disbelieving expression on her face.  
美里突然大笑起来，而明日香则转过身来，脸上带着难以置信的表情。

"How can you not know what it means? Doesn't Kensuke teach you about that stuff? More importantly, you are so perverted you should know straight away just by how it sounds" Asuka remarked incredulously.  
"你怎么会不知道这是什么意思？难道不是真嗣教你这些的吗？更重要的是，你这么变态，光听声音就应该立刻明白的。" 明日香难以置信地说道。

Shinji just looked at her cluelessly, causing Asuka to just sigh in irritation.  
真嗣只是茫然地看着她，这让明日香不耐烦地叹了口气。

"How can you be so dumb? I'm sure that strumpet over there can give you accurate detail on what she implied" Asuke replied, pointing to their guardian.  
"你怎么能这么笨？我敢肯定那边那个荡妇能给你详细解释她暗示了什么。" 明日香回答道，指着他们的监护人。

"Hey!" Misato shot back, glaring at Asuka. She then turned to face Shinji. "Now Shinji, when you think of a salami, using a perverted context, what comes to mind?"  
"嘿！" 美里反击道，瞪着明日香。随后她转向真嗣。"现在，真嗣，当你想到用变态的语境来思考萨拉米香肠时，你会想到什么？"

"Well umm… a male's private part" he guessed.  
"嗯，呃……男性的私处" 他猜测道。

"Precisely, now what ways are there of 'hiding' it?" Misato continued.  
"完全正确，那么有哪些方法可以'隐藏'它呢？" 美里继续问道。

"It's hidden at the moment" he answered innocently.  
"现在它被藏起来了" 他天真地回答道。

Asuka sniggered silently; this was so amusing to watch.  
明日香暗自发笑；这场景真是太有趣了。

"Ok… if you had no clothes on and a naked girl next to you, how _else_ could you hide it?" the older woman prompted.  
"好吧……如果你没穿衣服，旁边还有一个裸女，你还能怎么藏它呢？" 年长的女人提示道。

Shinji's eyes widened as he finally realised what it meant. He had played this "game" with Asuka _many_ times.  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他终于意识到这意味着什么。他和明日香已经多次玩过这个“游戏”。

"You don't mean…?" he started. Then he grinned cheekily, "Ah but… we couldn't have, because I wouldn't fit"  
“你不是说……？”他开口道。然后他调皮地咧嘴一笑，“啊，但是……我们不可能，因为我装不下”

Two pairs of jaws dropped to the floor, Misato standing there with her mouth agape. Asuka looked at the boy shocked as her face turned red.  
两对下巴掉到了地上，美里站在那里，嘴巴张得大大的。明日香看着男孩，震惊得脸都红了。

"You stupid hentai! Don't make such bold statements! You are not _that_ big" the young girl snapped.  
"你这个笨蛋变态！别这么大言不惭！你没那么厉害" 年轻女孩厉声说道。

"Oh, so you've already tested it?" Shinji asked.  
"哦，那你已经试过了？" 真嗣问道。

Asuka blushed. "No I have not! But I know for a fact that you would fit in me-" she started, before snapping her mouth shut. _'What the hell am I saying?'_  
明日香脸红了。"不，我没有！但我知道你肯定适合我——" 她开口说道，随即紧紧闭上了嘴。'我到底在说什么鬼话？'

"There's only one way to find out" Shinji replied, grinning.  
"只有一种方法可以找出答案" 真嗣回答道，咧嘴笑着。

"You keep your perverted fantasies in your head!" she shouted at him, slapping him as hard as she could.  
"你把那些变态的幻想留在你脑子里！" 她对他大喊，用尽全力扇了他一巴掌。

Suddenly, a loud noise took the attention of the two teens as they looked to the source. They found Misato had collapsed to the floor; she had passed out from lack of oxygen from laughing too much. Both eva pilots sweat dropped at their guardian.  
突然，一声巨响吸引了两个青少年的注意，他们转向声源。他们发现美里已经倒在地上；她因为笑得太厉害而缺氧昏倒了。两位 EVA 驾驶员对他们的监护人汗颜。

"Eh just leave her there, she'll come to" Asuka commented.  
"哎，就让她在那儿吧，她会自己醒过来的" 明日香评论道。

"Ok" he agreed. "好的" 他同意道。

"Anyways Shinji, I wanted to discuss something" the redhead began.  
"话说回来，真嗣，我有件事想和你讨论" 红发少女开始说道。

"Go ahead" Shinji encouraged.  
"继续说" 真嗣鼓励道。

"I remembered something else in the past that you have 'forgotten' to mention" Asuka continued.  
"我想起了过去你'忘记'提到的一些事" 明日香继续说道。

"Oh?" he prompted. "哦？" 他追问道。

"I had gone to Hikari's house to skip school because something had happened between me and you, however, I could not remember what had happened… only that it concerned you" the young girl explained.  
“我去了光的家逃学，因为我和你之间发生了一些事，然而，我记不清具体发生了什么……只知道与你有关。”年轻女孩解释道。

Shinji looked at her surprised, that incident was the one memory he most wanted her to forget, well that and the rape. This was tough; he couldn't tell her that she walked in on him and Rei, because that wouldn't justify her skipping school, she wouldn't have cared that much. Furthermore, if she had told Hikari, it was even more troublesome. He hadn't even thought of the possibility of Hikari knowing. Now that he thought about it again, he hadn't come up with an idea for preventing Asuka asking questions about the past.  
真嗣惊讶地看着她，那件事是他最希望她忘记的记忆，还有那次强奸。这很棘手；他不能告诉她她撞见了他和丽，因为那不足以解释她逃学的原因，她不会那么在意。此外，如果她告诉了光，那就更麻烦了。他甚至没想过光可能知道。现在再想起来，他还没想出阻止明日香追问过去的办法。

At Shinji's lack of response, the redhead spoke up. "I _know_ this is what you haven't been telling me all this time. I've already figured out most of it, a few questions to Hikari and I can find out the rest. But save me the trouble and just tell me yourself"  
在真嗣沉默不语时，红发女孩开口了。“我知道这就是你一直没告诉我的事。我已经猜到了大部分，再问光几个问题就能知道剩下的。但省省麻烦，直接告诉我吧。”

Shinji almost smiled, it was perfect. If he could come up with something good now, she would stop in her efforts to find out about the past, presuming that this event was what he had been hiding. He would also admit a little bit of the truth, in regards to their relationship, to explain Misato's and his reactions to her losing her memory. Furthermore, with a little manipulation he could stop her from asking questions about the past. It was killing two birds with one stone.  
真嗣几乎要笑了，这太完美了。如果他现在能想出点什么好东西，她就会停止追查过去的努力，假设这个事件就是他一直隐瞒的。他还会承认一些关于他们关系的真相，以解释美里和他对她失忆的反应。此外，稍加操纵，他就能阻止她对过去提出问题。真是一石二鸟。

"Alright Asuka… I think you're ready to know, since you've caught up on many things already" Shinji began. "I'm sure you realise by now… and maybe you also feel it, that us two got closer during the time you forgot"  
“好吧，明日香……我想你已经准备好了，既然你已经了解了很多事情。”真嗣开始说道，“我相信你现在意识到了……也许你也感觉到了，我们俩在你忘记的那段时间里变得更亲近了。”

Asuka simply nodded. 明日香只是点了点头。

"The reason I'm bringing that up is to give context, and also to explain why Misato and I were so downtrodden when we first discovered you had lost your memory. You and I had lost the close friendship we had built up, and it wasn't something we could just 'tell' you, since relationships are a lot more complicated than a simple explanation" Shinji elaborated; it's not like he wasn't telling the truth, he was just omitting the magnitude of their relationship.  
“我提起这个是为了提供背景，同时也解释了为什么美里和我最初发现你失忆时会如此沮丧。你我之间建立的亲密友谊已经不复存在，这不是我们能简单‘告诉你’的事情，因为人际关系远比简单的解释复杂得多。”真嗣详细阐述道；他并非没有说实话，只是省略了他们关系的深度。

"Fair enough… that makes sense… continue" Asuka prompted.  
“说得通……继续吧。”明日香催促道。

"With that in mind, I'll tell you what I've been hiding from you. However, if I tell you, in return you must act as if you haven't lost your memory at school" Shinji requested.  
“考虑到这一点，我会告诉你我一直对你隐瞒的事情。但作为交换，如果你知道了，在学校你必须表现得好像没有失忆一样。”真嗣请求道。

"What? Why?" Asuka protested.  
"什么？为什么？" 明日香抗议道。

"Because it will be troublesome for everyone if they find out you lost your memory, it will be a lot easier on everyone, including you, if you just pretend nothing happened" Shinji explained.  
"因为如果他们发现你失忆了，对大家都会很麻烦，如果你假装什么都没发生，对所有人，包括你，都会轻松很多" 真嗣解释道。

"But that's an outrageous demand, how am I supposed to do that? What if they mention or ask something and I have no clue?" the redhead refuted.  
"但这要求太离谱了，我怎么可能做到？万一他们提到或问起什么而我一无所知怎么办？" 红发少女反驳道。

"Improvise. I'll also help you out too" Shinji countered.  
"即兴发挥。我也会帮你一把" 真嗣回敬道。

"I could just ask Hikari, why should I even consider this third child?" the young girl shot back.  
"我完全可以问光，为什么要考虑这个第三适格者？" 少女反驳道。

"You might not have even told her plus even if you did, she won't know the full story. This is your only chance Asuka. If you don't agree to this, I won't tell you what happened" he replied.  
"你可能根本没告诉她，就算说了，她也不会知道全部真相。这是你唯一的机会，明日香。如果你不同意，我就不告诉你发生了什么" 他回答道。

Asuka seemed to think it over; she finally had her chance at finding out the information kept from her, plus it wasn't like she couldn't pretend to not have forgotten anything, Shinji did fill her in on a lot of details. She weighed up the two options and sighed in defeat, he was right that Hikari might not even know and she couldn't take that risk.  
明日香似乎在仔细考虑；她终于有机会了解那些对她隐瞒的信息了，而且她也可以假装什么都没忘记，毕竟真嗣确实告诉了她很多细节。她权衡了两个选择，叹了口气，认输了，他说的对，也许美里根本不知道，她不能冒这个险。

"Alright I agree, you tell me what happened immediately" she demanded.  
“好吧，我同意，你马上告诉我发生了什么。”她要求道。

"Ok I will… just don't kill me when I tell you" the boy implored.  
“好的，我会……只是在我告诉你之后，别杀了我。”男孩恳求道。

"How suspicious… what did you do?" she asked, curious.  
"真可疑……你做了什么？" 她好奇地问道。

"Well you see…" he began, twiddling his thumbs. "How do I say this…"  
"嗯，你看……" 他开始捻着拇指。"我该怎么解释呢……"

"Use your mouth Shinji, I've already answered that stupid question before" Asuka snapped.  
"用你的嘴说，真嗣，我已经回答过那个愚蠢的问题了" 明日香厉声说道。

"Kensuke, Touji and I were arguing whether or not you had a good side to you or not. I was defending you saying that you had definitely had some good points, however, Kensuke and Touji wanted proof" the boy began.  
"健介、斗司和我争论你是否有好的一面。我为你辩护，说你肯定有优点，但健介和斗司想要证据。"男孩开始说道。

"Let me guess… you agreed?" Asuka inferred.  
"让我猜猜……你同意了？"明日香推测道。

"Yes, I thought for sure I could prove it to them. Later on, one night I asked you to watch television with me late at night and you did so"  
"是的，我确信我能向他们证明这一点。后来有一天晚上，我请你深夜和我一起看电视，你答应了。"

"So what?" the young girl asked, not sure where this was going.  
"那又怎样？" 年轻女孩问道，不确定这话题会引向何方。

"I'm getting to it. It was late at night and we were sitting on the couch together. We were both tired you see and-" Shinji started to explain.  
"我正要说呢。那是个深夜，我们俩一起坐在沙发上。你知道的，我们都累了，然后——" 真嗣开始解释道。

"Get to the freaking point already" the redhead snapped.  
"赶紧说重点吧" 红发女孩不耐烦地打断道。

"I snuggled up to you a bit, but I suspect you were too tired to care. Anyways, I asked if you liked me. You giggled and called me a baka saying that I was so dense. You said I understood you more than anyone else, since I'm an eva pilot, also that I live with you almost every day so I know your true personality, not like the boys at school just interested in your body" Shinji continued.  
"我稍微靠近了你一些，但我猜你可能太累了没注意到。总之，我问你是否喜欢我。你笑了，说我是个笨蛋，说我太迟钝了。你说我比任何人都更了解你，因为我是个 EVA 驾驶员，而且我几乎每天都和你住在一起，所以我了解你的真实性格，不像学校里的那些男生只对你的身体感兴趣" 真嗣继续说道。

Asuka listened quietly as the boy continued the revelation.  
明日香静静地听着男孩继续吐露心声。

"Then you said that of course you liked me better than other guys, except Kaji of course, that was all" he remarked.  
"然后你说当然你更喜欢我，而不是其他男生，当然除了加持先生之外，就这些了" 他补充道。

"And?" Asuka replied, growing impatient at his frequent pauses.  
"然后呢？" 明日香回答道，对他的频繁停顿感到不耐烦。

"What happened next is, well we fell asleep on the couch together. Misato happened to come back home this night and took a picture of us snuggled up together. Misato showed me the picture in the morning and I scanned and sent it to Kensuke and Touji giving them the proof they desired" he finished.  
"接下来发生的事，嗯，我们一起在沙发上睡着了。美里恰巧在那个晚上回家，拍下了我们依偎在一起的照片。早上美里给我看了那张照片，我扫描后发给了真希波和东二，给了他们想要的证据。" 他结束了叙述。

"WHAT?! How could you do that?! How could you trust them? They would have just spread it around the school and a hundred rumours would have started" Asuka shouted.  
"什么？！你怎么能这么做？！你怎么能相信他们？他们只会把这事儿在学校里传开，然后谣言满天飞" 明日香大声喊道。

"Your thoughts exactly back then. You got real pissed at me, additionally because I didn't ask for your permission either. I just wanted to prove to them I was right and didn't think about the consequences at all. You left the house to go to Hikari's. You didn't want to go to school because of what could happen and you didn't want to see me because you were angry at me and a little sad that I had, in your eyes, betrayed you" Shinji explained.  
"你当时确实是这么想的。你对我真的很生气，还因为我没有征求你的同意。我只是想向他们证明我是对的，完全没有考虑后果。你离开家去了光那里。你不想去学校，因为可能会发生的事情，也不想见我，因为你对我生气，还有点难过，觉得我背叛了你。" 真嗣解释道。

"I do find all this hard to believe, I do remember I felt sad and angry so I guess that's right. I would have stayed away from you and school to prevent any rumours or embarrassment occurring so that seems right too. But we snuggled up together on the couch? You'll have to show me this photo first before I believe that. Also, what's the big deal about telling me this secret… is this what you were sad about me forgetting?" Asuka questioned, unable to contain her desire to understand everything.  
"我确实觉得这一切难以置信，我记得我当时感到悲伤和愤怒，所以我想那是对的。我可能会避开你和学校，以防止任何谣言或尴尬的发生，这也似乎是对的。但我们一起蜷缩在沙发上？你得先给我看看那张照片，我才会相信。还有，告诉我这个秘密有什么大不了的……这就是你因为我忘记而感到难过的原因吗？" 明日香质疑道，无法抑制自己想要理解一切的渴望。

"I was sad that you had forgotten ALL _our_ memories. You see… there were a few other incidents where you warmed up to me a bit, not just that moment. Like I said earlier, the loss of those memories meant the loss of the friendship we had created. It's not possible to just inform you that we became better friends and let's act like that… so I was hiding all this so that we could recreate the relationship we had" Shinji clarified.  
"我很难过，你忘记了我们所有的记忆。你看……还有几次你对我稍微亲近了一些，不仅仅是那一刻。就像我之前说的，失去那些记忆意味着失去了我们建立的友谊。不可能简单地告诉你我们成了更好的朋友，然后就这样装作一切如常……所以我一直隐瞒这些，以便我们能重新建立那种关系。" 真嗣解释道。

"So _that's_ the understanding we reached! Now I understand why you were showing me more affection and I totally agree with your point, I can understand why you wouldn't tell me. But how come Misato knows about this?" Asuka inquired, wondering how the older woman came into this.  
"原来这就是我们达成的理解！现在我明白你为什么对我表现出更多关爱了，我完全同意你的观点，我能理解你为什么不告诉我。但为什么美里知道这件事？" 明日香询问，好奇这位年长的女性是如何卷入其中的。

"If you're talking about the photo incident, of course she knew. You blew off at her for taking the photo and showing it to me. If you mean our getting along better, she's our guardian she would have noticed our change in behaviour" he answered.  
"如果你说的是照片事件，她当然知道。你因为她拍了照片并给我看而对她大发雷霆。如果你指的是我们相处得更好，她是我们的监护人，她肯定会注意到我们行为的变化。" 他回答道。

Asuka digested all the information, it did fit and she suspected after living with the same person for a while she would eventually get along better; it was a few months after all. The redhead would have been sad if Hikari forgot she was her friend so she understood what Shinji meant precisely. It also explained Shinji's change in character; she definitely would have fixed him up good in a few months.  
明日香消化着所有信息，确实说得通，她猜想与同一个人生活一段时间后，关系自然会改善；毕竟已经过去了几个月。如果光忘记了她们是朋友，红发少女会感到难过，所以她完全理解真嗣的意思。这也解释了真嗣性格的变化；她肯定会在几个月内好好改造他。

"Alright Ikari, I won't kill you but I still want to see that photo" the young girl requested.  
“好吧，碇，我不会杀你，但我还是想看看那张照片。”年轻女孩请求道。

"I can get it right now" he replied.  
“我现在就可以拿给你。”他回答说。

"Go on then" she said impatiently.  
“那就快说吧。”她不耐烦地说道。

The boy walked off to his room, his made-up story was a bit dodgy but it held. He sighed in relief at managing that, he really had no clue what to say and was making it up as he went along. But after showing her the photo, he was sure she would be convinced. There was only one flaw in his plan and that was Hikari; if the redhead had told her then he was done for. However, it was a risk that he thought was justified due to the fact that Asuka usually didn't share her problems.  
男孩走向自己的房间，他编的故事有些牵强，但勉强说得通。他松了口气，庆幸自己应付过去了，其实他根本不知道该说什么，只是边走边编。但给她看了那张照片后，他确信她会被说服。他的计划只有一个漏洞，那就是光；如果红发女孩已经告诉了她，那他就完蛋了。然而，他认为这个风险是值得的，因为通常情况下，明日香不会分享她的烦恼。

Soon, Shinji entered his room and moved to his drawer. He opened his drawer and took out the photo of him and Asuka. He smiled slightly as he looked at it; Asuka looked so cute when she was asleep. The boy closed the drawer and exited his room returning to the kitchen. The girl was waiting there quietly pondering something, however when he entered the kitchen she was broken out of her trance.  
很快，真嗣走进自己的房间，来到抽屉前。他打开抽屉，拿出他和明日香的照片。他微微一笑，看着照片中的明日香睡得那么可爱。男孩关上抽屉，离开房间回到厨房。女孩静静地坐在那里沉思着什么，但当他走进厨房时，她从恍惚中回过神来。

"Here it is" he said, handing it to her.  
"在这里" 他说着，把它递给了她。

The redhead took the photo from the boy and her eyes widened in shock. There was no doubt about it, she could clearly see her and Shinji snuggled up to each other on the couch and the photo was real. An image of her looking at the photo appeared in her mind as well, this was definitely not the first time she had seen this. Asuka handed the photo back to him.  
红发女孩从男孩手中接过照片，她的眼睛因震惊而睁大。毫无疑问，她清楚地看到自己和真嗣依偎在沙发上，照片是真实的。她的脑海中也浮现出自己看着这张照片的画面，这绝对不是她第一次看到这张照片。明日香将照片递还给他。

"I do think you're more decent than most guys so I can believe that I had said what I said, but you can't think I was getting onto you or anything. I must have just been too sleepy to realise" the girl rationalised.  
"我认为你比大多数男生都要正派，所以我能相信我说过的话，但你不能认为我在挑逗你或什么的。我一定是太困了，没有意识到" 女孩理性地解释道。

"Asuka, I never assumed anything" Shinji reassured.  
“Asuka，我从没假设过什么。” 真嗣安慰道。

"Good, you tell your two stooges not to do anything with that photo then. I _may_ forgive you if nothing eventuates out of this. I'm still going to ask Hikari about this, but that photo is definitely real. In any case, we best get ready for school" she finished off, before walking to her room.  
“很好，告诉你的那两个跟班别对那张照片做任何事。如果这件事没有闹大，我可能会原谅你。我还会去问 Hikari 这件事，但那张照片绝对是真的。无论如何，我们最好准备去上学。”她结束谈话，走向自己的房间。

Shinji sat back down at the table and finished his breakfast; he was finally free from Asuka's constant prying. Now he could focus more on getting back together with her rather than trying to avoid revealing the past. He looked down at the still unconscious Major on the floor and shook his head. As he finished his meal, he went over to Misato and brought her back to this plane of existence.  
真嗣坐回桌前，吃完早餐；他终于摆脱了 Asuka 不断的盘问。现在他可以更专注于与她复合，而不是试图隐瞒过去。他低头看着地板上仍昏迷不醒的 Misato，摇了摇头。吃完饭后，他走到 Misato 身边，将她唤醒。

"You ok Misato?" Shinji asked.  
"没事吧，美里？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah I'm fine, been a while since I laughed like that" Misato answered.  
"嗯，我很好，已经很久没那样笑过了" 美里回答道。

"Misato, did you find out who was listening in on us?" the boy asked.  
"美里，你查出是谁在偷听我们了吗？" 男孩问道。

"No, I couldn't catch the person. But it doesn't really matter for now, we weren't discussing anything that important" the Major replied.  
"不，我没抓到那个人。不过现在这也不太重要，我们刚才讨论的也不是什么要紧事。" 少校回答道。

"By the way, I just showed Asuka that photo you took" Shinji remarked.  
"对了，我刚给明日香看了你拍的那张照片" 真嗣说道。

"Oh? Any particular reason? How did she take it?" Misato asked, curious as to what had happened this morning between the two.  
"哦？有什么特别的原因吗？她反应如何？" 美里问道，好奇今早两人之间发生了什么。

"It's complicated to explain, but essentially she remembered some of what happened on the morning of the last angel attack. I showed her the photo for proof of its existence as I used it as the scapegoat for why she skipped school to go to Hikari's house that day" Shinji answered.  
"解释起来很复杂，但基本上她记得上次天使袭击那天早上的部分事情。我给她看了照片作为存在的证据，因为我用它作为她那天逃学去光家里的替罪羊。" 真嗣回答道。

"That doesn't completely make sense to me, perhaps fill me in later" Misato replied.  
"这对我来说不完全说得通，也许晚点再给我详细解释一下" 美里回答道。

"I also told her the reason we were downcast about her losing her memories was because she had forgotten the close friendship she and I had. I didn't explain _how_ close we were, but that's more or less the truth and she accepted it" Shinji added.  
"我还告诉她，我们因为她失去记忆而感到沮丧，是因为她忘记了她和我之间的深厚友谊。我没有解释我们有多亲密，但这基本上是事实，她接受了" 真嗣补充道。

"Good thinking! At least now she'll stop pestering us about hiding things from her, perhaps her knowing and accepting that you two were close friends is a step towards your goal as well" Misato commented.  
"好主意！至少现在她不会再缠着我们问东问西了，或许她知道并接受你们俩是好朋友，也是朝着你的目标迈出的一步。" 美里评论道。

"I definitely think so, things are definitely looking better now" Shinji replied, smiling. "In any case, I need to hurry prepare for school!"  
"我确实这么认为，现在情况看起来好多了" 真嗣笑着回答。"无论如何，我得赶紧准备上学了！"

"No worries, go ahead" Misato replied.  
"别担心，去吧" 美里回答道。

The boy returned to the kitchen and placed the already prepared lunches on the table. He then proceeded to his room to change into his school uniform. It felt like it had been forever since the last time he was at school. He placed the photo of him and Asuka back into his drawer and looked at his clock; it was almost time to leave.  
男孩回到厨房，将已经准备好的午餐放在桌上。随后，他走进自己的房间换上校服。感觉好像已经很久没有去过学校了。他把和明日香的照片放回抽屉，看了看时钟；差不多该出发了。

"Baka hurry up already, we gotta go soon!" Asuka shouted as if on cue.  
“笨蛋，快点，我们得走了！”明日香像是有预感一样喊道。

Shinji took his bag, exited his room and returned to the dining room to pack his lunch into his bag. Misato was sitting down at the dining table, now sipping another beer. At the sight of Shinji, she waved to him.  
真嗣拿起书包，走出房间回到餐厅，把午餐装进书包。美里正坐在餐桌旁，又喝起了啤酒。看到真嗣，她向他挥了挥手。

"You not going to NERV today?" he asked curiously.  
"你今天不去 NERV 吗？" 他好奇地问道。

"No, I'm staying home today. I'll be here when you get back" his guardian answered.  
"不了，我今天待在家里。你回来的时候我会在这儿的。" 他的监护人回答道。

"Alright, bye Misato!" he responded, waving at her.  
"好的，再见，美里！" 他回应着，向她挥手。

"Bye Shinji, bye Asuka!" the Major replied, waving at him.  
“再见，真嗣，再见，明日香！”少校回应道，向他挥手。

He then joined Asuka at the door who was pacing impatiently. "Finally, you slow poke" she said, grabbing his hand and pulling him along.  
随后，他走到在门口不耐烦踱步的明日香身边。“终于来了，你这个慢吞吞的家伙。”她说着，抓住他的手拉着他走。

"Ouch Asuka! Not that hand please" he quickly let out.  
“哎哟，明日香！别抓那只手，拜托。”他迅速喊道。

The redhead let go of his hand and grabbed the other one as she pulled him down the stairs; it seemed she really wanted to get to school. Asuka barged through the sea of people like a plow as they rushed to get to school.  
红发女孩松开了他的手，转而抓住另一只，拉着他快步下楼；看来她真的很想赶到学校。明日香像犁一样冲破人群，他们急匆匆地赶往学校。

"Asuka we really don't need to rush" Shinji proposed.  
“明日香，我们真的不用这么急。”真嗣提议道。

The redhead turned to face him glaring and he instantly shut up, letting himself be pulled along. In record time, they reached the front gates of their school and Asuka applied her brakes, creating deep scorch marks in the ground. Shinji quietly pondered how she had been moving so fast on foot. Once again, the pair entered the school together. They had arrived early thanks to Asuka and he suspected she wanted to see Hikari.  
红发女孩转过身来瞪着他，他立刻闭上了嘴，任由她拉着走。他们以创纪录的速度到达了学校前门，明日香猛地停下，在地上留下了深深的焦痕。真嗣默默思索着她是怎么用双脚跑得这么快的。又一次，两人一起走进了学校。多亏了明日香，他们到得很早，他猜她可能是想见光。

Students were still out and about outside chatting; some were heading inside the school. The two eva pilots entered the school building and proceeded to their classroom. On the way, they noticed many posters promoting the musical concert to be held at school and performed by students. The two roommates entered their classroom when they arrived. Hikari was always at school early and so Asuka happily walked over to the class rep.  
学生们还在外面闲聊，有的正往学校里走。两位 EVA 驾驶员走进教学楼，前往自己的教室。途中，他们注意到许多宣传学校即将举行的学生音乐会的海报。到达教室后，这对室友走了进去。光总是早早到校，所以明日香高兴地走向班级代表。

"Hikari! It feels like I haven't seen you in a while" Asuka greeted.  
“光！感觉好久没见到你了。”明日香打招呼道。

"Hey Asuka! I was worried about you. Together with the angel battle and being away on Friday, I was wondering if you were ok" Hikari replied with concern.  
“嘿，明日香！我很担心你。天使战斗加上周五不在，我在想你还好吗？”光关切地回应。

"Of course I'm ok, I'm the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley" the redhead said proudly.  
“当然我没事，我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”红发女孩自豪地说道。

Hikari giggled, "Well what happened before? Have you already made up with Shinji?" she asked.  
光子轻笑道：“那之前发生了什么？你已经和真嗣和好了吗？”她问道。

It was as Asuka had expected, she hadn't told the class rep what had happened. Guess it was lucky she had agreed to Shinji's demand. "Well that is yet to see, today he's going to meet up with the other two stooges and prevent anything bad from occurring. But it wasn't that big a deal in the end, thanks for taking me in Hikari" she answered.  
正如明日香所料，她还没告诉班长发生了什么。看来她同意真嗣的要求真是幸运。“那还有待观察，今天他要和其他两个笨蛋见面，防止任何坏事发生。但最终也没什么大不了的，谢谢你收留我，光子。”她回答道。

"No problem" Hikari said, smiling. "So why weren't you here on Friday?"  
“没问题。”光笑着说，“那你周五怎么没来？”

"Just recovering from injuries in the angel battle, Shinji also. Sorry for worrying you, but you could have called" the redhead replied.  
“只是从天使战斗中恢复伤势，真嗣也是。抱歉让你担心了，但你本可以打电话来的。”红发少年回答道。

"I didn't want to disturb you. I thought something might have happened and was waiting till today before I considered calling" the class rep explained.  
“我不想打扰你。我以为可能发生了什么事，打算等到今天再考虑打电话。”班长解释道。

"Fortunately, everything's ok" the redhead reassured, keeping her word to Shinji and not mentioning her loss of memory. "Did anything interesting happen on Friday anyway?"  
"幸好，一切都好" 红发女孩安慰道，遵守了对真嗣的承诺，没有提及自己失忆的事情。"周五有什么有趣的事发生吗？"

"It was fairly uneventful actually, especially considering the angel attack just the day before. Everyone was just wondering what had happened to you two as you were both absent. It's good to see you're ok, though I can't help but feel sorry for Shinji, he doesn't seem to get a break these days" Hikari commented.  
"其实相当平静，尤其是考虑到前一天还有使徒袭击。大家都在好奇你们俩怎么缺席了。看到你们没事真是太好了，不过我忍不住为真嗣感到难过，他最近似乎没有一刻能休息" 光子评论道。

"What do you mean?" Asuka asked, honestly not knowing what she meant.  
"你是什么意思？" 明日香问，真心不知道她指的是什么。

"Come on Asuka, don't be like that. He had only just returned last week from prison and then almost drowned on the first day back!" the class rep exclaimed. "He had been at school just two and a half days before the angel attack, don't you feel some sympathy?"  
“拜托，明日香，别这样。他上周才刚从监狱回来，第一天就差点淹死！”班长喊道，“他在学校才待了两天半就遭遇使徒袭击，你不觉得应该有点同情心吗？”

The redhead was shocked; Shinji hadn't told her anything about him being imprisoned, why wouldn't he mention something like that?  
红发女孩震惊了；真嗣没告诉她任何关于他入狱的事，为什么他连这种事都不提呢？


_**Asuka was tapping her heel impatiently as she looked at the cell door. "Hurry and open this door already! I want to see him right now!"  
明日香不耐烦地用脚尖敲打着牢房门，“快点开门！我现在就要见他！”**_

_**At that, Misato opened the door causing it to swing open quickly. The redhead soon noticed Shinji sitting on the floor, covering his eyes. Asuka couldn't hold herself back as she tackled the boy enthusiastically, before embracing him.  
话音刚落，美里便迅速推开门，门随即快速打开。红发女孩很快注意到真嗣坐在地板上，双手捂着眼睛。明日香忍不住热情地扑向男孩，随后紧紧拥抱着他。**_

"_**Shinji! It's so good to see you again!" the young girl said, gripping him tightly.**_  
“真嗣！再次见到你真是太好了！”少女说道，紧紧地抱住他。

"_**A-Asuka?" the boy asked, sounding confused.**_  
“明-明日香？”男孩问道，听起来有些困惑。

"_**Who else you baka?" she replied. "Although, I suppose I should be a little understanding, you've been in this cell for three weeks" she explained.**_  
"除了你这个笨蛋还有谁？" 她回答道。"不过，我想我应该稍微理解一下，你已经被关在这个牢房里三个星期了" 她解释说。

"_**Asuka, it's really you… it's really you" he responded, hugging her back firmly. The boy started crying as he held onto her.**_  
“明日香，真的是你……真的是你”他回应道，紧紧地回抱她。男孩在抱着她时开始哭泣。

"_**Shinji… it's ok… I'm here" Asuka said soothingly.**_  
“真嗣……没事的……我在这里”明日香温柔地说道。


'_Wow that was some affection I gave him… maybe I felt sorry for him. Or maybe I was sick of just me and Misato at home, three weeks is a while… but he did look quite troubled. Add the assassination attempt and him getting injured to everything Hikari just said… maybe I shouldn't be so hard on Shinji…'_ she thought.  
“哇，我给了他不少关爱……也许我为他感到难过。或者也许我厌倦了只和美里在家，三周时间挺长的……但他看起来确实很烦恼。再加上暗杀企图和他受伤的事情，再加上刚才光说的那些……也许我不应该对真嗣这么苛刻……”她想道。

"Well true I guess when you put it like that…" Asuka replied, uncertain how else to respond. "I had forgotten the drowning incident was just last week" she continued, trying to prompt Hikari to speak, though it was a true statement anyway.  
"嗯，确实，这么说来……" 明日香回答道，不确定如何回应。"我忘了溺水事件就发生在上周" 她继续说道，试图引导光说话，尽管这也是事实。

"Yeah, I can imagine what with the angel attack! Though still… I don't think I'll ever forget you doing something so embarrassing to save Shinji" Hikari replied.  
"是啊，我能想象，毕竟天使袭击了！不过……我还是觉得我不会忘记你为了救真嗣做了那么尴尬的事" 光回答道。

Asuka thought it was a good idea to see if Shinji had told the truth. "Yeah, I can't believe I stripped down to my underwear… I dunno what I was thinking, giving everyone a free peep show" she remarked, unable to help blushing a little.  
明日香觉得这是个好主意，看看真嗣是否说了实话。"是啊，我真不敢相信我脱到只剩内衣……我不知道我当时在想什么，让大家都免费看了一眼" 她评论道，忍不住脸红了一点。

"But it was so decent of you to save him from drowning, considering what you had to do… besides, don't forget you got a lot of attention, apologies and praise from many boys in the class afterward" the ponytailed girl replied.  
"但考虑到你不得不做的事情，你救他免于溺水真是太好了……而且，别忘了事后你从班上许多男孩那里得到了很多关注、道歉和赞扬" 马尾辫女孩回答道。

'_Perhaps I realised I would get approval from my classmates for the act, I guess the incident doesn't seem too farfetched. It would also appear Shinji had told me the truth about what happened, it's good to see he isn't telling me an alternate history'_ the redhead thought.  
'也许我意识到我会因为这一行为得到同学们的认可，我想这个事件并不显得太牵强。看来真嗣确实告诉了我真相，很高兴他没有对我编造另一段历史' 红发女孩心想。

"All's well that ends well, I guess" Asuka commented. "And Shinji's fine, other than a hand injury… maybe too fine even. Bastard annoyed me over the weekend"  
"我想，结局好就一切都好" 明日香评论道。"而且真嗣除了手部受伤外一切都好……也许好得过头了。那个混蛋周末还惹我生气"

"Did you guys fight again?" Hikari asked.  
"你们又吵架了吗？" 光问道。

"Yeah, but we ended up resolving it. Just some… unexpected difference of opinions. Also, I get the feeling he likes me" Asuka answered.  
"嗯，不过最后解决了。只是一些……意料之外的分歧。而且，我有种感觉他喜欢我" 明日香回答道。

"Of course he does! He respects you too. I'm glad you're finally realising that he has feelings towards you" Hikari responded immediately.  
"当然啦！他也尊重你。我很高兴你终于意识到他对你的感情了" 光立刻回应道。

"Wow Hikari, didn't know you were so excited about that. Though it's pointless in the end for him, it's not like I'm gonna return such feelings, if he even has the balls to ask me out directly" Asuka retorted.  
"哇，光，没想到你对那件事这么兴奋。虽然对他来说最终是徒劳的，我又不会回应这种感情，如果他甚至有胆量直接约我出去的话。" 明日香反驳道。

"Jeez Asuka you are so stubborn!" Hikari reprimanded. "I think he's a great match for you! And even if you don't have feelings for him, it's definitely not pointless!"  
"天啊，明日香你真是固执！" 光责备道。"我觉得他和你很般配！即使你现在对他没感觉，也绝不是徒劳的！"

"Puh-lease, Shinji does not deserve someone like me. But I guess my words were a bit too harsh" Asuka conceded. "Besides you're one to talk, you're not honest to me about Touji"  
"得了吧，真嗣不配拥有像我这样的人。但我想我的话可能有点过分了。" 明日香承认道。"而且说到这个，你也没资格说我，你对我和阿薰的事也不坦诚。"

"That's not fair Asuka! We're discussing you and Shinji!" Hikari snapped, blushing bright pink.  
“那对明日香不公平！我们正在讨论你和真嗣呢！” 光子厉声说道，脸颊涨得通红。

The redhead couldn't help smirking at her friend's reaction; guess Shinji was right about her and Touji.  
红发女孩忍不住对朋友的反应露出得意的微笑；看来真嗣关于她和冬二的事说得没错。

"In any case, whatever happens with Shinji is your choice. Though I don't agree with your approach about whether he deserves you or not. Nonetheless, I know he has a lot of good points too. Did anything good happen this weekend with him?" the ponytailed girl asked.  
“无论如何，真嗣的事你自己决定。虽然我不赞同你关于他是否配得上你的看法。不过，我也知道他有很多优点。这个周末和他有什么好事发生吗？” 马尾女孩问道。

"Yeah it wasn't all bad, he did take me shopping! I gotta show you some of the clothes I bought, you'll find them so cute!" Asuka recounted.  
“是啊，也不全是坏事，他还带我去购物了呢！我得给你看看我买的一些衣服，你一定会觉得超可爱的！”明日香回忆道。

"Oh really? I'd love to see them!" Hikari replied eagerly, "We'll have to continue this discussion later though Asuka. Sorry but I need to prepare some things before the class begins" she explained before walking off.  
“哦，真的吗？我真想看看！” 光急切地回答，“不过我们得稍后再聊了，明日香。抱歉，我得在课开始前准备一些东西。”她解释完便走开了。

Shinji had been standing off in the distance to give Asuka plenty of space to catch up with Hikari. Touji and Kensuke hadn't yet arrived, so he hadn't been able to discuss the imaginary photo incident with them yet. He stood there silently, thinking about the current situation and how he should go about with his new approach towards Asuka. Uncertainty, guilt, despair, hope all plagued him and he struggled to put his mind at ease. There was also the worry about how the redhead would deal with memory loss or if she found out conflicting information, he really disliked needing to lie to her but he just couldn't think of another way.  
真嗣站在远处，给明日香留出足够的空间与光交谈。东治和健司还没到，所以他还没能和他们讨论那次虚构的照片事件。他静静地站在那里，思考着当前的状况以及他该如何采取新的方式对待明日香。不确定、内疚、绝望、希望，种种情绪困扰着他，他努力平复自己的心情。还有对红发女孩如何处理失忆或发现矛盾信息的担忧，他真的很不喜欢对她撒谎，但又想不出其他办法。

The boy's thoughts were interrupted as he noticed the class rep walk away from Asuka and so he moved over to the redhead. "And? Did she know?" he asked, wondering what the redhead had told Hikari on the day of the angel attack.  
男孩的思绪被中断，他注意到班长从明日香身边走开，于是他走向红发女孩。“然后呢？她知道吗？”他问道，想知道红发女孩在天使袭击那天对光说了些什么。

"Nope, you were right. She didn't know anything. She also told a fairly identical story of the drowning incident, which was apparently just last week. Her reaction to my prodding made it obvious that she has feelings for that dumb jock too, looks like you weren't making things up in either case" Asuka answered.  
“没有，你猜对了。她什么也不知道。她还讲了一个几乎一模一样的溺水事件，好像就是上周的事。她对我的追问的反应很明显，她对那个笨蛋运动员也有感觉，看来你在这两件事上都没撒谎。”明日香回答道。

"What, you don't trust me?" Shinji replied, pretending to be offended. He was secretly glad Hikari hadn't given any conflicting information, it certainly gave him more credibility.  
“什么，你不相信我？”真嗣回答，假装生气。他暗自庆幸光没有提供任何矛盾的信息，这无疑增加了他的可信度。

"Well you _were_ hiding things from me, scratch that _are_ still hiding things from me. Apparently, you had just returned from prison last week. Mind filling me in?" the redhead asked with a smirk.  
"好吧，你之前对我隐瞒了事情，不对，现在还在对我隐瞒。显然，你上周刚从监狱回来。介意给我解释一下吗？" 红发女孩带着一丝嘲讽问道。

'_Oh right, all my friends know about that… I shoulda told her about it'_ he thought. "Ahh yeah… I was imprisoned for a few weeks for disobeying the Commander's orders in the previous angel battle, the 15th" he replied, using the same lie they had used to his friends. "It's not something I forgot by the way, I just didn't think it was relevant to you"  
'哦对了，我所有的朋友都知道这件事……我早该告诉她的' 他心想。 "啊，是的……我因为在上一次天使战斗中违抗指挥官的命令而被关押了几周，就是第 15 次战斗" 他回答道，用的还是之前对朋友们撒的那个谎。 "顺便说一句，我并没有忘记这件事，只是觉得对你来说不相关"

"That was it? How boring, I can't believe he imprisoned you just for that" Asuka replied, sounding a little disappointed.  
"就这样？真无聊，我简直不敢相信他仅仅因为那个就把你关起来了" 明日香回答道，听起来有些失望。


"_**While I may have my dislikes about the third child" Asuka started, "I was the only one able to save him. I couldn't just let my fellow pilot die"**_  
"虽然我对三号机有些不满" 明日香开口道，"但我是唯一能救他的人。我不能眼睁睁看着我的同僚飞行员死去"

"_**Well, if ya really did all that… I suppose ya deserve our gratitude" Touji said, reluctantly holding out his hand to shake hers.**_  
"好吧，如果你真的做了那么多…我想你值得我们感谢" 真嗣说，不情愿地伸出手与她握手。

"_**Thanks for saving him Asuka" Kensuke said, also holding out his hand.**_  
"谢谢你救了他，明日香" 健介也伸出手。

"_**Not every day I see the dumb jock show his appreciation for my existence" Asuka replied smirking, shaking Touji's hand before shaking Kensuke's.**_  
“不是每天都能看到那个笨蛋运动员展示他对我的存在的感激。”明日香带着一丝嘲讽回答，先摇了摇冬二的手，然后是真嗣的。

"_**Asuka!" Hikari snapped.**_ “明日香！”光愤怒地说。

"_**I'll let this go just for today ya bad-tempered girl" Touji responded with a fake smile.**_  
“今天就放过你吧，你这个坏脾气的女孩。”冬二带着假笑回应道。

"_**You're definitely ok Shinji?" Hikari asked, ignoring the other two's antics.**_  
"你真的没事吗，真嗣？" 光不理会另外两人的胡闹，问道。

"_**Yeah yeah, Asuka acted pretty quick thankfully" he replied.**_  
"是啊是啊，幸好明日香反应很快" 他回答道。

"_**And your time in prison…? I think it's silly the Commander put you there" Hikari continued.**_  
"还有你在监狱里的时间……？我觉得司令把你关进去真是太荒唐了" 光继续说道。

"_**Damn straight, that Commander is an asshole! You're fighting dem angels all the time, he could cut you some slack" Touji added aggressively.**_  
“说得太对了，那个指挥官就是个混蛋！你一直在和那些天使战斗，他至少该给你点宽松。” 冬二咄咄逼人地补充道。

"_**Well, the time in prison was a difficult experience I'll admit, but it did give me some time to think about a lot of things" Shinji explained. "In any case, I'm glad you guys are on my side but I did deserve to go to prison. There's no need to be angry for my sake" he finished.**_  
“好吧，监狱里的时光确实是一段艰难的经历，我承认，但它也给了我时间去思考很多事情。” 真嗣解释道，“无论如何，我很高兴你们站在我这边，但我确实应该进监狱。没必要为我生气。” 他结束了这段话。

"_**What! No matter what orders you disobeyed, it can't be worth that surely?!" Touji refuted.**_  
“什么！无论你违抗了什么命令，这肯定不值得吧？！” 冬二反驳道。

"_**Angel battles are a serious thing" Asuka interrupted. "Not following orders can lead to casualties or worse, the angel defeating us" she explained.**_  
“天使之战可不是闹着玩的。”明日香打断道，“不服从命令可能导致伤亡，甚至更糟，天使击败我们。”她解释说。


The redhead shook her head as she recalled yet another memory, it seemed she was mostly recalling fairly recent events now that she knew the timeframe. That memory certainly lined up with what the boy had just said too, it was also nice to see those two stooges grateful for her actions. Asuka found her own words to be quite convincing as to why Shinji was imprisoned, but she couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't quite right, especially after recalling how distraught Shinji had been after being released from his cell.  
红发少女摇了摇头，她再次回忆起另一段记忆，现在她知道时间线后，似乎主要回忆的都是近期的事件。那段记忆确实与男孩刚刚说的一致，能看到那两个家伙对她心存感激也挺好。明日香觉得自己的话很有说服力，解释了为什么真嗣会被关押，但她无法摆脱那种感觉，尤其是回想起真嗣被释放后那副失魂落魄的样子，总觉得哪里不对。

Her thoughts were interrupted by Shinji speaking up. "Well never mind that, how was talking to Hikari?" he asked, trying to steer the conversation away from that topic as it could make her remember all sorts of things she wasn't ready for yet.  
她的思绪被真嗣的声音打断。“算了，不提那个，你和 Hikari 聊得怎么样？”他问道，试图将话题从那个可能让她想起许多尚未准备好面对的事情的话题上引开。

"Well Hikari is still pretty much how I remember her so that's ok, but I'm curious as to how the other two stooges are. I mean Rei acted way different than usual, I'm half expecting Touji to be intelligent" she remarked.  
"嗯，小光还是和我记忆中一样，所以还好，但我很好奇另外两个家伙怎么样了。我是说，丽表现得比平时奇怪多了，我甚至有点期待东治变得聪明起来" 她评论道。

Shinji snickered a little at her joke.  
真嗣听到她的笑话，轻声笑了一下。

"What is that supposed to mean?" a voice said aloud.  
"那是什么意思？" 一个声音大声说道。

Asuka turned around to face the jock, smiling smugly. "You know precisely what I mean, you are so dumb you'd get lost in an elevator"  
明日香转过身面对着那个运动员，得意地笑着。“你明明知道我的意思，你这么笨，连电梯都能把你困住。”

"Yeah well, you're so bitchy you look like a cat" Touji retorted.  
“是啊，你这么泼辣，看起来就像只猫。” 东治反驳道。

Shinji visibly cringed and Asuka just shook her head in laughter. "You prove my point exactly. A bitch is a female dog not a cat, retard" she said arrogantly.  
真嗣明显地皱了皱眉，而明日香只是笑着摇头。“你正好证明了我的观点。泼妇是指母狗，不是猫，傻瓜。”她傲慢地说道。

Touji clenched his fists, ready to retaliate.  
冬二紧握双拳，准备反击。

"Settle down Touji" Kensuke said walking in, "She's not worth it"  
“冷静点，冬二。”健司走进来说，“她不值得你这样。”

"Oh look, the other stooge has arrived" Asuka commented.  
“哦，看哪，另一个跟班来了。”明日香评论道。

"Yeah, she's not worth it! She's just a stupid-owww!" Touji let out.  
“是啊，她不值得！她就是个蠢——哎哟！” 东治叫道。

"What were you gonna say Suzuhara?" Hikari asked, holding his ear; looks like the class rep had returned after hearing all the fuss.  
“你刚才想说什么，铃原？”光子问道，揪着他的耳朵；看来班长在听到所有骚动后回来了。

"Nothing, nothing let go please" Touji pleaded.  
“没什么，没什么，请放手” 东治恳求道。

The class rep released her hold on Touji and he quickly nursed his swollen ear.  
班长松开了对冬二的手，他赶紧揉着红肿的耳朵。

"I call a full retreat" Kensuke announced, signalling to his two other friends.  
“我宣布全面撤退。”剑介宣布道，向他的另外两个朋友示意。

Together Shinji, Touji and Kensuke moved away from the glaring faces of Hikari and Asuka. When they were out of range of possible reprimand, the trio stopped to talk to each other.  
真嗣、冬二和剑介一起从光和明日香怒视的目光中撤离。当他们离开可能被训斥的范围后，三人停下来互相交谈。

"Yo Shin-man, how's it going? Didn't see ya here on Friday" Touji asked.  
"哟，真嗣君，最近怎么样？周五没见你来啊" 冬二问道。

"Yeah, we were recovering from the angel battle" Shinji replied.  
"嗯，我们在从使徒战斗中恢复" 真嗣回答道。

"Is your hand injury from the angel battle?" Kensuked asked curiously.  
"你手上的伤是使徒战斗留下的吗？" 剑介好奇地问。

"No… that was from an assassination attempt on Asuka. Thankfully, this was the only thing that ended up happening to us" Shinji answered.  
"不…那是因为有人试图暗杀明日香。幸运的是，我们只遭遇了这些。" 真嗣回答道。

"Tssk, you shoulda just let the assassin do his job" Touji joked.  
"啧，你当时就该让刺客完成他的任务" 冬二开玩笑地说。

"Don't say that Touji!" Shinji shot back sharply. "Sorry, I know you're joking, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Asuka did save my life too remember?"  
"别这么说，冬二！" 真嗣严厉地回击。"抱歉，我知道你在开玩笑，但那次经历并不愉快。别忘了，明日香也救了我的命。"

"Sorry sorry, too soon and all that. My bad" Touji apologised.  
“抱歉抱歉，太早了，都是我的错。” 东治道歉道。

Shinji then recalled what he needed to do with his friends. Thankfully, he didn't have to say anything to stop them spreading the photo of him and Asuka based on the fact he never gave it to them. However, he needed to make it look like he was trying to make sure they didn't, so that Asuka believed he had stopped them. He was proven right as every few moments in the corner of his eye he saw Asuka glance at him momentarily.  
真嗣随后想起了他需要和朋友做的事情。幸运的是，他不必说什么来阻止他们传播他和明日香的照片，因为他从未把照片给他们。然而，他需要表现得像是在努力确保他们没有这样做，以便让明日香相信他阻止了他们。事实证明他是正确的，因为每隔一会儿，他就能在眼角余光中看到明日香短暂地瞥他一眼。

"Speaking of Asuka though… are you guys still selling those photos of her?" Shinji asked.  
“说到明日香……你们还在卖那些她的照片吗？” 真嗣问道。

"Why do you want to know?" Touji asked, suspicious.  
“你为什么想知道？” 东治问道，带着怀疑。

"Just curious" male eva pilot replied.  
“只是好奇。” 男性 EVA 驾驶员回答道。

"You want one don't you Shinji? Well, we still got pics of her in her swimming costume, in sports gear as well as many other types of attire" Touji answered.  
“你也想要一张对吧，真嗣？嗯，我们还有她穿泳装的照片，运动装备的，以及其他各种服装的照片。” 东治回答道。

"No, no I just want to know how your business is doing" Shinji said defensively. Though in truth, he wouldn't have minded to have those pictures.  
"不，不，我只是想知道你的生意怎么样" 真嗣辩解道。虽然说实话，他并不介意拥有那些照片。

"Lately our operation has been undermined. Someone is interrupting almost every meeting with our potential clients. Anyway, point is we stopped a while ago as we weren't making any profit" Kensuke explained.  
"最近我们的业务受到了破坏。有人在几乎每次与潜在客户的会议上进行干扰。总之，重点是我们已经停了一段时间，因为我们没有赚到任何利润" 肯斯克解释道。

"Ah well it's a good thing in a way, Asuka will never find out" Shinji commented.  
"啊，从某种程度上说这是件好事，明日香永远不会发现" 真嗣评论道。

"Maybe everyone has just realised her bitchy personality far outweighs her beauty" Touji teased.  
"也许大家都意识到她的泼辣性格远超她的美貌" 冬二打趣道。

"Amen to that!" Kensuke replied, high-fiving Touji. "Perhaps more attention will be given to Rei now"  
"说得好！" 真希回应道，与冬二击掌。"或许现在大家会更关注丽了"

"Well now that you mention it, Rei came up to me and started a conversation. It seems like she's becoming more umm… sociable" Touji began.  
"你这么一说，丽确实来找我聊过天。看来她变得...呃...更合群了" 冬二开始说道。

"What did she say?" Shinji asked, curious.  
"她说了什么？" 真嗣好奇地问。

"Well, it was like this…" Touji continued.  
"嗯，是这样的……" 冬二继续说道。


**"**_**Your name is Suzuhara right? You are a friend of Ikari's are you not?" Rei asked.**_  
"你的名字是铃原没错吧？你是真嗣的朋友，对吧？" 丽问道。

**"**_**Yes, right on both accounts. How can I help ya Rei?" Touji replied.**_  
"是的，两个都对。我能帮你什么忙吗，丽？" 东治回答道。

**"**_**I have been observing Ikari's and Sohryu's behaviour and I cannot see how their relationship resembles a married couple. But I am not experienced in this area so maybe I am missing something" Rei explained.**_  
"我一直在观察碇和惣流的行为，我看不出他们的关系像一对已婚夫妇。但在这方面我没有经验，所以可能我忽略了什么" 丽解释道。

_**Touji began to laugh. "Look Rei, I don't think you realised but I was joking when I said they acted like a married couple"  
东治开始笑了起来。"看吧，丽，我想你没意识到，我之前说他们像一对已婚夫妇时是在开玩笑"**_

**"**_**Joking?" she asked, confused.**_  
"开玩笑吗？" 她困惑地问。

**"**_**It's when you say something that isn't necessarily true, but it is said to make you laugh" Touji answered.**_  
"开玩笑就是说一些不一定是真的话，但说出来是为了逗你笑。" 东治回答道。

**"**_**So, you didn't really mean it?" Rei asked, trying to clarify.**_  
"那么，你不是真的那个意思？" 丽试图弄清楚。

**"**_**No of course not, but it made them blush and sure earned a lot of laughter" Touji replied.**_  
"当然不是，但它让他们脸红，也确实引来了不少笑声" 东治回答道。

**"**_**I think I understand, thank you for explaining it to me" Rei replied.**_  
"我想我明白了，谢谢你给我解释" 丽回答道。

**"**_**No problem. Maybe you should try telling a joke, it will help you understand the feeling more" Touji suggested.**_  
"没事。也许你可以试试讲个笑话，这会让你更理解那种感觉" 东治建议道。


As Touji finished explaining, Shinji suddenly understood Rei's behaviour yesterday; now that he thought about it, he thought it was kinda funny. Rei was trying to understand human behaviour and emotions. The bell then rang, signalling the beginning of class and all students went to sit down at their respective desks. The teacher walked in and Hikari said her customary "Rise! Bow! Sit!"  
当冬二解释完毕，真嗣突然明白了昨天绫波的行为；现在想来，他觉得有点好笑。绫波正在尝试理解人类的举止和情感。此时，铃声响起，标志着课堂的开始，所有学生都回到各自的座位上。老师走了进来，光子照例喊道：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”

"Now students, I have an announcement to make" the teacher declared.  
“现在，同学们，我有一个通知要宣布。”老师宣布道。

All students quietened down and gave their attention as the teacher spoke up.  
所有学生都安静下来，全神贯注地听老师讲话。

"We have a new student transferring into this class, please make her feel welcome" the teacher announced.  
"我们班新转来了一位同学，请大家让她感到受欢迎。"老师宣布道。

A small redheaded girl walked into the classroom and wrote her name on the blackboard.  
一个红头发的小女孩走进教室，在黑板上写下了她的名字。

"Hi my name is Aria Swung-Oak, I'm pleased to meet you" Aria greeted the class.  
"大家好，我叫 Aria Swung-Oak，很高兴认识你们" Aria 向全班同学打招呼。

Shinji recognised her immediately and stood up. "You're that girl in the store, I remember you" he said to her.  
真嗣立刻认出了她，站起身来。“你是店里那个女孩，我记得你。”他对她说道。

The little girl looked at him shocked and remembered the encounter last week when she had been shopping and had suddenly been turned around by him.  
小女孩震惊地看着他，想起了上周购物时突然被他转过身来的那一幕。

"Ah yes you're that cute polite boy, bowing to me so formally" the transfer student replied, giggling.  
“啊，是的，你就是那个可爱又礼貌的男孩，那么正式地向我鞠躬。”转学生回答道，咯咯笑着。

Shinji blushed at the comment and sat down, the rest of the class casting curious glances at him.  
听到这番话，真嗣脸红了，坐了下来，班上其他同学都好奇地打量着他。

"Anyway, she has come from America and has been here since last week and has chosen to learn at this school" the teacher explained.  
“无论如何，她从美国来，上周就到了，并选择在这所学校学习。”老师解释道。

"What's with the weird name?" one of the students asked.  
“这名字怎么这么奇怪？”一个学生问道。

"Don't be rude!" the teacher snapped, "Her name is American"  
"别无礼！" 老师厉声道，"她的名字是美式的"

"It's alright, I can explain. Many American names come from England. Most English surnames come from a job they did, for example Fletcher is a surname and it is also a person who makes arrows. My family a long time ago used to cut down oak trees" Aria explained.  
"没关系，我可以解释。许多美国名字源自英国。大多数英国姓氏来源于他们的职业，例如 Fletcher 是一个姓氏，也是制作箭的人。很久以前，我的家族负责砍伐橡树" Aria 解释道。

"Ok, I want to begin the lesson now so sit down over there Miss Swung-Oak" the older man said, pointing to an empty desk.  
"好了，我现在要开始上课了，请坐到那边的空桌去，斯旺橡小姐" 那位年长男士指着一张空桌子说道。

The redheaded Aria sat down at her new desk and took out her books and utensils. Asuka looked at the girl curiously, she couldn't recognise her or even jog a memory; she had obviously never seen her before. _'Calling Shinji cute, how stupid is she?'_ She looked over to Shinji whose attention was currently taken up by masses of messages arriving at his computer. Asuka looked at him amused as he frantically tried to stop the incoming messages; it seemed people were curious as to how he knew the new girl.  
红发的 Aria 坐在她的新桌前，拿出书本和文具。Asuka 好奇地看着这个女孩，她认不出她，甚至无法唤起一丝记忆；显然，她以前从未见过她。'说 Shinji 可爱，她有多傻？'她看向 Shinji，他的注意力正被电脑上涌入的大量消息占据。Asuka 看着他手忙脚乱地试图阻止消息涌入，似乎人们都好奇他是怎么认识新来的女孩的。

Shinji finally managed to block all incoming messages except from Touji, Kensuke and Asuka.  
Shinji 终于设法屏蔽了所有消息，除了来自 Touji、Kensuke 和 Asuka 的。

_**Touji: Yo Shinji you dog, how come you never told us about this cutie? Why do you get all the good chicks?  
Touji：哟 Shinji，你这小子，怎么从没告诉我们这个甜心？为什么好姑娘都让你碰上了？**_

He quickly typed a message back.  
他迅速回复了一条消息。

_**Shinji: I met her randomly and it was for only a few seconds, do you tell me about all the people you bump into?  
真嗣：我偶然遇见她，只短短几秒钟，你难道要把遇到的每个人都告诉我吗？**_

_**Touji: I think she likes you Shinji :P, not as hot as Asuka but good enough.  
斗志：我觉得她喜欢你，真嗣 :P，虽然没明日香那么火辣，但也挺不错的。**_

Shinji just sweat dropped at the comment.  
真嗣对这个评论只是汗颜了一下。

_**Shinji: I barely know her.  
真嗣：我几乎不认识她。**_

_**Touji: I say go for her Mr. cute polite boy.  
冬二：我说，去追她吧，可爱的礼貌男孩先生。**_

Shinji just shook his head. He then began typing a message to Kensuke.  
真嗣只是摇了摇头。随后，他开始给健介发消息。

_**Shinji: Kensuke, in the last angel battle Asuka suffered head trauma and lost her memory and has forgotten our relationship. Currently, she is acting as if she hasn't lost her memory so there isn't a problem, you can act as you usually do. I am only telling you this so you don't mention our previous relationship to her.  
真嗣：健介，在上一次使徒战斗中，明日香头部受伤失去了记忆，忘记了我们的关系。目前，她表现得好像没有失忆一样，所以没什么问题，你可以像往常一样行事。我告诉你这些，只是希望你不要向她提及我们之前的关系。**_

_**Kensuke: Damn that sucks Shinji… must be rough having her forget that. Thanks for informing me though, I will be careful with what I say.  
健介：该死，真嗣，这太糟糕了……她忘记这些一定很难受吧。不过，谢谢你告诉我这些，我会注意我的言辞的。**_

_**Shinji: Yeah… it sucks hard. Thanks man.  
真嗣：是啊……糟透了。谢了，伙计。**_

The pilot of Unit 01 relaxed in his chair, he was certain no problems would occur now. He was a little curious at the new student and he had to admit she did look cute. Shinji turned his gaze in her direction to observe her. In this moment, she happened to turn around and catch his gaze. Aria smiled at him warmly before redirecting her attention to the teacher. Shinji looked down at his laptop, noticing he had been sent another message.  
初号机的驾驶员在椅子上放松下来，他确信现在不会有什么问题了。他对新来的学生有点好奇，而且不得不承认她确实很可爱。真嗣将目光转向她，想观察一下。就在这时，她恰好转过身来，捕捉到了他的视线。阿莉亚朝他温暖地笑了笑，然后重新将注意力转向老师。真嗣低头看向自己的笔记本电脑，发现又收到了一条消息。

_**Asuka: Ok third child, who is this girl? You never mentioned her to me.  
明日香：好吧，第三适格者，这女孩是谁？你从没跟我提过她。**_

_**Shinji: I don't know her. I just bumped into her randomly the other day. As soon I left the store, I had already forgotten her.  
真嗣：我不认识她。那天我只是偶然撞见她。一离开商店，我就已经把她忘了。**_

_**Asuka: Well regardless, at least she'll relieve some of the perverted boys' attention off me for a while. She even has red hair like me.  
明日香：不管怎样，至少她能帮我分担一些那些变态男生的注意力。她甚至和我一样有着红发。**_

Shinji tuned out the rest of the teacher's lecture as he waited for the lunch break. Soon enough, the bell rang and the students got up ready to go to lunch. Aria made her way to the male eva pilot and tapped him on the shoulder. Shinji turned around, surprised to find the little girl there.  
真嗣在等待午休时忽略了老师的其余讲解。不久，铃声响起，学生们起身准备去吃午饭。阿莉亚走向男性 EVA 驾驶员，轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀。真嗣转过身，惊讶地发现小女孩站在那里。

"Hi" Shinji greeted. "嗨" 真嗣打招呼道。

"I never got your name, after all you know mine now" Aria said, smiling.  
"我一直没问你的名字，毕竟你现在知道我的了" 亚里亚笑着说。

"It's Shinji, Shinji Ikari" he answered.  
"我是真嗣，碇真嗣" 他回答道。

"No way! You're the third child?" she asked, astonished.  
"不可能！你是第三个孩子？" 她惊讶地问道。

"Yeah, I pilot Unit 01" he replied quietly.  
"是的，我驾驶 01 号机" 他轻声回答。

"I didn't know they had such a cute boy piloting Unit 01" Aria remarked.  
"我不知道驾驶 01 号机的竟然是个这么可爱的男孩" 艾丽娅评论道。

Shinji blushed at being called cute again. "Well, you see…" he started.  
再次被说可爱，真嗣脸红了。“嗯，你看……”他开口道。

"If you don't mind…" Aria started, "I'm new to this school and you seem like a nice enough guy, can you show me around? I'd love to have lunch with you"  
“如果你不介意的话……”亚里亚开始说，“我是新转来这个学校的，你看起来人不错，能带我四处看看吗？我很想和你一起吃午饭。”

"Yeah sure, ok" Shinji agreed.  
“当然可以，好的”真嗣同意了。

Meanwhile Asuka had noticed the exchange and was glaring daggers at the other girl's back. _'She's just using him because he pilots Unit 01, oh what the hell do I care anyway? Shinji can do whatever he wants.'_ With that, the pilot of Unit 02 went off after Hikari to eat lunch. Both Touji and Kensuke had mysteriously disappeared, leaving Shinji to deal with the new girl by himself. Many other boys cast jealous glances at him but said nothing.  
与此同时，明日香注意到了这一幕，正对那女孩的背影怒目而视。'她只是因为他驾驶零一机才利用他，我他妈的在乎什么呢？真嗣想干什么就干什么吧。'说完，零二机的驾驶员便跟着光去吃午饭了。东治和健司神秘地消失了，留下真嗣独自应对新来的女孩。许多其他男生向他投去嫉妒的目光，却一言不发。

"Well come on already, how long you gonna stand there?" Aria said eagerly.  
“快点儿，你还要在那儿站多久？”亚莉亚急切地说。

"Alright, follow me" Shinji said, motioning her to come after him.  
“好吧，跟我来。”真嗣说着，示意她跟上。

The male eva pilot led the exuberant little girl out of the classroom and to the school grounds. The sun shone brightly down on them making Aria's beautiful red hair sparkle radiantly. Shinji showed her all the areas outside the school building and the girl tagged along, enjoying every moment. Soon, she motioned towards a tree and the pair sat down in the shade to eat their lunch.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员带着活泼的小女孩走出教室，来到校园里。阳光明媚，照在 Aria 美丽的红色头发上，闪耀着光芒。Shinji 带她参观了学校外的各个区域，小女孩兴致勃勃地跟着，享受每一刻。不久，她指向一棵树，两人便在树荫下坐下，开始吃午餐。

"So, how do you like the school?" Shinji asked.  
“那么，你觉得学校怎么样？”Shinji 问道。

"It's great! Thanks for your help too, you really are a great guy. Do you have a girlfriend?" the girl asked.  
“很棒！也谢谢你的帮助，你真是个好人。你有女朋友吗？”女孩问道。

"Well err no but…" he started.  
"呃，不，但是……" 他开口道。

"Really? How can you not have a girlfriend? You are such a cute and nice guy" Aria commented.  
"真的吗？你怎么会没有女朋友呢？你这么可爱又善良。" 艾丽娅评论道。

"No, I'm nothing special" he replied, scratching his head; he was not used to receiving this much praise and attention from a girl.  
"不，我没什么特别的。" 他回答，挠了挠头；他不习惯从一个女孩那里得到这么多赞美和关注。

"Don't be so modest! You only save the whole world in your eva, surely it must be tough. But you do have some help from the other two pilots I guess. Do the other two pilots go to this school as well?" the redhead asked.  
"别这么谦虚！你可是开着 EVA 拯救了整个世界，肯定不容易。不过我想你还有另外两位驾驶员的帮助吧。另外两位驾驶员也在这所学校吗？" 红发女孩问道。

"Yes, Asuka and Rei both attend this school. Both are very easy to recognise, Asuka has red hair and is the most popular girl in the school. She has a very fiery personality. Rei has blue hair and is very quiet, usually looking out the window during class time" Shinji answered.  
"是的，明日香和绫波都就读于这所学校。她们都很容易辨认，明日香有着红发，是学校里最受欢迎的女生。她的性格非常火爆。绫波则是蓝发，非常安静，上课时通常望着窗外。" 真嗣回答道。

"Oh, so that's Asuka! I saw her almost instantly as she's the only other person with red hair. I didn't see anyone with blue hair though" the girl replied.  
"哦，原来那就是明日香！我一眼就认出她了，因为她是唯一一个红头发的人。不过我没看到有蓝头发的人。" 女孩回答道。

"Yeah, Rei is not here today" Shinji explained.  
“是啊，丽今天不在。”真嗣解释道。

"Hey, by any chance when we met in the shop were you looking for Asuka?" Aria asked curiously.  
“嘿，我们在店里碰面的时候，你是不是在找明日香？”亚里亚好奇地问。

"Yes I was" he said, nodding.  
“是的，我是在找她。”他点头说道。

"I see it makes sense now. I thought it was kinda funny how you bowed so formally to me, but then again, I'm not used to Japanese behaviour" the girl remarked.  
"现在我明白了，这很有道理。我之前觉得你对我鞠躬那么正式挺有趣的，不过话说回来，我不太习惯日本人的行为方式。" 女孩评论道。

Shinji began eating his lunch as Aria fell silent. The girl looked at him curiously, taking in all his features and watching how he ate his meal.  
真嗣开始吃他的午餐，而亚莉亚则陷入了沉默。女孩好奇地看着他，仔细观察他的每一个特征，以及他吃饭的样子。

"I haven't tried much Japanese food, can I have a try?" she asked.  
"我还没怎么尝试过日本料理，能让我尝尝吗？" 她问道。

"Sure" he said, offering her some of his food.  
“当然”他说着，递给她一些自己的食物。

The redhead took a bite and smiled happily. "Mmm delicious, this must be homemade"  
红发女孩咬了一口，开心地笑了。“嗯，真好吃，这一定是自制的”

"Yes, I cooked it" Shinji admitted.  
“是的，我做的”真嗣承认道。

"You cooked it? Wow, what else can you do? I'm so impressed" Aria exclaimed.  
"你做的？哇，你还会什么？我真是太佩服了" Aria 惊叹道。

"Really, there's no need to compliment me" the boy replied, starting to feel embarrassed.  
"真的，没必要夸我" 男孩回答，开始感到有些不好意思。

"Oh, but what's a little praise hurt anyway. Though I am a little curious about one thing. If you don't mind me asking, how did you injure your hand? It looks like more than just a small wound"  
"哦，不过一点赞美又有什么关系呢。不过我确实有点好奇一件事。如果你不介意我问的话，你的手是怎么受伤的？看起来不像是小伤口"

"Oh that, it's well… I had a knife go right through my hand in an assassination attempt" he explained.  
"哦，那个啊，其实……我曾遭遇暗杀，一把刀直接穿过了我的手。" 他解释道。

"Whaa? People are trying to kill the saviour of the world? Does it hurt? Can you still write with it or even use it?" Aria fretted.  
"什么？有人想杀世界的救星？疼吗？你还能写字或者使用它吗？" 阿莉亚担忧地问道。

"Thankfully it's not as serious as it looks. I can still write, but it starts to hurt after a while. It doesn't hurt unless I use it too much and luckily none of my nerves or anything were damaged so it will recover fully in time" the boy answered.  
"幸好没看起来那么严重。我还能写字，但过一会儿就会疼。只要不过度使用就不疼，而且幸运的是我的神经什么的都没受损，所以时间久了会完全恢复的。" 男孩回答道。

"That's good" the girl replied in relief.  
“那太好了。”女孩松了口气回答道。

Shinji stayed silent and finished his lunch. Aria just lay down on the soft grass lazily enjoying the gentle breeze blowing.  
真嗣沉默不语，吃完了他的午餐。亚莉亚则慵懒地躺在柔软的草地上，享受着轻柔的微风。

"Back to what you can do Shinji… do you play an instrument?" she asked.  
“回到你能做的事情上，真嗣……你会演奏乐器吗？”她问道。

"Yes, I play the cello" he answered. "Why do you ask?"  
"是的，我会拉大提琴" 他回答道。"你为什么问这个？"

"Because I think music is good. Music brings joy and revitalises the soul. I think that music is the greatest achievement of human culture. I'd love to hear you play one day" she replied.  
"因为我觉得音乐很美好。音乐带来快乐，让心灵焕发活力。我认为音乐是人类文化最伟大的成就。我很想有一天能听到你演奏" 她回答说。"

The bell rang and the pair got up and began to walk back to the classroom. Aria held his hand as they walked back. They were getting plenty of attention from many of the students, but Shinji didn't have the heart to let go of her hand. They soon arrived at the classroom and they both went to their desks and sat down. As the rest of the class made their way to their desks, Shinji looked around for his friends. Touji was giving him the thumbs up, Kensuke was impassive and Asuka seemed a little annoyed.  
铃声响起，两人起身开始走回教室。Aria 握着他的手，他们走回去时吸引了不少学生的目光，但 Shinji 不忍心放开她的手。很快他们到达了教室，各自回到座位坐下。当其他同学也陆续回到座位时，Shinji 环顾四周寻找他的朋友们。Touji 向他竖起大拇指，Kensuke 面无表情，而 Asuka 似乎有点不高兴。

Hikari said her "Rise! Bow! Sit!" as the teacher entered the room and the class began again. It seemed to Shinji that everyone had their eyes on him and it was making him uncomfortable.  
光说她的“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”当老师走进教室，课程再次开始。似乎每个人都盯着真嗣，这让他感到不舒服。

Aria was certainly a great girl; Shinji couldn't deny he liked her cheerful attitude and she was beautiful. It also seemed that she was fond of him, which made it perfect. The boy looked once again at the new student, admiring her form and bright aura. He waited quietly, receiving no messages from anyone, for the class to end.  
亚里亚无疑是个很棒的女孩；真嗣无法否认自己喜欢她那开朗的态度，而且她很漂亮。似乎她也喜欢他，这再好不过了。男孩再次看向新同学，欣赏她的身姿和明亮的气质。他静静地等待着，没有收到任何人的消息，直到下课。

The man approached the apartment warily, he hadn't seen her for a while and she still thought he was dead. He quietly pondered how to deal with this and considered avoiding the confrontation. However, he knew he was needed and so he continued on and entered the apartment, taking the stairs to a particular door. His hand momentarily paused as he hesitated to press the doorbell. After strengthening his resolve, he pressed the doorbell and the chime rang out inside.  
男人小心翼翼地接近公寓，他已经有一段时间没见到她了，而她仍然以为他已经死了。他静静地思考如何应对这种情况，并考虑避免这场对峙。然而，他知道自己被需要，于是继续前进，进入公寓，走上楼梯，来到一扇特定的门前。他的手在按门铃前犹豫了一下。在坚定决心后，他按下了门铃，门铃声在屋内响起。

"I'm coming" a woman called out.  
"我来了" 一个女人喊道。

He heard the door unlock before the door was opened. Upon opening the door, the woman dropped her beer in shock. It spilt all over the floor and the two looked at each other for a moment.  
他听到门锁被打开的声音，随后门被推开。门一开，女人震惊之下手中的啤酒掉落，洒了一地。两人对视片刻。

"Hello Katsuragi" "你好，桂木"

---

Finally the bell rang, signalling the end of school. Shinji got up and exited the classroom. Asuka went after him and was about to drag him out of school when he was approached yet again by Aria. The boy just looked at her curiously.  
终于，铃声响起，标志着学校生活的结束。真嗣站起身，离开了教室。明日香紧随其后，正准备把他拽出学校时，艾丽娅再次走近了他。男孩好奇地看着她。

"Thanks for today Shinji, it was great! See you later" Aria said, moving towards him and kissing him on the cheek. She then embraced him warmly before moving away. The new girl then ran off down the corridor.  
“今天谢谢你，真嗣，很开心！再见” 艾丽娅说着，向他走去，在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。随后她热情地拥抱了他，然后转身离开。新来的女孩沿着走廊跑开了。

"What is up with that oak tree honestly? She's practically drooling all over you" Asuka remarked, irritated.  
“那棵橡树到底怎么回事？她简直对你垂涎三尺。” 明日香不悦地说道。

"She's a nice girl" Shinji replied as they started moving, "She's cute and she's got quite a bright personality"  
"她是个好女孩" 真嗣回答道，他们开始移动，"她很可爱，而且性格非常开朗"

"From my point of view, she seems to have taken an extreme liking to you for only having just met you. To me it seems she's just using you or something" the redhead advised.  
"在我看来，她似乎对你一见钟情。我觉得她可能只是在利用你或者别的什么" 红发女孩建议道。

"Asuka, are you showing concern for me?" Shinji asked.  
"明日香，你在关心我吗？" 真嗣问道。

"What? No! As if I care. You can do whatever you want, I was just making an observation" Asuka refuted.  
"什么？不！好像我在乎似的。你想干嘛就干嘛，我只是发表一下看法。" 明日香反驳道。

The two eva pilots exited the school building and began walking back to their apartment. As they walked towards their home, Asuka spoke up again. "Well, what did you and Miss Oak Tree do at lunch?"  
两位 EVA 驾驶员离开了教学楼，开始步行回他们的公寓。在走向家的路上，明日香再次开口。"那么，你和橡树小姐午餐时做了什么？"

"Just call her Aria, and we just talked. Why do you ask?" he inquired.  
"就叫她 Aria 吧，我们只是聊了聊天。你为什么问这个？" 他询问道。

"Just curious" she replied.  
"只是好奇而已" 她回答道。

"Never mind that, how was your first day at school since memory loss?" the boy prompted, wanting to know how she coped.  
"别管那个了，你失忆后第一天上学感觉怎么样？" 男孩追问，想知道她如何应对。

"It was fine. Hikari was just as I remember and school was pretty much the same. It wasn't hard at all acting like nothing had happened thankfully. Also, it felt good to have some girl talk after these past few days with just you" she answered, sticking her tongue out at him.  
"挺好的。光还是老样子，学校也几乎没变。幸运的是，装作什么都没发生并不难。而且，这几天只和你在一起，能和女生聊聊感觉真好" 她回答，朝他吐了吐舌头。

Shinji chuckled slightly. "That's good to hear Asuka. You'll also be glad to hear there will be no photo distribution, you are safe from any potential outbreak"  
真嗣轻声笑了一下。“听到你这么说真好，明日香。你也会高兴知道不会有照片流传出去，你安全了，不会有什么潜在的泄露。”

"Thank God, I would have murdered you for sure Ikari" she replied.  
“谢天谢地，不然我肯定会杀了你，碇”她回答道。

The pair soon arrived at their apartment and took the stairs to their door. Shinji was surprised to find that the door was not locked; he was sure he had locked it when he left. Did Misato leave and forget? Curiously, the boy opened the door and walked into the room with Asuka following suit. A strange noise was heard coming from the direction of the bedrooms.  
两人很快到达了他们的公寓，走楼梯到了门口。真嗣惊讶地发现门没有上锁；他确信自己离开时锁上了。是美里离开时忘记了吗？好奇之下，男孩打开门，走进房间，明日香紧随其后。从卧室的方向传来了一阵奇怪的声响。

"What in the world?" Asuka commented out loud, noticing the disarray inside. A few objects had been thrown about and were currently residing on the floor. As they neared the bedrooms, they discerned the noise was coming from Misato's bedroom.  
“这到底是怎么回事？”明日香大声评论道，注意到室内的混乱。一些物品被扔得到处都是，现在正躺在地板上。当他们靠近卧室时，他们听出噪音是从美里房间传来的。

"What is that noise?" Shinji asked as the noise got louder. He thought there was something familiar about it too.  
“那是什么声音？”真嗣问道，噪音变得更大了。他觉得这声音似乎有些熟悉。

The two eva pilots approached Misato's bedroom cautiously. Suddenly a scream was let out, obviously coming from Misato, and Shinji quickly barged through the door.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员小心翼翼地接近美里的卧室。突然间，一声尖叫传出，显然是美里的声音，真嗣迅速破门而入。

"Misato-" the young boy started.  
"美里——" 少年开口道。

However, both teens went slack-jawed as they witnessed their guardian playing the game mentioned this morning with Kaji. They quickly covered their eyes and exited the room, closing the door behind them. Asuka shuddered involuntarily.  
然而，两位少年看到他们的监护人正与加持玩着今早提到的游戏，都惊得目瞪口呆。他们迅速捂住眼睛，退出了房间，并关上了门。明日香不由自主地打了个寒颤。

"That was scary, I never want to see that in my life ever again" Asuka said aloud.  
"太吓人了，我这辈子再也不想看到那种场景了" 明日香大声说道。

"Agreed" Shinji concurred weakly.  
“同意。”真嗣无力地附和道。

"Well, she's definitely a screamer" Asuka commented cheekily.  
“嗯，她绝对是个尖叫女王。”明日香俏皮地评论道。

Shinji laughed. "Well so are you" he teased.  
真嗣笑了。“你也是啊。”他打趣道。

"And how would you know?" the redhead asked, smirking.  
"你怎么会知道？" 红发女孩挑眉问道。

"I mean you scream at me all the time, why would you stop while making love?" the boy joked.  
"我是说你总是对我大喊大叫，做爱时怎么会停下来？" 男孩打趣道。

"You baka" she said, shaking her head. "Well anyway, either we find a way to drown out this noise or we leave the apartment. They're gonna be at it for a while"  
"你这个笨蛋" 她摇头说道。"总之，我们要么想办法盖过这噪音，要么就离开公寓。他们一时半会儿是不会停的"

"I've got an idea, Aria reminded me of something today" Shinji began.  
"我有个主意，今天 Aria 提醒了我一件事" 真嗣开始说道。

"Oh?" she prompted. "哦？" 她催促道。

"Wait in the living room, I'll be there soon" he requested.  
"在客厅等我，我很快就到" 他请求道。

"Alright" she replied. "好吧" 她回答道。

Shinji went off to his room as Asuka went to the living room and sat down on the couch. The girl silently wondered what he was planning to do. She tried her best to shut out the incessant passionate noises, but it only seemed to amplify it. Fortunately, Shinji soon returned carrying his cello, causing her to raise her eyebrow slightly at him.  
真嗣回到自己的房间，而明日香则走向客厅，坐在沙发上。女孩默默地猜测着他打算做什么。她尽力屏蔽那些不绝于耳的激情声响，但似乎只是让它们更加放大。幸运的是，真嗣很快带着他的大提琴回来了，这让她的眉毛微微一挑。

"Aria asked me today if I could play an instrument, and music would definitely drown out Misato and Kaji" the boy suggested.  
"今天 Aria 问我是否会演奏乐器，音乐肯定能盖过美里和加持的声音" 男孩提议道。

"Go for it" the redhead agreed.  
"去吧" 红发女孩赞同道。

The male eva pilot sat down on the couch and began playing on his instrument. A soft melody rang throughout the apartment, drowning out the offending racket from Misato's bedroom. Soon, Asuka got mesmerised by the music and began to hum softly to the tune. The song was stopped abruptly and Asuka looked at Shinji questioningly.  
男性 eva 驾驶员坐在沙发上，开始弹奏他的乐器。一段柔和的旋律在公寓中响起，淹没了来自美里卧室的恼人噪音。很快，明日香被音乐迷住了，开始轻轻地跟着哼唱。歌曲突然中断了，明日香疑惑地看向真嗣。

"You weren't half bad Shinji, why did you stop?" the girl asked, confused.  
"你弹得不错啊，真嗣，为什么停下了？" 女孩困惑地问。

"My hand is killing me. I can't do anything for too long or it starts to hurt" Shinji answered, holding injured his hand.  
"我的手疼得要命。我不能做太久的事情，否则它就开始疼了" 真嗣回答道，握着他受伤的手。

"Such a wuss" she shot back, rolling her eyes. "But it was a good idea, I'll go get my violin"  
"真是个胆小鬼" 她回敬道，翻了个白眼。"不过这是个好主意，我去拿我的小提琴"


"_**You have wonderful hair Asuka, did I ever tell you that?" Shinji commented.**_  
"你的头发真漂亮，明日香，我有没有告诉过你？" 真嗣评论道。

_**The redhead turned to face the boy, surprised at the remark.  
红发女孩转过身面对男孩，对他的话感到惊讶。**_

"_**Umm I don't think so but thanks… I washed it this morning" she replied awkwardly.**_  
“呃，我觉得不是，不过还是谢谢了……我今早刚洗过。”她尴尬地回答。

_**Even after her reply, the male eva pilot kept his gaze on her, causing Asuka to wonder what he was doing.  
即便在她回复之后，那位男性 EVA 驾驶员依旧凝视着她，这让明日香不禁好奇他在做什么。**_

"_**Why are you looking at me? Have I got something on my face?" she inquired, a small smile forming on her face from the attention.**_  
“你为什么盯着我看？我脸上有什么东西吗？”她问道，因这份关注而在脸上绽开了一抹浅笑。

"_**Yeah" he answered.**_ “嗯”他答道。

"_**Oh, what is it?" she asked, reaching up to her face.**_  
"哦，怎么了？" 她问道，伸手摸向自己的脸。

"_**Your beautiful smile" he replied.**_  
"你美丽的笑容" 他回答道。

_**The girl found herself blushing. "Enough with that, you're making me blush. I don't know what's up with you this morning" Asuka said, shaking her head.  
女孩发现自己脸红了。“够了，你让我脸红了。我不知道你今早怎么了。”明日香摇着头说。**_

"_**I mean, I did have lots of fun with a gorgeous girl yesterday… I'm in a pretty good mood and I just want to show my appreciation for you" he explained, "But if that's not enough, I can also play you a song too" Shinji joked.**_  
“我是说，昨天和一位漂亮女孩玩得很开心……我现在心情很好，只想表达对你的感激。”他解释道，“但如果这还不够，我也可以给你弹首歌。”真嗣开玩笑说。

"_**You are such a moron, why would I want you to serenade me?" she retorted.**_  
“你真是个傻瓜，我为什么要你给我唱小夜曲？”她反驳道。

"_**Perhaps you'd prefer a duet instead? After all you play the violin, right?" Shinji suggested more seriously.**_  
"或许你更喜欢二重奏？毕竟你会拉小提琴，对吧？" 真嗣更认真地提议道。

"_**Now that's not a bad idea actually. You could even teach me how to play the cello" Asuka replied.**_  
"这主意其实不错。你甚至可以教我拉大提琴" 明日香回答道。

"_**It wouldn't be too hard I guess" the boy agreed.**_  
"我想应该不会太难" 男孩同意道。


As she returned from her flashback, she wondered when Shinji became so corny. The more she remembered, the more it seemed like they had been closer than just friends. The compliments and attention he had given her really seemed genuine. Certainly, she was beginning to understand more and more why he had been so sad after discovering that she had lost her memories. _'What did he mean by lots of "fun" with me? The way he said that just feels odd, like some hidden meaning… that is if the "gorgeous girl" he's referring to is me… I mean, it has to be given the context and mentioning his appreciation for me. Maybe I'm just reading too much into this… so far everyone else and my memories have corroborated much of what he's told me'_ the girl thought, feeling strangely flushed.  
从回忆中回过神来，她疑惑真嗣何时变得如此老套。她越回想，越觉得他们不仅仅是朋友。他对她的赞美和关注似乎真的很真诚。当然，她越来越明白为什么他在发现她失去记忆后会那么难过。“他说的和我有很多‘乐趣’是什么意思？他那样说感觉很奇怪，好像有什么隐含的意思……如果他说的‘漂亮女孩’是我……我是说，从上下文和他对我的欣赏来看，肯定是我。也许我只是想太多了……到目前为止，其他人和我的记忆都证实了他告诉我的大部分事情。”女孩想着，感到奇怪地脸红。

Asuka realised she had been silent and still for a while and quickly spoke up. "I just remembered you offering to play a duet with me and even teach me to play the cello"  
明日香意识到自己已经沉默静止了好一会儿，赶紧开口说道：“我刚想起来你曾提议和我一起演奏二重奏，甚至还说要教我拉大提琴。”

"That's right, we did have such a conversation! I feel a bit embarrassed though haha. I think I told you some cheesy lines and jokingly offered to play a song for you" Shinji replied, feeling self-conscious.  
“没错，我们确实有过那样的对话！不过我有点不好意思哈哈。我想我当时说了些俗套的话，还开玩笑说要为你演奏一首歌。”真嗣回答道，感到有些不自在。

"Yeah, that memory almost made me throw up" the redhead teased.  
“是啊，那段记忆差点让我吐了。”红发女孩打趣道。

"In any case, we won't be doing a duet today. I could still teach you cello though" Shinji suggested, wanting to move on from that conversation.  
"无论如何，今天我们不会一起演奏二重奏了。不过，我仍然可以教你大提琴。" 真嗣提议道，想要从那个话题中转移出来。

"Well, got nothing better to do" Asuka replied, returning to the couch and sitting next to the boy. She took the cello from Shinji, but had no idea what to do. "So err… how do I hold it?"  
"嗯，也没什么更好的事情可做。" 明日香回答，回到沙发旁坐在男孩旁边。她从真嗣手中接过大提琴，但完全不知道该怎么做。"那么，呃……我该怎么拿它？"

"In front of you" he answered.  
"在你面前" 他回答道。

"Like this?" she asked, placing it front of her.  
"像这样吗？" 她问道，将它放在自己面前。

"No closer" he directed. "再远一点" 他指示道。

She moved it closer. "This better?"  
她将它移近了一些。"这样好些吗？"

"Look, I'll just show you myself" he declared.  
"看，我亲自示范给你看" 他宣称道。

The boy moved under Asuka so that she was sitting on his lap. He held her waist for support as he grabbed the cello and positioned it in front of her.  
男孩移动到明日香下方，让她坐在他的腿上。他扶着她的腰以保持平衡，同时抓起大提琴并将其置于她面前。

"Don't get any perverted ideas" the girl warned.  
"别有什么奇怪的想法" 女孩警告说。

"I wouldn't do such a thing" he retorted, snickering slightly.  
"我不会做那种事的" 他反驳道，轻声嗤笑。

The redhead took the bow and placed it across the instrument, ready to play a note. "Is it just like playing the violin?" she asked, attempting a note only to hear an awful squeaking noise.  
红发女孩拿起弓，放在乐器上，准备演奏一个音符。"这和拉小提琴一样吗？" 她试着拉了一个音符，却只听到一声刺耳的吱吱声。

"Well, I presume not" Shinji replied with a chuckle. "Here I'll show you"  
"嗯，我想不是" 真嗣笑着回答。"我来示范给你看"

The boy held her wrist and moved the bow into the proper position. "You gotta play it from here and move it a little more fluidly. You probably would have made a note if you moved it properly" he explained.  
男孩握住她的手腕，将弓调整到正确的位置。“你得从这里开始，动作再流畅一些。要是动作对了，你大概就能拉出音符了。”他解释道。

"I did do it properly! Your cello just sucks" she rebuked.  
“我确实做得对！是你的大提琴太烂了。”她反驳道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes as she attempted to play a note again and was met with success. She tried a couple more times as she got used to playing the larger instrument.  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼，看着她再次尝试拉出一个音符，这次成功了。她又试了几次，逐渐习惯了演奏这个更大的乐器。

"Mmm this isn't that hard after all" Asuka commented.  
"嗯，其实也没那么难嘛。" 明日香评论道。

Now that the redhead was confident in being able to play the instrument, she then tested the pitch, getting accustomed to the much lower pitch of the cello compared to the violin. The girl began to work out where the notes were, with Shinji occasionally leaning forward to show her where a certain note was. In next to no time, she began playing a few simple melodies.  
现在，红发女孩对自己的演奏能力充满信心，她开始测试音高，逐渐适应了大提琴比小提琴低得多的音调。她开始摸索音符的位置，有时真嗣会向前倾身，指点她某个音符的位置。没过多久，她就开始演奏一些简单的旋律。

"You're a really fast learner, but then again you are accustomed to playing a string instrument because you play the violin" Shinji commented.  
"你学得真快，不过话说回来，你习惯了弦乐器，因为你拉小提琴。" 真嗣评论道。

"Or maybe I'm just so great" she replied, sticking her tongue out at him. "Well, it's sort of like playing a larger violin with the notes much lower"  
"或许我只是太棒了" 她回答道，朝他吐了吐舌头。"嗯，有点像用更低的音符演奏一把更大的小提琴"

The boy was enjoying having Asuka sitting on his lap, her red hair so close he could smell her scent. The girl's body was warm as he held her around the waist and her wrist was smooth and slender to the touch. In this moment, he wanted nothing more to start moving his hands all over her body and then do the same thing with his mouth. He placed his chin on her shoulder and she moved her head to face him; the redhead's mind was still full of playing the cello and didn't take much note of their current positioning.  
男孩很享受明日香坐在他腿上，她的红发近在咫尺，他能闻到她的香气。女孩的身体温暖，他环抱着她的腰，她的手腕触感光滑纤细。此刻，他只想开始用手抚摸她的全身，然后用嘴做同样的事。他把下巴搁在她的肩上，她转过头面对他；红发女孩的脑海里仍满是拉大提琴的画面，并没有太在意他们现在的姿势。

"It looks like they finally found the salami" the girl announced, noticing the lack of noise.  
"看来他们终于找到了那根萨拉米香肠" 女孩宣布道，注意到了噪音的消失。

Shinji sniggered and accidentally moved his hand down to rest on her thigh.  
真嗣窃笑起来，不小心把手移到了她的大腿上。

"What are you-?" Asuka started.  
“你在干什么——？”明日香开口道。

"Oh what's this? Shinji and Asuka have also decided to have some fun" Kaji joked as he entered the room.  
“哦，这是什么情况？真嗣和明日香也决定找点乐子了。”加持一边开玩笑一边走进房间。

Asuka's face went red as she elbowed Shinji in the face and ripped his hand off her thigh. She quickly moved the cello out of the way and jumped off Shinji's lap.  
明日香的脸一下子红了，她用胳膊肘顶了真嗣的脸，一把扯开他放在自己大腿上的手。她迅速把大提琴移开，从真嗣的腿上跳了下来。

"No! It's not what it looks like! Shinji is just a perverted baka" Asuka quickly explained to Kaji.  
“不！不是你想的那样！真嗣只是个变态白痴”明日香急忙向加持解释道。

"Asuka it was an accident" Shinji elaborated, nursing yet another wound to his face, "But I think I was successful in teaching you how to play the cello"  
“明日香，这是个意外”真嗣一边护理着脸上新添的伤口，一边解释道，“不过我觉得我成功教会了你拉大提琴。”

"Oh so Shinji was giving you lessons, how kind of him" Kaji replied, smiling his charismatic smile.  
"哦，原来真嗣在给你上课啊，他真好心" 加持回答道，露出了他那迷人的微笑。

Asuka instantly melted at his charm, grabbing him around his shoulder as she began her rant on how great she was. The young girl was also a little annoyed at how he and Misato were back together. Shinji grew a little jealous at how easily Kaji was able to get Asuka's affection, but he knew it was somewhat fake and besides Kaji was already taken by Misato. He was however curious at his appearance, but then again, he did say he would show himself soon. Misato walked into the room sweat dropping at Asuka's behaviour and subtly pried her off of the suffering man.  
明日香立刻被他的魅力所融化，一把搂住他的肩膀开始滔滔不绝地吹嘘自己有多棒。这位年轻女孩也对他和美里重新在一起感到有些不悦。真嗣对加持如此轻易赢得明日香的喜爱感到一丝嫉妒，但他知道这多少有些虚假，况且加持已经被美里占据了。不过，他对加持的出现感到好奇，但话说回来，加持确实说过他会很快露面的。美里走进房间，看到明日香的行为后汗颜，悄悄地将她从那位受苦的男人身上拉开。

"Misato has already given me her greeting, Asuka has just told me how she is and so how are you doing Shinji?" Kaji asked.  
"美里已经向我打过招呼了，明日香也刚告诉我她的情况，那么真嗣你最近怎么样？" 加持问道。

"I'm good thanks! Nothing really special happening right now. By any chance, were you the one listening in on us in the morning?" Shinji replied.  
"我很好，谢谢！现在没什么特别的事。对了，早上偷听我们谈话的是你吗？" 真嗣回答道。

"You got me there" the older man responded with a chuckle, "Old habits I guess, I am a spy after all. Misato almost caught me too"  
"你猜对了" 年长的男人笑着回应，"大概是老习惯吧，毕竟我是个间谍。美里差点就抓到我了"

"I would have if it wasn't for that stupid old man in the way!" Misato snapped.  
"要不是那个碍事的老头挡路，我早就逮到你了！" 美里气愤地说。

"Putting all that aside, Shinji I'd like to talk to you in private for a moment if you don't mind" Kaji requested.  
"抛开这些不谈，真嗣，如果你不介意的话，我想私下和你谈谈" 加持请求道。

"Sure" the young boy replied.  
"当然" 少年回答道。

"Waah, but I wanted to talk more" Asuka whined.  
"哇，但我还想多聊聊" 明日香抱怨道。

"Don't worry Asuka, this is just some guy talk, we'll be back soon" Kaji reassured.  
"别担心明日香，这只是男人间的谈话，我们很快就会回来" 加持安慰道。

At this, the older man led the male eva pilot away to his room. The spy closed the door and turned to face him. "Did you get my message?" he asked the boy.  
听到这话，年长的男人带着男性 EVA 驾驶员走向他的房间。间谍关上门，转身面对他。"你收到我的消息了吗？" 他问少年。

"Yep! I played the tape. How was your initial meeting with Misato?" Shinji asked.  
"收到了！我听了磁带。你和美里初次见面怎么样？" 真嗣问道。

"She started screaming and hitting me at first. But after she calmed down, I explained what had happened. She was really angry I had made her think I was dead, but I eventually made her come around" Kaji recounted. "But that's not so important right now. I'm curious as to how you and Asuka are doing, after all I know she lost her memory"  
"她一开始尖叫着打我。但等她冷静下来后，我解释了发生的事情。她真的很生气，我让她以为我死了，但最终我还是让她接受了事实。不过现在这并不重要。我很好奇你和明日香现在怎么样了，毕竟我知道她失去了记忆。"

"Ah yeah, Asuka and I are well… she is proving to be very difficult. Our relationship has slightly improved, but all in all she won't move any further past that. I'm struggling to progress, but I definitely think we're on good terms"  
"啊，是的，我和明日香都还好……她变得非常难以相处。我们的关系略有改善，但总体来说她不会再进一步了。我努力想有所进展，但我确实认为我们现在关系不错。"

"How close were you before she lost her memory?" Kaji asked.  
"在她失去记忆之前，你们关系有多亲密？" 加持问道。"

"As close as you and Misato just moments ago" the young boy answered.  
"就像你和美里刚才那样近" 少年回答道。

"I wasn't referring to physical closeness, but did you really make love with her? I would have thought that with how it started… she wouldn't want to do that for a while" Kaji replied.  
"我不是指身体上的接近，但你真的和她做爱了吗？我以为事情一开始那样……她不会想那么快就做那种事的" 加持回答道。

Shinji's face went downcast at Kaji's words. "Yes, we did. And to your earlier question, we were both in love"  
听到加持的话，真嗣的脸色变得阴沉。"是的，我们做了。至于你之前的问题，我们确实相爱"

"I'm also guessing you weren't able to use my ring?" the older man inquired.  
"我也猜你没能用上我的戒指吧？" 年长者问道。

"No, though I don't think I was ready for marriage yet anyway. And right now, I don't have even a remote chance" Shinji answered.  
"没有，不过我觉得自己当时也还没准备好结婚。而现在，我连一丝机会都没有。" 真嗣回答道。

"As you might have already guessed, I didn't come here just to see how you were doing. You see I know women, so I can help you out a bit with your relationship. Even _Asuka_ can be made to realise her feelings. Breaking through her defences is tough, making her admit feelings is even tougher as it requires forgoing her pride, which to Asuka is just about everything. All in all, she is likely to be one of the most difficult women to make fall in love" Kaji explained.  
"你可能已经猜到，我来这里不只是为了看看你过得怎么样。你知道，我了解女人，所以可以在你的感情问题上帮点忙。即便是明日香，也能让她意识到自己的感情。突破她的防线很难，让她承认感情更是难上加难，因为这需要她放下自尊，而自尊对明日香来说几乎就是一切。总的来说，她可能是让男人最难打动芳心的女人之一。" 加持解释道。

"I already know all this, but I had done it before. Though… what I did initially broke her will, therefore overpowering a bit of her dominant character allowing for greater suppression of her pride and thus a simpler forming of the relationship. Though I do not wish to ever do that to her again, I have also been completely unsuccessful in my attempts to get her to fall in love so far" the young boy described.  
"这些我早已知晓，但之前我确实尝试过。虽然……我最初的所作所为打破了她的意志，从而削弱了她强势的性格，使得她的骄傲更容易被压制，关系也因此更容易建立。不过，我再也不想那样对她了，而且到目前为止，我也没能成功让她爱上我。" 少年描述道。

"Just so you know, and I don't mean to be offensive, from what I've heard your previous relationship might not have lasted. It did not have a good foundation and Asuka's dominant character would most likely have fully resurfaced. It probably would have been more complicated in time, given the initial mess and your strong entanglements with each other" Kaji elaborated.  
"只是让你知道，我无意冒犯，据我所闻，你之前的恋情可能不会长久。它缺乏良好的基础，而明日香强势的性格很可能会完全恢复。随着时间的推移，考虑到最初的混乱和你们之间的紧密纠葛，情况可能会变得更加复杂。" 加持解释道。

"No offence taken, I definitely don't like how things started and I fully regret what I did. I guess we'll never know how things would have turned out, but I certainly don't want to make the same mistakes" Shinji concurred.  
"没有冒犯，我确实不喜欢事情的开端，也完全后悔我所做的。我想我们永远不会知道事情会如何发展，但我肯定不想重蹈覆辙。" 真嗣同意道。

"It takes a lot of courage to admit such mistakes and each one of us does things we're not proud of, not that it excuses us" Kaji began. "Moving on though, the first step in getting her back is to get her to like you. This requires you to get past her defences and show her that you are the guy she wants to be with. If Asuka has already warmed up to you, then this is a fair indication that she likes you and does not yet realise it. The obvious next step is to make her realise that she likes you. This is probably the most difficult part, as her pride will not allow her to admit such a thing… even to just herself. However, there are many methods to achieve this and for a case such as Asuka, we might have to use the more extreme ones" he said with a glint in his eye.  
"承认这样的错误需要很大的勇气，我们每个人都会做些自己不引以为傲的事，但这并不意味着可以被原谅。" 加持开始说道，"不过，要让她回到你身边，第一步是让她喜欢上你。这需要你突破她的防线，向她展示你是她想要在一起的那个人。如果明日香已经对你有所好感，那么这是一个很好的迹象，表明她喜欢你但尚未意识到。接下来的明显步骤是让她意识到她喜欢你。这可能是最困难的部分，因为她的骄傲不允许她承认这一点……甚至只是对自己承认。然而，有许多方法可以达到这个目的，对于明日香这样的情况，我们可能不得不采取更极端的手段。" 他眼中闪过一丝光芒。

"I'm open to all suggestions" Shinji replied.  
"我愿意听取所有建议。" 真嗣回答道。

"Then listen carefully…" Kaji started.  
"那么请仔细听……" 加持开始说道。

Misato and Asuka were waiting in the living room while the two boys were having a conversation. The redhead was quite curious about what they could possibly be discussing.  
美里和明日香在客厅里等待，而两个男孩正在进行对话。红发女孩对他们的讨论内容颇为好奇。

"What do you think they are talking about?" Asuka asked Misato.  
“你觉得他们在谈什么呢？”明日香问美里。

"Kaji hasn't seen Shinji in a while, I guess he just wants to catch up and have some guy talk like he said" Misato answered.  
“真嗣好久没见加持了，我想他只是想叙叙旧，像他说的那样聊聊男人的话题吧。”美里回答道。

"Well, what about you? I thought you despised Kaji and yet I walk in on you screwing each other" the redhead remarked.  
“那么你呢？我以为你讨厌加持，结果却发现你们在厮混。”红发女孩评论道。

"Love is always a complicated thing Asuka, it brings pain and happiness at the same time. It can make you do things you'd never think you'd ever do" the older woman replied.  
“爱情总是复杂的，明日香，它同时带来痛苦和快乐。它能让你做出你从未想过会做的事。”年长的女人回答。

At Misato's response, the young girl just stayed silent, quietly brooding. Did anyone truly love her? Did she love anyone else? _'All I need is myself, what do I need something as stupid as love for?'_ she thought. Though she was not fully convinced, a part of her remembered what it was to be loved.  
听到美里的话，少女只是沉默，静静地沉思。真的有人爱她吗？她又爱过谁吗？‘我只需要我自己，要这种愚蠢的爱情做什么？’她想。尽管不完全信服，但内心的一部分回忆起了被爱的感觉。

The door to Shinji's room opened and Asuka turned her head to see the two boys exiting the room. Shinji seemed a lot happier as he exited the room with Kaji.  
真嗣的房门打开了，明日香转头看到两个男孩从房间里走出来。真嗣和加持一起出来时，看起来开心多了。

"Thank you very much Kaji, I really appreciate it" Shinji thanked.  
“非常感谢你，加持先生，我真的很感激。”真嗣道谢道。

"No problem, you kids deserve a chance at life after all" Kaji replied.  
“别客气，你们这些孩子毕竟也该有机会享受生活。”加持回答道。

The two males walked over to the living room, gracing the two females with their presence once again. Misato stood up and went over to Kaji, kissing him on the lips. The older couple couldn't resist moving their hands about, causing the two eva pilots to look away from the public display.  
两位男士走进客厅，再次以他们的存在取悦了两位女士。美里站起身走向加持，吻了他的唇。这对年长的情侣忍不住动手动脚，让两位 EVA 驾驶员不得不移开视线，避开这公开的亲密举动。

"Let's not trouble these kids anymore Katsuragi. You can come to my place, I have beer too" Kaji suggested.  
“我们别再打扰这些孩子了，葛城。你可以来我那儿，我也有啤酒。”加持提议道。

"Great idea, alright goodnight Asuka, Shinji. You guys take care of yourselves" Misato said, waving to her two wards.  
“好主意，好吧，晚安，明日香，真嗣。你们要照顾好自己。”美里说着，向她的两个孩子挥手道别。

"Goodbye Misato" Shinji replied.  
"再见，美里" 真嗣回答道。

With that, the two adults left their residence, closing and locking the door behind them. Silence filled the dwelling as the two eva pilots looked at each other for a moment. Asuka felt that Kaji was quite different to how she last remembered; he definitely showed her much less attention, not to mention as soon as he finished talking with Shinji he just left. The redhead wasn't happy about how this afternoon had transpired.  
说完，两位成年人离开了他们的住所，关上门并上了锁。屋内陷入了寂静，两位 EVA 驾驶员相互对视了一会儿。明日香觉得加持与她记忆中的样子大相径庭；他显然对她不再那么关注，更别提他和真嗣谈完后立刻就离开了。红发少女对今天下午发生的一切感到不满。

"What were you doing placing your hand on me you pervert?" she asked irately, venting some of her frustration.  
"你刚才把手放在我身上干什么，变态？" 她生气地质问道，发泄了一些怒气。

"I told you Asuka, I did it accidentally" he answered. "Are you still bothered over it?"  
"我告诉过你，明日香，我是无意中做的" 他回答道。"你还为此烦恼吗？"

"I'm gonna go watch some television" Asuka replied, ignoring his excuse.  
"我要去看会儿电视" 明日香回答，对他的借口置之不理。"

The girl sat down on the couch and switched on the TV with the remote and began watching some soap opera. Sighing, Shinji went to the laundry to distribute the clean clothes throughout the house. After depositing everyone's clothes to their correct rooms, he returned to the kitchen.  
女孩坐在沙发上，用遥控器打开了电视，开始看一部肥皂剧。叹了口气，真嗣去洗衣房把干净的衣服分发到各个房间。把每个人的衣服放到正确的房间后，他回到了厨房。

Shinji noticed it was getting late and decided to make some supper for the both of them. He noticed that Asuka's mood had fallen and he suspected it was due to Kaji. The boy knew there really wasn't anything he could do to cheer her up at the moment and just hoped a good night's sleep would help. It didn't take long to finish making supper and he set it down on the table. Shinji went over to the living room to fetch Asuka.  
真嗣注意到天色已晚，决定为他们俩做些晚饭。他察觉到明日香的情绪低落，猜测这可能与加持有关。男孩知道此刻没有什么能让她开心起来，只希望一夜好眠能有所帮助。没花多少时间就做好了晚饭，他将食物摆上桌。真嗣走到客厅去叫明日香。

"Stop it Richard" a woman in the soap opera protested.  
“住手，理查德。”肥皂剧中的一个女人抗议道。

"What's wrong Anna?" the man named Richard replied.  
“怎么了，安娜？”名叫理查德的男人回应道。

"You know we can't do this! I don't love you, so just stop it already" Anna objected.  
"你知道我们不能这样做！我不爱你，所以就到此为止吧" 安娜反对道。

"Enough Anna! Do I have to die for you to realise your feelings for me?" Richard refuted.  
"够了，安娜！难道我非得死了你才能明白你对我的感情吗？" 理查德反驳道。

"Please Richard!" Anna continued stubbornly.  
"求你了，理查德！" 安娜固执地继续说。

"Oh bloody hell you stupid cow! Can't you see that guy is more decent than 90 percent of the males on this planet? You already love him, so just admit it and go with him already" Asuka commented, growing irritated at the television program.  
"哦，该死的，你这蠢牛！难道你看不出那家伙比这个星球上 90%的男性都要体面吗？你已经爱上他了，就承认吧，跟他走就是了" 明日香评论道，对电视节目越来越不耐烦。

The boy couldn't help smiling at the irony of Asuka saying that. The redhead switched off the television as she noticed Shinji.  
男孩不禁对明日香说这话的讽刺意味笑了。红发女孩注意到真嗣后，关掉了电视。

"So which bracket do I fall under?" he asked her jokingly.  
"那我属于哪一类呢？" 他开玩笑地问她。

"Definitely in the 90 percent, but like it matters; that guy was fictional. It's near impossible to find a guy like that" the girl answered.  
“绝对在 90%的范围内，但就像这有什么关系似的；那家伙是虚构的。找到那样的人几乎是不可能的。”女孩回答道。

"Then why say 90 percent?" Shinji asked curiously.  
“那为什么说是 90%呢？”真嗣好奇地问。

"Well, there are guys like Kaji after all" Asuka remarked.  
“嗯，毕竟还是有像加持那样的家伙存在。”明日香评论道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes; her idol worship of him was just plain annoying. The boy clenched his fist. _'Relax… it's just a childish crush, she'll get over it'_ he thought.  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼；她对他的偶像崇拜简直让人烦透了。男孩紧握拳头。'放松点……这只是小孩子的迷恋，她会过去的' 他心想。

"You know Kaji is already taken by Misato" Shinji pointed out.  
“你知道加持已经被美里抢走了” 真嗣指出。

"Don't lecture me third child! Misato just has bigger breasts" the redhead retorted.  
“别教训我，第三适格者！美里只是胸更大” 红发女孩反驳道。

"If Kaji was so perfect, that wouldn't be the only thing that mattered to him. Besides, it's not like your breasts aren't big enough or you're not attractive enough. Can't you see that even though you don't think so, you are still a child? He still sees you as a child; Misato is a full-grown woman" Shinji countered.  
"如果加治那么完美，那对他来说就不止是唯一重要的事了。再说了，你的胸部也不小，你也很迷人。难道你看不出来吗？即使你自己不这么认为，你依然是个孩子。他还是把你当孩子看；美里可是个成熟的女人" 真嗣反驳道。

"Look here Ikari, we were not children anymore the moment we became eva pilots. We could die at any time and so we have matured faster than other children at this age. You don't know anything!" Asuka rebuked.  
"听着，碇，自从我们成为 EVA 驾驶员的那一刻起，我们就不再是孩子了。我们随时都可能死去，所以我们比同龄的其他孩子成熟得更快。你什么都不懂！" 明日香反驳道。

"Fine, go to Kaji! He won't take you into a relationship like that, he won't love you, he won't give you most of his attention, but I guess you're ok with that" Shinji snapped nastily.  
"好吧，去找加治吧！他不会那样和你建立关系的，他不会爱你，他不会把大部分注意力放在你身上，但我想你对此也无所谓" 真嗣恶狠狠地说道。

The redhead slapped him on the face, however Shinji didn't even flinch. "I'm sick of all this crap Shinji, you should mind your own business" the girl spat angrily.  
红发女孩一巴掌扇在他脸上，然而真嗣连眼都没眨一下。“我已经受够了这些破事，真嗣，你还是管好你自己的事吧。”女孩愤怒地啐道。

Shinji just sighed; he knew he shouldn't give in to jealousy. "Alright Asuka, I went too far. Supper's ready"  
真嗣只是叹了口气；他知道不该被嫉妒冲昏头脑。“好吧，明日香，我做得过分了。晚饭已经准备好了。”

With that, the two eva pilots sat down at the dining table, eating their late-night meal. Shinji looked at Asuka warily; sometimes the situation just seemed so hopeless, many times he thought that perhaps he should just give up on her. It's not like she was the only girl in the world… maybe in time he would be able to fall in love again with someone else. Having finished her meal, Asuka got up and left the table without a word, leaving Shinji alone. He heard the door close and he began to sob quietly, the toll of everything weighing down on him.  
说完，两位 EVA 驾驶员坐到了餐桌前，开始享用他们的深夜餐食。真嗣小心翼翼地看着明日香；有时候情况似乎真的无望，他多次想过也许应该放弃她。毕竟她不是世界上唯一的女孩……也许随着时间的推移，他能够再次爱上别人。明日香吃完饭后一言不发地起身离开，留下真嗣独自一人。他听到门关上的声音，开始默默啜泣，一切的压力都压在了他身上。

Asuka had gone to Shinji's room as she left the table. At school today she had to borrow a lot of equipment from Hikari, because she had lost her stationery in the explosion. After entering Shinji's room, she went searching through his drawers and found enough supplies. However, she came across an object that sparked her curiosity; it was a ring. She picked it up and examined it; it had a beautiful red stone and on the inside it had an inscription that read _**Semper Amemus**_. _'Isn't that what Shinji asked me to translate? Why has he got such a ring? Did somebody give this to him?'_ Then she smiled evilly as an idea formed in her head. _'Well that baka deserves this, being so bloody annoying'_ she thought. With that, the redhead placed the ring in her pocket and silently laughed at the panic on his would be face as he frantically searched for the ring.  
明日香在离开餐桌后去了真嗣的房间。今天在学校，她不得不向光借了很多文具，因为她的文具在爆炸中丢失了。进入真嗣的房间后，她在抽屉里翻找，找到了足够的用品。然而，她发现了一个引起她好奇心的物品；那是一枚戒指。她拿起它仔细端详；戒指上有一颗美丽的红宝石，内侧刻着“Semper Amemus”的字样。‘这不是真嗣让我翻译的那句话吗？他为什么会有这样的戒指？是有人送给他的吗？’随后，她邪恶地笑了，一个念头在她脑海中形成。‘哼，那个笨蛋活该，这么烦人’她想。于是，红发女孩将戒指放入口袋，暗自窃笑他焦急寻找戒指时可能露出的惊慌表情。

Asuka quietly snuck out of Shinji's room and went to her own, making sure that he hadn't noticed her enter his room. She closed her door quietly and went to lie down on her bed to go to sleep.  
明日香悄悄地溜出真嗣的房间，回到自己的房间，确保他没有注意到她进入他的房间。她轻轻关上门，躺到床上准备睡觉。

Shinji had finally finished his supper and placed his dish in the sink. He got up and left the table to go to his room. After entering his room, he just went straight to his bed. The troubled boy found his solace as he drifted off to sleep…  
真嗣终于吃完了晚饭，将餐盘放在水槽里。他起身离开餐桌，走向自己的房间。一进房间，他就直接躺到了床上。这个烦恼的男孩在沉睡中找到了慰藉……

End notes: Now this chapter was damn hard to write initially. I had planned the photo's use since I had made Misato take it way back when, however actually writing down my idea on paper ended up being quite difficult. I originally rewrote Shinji's explanation like five times, trying to make it sound plausible and in character. Perhaps my rewrite this time around sounded better too? Back when I first wrote this chapter, there were so many issues in writing this chapter. My time to write was reduced in the past as my brother had finished school and was using the computer. Additionally, our landlady had increased the rent by about $200 per week and we couldn't afford to stay, forcing us to move. Not much else to say here other than the rewrite brought this chapter to about 14000 words (originally around 11000).  
尾注：这一章最初写起来真是难上加难。我从一开始就计划好了照片的用途，当时让美里拍下它，但真正把我的想法写在纸上却相当困难。我原本重写了真嗣的解释大约五次，试图让它听起来合理且符合角色性格。或许这次重写听起来更好了？当我第一次写这一章时，写作过程中存在许多问题。过去我写作的时间减少了，因为我的哥哥完成了学业并开始使用电脑。此外，我们的房东将每周的租金提高了约 200 美元，我们负担不起，被迫搬家。除了这些，重写这一章使得字数达到了约 14000 字（原先是大约 11000 字）。

Author's Notes: The original notes here just answered some questions from reviewers a while ago. Most of those questions are already long answered, so no real need to keep those notes anymore.  
作者的话：之前的笔记只是回答了一段时间前评论者的一些问题。大多数问题早已有了答案，所以那些笔记已经没有保留的必要了。

The previous notes also mentioned coming across a short eva fanfic called 'Snow Dance.' Original Notes I wrote on that fanfic:  
之前的笔记还提到了一篇名为《雪之舞》的短篇 EVA 同人小说。我关于那篇小说的原始笔记：

_If anyone has had the displeasure of coming across this fic and reading it, you'll know what I mean when I say it is so unexpected and awful. I really hated this fic, but I couldn't help laughing at the reviews. There is one thing that it made me think about though, and that's how people are always expecting a certain ending and it was kind of funny and disturbing to see it end that way. If you don't know what I mean go and read it, it's about 600 words. But in the end that writer should be shot :P. Phew now that I've calmed down, on with the chapter. I hope you enjoy it. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year :D.  
如果有谁不幸读过这篇小说，就会明白我所说的出乎意料且糟糕透顶是什么意思。我真的很讨厌这篇小说，但评论区的反应让我忍不住笑出声。不过，它确实让我思考了一件事，那就是人们总是期待某种结局，而看到那样的结局既有趣又令人不安。如果你不明白我在说什么，可以去读一读，大约 600 字。但最终，那位作者应该被“枪毙”:P。呼，现在我平静下来了，继续本章。希望你喜欢。圣诞快乐，新年快乐:D。_

I hope you've enjoyed the story so far, not much else to say!  
希望到目前为止，您已经享受了这个故事，没有太多其他要说的了！

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 15 (First rewrite, slight modifications and additions but quite similar to the original version).  
说明一下，这是重写的第 15 章（首次重写，略有修改和增加，但与原版相当接近）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 15: I Like Shinji  
第 15 章：我喜欢真嗣

_"I don't appreciate you cheating third child and so blatantly too" Asuka said with her arms crossed.  
"我不喜欢你作弊，三儿，还这么明目张胆。" 明日香双臂交叉说道。_

_"As if I was cheating" he shot back, pretending to sound offended.  
"好像我在作弊似的。" 他回击道，假装听起来很受伤。_

_"Oh really? How stupid do you think I am?" she replied, pointing to her panties around her ankles. "These didn't just magically slip off now did they?"  
"哦，真的吗？你以为我有多傻？" 她回答道，指着缠绕在脚踝上的内裤。"这些可不是自己神奇地滑下来的，对吧？"_

_"Aww come on Asuka, it's just a game" Shinji said, sticking his tongue out at her.  
“哎呀，别这样嘛，明日香，这只是个游戏。” 真嗣说着，向她吐了吐舌头。_

_"One that didn't count nor was it recorded, you have no proof you won" she refuted, sticking her tongue out in return. "Though I'll admit you played much better than previously, you still can't beat me"  
“那场不算数，也没记录下来，你没有证据证明你赢了。” 她反驳道，同样吐了吐舌头。“不过我承认你比以前玩得好多了，但你还是赢不了我。”_

_Grinning cheekily, the boy pushed the girl up against the wall. He ever so irritatingly brushed his knee against her exposed private region, making her squirm a little.  
男孩调皮地咧嘴一笑，把女孩推到墙边。他故意用膝盖蹭了蹭她暴露的私密部位，让她微微扭动了一下。_

_"I can still beat you in this" Shinji whispered into her ear. He then kissed her hard on the lips, slipping his tongue inside her mouth and using his free hands to roam about her body. "How long haven't we had sex?" he asked, parting.  
"我还能在这方面赢你" 真嗣在她耳边低语。随后他用力吻上她的唇，舌头滑入她的口中，空着的手在她身上游走。"我们多久没做了？" 他分开时问道。_

_"Don't tell me you actually forgot" she replied aspiratingly, "We only_ _**screwed each other's brains out**_ _two days ago"_  
"别告诉我你真的忘了" 她喘息着回答，"我们两天前才疯狂地做了个够"

_"Feels like years" the boy remarked.  
"感觉像过了好几年" 男孩说道。_

_At his comment, Shinji slowly pulled off Asuka's shirt, allowing it to fall to the floor. He held her shoulders while he moved his mouth down to trail kisses along her neck. The boy teasingly licked the hollows in her neck while slowly moving his hand behind her back. Shinji unhooked the girl's bra, pulling it off and throwing it to the other side of the room. The girl followed suit, stepping out of her panties and kicking them off. The boy looked down admiringly at her soft firm breasts before moving further down and kissing her in the valley between her two orbs. Asuka moaned softly and ran her hand affectionately through his thick brown hair. She used her other hand to gradually take off his shirt…  
听到他的话，真嗣缓缓地脱下明日香的上衣，任其滑落在地。他扶着她的肩膀，嘴唇沿着她的脖颈一路轻吻。男孩调皮地舔舐着她颈间的凹陷，同时慢慢将手移到她的背后。真嗣解开了女孩的胸罩，脱下后扔到房间的另一边。女孩也配合地脱掉内裤，一脚踢开。男孩低头欣赏着她柔软而结实的胸部，然后继续向下，在她两团丰盈之间的谷地轻吻。明日香轻声呻吟，温柔地用手抚过他浓密的棕色头发。她用另一只手逐渐脱下他的衬衫……_

"WAKE UP SHINJI!" “醒醒，真嗣！”

Shinji jumped a mile high from the shock, hitting his head on the ceiling. Apart from being annoyed that he had been interrupted from such a nice dream, the boy felt slightly off and a little tired. He found the cause of his waking up as he noticed the graceful profile of his roommate Asuka. She was glaring at him quite menacingly and looked just about ready to explode. Shinji quickly sat up, wondering what the hell warranted a wakeup call from the redhead and this early too.  
真嗣被吓得跳了起来，头撞到了天花板。除了因为被打断了一个美好的梦而感到恼火外，男孩还觉得有些不对劲，有点疲惫。当他注意到室友明日香优雅的侧脸时，他找到了自己醒来的原因。她正恶狠狠地瞪着他，看起来几乎要爆发了。真嗣迅速坐起身，不知道红发女孩这么早叫醒他到底是为了什么。

"What is it Asuka?" he asked sleepily.  
“怎么了，明日香？”他睡眼惺忪地问道。

"How hard did you hit your head you Dummkopf? Haven't you noticed the time? It's almost time for school and you haven't made lunches or even breakfast for me yet!" she shouted.  
“你脑袋被撞傻了吗，笨蛋？你没注意到时间吗？快到上学时间了，你还没给我准备午餐甚至早餐呢！”她大声喊道。

Her shrill voice seemed to hurt his head as she shouted; he really wasn't in the mood to deal with this today.  
她尖锐的声音似乎刺痛了他的头，当她大喊时；他今天真的没心情处理这件事。

"I just woke up Asuka. You should have woken me up earlier, though I have no clue why I slept in. Anyway Asuka… I won't be able to do both things in time, so please, just PLEASE make breakfast while I do the lunches. I'm begging you to do this alright, I really don't want to fight about it" Shinji pleaded.  
“我刚醒来，明日香。你应该早点叫醒我的，虽然我不明白为什么睡过头了。总之，明日香……我没法同时做两件事，所以请，就请你在做午餐的时候顺便做早餐。我恳求你这么做，好吗，我真的不想为此争吵” 真嗣恳求道。

Asuka seemed to take in his plea and looked at him thoughtfully. "Are you alright? Should I get Misato?"  
明日香似乎接受了他的请求，若有所思地看着他。“你还好吗？需要我叫美里来吗？”

"NO! No please… she's gonna cook breakfast if you tell her, so please just do it. I won't live another day if she makes breakfast, remember when I told you about the time she burnt the cereal" he replied, painfully recalling his upset stomach.  
“不！不要，求你了……如果你告诉她，她会做早餐的，所以请别这么做。如果她做早餐，我活不过今天了，还记得我跟你说她把麦片烧焦的那次吗？”他回答道，痛苦地回想起那次胃痛的经历。

The redhead chuckled softly. "I had to admit I was impressed she could be that bad. But she went to Kaji's house last night you retard, I was kidding"  
红发人轻声笑了笑。“我得承认，她能糟糕到那个程度让我印象深刻。但她昨晚去了卡吉家，你个傻瓜，我开玩笑的。”

He blushed at having forgotten. "Will you do it?" he queried.  
他因为忘记而脸红。“你会这么做吗？”他问道。

Asuka returned her thoughts to the previous dilemma, wondering if she should show him mercy. Finally, she sighed and threw her hair. "Alright fine you lazy baka, I'll make breakfast"  
明日香将思绪拉回到之前的难题，犹豫是否该对他施以仁慈。最终，她叹了口气，甩了甩头发。"好吧，你这个懒惰的笨蛋，我来给你做早餐。"

"Thank you Asuka" he expressed gratefully.  
"谢谢你，明日香" 他感激地表达道。

The redhead just mumbled something incoherently as she walked out of the room, closing the door. Shinji quickly stood up and wished he hadn't as his head spun wildly, causing him to fall back onto the bed. He placed a hand on his head as he tried to steady the world around him. The boy couldn't afford to make Asuka angry and so he forced himself up and out of the bed. He walked unsteadily to the door, his nausea improving slightly. His injured hand cramped slightly but it had gone as quickly as it came. Shinji opened the door and proceeded to walk to the kitchen.  
红发女孩只是含糊地咕哝了些什么，便走出了房间，关上了门。真嗣迅速起身，却后悔了，因为他的头剧烈地旋转，使他跌回床上。他用手扶着头，试图稳定周围的世界。这男孩可不能惹明日香生气，于是他强迫自己起床，走出房间。他摇摇晃晃地走向门口，恶心感略有缓解。受伤的手抽搐了一下，但很快又消失了。真嗣打开门，继续走向厨房。

The male eva pilot noticed Asuka was in the kitchen already, an apron tied around her. She was cooking up some meal for them to eat for breakfast; it was an unusual sight for her. The redhead seemed to dance around the kitchen as she prepared the meal and Shinji almost got lost in a trance just watching her. He quickly snapped out of it, as he needed to make both their lunches and fast. The boy begun making their usual bento boxes and was surprised to hear the girl begin whistling.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员注意到明日香已经在厨房里，腰间系着围裙。她在为他们准备早餐，这一幕对她来说颇为罕见。红发的她似乎在厨房里翩翩起舞，准备着餐食，真嗣几乎看得入了迷。他很快回过神来，因为他需要迅速为他们俩准备午餐。男孩开始制作他们平常的便当盒，惊讶地听到女孩开始吹口哨。

Despite Shinji's condition, he was still able to finish the lunches faster than Asuka could complete their breakfast. He set the lunches down on the table and returned to the kitchen to help Asuka. As he approached her, his view spun wildly again and he quickly leaned on her for support.  
尽管真嗣身体状况不佳，他仍能比明日香更快完成午餐的准备。他将午餐放在桌上，回到厨房帮助明日香。当他走近她时，视线再次剧烈旋转，他迅速靠在她身上寻求支撑。

"Get off me third child, I haven't finished yet" she let out, slightly annoyed.  
“别靠着我，第三适格者，我还没做完呢。”她略显不悦地喊道。

"My head's spinning" he explained, holding her around the waist and supporting his head on her shoulder.  
"我的头好晕" 他解释道，双手环抱着她的腰，头靠在她的肩上。

"I can't finish this lugging around a brain-dead loser" the redhead snapped.  
"我可不想拖着一个脑死亡的废物到处走" 红发女孩厉声说道。

"Asuka, thank you for doing this for me" he said quietly.  
"明日香，谢谢你为我做这些" 他轻声说道。

"I want to eat breakfast and I don't want to be late. I'm doing this for myself you baka. Now get off of me already" she replied.  
"我想吃早餐，也不想迟到。我这么做是为了我自己，你这个笨蛋。现在快从我身上下来" 她回答道。

Feeling better, Shinji removed himself from the beautiful redhead and stood up straight. He gently placed a soft kiss on Asuka's cheek before going to the dining table to sit down. Asuka froze, momentarily surprised, but continued finishing breakfast as if nothing had happened. She was soon done and set the two meals on the table. At once the girl began shoveling the food into her mouth, grateful to finally have food. Shinji ate his meal slowly; he really didn't feel like eating that much. The redhead had soon finished and looked at the boy with a curious glance.  
感觉好些了，真嗣从美丽的红发女孩身上移开，站直了身子。他温柔地在明日香的脸颊上轻吻了一下，然后走向餐桌坐下。明日香愣了一下，有些惊讶，但继续若无其事地完成早餐。她很快准备好了两人的餐点，并摆放在桌上。女孩立刻开始狼吞虎咽地吃起食物，终于有食物可吃让她感到欣慰。真嗣则慢慢地吃着，他其实并不太饿。红发女孩很快吃完，好奇地看着男孩。

"I'll eat it if you don't want it" she offered.  
"如果你不想要，我会吃掉的" 她提议道。

"Yeah… I don't have much of an appetite this morning, you can have it" he replied, pushing his plate in front of her.  
“嗯……我今天早上没什么胃口，你可以吃掉。”他回答道，把盘子推到她面前。

Eagerly, Asuka began wolfing down Shinji's meal as well. The boy decided to go back to his room to change into his school uniform. He still felt a little unwell while he was changing, but it seemed to be getting better. After dressing up he took his bag, which felt a little heavier than usual, and returned to the dining room. He noticed that Asuka had already finished his portion and was packing her bag. The boy took his lunch and placed it in his bag. The girl looked up at Shinji's arrival and scowled at him.  
阿斯卡急切地开始狼吞虎咽地吃着真嗣的早餐。男孩决定回房间换上校服。换衣服时他仍感觉有些不适，但似乎正在好转。穿好衣服后，他拿起书包，感觉比平时重了些，然后回到餐厅。他注意到阿斯卡已经吃完了他的那份，正在收拾自己的书包。男孩把自己的午餐放进书包里。女孩抬头看到真嗣回来，对他皱起了眉头。

"I swear what's wrong with you this morning?" she asked irritated, noticing him placing his lunch in his cello case.  
“我发誓，你今天早上到底怎么了？”她不悦地问道，注意到他把午餐放进了大提琴盒里。

Shinji looked down and blushed, embarrassed at his actions. He had mistaken his cello case for his bag and he looked downright silly placing his lunch in it. Asuka just walked over to him and smacked him over the head before grabbing his cello case and walking off to his room. She soon returned with his backpack in hand and threw it at him.  
真嗣低下头，脸颊泛红，为自己的行为感到尴尬。他误把自己的大提琴盒当成了书包，把午餐放进去的样子看起来真是滑稽。明日香只是走过来，在他头上拍了一下，然后抓起他的大提琴盒走向他的房间。不久，她拿着他的背包回来，扔给了他。

"Don't make this a common occurrence, I can't be here to baka-sit you all the time" she teased, punching him lightly.  
“别让这种事成为常态，我可不能一直在这儿傻乎乎地照顾你。”她打趣道，轻轻地捶了他一下。

Shinji wrapped his arms around the redhead, embracing her tenderly; her body felt soft and warm. Asuka just sighed and rolled her eyes.  
真嗣用双臂环抱住红发女孩，温柔地拥抱着她；她的身体柔软而温暖。明日香只是叹了口气，翻了个白眼。

"Look third child, glad you want to show gratitude, but we are going to be late for school" she said, prying his arms off her.  
"听好了，小老三，很高兴你想表达感激，但我们上学要迟到了。" 她说着，挣脱了他的拥抱。

"I just feel strange today Asuka" he replied.  
"我只是今天感觉有点奇怪，明日香。" 他回答道。

"You _are_ strange third child. Now come on!" she urged, grabbing his hand.  
"你一直都是个怪人，小老三。快点走吧！" 她催促着，抓住了他的手。

"Asuka! Other hand please" Shinji gasped.  
“明日香！另一只手给我” 真嗣喘息着。

She smirked slightly as she took his other hand and pulled him down the stairs. His world spun as Asuka moved amazingly fast, almost making him trip down the stairs. Shinji had a slight relief as he breathed in some fresh air when they exited their building. However, this was short lived as Asuka once again started her inhuman sprint pulling the poor boy along. Shinji struggled desperately to keep the contents of his stomach intact.  
她微微一笑，抓住他的另一只手，拉着他下楼梯。随着明日香惊人的速度移动，真嗣的世界旋转起来，差点让他跌下楼梯。当他们走出大楼时，真嗣稍微松了口气，呼吸到了一些新鲜空气。然而，这种轻松感转瞬即逝，明日香再次开始了她非人的冲刺，拖着可怜的男孩一起。真嗣拼命挣扎，努力不让胃里的东西翻涌出来。

The traffic was heavy this morning, but Asuka could not afford to waste time standing at the crossings and ran on through. Many stopped to stare in wonder as a redheaded girl weaved and dodged her way through the morning traffic, pulling a helpless boy along with her. She jumped onto several cars to speed up her progress, earning a few shouts; some of which made the boy blush heavily. The redhead simply ignored their remarks and continued on.  
今天早上的交通很繁忙，但明日香不能浪费时间在十字路口等待，于是她径直穿了过去。许多人停下来，惊讶地看着一个红发女孩在早高峰的车流中穿梭闪避，拖着一个无助的男孩。她跳上几辆汽车以加快进度，引来了一些喊叫声；其中一些让男孩脸红不已。红发女孩只是无视了他们的评论，继续前进。

As the two eva pilots crisscrossed their way through the network of side-streets and footpaths, they finally arrived at their destination. The school building towered over them as it blocked out the sun, providing them with a little shade as they ran past the front gates. The school courtyard was empty, meaning the students were already inside. Asuka roared and leapt up over the stairs, not unlike Unit 02 during the battle on "Over the Rainbow."  
两位 EVA 驾驶员穿梭于小巷和人行道之间，终于抵达了目的地。学校大楼高耸在他们面前，遮住了阳光，为他们跑过前门时提供了一片阴凉。校园里空无一人，意味着学生们已经进入了教室。明日香咆哮着，一跃而起，跨过楼梯，那动作与“跨越彩虹”战役中的二号机如出一辙。

_'It's not that big a deal if we're late, what is she so fussed about?'_ Shinji thought. He desperately wanted Asuka to slow down or at least to let him go. The boy felt relieved as they were nearing their classroom, however someone moved into their pathway causing Asuka to collide with the obstacle. Thankfully, Asuka had received the brunt of the impact and Shinji was able to stand up quickly to help the others.  
'我们迟到也没什么大不了的，她干嘛这么紧张？' 真嗣心想。他迫切希望明日香能慢下来，或者至少让他先走。当他们接近教室时，真嗣感到一阵轻松，然而有人突然出现在他们的路径上，导致明日香撞上了障碍物。幸运的是，明日香承受了大部分冲击，真嗣迅速站起身来帮助其他人。

He pulled up the redhead. "You ok Asu-… Aria?" he asked.  
他扶起了红发女孩。“你还好吗，明日香……还是说，是亚里亚？”他问道。

The small girl giggled as Shinji helped her stand, though Shinji noticed she didn't seem too affected by the impact. "I'm ok Shinji, you should go help Asuka" Aria suggested.  
小女孩咯咯笑着，在真嗣的帮助下站了起来，尽管真嗣注意到她似乎并未受到撞击的影响。“我没事，真嗣，你应该去帮明日香。”阿莉亚建议道。

The boy immediately turned around and moved towards the other redhead. Asuka was clutching her head in pain, but she had noticed the exchange. Though she wouldn't admit it, she didn't like that Shinji went to help the other girl first. Of course poor Shinji had gotten confused between the two redheads. The boy held out his hand for Asuka to help herself up but it was slapped away.  
男孩立刻转身向另一位红发女孩走去。明日香正痛苦地抱着头，但她注意到了刚才的交换。虽然她不会承认，但她不喜欢真嗣先去帮另一个女孩。当然，可怜的真嗣在两位红发女孩之间感到困惑。男孩伸出手想帮明日香站起来，却被她一巴掌拍开。

"I'm fine, I can take care of myself" Asuka snapped angrily.  
“我没事，我自己能行。”明日香生气地厉声说道。

The female eva pilot got up and steadied herself, glaring menacingly at Aria. "Listen here you try-hard redhead, what in the world were you doing moving in our way?"  
女式 EVA 驾驶员站起身来，稳住自己，恶狠狠地瞪着 Aria。“听着，你这个爱出风头的红发女，你到底在搞什么鬼，挡我们的路？”

"Sorry, I was running late today because I got lost. When I finally found myself here, you collided into me. I'm really sorry though, I didn't mean it. In the end you're all right, which means there's no problem and thankfully cute little Shinji was here to help" Aria answered.  
“对不起，我今天迟到了，因为我迷路了。当我终于找到这里时，你就撞上了我。不过我真的不是故意的，最后你也没事，那就没问题了，幸好可爱的真嗣在这里帮忙。”Aria 回答道。

"Would you stop idolising that baka?" Asuka shot back, annoyed.  
“你能别再崇拜那个笨蛋了吗？”明日香不悦地回击道。

"I'm not idolising him, I'm telling the truth" Aria refuted, hugging Shinji softly.  
"我不是在崇拜他，我只是在陈述事实。" 绫波反驳道，轻轻地拥抱了真嗣。

"Pfft whatever" Asuka huffed, moving past her.  
"哼，随你怎么说。" 明日香哼了一声，从她身边走过。

"Hey Asuka, no need to get angry at her, she didn't mean to collide with us" Shinji said, going after Asuka.  
"嘿，明日香，没必要对她生气，她不是故意撞到我们的。" 真嗣说着，追上了明日香。

"Stop defending her already. When it comes to being annoying, she's worse than Wondergirl!" Asuka responded with frustration.  
“别再为她辩护了。说到烦人，她比奇迹少女还糟糕！”明日香带着沮丧回应道。

"Shinji it's alright for her to be angry at me, you don't need to defend me" Aria remarked as she came up to them.  
“真嗣，她对我生气没关系，你不必为我辩护。”亚莉亚走近他们时说道。

"You stay out of this!" Asuka shouted at Aria. As she turned, she accidentally tripped pulling Shinji along with her. Aria had tried to hold Shinji to prevent him from falling, but ended up falling with him and Asuka. They hit the door of the classroom opening it with a crash as Asuka landed on the floor first on her back, with Shinji coming soon after with the back of his head landing on Asuka's chest, followed shortly by Aria who landed in such a way that she was straddling Shinji's waist, facing him.  
“你别掺和进来！”明日香对亚莉亚喊道。她转身时不小心绊倒了，还把真嗣一起拉了下来。亚莉亚试图抓住真嗣防止他摔倒，结果自己也跟着摔了下去。他们撞开了教室的门，发出一声巨响，明日香先背部着地，紧接着真嗣后脑勺落在明日香的胸口，随后亚莉亚也摔了下来，正好骑坐在真嗣的腰上，面对着他。

The entire class had seen the event that transpired. "Ikari you dog! Doing two girls at a time, isn't that a bit much?" Touji shouted.  
全班同学都目睹了那一幕。“碇，你这狗东西！一次泡两个妹子，是不是有点过分了？”东治大喊道。

The entire class erupted into laughter as all three teens on the floor blushed, suddenly self-conscious of their position.  
全班顿时哄堂大笑，地板上的三个少年少女脸红了起来，突然对自己的姿势感到尴尬。

"Get off me you hentai!" Asuka shouted, trying to push Shinji off but only managing to shove his face into Aria's breasts.  
“从我身上滚开，你这个变态！”明日香喊道，试图推开真嗣，却只是把他推得一头扎进了绫波的胸口。

The class laughed even harder. Aria blushed and instantly stood up to allow Shinji to get up, but this abrupt movement caused his face to now be positioned in front of her nether region.  
全班笑得更厉害了。Aria 脸一红，立刻站起来让 Shinji 起身，但这一突然的动作导致他的脸现在正对着她的下体。

"Ikari! Don't take advantage of her, you pervert!" Asuka snapped, slapping Shinji. Momentarily dazed, Shinji fell back onto Asuka, his head between her breasts again.  
“碇！别占她便宜，你这个变态！”Asuka 厉声喝道，一巴掌打在 Shinji 脸上。Shinji 一时晕头转向，向后倒去，头又撞进了 Asuka 的胸间。

At that moment, the teacher walked in with a strange expression on his face. "I leave the class for a few minutes and return to hear such a racket. Would you mind explaining what is going on?"  
就在这时，老师带着奇怪的表情走了进来。“我离开教室几分钟，回来就听到这么大的动静。你们介意解释一下发生了什么吗？”

By now Aria had moved off of Shinji and he quickly got off Asuka, allowing her to stand up. Both eva pilots looked at the teacher in silence, unable to think of what to say.  
此时，Aria 已经从真嗣身上移开，他迅速离开明日香，让她站起来。两位 EVA 驾驶员默默地看着老师，想不出该说什么。

"It was my fault" “那是我的错”

They all turned to the other redhead.  
他们都转向了另一位红发女孩。

"What do you mean Miss Swung-Oak?" the teacher asked.  
“斯旺橡小姐，你是什么意思？”老师问道。

"I was coming late because I got lost and these two came to get me. However, upon arriving to the classroom I accidentally tripped and made them fall over" Aria explained.  
“我迟到是因为迷路了，这两位同学来接我。然而，当我到达教室时，不小心绊倒了，结果把他们也带倒了。”艾丽娅解释道。

The teacher thought about it; she was a new student and she was looking at him pleadingly. He sighed and let it slide this time.  
老师思考了一下；她是个新生，正恳求地看着他。他叹了口气，这次就放过了。

"Alright, since she is a new student I'll let it go this time. But be sure you don't disrupt my class again eva pilots" the teacher warned.  
“好吧，既然她是新生，这次我就放过。但你们这些 EVA 驾驶员可别再扰乱我的课堂了。”老师警告道。

Both Shinji and Asuka nodded before going to their seats. Aria moved to her desk, but not before blowing a kiss to Shinji. After sitting down, she smiled at him. Asuka considered throwing her bag at the other girl to wipe that stupid goofy smile off her face, however, she didn't want to annoy the teacher again and so resisted the almost unbearable urge. The only thing really stopping her was the fact that Aria had saved her ass from punishment. Asuka knew how much the teacher was always itching to get an eva pilot in trouble; they probably would have gotten a detention if it weren't for Aria.  
碇真嗣和惣流都点了点头，然后回到自己的座位上。Aria 走向她的课桌，临走前还不忘向真嗣抛了个飞吻。坐下后，她对他笑了笑。惣流差点忍不住要把书包扔向那个女孩，好擦掉她脸上那愚蠢的傻笑，但她不想再次惹恼老师，于是强忍住了这几乎无法抗拒的冲动。唯一真正阻止她的，是 Aria 救了她一命，让她免于受罚。惣流知道老师一直渴望抓到 EVA 驾驶员的把柄；如果不是 Aria，他们可能已经被罚留堂了。

Sighing, Asuka turned her attention to the object of her extreme irritation; Shinji. The boy was blushing at the flirts being sent to him from biggest slut number two, second of course to Misato. _'Is he really buying that girl? Honestly, I didn't think he was that thick'_ she thought venomously, _'Wasn't he supposed to like_ _**me**__?'_  
叹了口气，惣流将注意力转向她极度恼火的目标——真嗣。那个男孩正因来自第二大荡妇的挑逗而脸红，当然，第一大荡妇非美里莫属。“他真的相信那女孩吗？老实说，我没想到他这么迟钝。”她恶毒地想，“他不是应该喜欢我吗？”

"_Don't you think it's your fault? You're not giving him any chance, so of course he'll move on"_ her inner voice reasoned.  
"你不觉得这是你的错吗？你一点机会都不给他，他当然会向前看" 她内心的声音辩解道。

'_Shut up, he can do whatever he wants with that bimbo. If he can switch girls so easily, obviously not worth me anyway, not that he ever was'_ she thought back.  
'闭嘴，他爱怎么和那个花瓶玩就怎么玩。如果他能这么轻易换女孩，显然不值得我留恋，反正他从来也没真正值得过' 她反驳道。

At this point, a message icon appeared on Asuka's screen and she opened it curiously.  
此时，屏幕上出现了一个消息图标，明日香好奇地打开了它。

_**Hikari: That new girl has taken quite an interest in Shinji. Let's invite her to lunch, I wanna talk to her.  
光：那个新来的女孩对真嗣很感兴趣。我们邀请她一起吃午饭吧，我想和她聊聊。**_

Asuka was about to refuse this absurd idea when she realised she hadn't really communicated with the other girl yet. She was also a little curious about Aria's background and what her motives were. The female eva pilot decided to give Aria this one chance and typed a message back.  
明日香本想拒绝这个荒谬的提议，但她意识到自己还没有真正与那个女孩交流过。她对艾丽娅的背景和动机也有些好奇。这位女性 eva 驾驶员决定给艾丽娅一个机会，并回复了一条消息。

_**Asuka: Alright, you invite her to our usual lunch spot, we'll give her a nice interrogation at lunch.  
明日香：好吧，你邀请她到我们常去的午饭地点，我们午餐时好好盘问她一番。**_

_**Hikari: Asuka! 光：明日香！**_

Asuka rolled her eyes. 明日香翻了个白眼。

_**Asuka: I was kidding Hikari, loosen up already.  
明日香：我开玩笑的，光，放松点嘛。**_

_**Hikari: Ok then, I'll message her now.  
光：那好吧，我现在就给她发消息。**_

Yet again finding herself bored during class, Asuka began tapping her fingers impatiently on her desk. Another message icon appeared on her screen; with absolutely nothing better to do, she checked it.  
又一次在课堂上感到无聊，明日香不耐烦地用手指敲打着桌面。屏幕上又出现了一个消息图标；实在无事可做，她便查看了消息。

_**Hikari: She's accepted my invitation, she'll come with us when lunch starts.  
光：她接受了我的邀请，午饭时会和我们一起。**_

_**Asuka: Ok. 明日香：好吧。**_

Shinji was still nursing his poor cheek; he had almost passed out from the slap too. Furthermore, his injured hand was starting to hurt again for some reason. He felt he hadn't done anything to deserve the slap either, he just happened to be a victim of circumstance. _'Damn Asuka, she knows I'm not feeling well and she_ _**knows**_ _it was an accident. I mean_ _**she**_ _shoved my face into her breasts, not that it was entirely a bad thing, but still why am_ _**I**_ _called the pervert?'_ He looked over to Aria again, to see her give him the "v" sign and he wondered why the girl gave him so much attention.  
真嗣还在揉着他那可怜的脸颊；那一巴掌几乎让他晕过去。此外，他受伤的手不知为何又开始疼了。他觉得自己并没有做什么该挨巴掌的事，只是碰巧成了环境的牺牲品。'该死的明日香，她知道我不舒服，也知道那是意外。我是说，她把我的脸推到她胸前，虽然那并不完全是坏事，但为什么我被称为变态？'他又看向 Aria，看到她对他比了个"V"字手势，他不禁疑惑为什么这女孩如此关注他。

The boy soon returned his view to his computer screen to see that he had been sent a message. He opened up the message, wondering who sent it.  
男孩很快将视线转回电脑屏幕，发现有人给他发了条消息。他打开消息，好奇是谁发的。

_**Touji: Yo Shinji, why were you actually late this morning?  
冬二：哟，真嗣，你今天早上怎么真的迟到了？**_

Shinji stretched lazily before typing a reply.  
真嗣懒洋洋地伸了个懒腰，然后开始打字回复。

_**Shinji: I just slept in is all, Asuka was really angry with me for it too. As for Aria, she really was running late because she got lost. We just happened to bump into her on the way.  
真嗣：我就是睡过头了，明日香为此对我很生气。至于亚里沙，她确实是因为迷路才迟到的。我们只是在路上碰巧遇到了她。**_

_**Touji: You know I think it's clear that Aria likes you, she got you out of trouble and she's cute. Just ask her out already.  
冬二：你知道吗，很明显亚里亚喜欢你，她帮你摆脱了麻烦，而且她很可爱。干脆直接约她出去吧。**_

_**Shinji: But I already told you I barely know her. I don't even understand why she likes me.  
真嗣：但我已经告诉过你，我几乎不认识她。我甚至不明白她为什么喜欢我。**_

_**Touji: Who cares why she likes you! Just get to know her by dating her.  
冬二：谁在乎她为什么喜欢你！通过约会来了解她就好了。**_

Shinji paused to think about it, maybe he should do as Touji suggested. It wasn't that bad an idea; she was a nice girl and it was pretty obvious she showed some interest in him. Maybe she was exactly what he needed.  
真嗣停下来思考了一下，也许他应该按照冬二建议的去做。这并不是个坏主意；她是个好女孩，而且很明显她对他有些兴趣。也许她正是他所需要的。

_**Shinji: Alright Touji, I will attempt to ask her out. I dunno a good time though…  
真嗣：好吧，冬二，我会试着约她出去。不过我不知道什么时候合适……**_

_**Touji: Go ask her at lunchtime. Try to get her alone, but don't back down if you can't. Good luck my brother!  
冬二：午饭时间去问她吧。尽量单独找她，但如果不行也别退缩。祝你好运，兄弟！**_

_**Shinji: Lol thanks. 真嗣：哈哈，谢谢。**_

Shinji returned his attention to the teacher, but he could not keep his concentration for more than a minute or so. _'I swear this old windbag must have taken a university degree on how to make a lesson as unexciting as possible. Doesn't he realise he says the same thing every time?'_ he thought. Bored once again, he found himself shifting his gaze to Asuka. The German girl was looking around the room with a languid expression on her face. Clearly, she shared the same feelings about the lesson as he did - and perhaps the whole class as well. The redhead caught his gaze and he quickly turned away. Shortly, a message arrived at his computer and he opened it.  
真嗣将注意力转回老师身上，但他最多只能集中注意力一分钟。'我发誓这个老顽固一定在大学里学过如何把课上得尽可能无聊。他难道没意识到每次都在重复同样的内容吗？'他想。再次感到无聊，他的目光不由自主地转向了明日香。这位德国女孩正带着慵懒的表情环顾教室。显然，她和他的感受一样——也许全班都是如此。红发的她捕捉到了他的目光，他迅速移开了视线。不久，他的电脑收到一条消息，他打开了它。

_**Asuka: Had enough of Miss Oak Tree already? I swear you were focusing on her so hard it looked like you were HOPING she would flash you.  
明日香：已经受够橡树小姐了吗？我发誓你盯着她看的样子，简直像是在期待她给你露一手。**_

_**Shinji: She's not an unattractive girl Asuka and I was just looking around the room.  
真嗣：她不是个没有魅力的女孩，我和明日香只是在房间里随便看看。**_

_**Asuka: Yeah right, I know you can't keep your eyes off me.  
明日香：是啊，我知道你眼睛离不开我。**_

Shinji rolled his eyes. 真嗣翻了个白眼。

_**Shinji: What does it matter? Are you getting envious of Aria because I'm paying more attention to her?  
真嗣：这有什么关系？你是不是因为我在她身上花更多心思而嫉妒亚里亚？**_

_**Asuka: I would so slap you through the computer right now you stupid baka. Why the hell would I care about YOUR attention?  
明日香：我现在真想隔着屏幕给你一巴掌，你这个笨蛋。我为什么要关心你的注意力？**_

_**Shinji: Ok fine, I will completely ignore you for the rest of the day.  
真嗣：好吧，那我今天剩下的时间就完全不理你了。**_

_**Asuka: As if you could.  
明日香：好像你能似的。**_

Shinji didn't type a reply and instead shifted his attention to Rei, who was at school today. She wasn't staring out the window as usual; rather, she seemed to be listening to the teacher's lecture as if every lesson she had always been ignoring him. Her actions were typically enigmatic and it was always hard to tell how she would react. The first child was still very quiet, but had opened up more; she had talked to Touji about a topic completely unrelated to eva and also told a joke, even though it was pretty lame. Without his father using her as a tool anymore, he supposed a great restraint was lifted off of her.  
真嗣没有回复，而是将注意力转向了今天来学校的绫波。她没有像往常一样望向窗外，反而似乎在认真听老师的讲课，仿佛她一直都在忽视他。她的行为总是那么神秘莫测，很难预测她会有什么反应。第一个孩子依然很安静，但已经变得更加开朗；她和东治聊了一个与 EVA 完全无关的话题，甚至还讲了个笑话，虽然挺冷。没有了父亲把她当作工具，他猜想她身上的重担已经大大减轻了。

The blue-haired girl momentarily turned her gaze away from the teacher and noticed Shinji looking at her. She paused for a second before returning her attention back to the teacher. _'Yep, I honestly can't tell what's going on in her head.'_ Shinji looked up at the clock, noticing that lunchtime was about to start. _'5…4…3…2…1…'_  
蓝发女孩短暂地从老师身上移开视线，注意到真嗣在看她。她停顿了一下，然后又将注意力转回老师身上。'是啊，我真的猜不透她在想什么。'真嗣抬头看向时钟，注意到午饭时间即将开始。'5…4…3…2…1…'

The bell rang and a loud noise was heard as every student in the room let out a sigh of relief at the same time. Asuka got up and moved over to Aria, before grabbing her arm and pulling her along.  
铃声响起，房间里的每个学生同时松了一口气，发出一阵喧闹。明日香站起身，走向亚里亚，抓住她的手臂拉着她一起走。

"Come on Miss Swung-Oak, we are going to have a nice lunch together" Asuka declared sarcastically.  
“来吧，斯旺橡小姐，我们要一起享用美味的午餐。”明日香带着讽刺的口吻宣布。

"I can't wait" Aria replied gleefully, completely missing Asuka's sarcasm.  
“我等不及了。”亚里亚欢快地回答，完全没有察觉到明日香的讽刺。

_'She's denser than Shinji I swear'_ Asuka thought.  
“她比真嗣还迟钝，我发誓。”明日香心想。

Hikari came over to them, joining the group. The three of them exited the classroom and walked off to their usual lunch spot outside. Shinji on the other hand had gone with Touji and Kensuke.  
光走了过来，加入了他们。三人一起离开了教室，走向他们常去的外面午餐地点。而真嗣则和东治、健介一起走了。

"Why do you think the girls went off with Aria?" Kensuke asked.  
“你觉得为什么女生们会和 Aria 一起走？”健介问道。

"Who knows?" Shinji replied, shrugging.  
“谁知道呢？”真嗣回答，耸了耸肩。

"Speaking of which, Shinji is going to ask Aria out today" Touji announced.  
“说到这个，真嗣今天要约阿里亚出去”托吉宣布道。

Kensuke looked at Shinji surprised; he thought Shinji liked Asuka. The bespectacled boy couldn't really say anything though, he had promised to keep it a secret.  
健介惊讶地看着真嗣；他以为真嗣喜欢明日香。不过戴眼镜的男孩什么也没说，他答应过要保守秘密。

"So soon Shinji? You barely know her" Kensuke retorted.  
"这么快就去找真希？你对她还不太了解呢。" 剑介反驳道。

"It doesn't matter, she might be the one for me. It doesn't hurt to try and she seems to be interested in me" Shinji remarked.  
"没关系，她可能是我的真命天女。尝试一下又不会有什么损失，而且她似乎对我也有兴趣。" 真嗣回答道。

"Yeah but…" Kensuke started, trying to mouth "Asuka" to Shinji without Touji noticing but was unsuccessful and just left it alone.  
"是啊，但是……" 剑介开口道，试图在不引起东治注意的情况下向真嗣暗示"明日香"，但未能成功，只好作罢。

"Why are you so against this Kensuke? Do you want her for yourself or something?" Touji interjected.  
"你为什么这么反对呢， Kensuke？难道你想自己独占她吗？" 东治插话道。

Kensuke blushed but said nothing.  
健介脸红了，但什么也没说。

"Anyway Shin-man I support you, you can go do it right now even" Touji encouraged.  
"总之，真嗣，我支持你，你现在就可以去试试" 东治鼓励道。

"Nah, not right now Touji. I wanna eat my lunch first" Shinji replied.  
"不，现在不行，阿薰。我想先吃午饭。" 真嗣回答道。

"Fair enough. Can I ask one favour though?" Touji started. "After you ask her out, come back here and tell us. I want to know if she accepts or not and I want to tell Hikari something, which I'll do after you finish"  
"好吧。不过我能提个请求吗？" 阿薰开始说。"你向她表白后，回来告诉我们结果。我想知道她是否接受，而且我有些话要告诉光，等你结束后我会去说的。"

"Alright" Shinji agreed. "好的" 真嗣同意了。

The trio sat down under the shade of a tree and began to eat their lunches.  
三人组坐在树荫下，开始享用他们的午餐。

---

Meanwhile, the three girls had arrived at their lunch spot.  
与此同时，三个女孩也到达了她们的午餐地点。

"Alright Aria, this is where we usually eat our lunch" Hikari explained.  
“好了，Aria，我们通常就在这里吃午餐。”Hikari 解释道。

"I like it" Aria replied.  
"我喜欢这个" 艾丽娅回答道。

The three girls sat down and took out their lunch. The second redhead looked at Asuka's bento, noticing that it looked very similar to Shinji's meal yesterday.  
三个女孩坐下来，拿出了她们的午餐。第二个红发女孩看着明日香的便当，注意到它看起来和昨天真嗣的午餐非常相似。

"Who made your lunch Asuka?" the transfer student asked.  
"明日香，你的午餐是谁做的？" 转学生问道。

"Shinji, why?" the second child answered.  
"真嗣，为什么？" 第二适格者回答道。

"Shinji makes you lunches? Does he like you or something?" Aria questioned.  
"真嗣给你做午餐？他是不是喜欢你之类的？" 亚里沙问道。

Asuka blushed slightly before responding. "I can't speak for him on whether he likes me or not! But he only makes my lunches because we live together is all"  
明日香微微脸红，然后回应道："我无法替他回答是否喜欢我！但他只是因为和我住在一起才给我做午餐的。"

"You live together? Shinji said he didn't have a girlfriend…" Aria continued.  
"你们住在一起吗？真嗣说他没有女朋友……" 亚里亚继续说道。

"I am NOT his girlfriend" Asuka shouted, her face turning red; not just from anger.  
"我才不是他的女朋友" 明日香大喊道，她的脸变得通红；不仅仅是出于愤怒。

"But then…?" Aria asked, confused.  
"但那又是为什么呢？" 亚里亚困惑地问道。

"We are both eva pilots, it's just convenient that we live in the same residence" the eva pilot answered.  
"我们都是 EVA 驾驶员，只是碰巧住在同一个宿舍而已" EVA 驾驶员回答道。

"I see" the new student remarked.  
"原来如此" 新同学说道。

"Look Aria we want to know more about you" Hikari interjected, trying to steer the conversation in a different direction. At this, Asuka began to start eating her lunch.  
"听着，Aria，我们想更多地了解你" Hikari 插话道，试图将对话引向另一个方向。听到这里，Asuka 开始吃她的午餐。

"You want to know about me?" Aria asked, surprised.  
"你想了解我吗？" 艾丽娅惊讶地问道。

"Yep" Hikari replied, smiling.  
"是的" 光笑着回答。

"Well you already know I'm from America, what else do you want to know?" Aria continued.  
"好吧，你已经知道我来自美国，还想知道些什么呢？" 艾丽娅继续说道。

"How old are you?" Hikari asked.  
"你多大了？" 光问道。

"I'm fourteen" Aria answered.  
"我十四岁" 艾丽娅回答。

"What do you like?" Hikari continued.  
"你喜欢什么？" 光继续问道。

"I like Shinji!" the exuberant girl exclaimed.  
"我喜欢真嗣！" 那个充满活力的女孩大声说道。

The eva pilot coughed and choked on the food she was eating. Hikari just laughed. "I said what, not who"  
那个 EVA 驾驶员被食物呛到，咳嗽起来。光只是笑了笑。"我说的是'什么'，不是'谁'"

"Oh sorry, I get confused with Japanese sometimes" Aria explained.  
"哦，抱歉，有时候我会对日语感到困惑" 艾丽娅解释道。

"It's alright, I think we all knew you liked Shinji anyway" Hikari reassured.  
"没事的，我想我们都知道你喜欢真嗣。" 光子安慰道。

"What do you even see in that baka?" Asuka asked suddenly.  
"你到底看上那个笨蛋哪一点了？" 明日香突然问道。

"You gotta admit he's cute. He's really nice and polite! Plus, he must be strong and brave if he's an eva pilot" Aria explained.  
"你得承认他很可爱。他真的很善良有礼貌！而且，如果他是 EVA 驾驶员，那他一定既强壮又勇敢。" 亚里亚解释道。

"His kindness and politeness are fake" Asuka retorted, "He uses it so that people will like him or at least not hate him! And he fluctuates between being strong and weak and being brave and cowardly so much I can't tell anymore"  
"他的善良和礼貌都是假的" 明日香反驳道，"他利用这些来让别人喜欢他，或者至少不讨厌他！而且他一会儿坚强一会儿软弱，一会儿勇敢一会儿胆小，我都分不清了"

"Look everyone has their faults, but the whole point of liking someone is to see past the bad aspects of the person and focus on the good aspects" Aria countered. "It's about accepting him for who he is. No one in this world is perfect, so why expect him to be?"  
"每个人都有缺点，但喜欢一个人的重点是看透这个人的不好之处，专注于他的优点" 艾丽娅反驳说。"这是接受他本来的样子。这个世界上没有人是完美的，为什么要期望他是呢？"

"Alright fine, but I still don't see how you can see his good points, especially considering that you haven't known him for long either" Asuka refuted.  
"好吧，就算这样，我还是不明白你怎么能看到他的优点，尤其是考虑到你也不久前才认识他" 明日香反驳道。

"I understand your concern, but-" Aria started.  
"我理解你的担忧，但是——" 亚莉亚开口道。

"CONCERN? Look honest to God if you like Shinji, I really don't care. I just wanted to know why you liked him" the eva pilot shot back.  
"担忧？老实说，如果你喜欢真嗣，我真的不在乎。我只是想知道你为什么喜欢他" 这位 EVA 驾驶员反驳道。

Hikari giggled, while Aria looked at the other redhead with a look of shock.  
光莉咯咯笑了起来，而亚莉亚则震惊地看着另一位红发女孩。

"Let's finish our lunch girls" Hikari said, still giggling a little.  
“我们吃完午饭吧，姑娘们。”光说，仍然轻轻地笑着。

The three girls went back to eating their food. After a few minutes of silence, none other than Shinji himself arrived at the girl's lunch spot. All three of them looked up at him questioningly.  
三个女孩继续吃着她们的食物。几分钟后，一片沉默中，真嗣本人来到了女孩们的午餐地点。她们三个都疑惑地抬头看着他。

"Hi girls, sorry to interrupt your lunch" Shinji greeted, before turning to face Aria. "I'd like to speak to you Aria" he requested, his voice shaking a little.  
“嗨，女孩们，抱歉打扰你们吃午饭。”真嗣打招呼，然后转向阿莉亚，“我想和你谈谈，阿莉亚。”他请求道，声音微微颤抖。

"Sure" the American girl replied happily.  
“当然。”美国女孩愉快地回答。

"In private?" he added. “私下里？”他补充道。

"Whatever concerns an eva pilot, concerns me" Asuka rebuked, wanting to hear what he was going to say to the girl.  
“凡是关系到 EVA 驾驶员的事，都与我有关。”明日香反驳道，她想知道他对女孩要说什么。

Shinji didn't even look at Asuka or register he had heard. Instead, he summoned up his courage. "Look Aria, you see the thing is I… I…like you and maybe we could err… go out and see a movie sometime or something"  
真嗣甚至没有看明日香一眼，也没有表现出他听到了什么。相反，他鼓起勇气说：“阿莉亚，你看，事情是这样的，我……我……喜欢你，也许我们可以……呃……找个时间出去看场电影什么的。”

Asuka felt her chest tighten upon hearing those words.  
明日香听到这些话，感到胸口一阵紧缩。

At once, Aria's face lit up. "Are you asking me out Shinji Ikari?" she clarified.  
阿莉亚的脸立刻亮了起来。“你是要约我出去吗，碇真嗣？”她确认道。

He hesitated momentarily, before replying. "Yes"  
他犹豫了片刻，然后回答道：“是的”

The transfer student flung her arms around the boy and kissed him softly on the lips. "I accept, nothing would make me happier"  
转学生张开双臂抱住男孩，轻轻地吻了他的唇。“我接受，没有什么比这更让我高兴的了”

Asuka couldn't understand why seeing Aria kiss him pissed her off. "Who would have thought you would go after easy girls Shinji?" she said viciously.  
明日香不明白为什么看到亚里沙吻他让她如此恼火。“谁会想到你会追求容易得手的女孩呢，真嗣？”她恶狠狠地说道。

Once again, Shinji made no response to indicate he had heard the female eva pilot. Though inside he was boiling with rage and not just because she had insulted Aria. He turned to face his girlfriend and managed to smile at her. "You know the reason I like you Aria?" he asked.  
"又一次，真嗣没有做出任何回应来表明他听到了那位女性 EVA 驾驶员的话。尽管内心愤怒沸腾，不仅仅是因为她侮辱了亚里亚。他转过身面对他的女朋友，勉强对她笑了笑。“你知道我喜欢你的原因吗，亚里亚？”他问道。”

"I'd love to know" Aria replied.  
“我很想知道。”亚里亚回答道。

"Because you are honest with your feelings and you're not afraid to give someone a chance" Shinji answered.  
“因为你对自己的感情坦诚，并且不怕给某人一个机会。”真嗣回答道。

"Are you implying something Ikari?!" Asuka spat.  
"你是在暗示什么吗，碇？" 明日香厉声说道。

"Why are you getting so worked up Asuka?" Hikari asked, concerned for her friend.  
"你为什么这么激动，明日香？" 光担心地问她的朋友。

"I am NOT getting worked up!" Asuka shouted at Hikari.  
"我才没有激动！" 明日香对光喊道。

The class rep went silent and an awkward silence continued before Shinji spoke up. "Anyways, the guys need me so I'm going back to our lunch spot. Lunch is almost over too, do you wanna come with?" he asked Aria.  
班长沉默了，一阵尴尬的寂静持续着，直到真嗣开口打破沉默。“总之，男生们需要我，所以我得回我们的午餐地点。午休也快结束了，你要一起来吗？”他问亚里亚。

"Yes, my boyfriend" Aria said happily.  
“好的，我的男朋友。”亚里亚开心地说。

Asuka just cringed at her sweet voice, but said nothing. She was losing control of her emotions and she didn't want another outburst. The new couple walked off laughing and chatting to each other. Aria held Shinji around the waist and kissed him on the cheek as they walked. At this, Asuka felt a knot twist in her stomach. _'What's wrong with me?'_ she thought, feeling sick.  
明日香只是因为她的甜美声音而皱眉，但没有说什么。她感到自己的情绪正在失控，不想再次爆发。这对新情侣笑着聊着天走开了。亚里亚搂着真嗣的腰，边走边亲了他的脸颊。看到这一幕，明日香感到胃里一阵纠结。‘我这是怎么了？’她想，感到恶心。

"Let's just go back to class Hikari, lunch is almost over" the redhead said in a flat tone.  
"我们还是回教室吧，光，午休快结束了" 红发女孩用平淡的语气说道。

"Sure Asuka" Hikari replied warily. She knew there was something up with Asuka but didn't know if she should push it or not. The class rep was also surprised to see Shinji get together with another girl; she had just been discussing the other day with the redhead about the boy liking Asuka and it was difficult to bring up the topic.  
"好的，明日香" 光小心翼翼地回答。她知道明日香有些不对劲，但不确定是否应该追问。作为班长的她也对真嗣和另一个女孩在一起感到惊讶；前几天她还和红发女孩讨论过真嗣喜欢明日香的事，现在提起这个话题有些困难。

The two girls walked slowly in silence towards the school building. Hikari could not stand the tension and the curiosity got the better of her as she decided to break the silence.  
两个女孩默默地慢慢走向学校建筑。光无法忍受这种紧张气氛，好奇心驱使她决定打破沉默。

"So Asuka, I wanted to ask you something?" the ponytailed girl asked.  
"那么，明日香，我想问你点事儿？" 马尾辫女孩问道。

"Go ahead" the eva pilot prompted.  
"说吧" 这位 EVA 驾驶员催促道。

"What did you mean when you asked Shinji if he was implying something?" Hikari asked.  
"你问真嗣他是不是在暗示什么的时候，是什么意思？" 光问道。

Asuka paused and sighed. "Sometime on the weekend Shinji and I had been talking, this was one of the fights we had that I mentioned yesterday. He told me that I should stop pushing people away and give them a chance, that was just after he admitted he liked me" she explained.  
明日香停顿了一下，叹了口气。“周末的时候，真嗣和我聊天，这就是我昨天提到的那次争吵之一。他告诉我应该停止推开别人，给他们一个机会，就在他承认喜欢我之后。”她解释道。

"Shinji admitted he liked you? Is this why you said you thought he had feelings for you? What did you do?" Hikari inquired.  
“真嗣承认他喜欢你？这就是为什么你说你认为他对你有感觉吗？你做了什么？” 洞木光询问道。

"I beat the crap out of him, that's what. Looks like I made the right call too, he just went off with that tramp anyway! Though not like I would ever-WHAM!" the redhead was cut short by a hard blow to the jaw.  
“我狠狠揍了他一顿，就是这样。看来我的决定没错，他还是跟那个贱人走了！虽然我绝不会——砰！”红发女孩的话被重重的一拳打断了。

Both girls turned in surprise to see the angry face of Touji.  
两个女孩惊讶地转过身，看到了愤怒的东治的脸。

"Unbelievable Sohryu, I never thought you could be such a heartless bitch" Touji spat.  
“难以置信，惣流，我从没想过你竟然能这么无情。”东治啐道。

"What in the world are you talking about?" Asuka retorted angrily.  
“你到底在说什么鬼话？”明日香愤怒地反驳。

"Don't tell me you forgot? You told me you would be nice to Shinji if he confessed any feelings towards you" he replied.  
"别告诉我你忘了？你说过如果真嗣向你表白，你会对他好一点的" 他回答道。


_**Touji: Hey Sohryu,**__**just wanted to ask you about Shinji. Have you noticed that he's changed? Despite the angel battles and his time in prison, he seems a lot more cheerful and not so reserved and… well not so Shinji.**_  
东治：嘿，绫波，我只是想问问你关于真嗣的事。你有没有注意到他变了？尽管经历了天使战斗和监狱时光，他似乎变得开朗多了，不再那么内向和……呃，不再那么像真嗣了。

_**Asuka: Yeah, you mean he's grown a spine. Yes, he definitely seems more outgoing and confident. I'm not too sure what has caused this.  
明日香：是啊，你是说他终于硬气起来了。没错，他确实看起来更外向和自信了。我不太确定是什么导致了这种变化。**_

_**Touji: Lol, grown a spine. I can only guess it's you Sohryu, so keep up the good work. Whatever it is you're doing, even if you don't realise what it is, keep it up, I've never seen Shinji so happy. He seems to generally enjoy your company, he defends you and interacts with you a lot, maybe he likes you?  
冬二：哈哈，终于硬气了。我猜八成是你，惣流，继续保持。不管你在做什么，哪怕你自己都没意识到，坚持下去，我从没见过真嗣这么开心。他似乎真的很享受和你在一起的时光，他为你辩护，和你互动很多，也许他喜欢你呢？**_

_**Asuka: Suzuhara you almost sound grateful to me, I thought you hated me? And as for Shinji liking me, I don't think so. Maybe he's just happy because I saved his life yesterday.  
明日香：铃原，你听起来几乎对我心存感激，我以为你讨厌我呢？至于真嗣喜欢我，我不这么认为。也许他只是因为昨天我救了他一命而感到高兴吧。**_

_**Touji: I don't HATE you… you just scare me :P. Though perhaps you're right about Shinji, if he DOES come up to you confessing his feelings, don't be mean to him. I mean, I know you probably don't like him that way, but be nice.  
冬二：我并不讨厌你……只是有点怕你罢了 :P。不过也许你是对的，如果真嗣真的来找你表白，别对他太刻薄。我是说，我知道你可能对他没那种感觉，但对他好点。**_

_**Asuka: He wouldn't have the guts to ask me out, but I'll be nice if he does, I do respect him.  
明日香：他没胆子约我出去，但如果他真敢，我会对他好点，我确实尊重他。**_


As Asuka returned from her flashback, Touji was still glaring at her angrily.  
当明日香从回忆中回过神来时，真嗣仍然愤怒地瞪着她。

"You remember now huh? You know I can't believe I thought you were a good person. All my instincts told me it couldn't be true, but I believed Shinji. Seems like you just played him you whore" the boy continued.  
“你终于想起来了是吧？真不敢相信我曾以为你是个好人。我的直觉一直告诉我那不可能，但我相信了真嗣。看来你只是玩弄了他，你这个婊子。”男孩继续说道。

"You don't know anything you dumb jock!" the redhead shot back.  
“你这个蠢货运动员，你什么都不知道！”红发女孩反唇相讥。

"And you still try to defend yourself. You disgust me" he finished, before walking off.  
“而你还在试图为自己辩解。你真让我恶心。”他说完，转身离开。

Asuka's fists shook violently and she desperately fought the urge to breakdown and cry. She turned to look at Hikari, who was looking at her with pity. Today she had been humiliated, ignored and now pitied. At this, the redhead snapped and punched the nearby window as hard as she could. Hikari screamed as the glass shattered and Asuka's hand got cut from the sharp glass. Blood dripped down her clenched fist as she breathed raggedly. All the anger and stress that had been building up since the day she woke up with her memory lost had been released in a massive torrent.  
明日香的拳头剧烈颤抖，她拼命压抑着崩溃大哭的冲动。她转头看向光，光正用同情的目光看着她。今天她遭受了羞辱、忽视，现在又被人同情。这一刻，红发女孩爆发了，她用尽全力猛击旁边的窗户。光尖叫起来，玻璃碎片四溅，明日香的手被锋利的玻璃划伤。鲜血从她紧握的拳头滴落，她喘着粗气。自从失去记忆醒来那天起积累的所有愤怒和压力，在这一刻如洪水般倾泻而出。

"Why can't everyone just LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!" Asuka shouted.  
“为什么每个人都他妈的不能让我一个人待着！”明日香大喊道。

"Look Asuka, I'm sure-" Hikari started.  
“听着，明日香，我肯定——” 光开始说道。

"Don't Hikari… just don't" the redhead interrupted.  
“别说了，光……就别说了”红发女孩打断道。

The two just stood in silence, neither wanting to say anything. There were a few students watching them curiously as they had heard the window smash and the loud shout, however they were too afraid to approach them. Asuka just held her head up and begun to walk off to the infirmary.  
两人只是静静地站着，谁也不想开口。有几个学生好奇地看着他们，因为他们听到了窗户破碎和那声大喊，但又害怕靠近。明日香只是昂起头，开始向医务室走去。

"I'm going to the infirmary to get these cuts fixed up, see ya" Asuka told Hikari.  
“我去医务室处理这些伤口，再见。”明日香对光说。

The class rep twisted her lips as she watched her friend walk off. She knew Asuka could be temperamental sometimes, but she had never seen her blow off so much before. Hikari also knew Touji's comment wasn't enough to set off the redhead like that and so deduced that something else must be bothering her. The girl made a decision and walked off to the infirmary to comfort Asuka, despite her behaviour and what she said, she knew the redhead would want someone with her.  
班长看着朋友离开，嘴唇扭曲了一下。她知道明日香有时脾气不好，但她从未见过她如此失控。光也知道，洞木的评论不足以让红发女孩那样爆发，因此推断肯定有其他事情困扰着她。女孩下定决心，尽管明日香的行为和所说的话，她知道红发女孩会希望有人陪着她，于是走向医务室去安慰明日香。

---

As Shinji, Touji and Kensuke returned to the classroom, they found out about the events that had transpired. Shinji felt very concerned for Asuka, but didn't know whether or not he should approach her just yet. For now, he decided to get the full story of what happened, starting with what Touji told her.  
当真嗣、渡志和健介回到教室时，他们得知了发生的事情。真嗣对明日香感到非常担忧，但不确定是否应该现在就接近她。目前，他决定先从渡志那里了解事情的全部经过。

"Alright Touji, what did you say to piss her off?" Shinji asked with a firm voice.  
“好吧，渡志，你说了什么惹她生气了？”真嗣用坚定的语气问道。

"I didn't do anything wrong! Don't try to pin it on me!" Touji replied.  
“我什么都没做错！别想把责任推给我！”渡志回答道。

"What did you say?" the eva pilot asked a little louder.  
"你说什么？" 初号机驾驶员稍微提高了声音问道。

"Well… I heard that she beat you up after you confessed to liking her" Touji explained.  
"嗯……我听说你向她表白后，她把你揍了一顿" 冬二解释道。

"I don't see how that would have done anything" Shinji remarked.  
"我不明白那怎么会起作用" 真嗣评论道。

"Well… last week I asked her to be nice to you if you confessed any feelings towards her and she promised to. After hearing what she said… I got so angry I punched her and told her she was a whore" the jock admitted.  
"嗯……上周我让她在你表白时对你好一点，她答应了。但听到她说的那些话……我气得揍了她一顿，还骂她是婊子"，这位运动员坦白道。

Both Kensuke and Shinji grimaced; Asuka would not have remembered her promise to Touji so she wasn't really at fault. Shinji could only imagine the misery she must be going through with everyone against her today.  
Kensuke 和 Shinji 都皱起了眉头；Asuka 可能已经不记得她对 Touji 的承诺了，所以她并非真的有过错。Shinji 只能想象她今天被所有人针对时所承受的痛苦。

"Touji there was no need to do that. She didn't beat me up because I admitted I liked her" Shinji declared.  
"Touji，没必要那样做。她没有因为我承认喜欢她就揍我"，Shinji 声明道。

"Really? But she said-" Touji began.  
"真的吗？但她说过——" 东治开始说道。

"It doesn't matter what she said" Shinji interrupted. "The truth is that I insulted her and we fought each other because of that. This just happened to be coincidentally after I admitted I liked her"  
"她说了什么并不重要" 真嗣打断道。"事实是我侮辱了她，我们因此打了起来。这只是巧合地发生在我承认我喜欢她之后"

"Wait, so you actually do like her?" Touji asked.  
"等等，所以你真的喜欢她？" 东治问道。

"Well…" Shinji began, "I was just saying I liked her as a close friend. In any case, I understand you were doing it for me Touji, but even if she _had_ broken her promise don't do something like that again"  
"嗯…" 真嗣开口道，"我只是说我把她当作亲密的朋友。无论如何，我知道你是为了我好，阿薰，但即使她违背了承诺，也不要再做那样的事了"

"But then-" Touji started, feeling bad for the redhead.  
"但然后-" 阿薰开始说，对那位红发女孩感到抱歉。

"Don't worry about it Touji, just let her cool down, she'll get over it" Shinji interrupted.  
"别担心，阿薰，让她冷静一下，她会释怀的" 真嗣打断道。

"But she broke a window" Kensuke added.  
“但她打碎了一扇窗户。” 真希波补充道。

"Oh believe me, it isn't as bad as it could have been" Shinji remarked.  
“哦，相信我，情况本可能更糟。” 真嗣评论道。

The three chuckled slightly, but the laughter died quickly as none of them found the situation that funny. The three were soon joined up by Aria, who had gone to the toilet. With lunch almost over, the four now returned to the classroom and sat down at their seats. When all the students had returned and the bell rang, they noticed Asuka and Hikari were both missing. Touji started to feel uneasy about what he had done, but there was nothing he could do to take back what he said.  
三人轻声笑了笑，但笑声很快消失，因为他们都觉得这情景并不那么好笑。不久，阿莉娅也回来了，她刚才去了洗手间。午餐即将结束，四人回到教室，各自坐回座位。当所有学生都回来并响起铃声时，他们注意到明日香和光都缺席了。冬二开始对自己所做的事感到不安，但他无法收回已经说出的话。

The teacher walked in and another girl stood up to say, "Rise! Bow! Sit!" As the teacher droned on, a feeling of worry grew inside Shinji, but he couldn't back down now. A message then arrived at his computer and he opened it.  
老师走进教室，另一个女孩站起来喊道：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！” 老师继续单调地讲课，但真嗣心中却越来越焦虑，他现在不能退缩。这时，他的电脑收到了一条消息，他打开了它。

_**Aria: Is Asuka ok? What's up with her? Was it anything I did?  
Aria：明日香还好吗？她怎么了？是我做了什么吗？**_

Shinji was surprised to see Aria showing concern for his roommate. When he thought about it, she never retaliated to Asuka's insults or took offense. He cleared his thoughts and began typing a reply.  
看到 Aria 对室友表现出关心，真嗣感到惊讶。回想起来，她从未对明日香的侮辱进行反击或感到冒犯。他整理了一下思绪，开始打字回复。

_**Shinji: Asuka's all right, she just needed to release some steam. It definitely wasn't anything you did. I'm pretty damn sure *I* pissed her off.  
真嗣：明日香没事，她只是需要发泄一下。绝对不是你做了什么。我敢肯定是我惹她生气了。**_

_**Aria: If you say so, but please tell me if you find out I did anything wrong. Asuka aside, I am so happy you actually asked me out Shinji :D. You know I think you're a great guy and I didn't think you would go after me. It must have taken a lot of courage since we only really met each other yesterday.  
亚里沙：如果你这么说的话，但请告诉我如果我发现我做错了什么。撇开明日香不谈，我真的很高兴你真的约我出去，真嗣：D。你知道我认为你是个很棒的人，我没想到你会追求我。毕竟我们昨天才真正认识对方，这一定需要很大的勇气。**_

Shinji felt a bit of guilt as he read the message.  
真嗣读着这条消息，感到有些内疚。

_**Shinji: Well it was hard to ask you in front of the other girls, but it wasn't that bad.  
真嗣：嗯，在其他女生面前问你确实有点难，但也没那么糟糕。**_

_**Aria: Ok honey, what would you like to do for our first date? Although it can't be today.  
亚里亚：好的，亲爱的，你想第一次约会做什么呢？虽然今天不行。**_

_**Shinji: I was thinking to go to the movies, perhaps tomorrow after school?  
真嗣：我在想去看电影，或许明天放学后怎么样？**_

_**Aria: Sounds great. I can't wait!  
阿莉亚：听起来很棒。我都等不及了！**_

The eva pilot smiled at his girlfriend's eagerness; she seemed very enthusiastic and positive all the time. His thoughts soon returned to Asuka, however, as he wondered if he should continue ignoring her. He really didn't want to upset her anymore and he thought she had had enough. Shinji had stood up to her many times already so he didn't need to prove anything. The boy began to look around the room again as he grew bored. He felt slightly uncomfortable with Hikari and Asuka gone as it reminded him of the other time they had both been absent.  
这位 EVA 驾驶员对他的女友的热情报以微笑；她似乎总是充满热情和积极。然而，他的思绪很快又回到了明日香身上，他不知道是否应该继续忽视她。他真的不想再让她不高兴了，他认为她已经受够了。真嗣已经多次站出来面对她，所以他不需要再证明什么。男孩开始再次环顾房间，感到无聊。他觉得有点不自在，因为光和明日香都不在，这让他想起了她们俩都缺席的另一次。

The sun shone strong through the windows, warming up the room considerably. It was always hot in Tokyo-3, but today the heat was making the students fall asleep in class. Shinji wiped the sweat of his brow; it was so stuffy and it was making him feel worse, the symptoms from this morning were returning. He had begun to feel better the first half of school without even noticing and thus had assumed that this morning's problems had been nothing, but now with the ill feeling returning he wasn't so sure. His head was starting to spin again and he felt ready to vomit.  
阳光透过窗户强烈地照射进来，使房间变得相当温暖。东京-3 总是很热，但今天的高温让学生们在课堂上昏昏欲睡。真嗣擦去额头上的汗水；这里太闷热了，让他感觉更糟，早上出现的症状又回来了。他一开始在学校的前半段时间里感觉好多了，甚至没有注意到，因此以为今天早上的问题没什么大不了的，但现在这种不适感又回来了，他就不那么确定了。他的头又开始晕了，感觉快要吐了。

Apparently, the teacher had noticed Shinji's sick condition as he called to him. "Mister Ikari, are you alright?"  
显然，老师注意到了真嗣的病态，向他喊道：“碇同学，你还好吗？”

"I don't feel very well sir" Shinji answered.  
“我感觉不太好，老师。”真嗣回答道。

"Alright Suzuhara, please take Shinji to the infirmary" the teacher requested.  
“好的，铃原，请带真嗣去医务室。”老师吩咐道。

"Yes sir" Touji replied, standing up.  
“是的，先生。” 冬二回答道，站起身来。

Touji walked over to his friend's desk as Shinji stood up unsteadily. The jock took his friend's arm and put it over his shoulder. Touji then proceeded to carry the eva pilot like this towards the classroom's door. Touji stopped to open the door and then walked through the doorway, closing the door behind him. The pair walked through the empty corridors towards the school infirmary. It was eerily silent as they traversed the hallway without speaking to each other.  
冬二走向朋友的桌子，真嗣摇摇晃晃地站了起来。这位体育健将扶住朋友的胳膊，搭在自己的肩膀上。随后，冬二就这样搀扶着 EVA 驾驶员向教室门口走去。他停下来开门，然后穿过门廊，顺手关上了门。两人穿过空荡荡的走廊，向学校医务室走去。他们默默地走过长廊，四周静得令人毛骨悚然。

The duo soon arrived at the infirmary and they noticed a red cross had been painted on the door. Touji held his breath and knocked on the door before opening it. Inside were Asuka, Hikari and a nurse who was currently bandaging Asuka's hand. The three looked up at the intruders in surprise. After realising who had come, Asuka turned her face away.  
不久，两人到达了医务室，注意到门上画着一个红十字。冬二屏住呼吸，敲了敲门，然后推门而入。里面是明日香、光和一名正在给明日香的手包扎的护士。三人惊讶地看着闯入者。意识到是谁来了之后，明日香转过脸去。

"What is a baka and a dumb jock doing here?" Asuka asked rhetorically.  
"一个笨蛋和傻瓜运动员在这里做什么？" 明日香讽刺地问道。

"Sshhh" the nurse said to Asuka, "Now what seems to be the problem?"  
"嘘嘘" 护士对明日香说，"现在有什么问题吗？"

"Well Shinji here is feeling quite sick so I brought him here. Anyways I need to return to class, so you take good care of him" Touji explained.  
"嗯，真嗣这里感觉很不舒服，所以我带他来了。无论如何我需要回教室了，所以你要好好照顾他" 东治解释道。

Shinji thought it strange to see Touji eager to go back to class, but then again, he wouldn't want to confront the redhead either. The jock placed Shinji down on a chair before turning to exit the infirmary.  
真嗣觉得看到阿斯兰急着回教室很奇怪，但话说回来，他也不想面对那个红发小子。体育生把真嗣放在椅子上，然后转身离开了医务室。

Touji turned his face slightly towards Asuka. "Sohryu… sorry about earlier" he said quickly before exiting and closing the door behind him.  
阿斯兰微微转向明日香。“惣流……刚才的事对不起”他迅速说完，然后离开了房间，关上了门。

The redhead just huffed in response but said nothing. The nurse turned to face the sick boy. "What exactly are your symptoms?" she asked.  
红发女孩只是哼了一声，什么也没说。护士转向生病的男孩。“你具体有哪些症状？”她问道。

"I'm feeling dizzy all the time, I can barely walk straight and I feel like vomiting" he answered.  
"我一直感到头晕，几乎走不直，还想吐" 他回答道。

"You're not drinking are you?" the nurse asked seriously.  
"你没在喝酒吧？" 护士严肃地问道。

Asuka laughed and Hikari couldn't help giggling a little.  
明日香笑了，而光子忍不住轻声笑了起来。

"No!" Shinji replied immediately, blushing.  
"不！" 真嗣立刻回答，脸红了。

"Alright then, well I just suggest you go home and get some rest. It's most probably a virus, but you might want a doctor to check you" the nurse advised.  
"好吧，那我建议你回家休息一下。很可能是病毒，但也许你需要医生检查一下" 护士建议道。

"Ok" he acknowledged. "好的" 他应道。

"You want me to phone your guardian to pick you up? Alternatively, do you have a relative or friend at school who can help you home?" the nurse offered.  
"你想让我打电话给你的监护人来接你吗？或者，你学校里有亲戚或朋友能帮你回家吗？" 护士提议道。

"My guardian is probably too busy at work. However, Asuka here lives in the same house as I do, she can help me home" the boy replied.  
"我的监护人工作可能太忙了。不过，明日香和我住在同一个屋檐下，她可以帮我回家。" 男孩回答道。

The redhead glared at him furiously, they both knew they were top priority to NERV and Misato would have picked up Shinji if he was sick regardless. But she didn't say anything because she didn't really want to stay at school any longer anyway.  
红发女孩愤怒地瞪着他，他们俩都知道 NERV 和美里会把真嗣放在首位，如果他生病了，美里无论如何都会来接他的。但她什么也没说，因为她其实也不想在学校多待。

"Ah well, I've already bandaged up Sohryu's cuts so it shouldn't be a problem. You ok with this miss?" the nurse asked.  
"啊，我已经给长良小姐包扎好了伤口，应该没问题。您觉得这样可以吗，小姐？" 护士问道。

"Yeah whatever" Asuka accepted.  
"随便啦" 明日香接受了。

"Alright then Miss Horaki, you can go back to class. I'll just do a few final checks on these two" the nurse informed the class rep.  
"好的，堀崎小姐，你可以回教室了。我再给这两位做些最后的检查" 护士告诉班长。

"Yes miss" Hikari replied politely and bowed, before leaving the room.  
“是的，小姐。”光礼貌地回答，并鞠了一躬，然后离开了房间。

The nurse turned back to the two eva pilots and checked their temperature and blood pressure. She carefully inspected Asuka's hand and then checked inside both their mouths.  
护士转回两位 EVA 驾驶员身边，检查了他们的体温和血压。她仔细检查了明日香的手，然后又检查了他们两人的口腔内部。

"Alright Mr. Ikari, you have a slight temperature so get home and rest ok?" the nurse requested.  
“好了，碇先生，你有点发烧，回家休息吧，好吗？”护士请求道。

"I will" Shinji agreed. “我会去的。”真嗣同意道。

"You take care of him Miss Sohryu and no more breaking windows" the nurse directed as she went back to her cupboard.  
“好好照顾他，绫波小姐，别再打破窗户了。”护士吩咐完，便回到她的橱柜旁。

Asuka just rolled her eyes. She then helped Shinji to stand and placed his arm around her shoulder as Touji had done. The young girl opened the door and exited the infirmary, carrying Shinji like this towards the exit of the school. Shinji enjoyed the feel of having Asuka close to him, but reminded himself he now had a girlfriend.  
明日香只是翻了个白眼。随后她帮助真嗣站起来，像之前东治做的那样，将他的手臂搭在自己的肩膀上。少女打开门，就这样搀扶着真嗣走出医务室，朝学校的出口走去。真嗣享受着与明日香近距离接触的感觉，但提醒自己现在有了女朋友。

"You gonna continue to ignore me for the rest of the day third child?" Asuka asked.  
"你打算一整天都无视我吗，三子？" 明日香问道。

"Nah you win, I can't do it" he replied.  
"不了，你赢了，我做不到" 他回答道。

Asuka smiled smugly, "As expected, I'm always right"  
明日香得意地笑了，"果然，我总是对的"

"Uh-huh" he said sarcastically.  
"嗯哼" 他讽刺地说道。

"Listen here Ikari, I've really had enough of your crap. You got me real pissed today and don't defend yourself, you KNOW it's your fault" Asuka declared, airing her grievances.  
"听着，碇，我真的受够了你的废话。你今天真把我惹火了，别辩解，你自己心里清楚这是你的错" 明日香宣布，发泄她的不满。

"But-" the boy started. "但是——" 男孩开口道。

"What did I just say you baka? _You_ made me pretend I didn't lose my memory and Touji attacks me because of a stupid promise I couldn't even recall" Asuka snapped.  
"我刚刚说什么了，你这个笨蛋？你让我假装没失忆，结果因为一个我都记不起来的愚蠢承诺，被东治攻击了" 明日香怒道。

"But it's not that big a deal, I mean it's only Touji and-" he attempted.  
"但这也没那么严重吧，我是说，只是东治而已——" 他试图辩解。

"That's not the point, it's humiliating! It makes me look like I don't keep my word and worst of all Hikari likes that freaking idiot" Asuka shot back.  
"问题不在这儿，这太丢人了！让我看起来像个不守信用的人，更糟糕的是，光还喜欢那个该死的傻瓜" 明日香反驳道。

"I mean… you're right, but how could I possibly know about that promise anyway? Look I'll deal with it, to make up for getting you so angry today" Shinji conceded.  
"我的意思是…你说得对，但我怎么可能知道那个承诺呢？听着，我会处理好的，为了弥补今天让你这么生气。" 真嗣让步道。

"You better" the redhead replied.  
"你最好说到做到" 红发女孩回答道。

They continued walking on, Asuka occasionally shifting her position to make it more comfortable. The sun was really hot today and the two teens couldn't help sweating.  
他们继续走着，明日香偶尔调整姿势以更舒适。今天的太阳真的很热，两个少年忍不住流汗。

"Why in the world did you get me to take you? You and I both know Misato would have come, and a car ride is much more enjoyable than this blistering heat" Asuka commented aloud.  
“你到底为什么要让我带你来？你我都知道美里会来的，坐车可比这酷热舒服多了。”明日香大声评论道。

"Not Misato's driving" he said, grimacing.  
“不是美里的车技。”他皱着眉说。

Asuka couldn't help chuckling. "Alright, but still"  
明日香忍不住轻笑。“好吧，但还是……”

"I thought you wanted to get out of school, besides I thought maybe Misato and Kaji might be doing something" Shinji explained.  
"我以为你想逃学，而且我以为美里和加持可能在做些什么" 真嗣解释道。

"Lies! You just wanted to do something perverted to me while I was carrying you" Asuka teased.  
"撒谎！你只是想在我背着你的时候对我做些下流的事" 明日香调侃道。

"I have a girlfriend now remember" he countered.  
"我现在有女朋友了，记得吗" 他反驳道。

"Are you a greenie or something? Why are you tying yourself to a tree?" she joked.  
"你是新手还是怎么的？为什么要把自己绑在树上？"她开玩笑道。

Shinji snickered, "Come on Asuka, that's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard you say"  
真嗣窃笑道："拜托，明日香，这是我听过你说过的最蠢的话之一了"

"Made you laugh" she said, smirking. "But seriously, why her?"  
"逗你笑呢"她扬起嘴角说。"但说真的，为什么是她？"

"You rather I was dating you?" he said, grinning.  
"你宁愿我在和你约会吗？" 他笑着说。

"No way!" she said, slapping him. "Oh who cares, are you doing anything with her yet?" she asked.  
"不可能！" 她拍了他一下。"哦，谁在乎呢，你和她有什么进展吗？" 她问道。

"Gonna go to the movies tomorrow" he answered.  
"明天打算去看电影" 他回答道。

"Right, how original. Is she going to give you oral sex in the cinema?" she said with a straight face.  
"对，真有创意。她要在电影院给你口交吗？" 她面无表情地说道。

"ASUKA?!" he shouted, blushing a deep red.  
"明日香?!" 他大喊道，脸红得像熟透的苹果。

"I'm just kidding" she replied, rolling her eyes.  
"我开玩笑的" 她回答道，翻了个白眼。

"I would never do anything sexual with her" he remarked.  
"我绝不会和她发生任何性关系" 他评论道。

"Well you never know, you're such a pervert after all. So, you two have only kissed then?" she asked, sounding unconvinced.  
"哎呀，谁知道呢，毕竟你是个变态嘛。那么，你们俩就只接过吻吗？" 她问道，听起来并不相信。

"Yes" Shinji answered. "是的" 真嗣回答道。

"Nothing else?" Asuka prompted.  
"没有别的了？" 明日香追问道。

"Nope, as if we had enough time anyway" he replied.  
"没有，反正我们也没多少时间" 他回答道。

For some reason, Asuka felt relieved at hearing this. "What are you talking about? Men are very quick to please"  
不知为何，明日香听到这话感到一阵释然。"你在说什么呢？男人可是很快就能满足的"

"Really Asuka, would you stop implying that Aria is a slut" Shinji requested.  
"真的，明日香，你能别暗示绫波是个荡妇吗？" 真嗣请求道。

"Oh why not? I cannot see any other possible reason for her instant attraction to you" the redhead retorted.  
"哦，为什么不？我看不出她对你一见钟情还有其他什么可能的原因" 红发女孩反驳道。

"Maybe I am just that good-looking" he countered jokingly.  
"也许我就是那么帅" 他开玩笑地回击道。

"Don't flatter yourself" she huffed.  
"别自作多情了"她哼了一声。

At this point, the two eva pilots continued on in silence. The heat was really starting to affect Shinji, his head was starting to ache and it was getting harder for him to keep up. Asuka noticed him lugging her down and turned to face him.  
此时，两位 EVA 驾驶员继续沉默前行。高温开始严重影响真嗣，他的头开始疼痛，跟上步伐也变得困难。明日香注意到他拖累了自己，转身面对他。

"Are you alright Shinji? What's wrong?" the girl asked with a hint of concern.  
"你还好吗，真嗣？怎么了？"女孩带着一丝关切问道。

"It's the heat… I'm getting real tired… gotta hurry up" he managed to reply.  
"是这热气... 我真是累坏了... 得快点儿" 他勉强回答道。

"Don't pass out on me, I don't wanna carry you!" the redhead ordered.  
"别在我面前晕倒，我可不想背你！" 红发女孩命令道。

But it was too late, the boy had passed out and Asuka was left with him hanging limply off her shoulder. The girl wiped the sweat off her brow and gathered all her strength. She lifted the boy up and began to carry him as he had done to her many times. She gritted her teeth with the effort and was thankful the apartment was very close.  
但为时已晚，男孩已经晕了过去，阿斯卡只能让他无力地靠在自己肩上。女孩擦去额头的汗水，集中所有力气。她把男孩背起来，就像他多次对她做的那样。她咬紧牙关，努力坚持，庆幸公寓就在不远处。

"How much do you weigh I swear" she commented aloud.  
“你到底有多重啊，我发誓。”她大声评论道。

Asuka soon arrived at the apartment and quickly made for the elevator. She threw him onto the floor and pressed their floor number. She breathed heavily, she could probably do it normally without this much effort, but it was hot and she was tired. As the elevator reached their floor, she dragged him across the floor instead, not wanting to lift him again. Asuka arrived at their door, unlocked it and opened it, pulling the unconscious Shinji inside. After getting the boy inside, she closed the door and went to check on him.  
明日香很快到达了公寓，迅速走向电梯。她把他扔在地上，按下了他们的楼层号码。她喘着粗气，她本可以正常地做到这一点，不需要这么费力，但天气很热，她也很累。当电梯到达他们的楼层时，她拖着他穿过地板，不想再把他抬起来。明日香到达他们的门口，解锁并打开门，将昏迷的 Shinji 拉了进去。把男孩带进屋后，她关上门，去查看他的情况。

He was breathing fine so that was all right, but when she put her hand to his forehead, he was burning up fast. _'Not good, there's not enough time for me to call Misato and wait for her to pick him up, I gotta get his temperature down'_ she thought. The redhead ran to the bathroom and started to pour cold water into the bathtub. The girl then ran to the kitchen, taking out all the ice trays she could find and dumping all the ice into the bathtub.  
他的呼吸还算正常，这还好，但当她把手放在他的额头上时，他烧得厉害。“不好，没时间打电话给美里等她来接他了，我得先给他降温。”她想。红发女孩跑到浴室，开始往浴缸里倒冷水。然后她跑到厨房，拿出所有能找到的冰格，把冰块全部倒进浴缸里。

Asuka soon returned to where Shinji was and dragged him as fast as she could to the bathroom. The redhead then pulled off his uniform and threw him into the freezing cold water. The boy immediately regained consciousness and yelped.  
明日香很快回到真嗣所在的地方，拽着他尽可能快地向浴室跑去。红发女孩随后脱掉了他的制服，将他扔进了冰冷的水中。男孩立刻恢复了意识，发出一声惊叫。

"Sshh you baka, your temperature is through the roof! You need to cool down, so stay down" Asuka ordered.  
"嘘，你这个笨蛋，体温高得离谱！你需要降温，所以待在水里" 明日香命令道。

"W-w-what h-h-happened?" he asked, stuttering from the cold.  
"发-发-发生了什么？" 他因寒冷而结巴地问道。

"You bloody passed out on me, I had to carry you into the apartment and dump you into this bathtub" she answered.  
"你这家伙居然在我面前晕倒了，我只好把你拖进公寓，扔进这个浴缸里。"她回答道。

"T-t-thank y-y-you A-a-asuka" he thanked.  
"谢、谢、谢谢你，绫、绫、绫波"他感激地说。

"Yeah yeah, I'm gonna go call Misato" she replied.  
"是是，我去给美里打电话。"她回应道。

"W-when c-can I g-get out?" he inquired.  
"我-我什么时候能-能出去？" 他问道。

The redhead sighed irritated and placed her hand on his forehead. Shinji enjoyed the soft feel of her palm pressed against his head.  
红发女孩不耐烦地叹了口气，把手放在他的额头上。真嗣享受着她手掌轻柔地贴在自己头上的感觉。

"Looks like about a day" she answered.  
"看起来大概还需要一天" 她回答道。

"W-What?" the boy let out in dismay.  
"什、什么？" 男孩失望地喊道。

She laughed slightly at his reaction. "Don't you have a sense of humour Shinji? You can get out in a few minutes, you've definitely cooled down"  
她对他的反应轻笑了一下。"别这么没幽默感，真嗣。你再过几分钟就可以出来了，肯定已经冷静下来了。"

"A-alright" he acknowledged.  
"好吧" 他应道。

Asuka exited the bathroom and moved over to their phone. She picked up the receiver and dialed Misato's work number. Misato picked up straight away.  
明日香走出浴室，走向电话机旁。她拿起听筒，拨打了美里工作地点的号码。美里立刻接起了电话。

"This is Major Katsuragi speaking" the Major answered.  
“我是葛城美里少校。”美里回答道。

"Hello Misato, it's me Asuka. Shinji and I are both at home. Shinji is sick and I'm not sure how bad it is" Asuka began.  
“你好，美里，是我，明日香。真嗣和我都在家。真嗣生病了，我不确定他病得有多严重。”明日香开始说道。

"What happened?" Misato asked.  
"发生了什么？" 美里问道。

"Well, that baka passed out while we were walking home" the redhead answered.  
"那个笨蛋在我们走回家的路上晕倒了" 红发女孩回答道。

"But school isn't over" her guardian replied.  
"但学校还没放学" 她的监护人回应道。

"Well, he was feeling sick and-" the young girl started.  
"嗯，他感觉不舒服，所以——"年轻女孩开口道。

"Why didn't he call me to pick him up?" the Major interrupted.  
"他为什么不打电话让我去接他？"少校打断道。

"Ask _him_ that" Asuka said, sighing.  
"你自己问他吧。"明日香叹了口气说。

"Is he alright now?" Misato asked, concerned about his wellbeing.  
"他现在还好吗？" 美里问道，关心他的健康状况。

"I shoved him in a bathtub full of freezing cold water to cool him down" Asuka explained.  
"我把他推进装满冰冷水的浴缸里，让他冷静下来。" 明日香解释道。

"Good thinking Asuka, I'll come by soon with Ritsuko to check up on him then" Misato replied, sounding relieved.  
"干得好，明日香。我很快会和律子一起过来看看他的情况。" 美里回答，听起来松了一口气。

CRASH! 轰隆！

Asuka jumped, surprised at the noise.  
明日香吓了一跳，被那声响惊到。

"What was that?" Misato asked.  
“那是什么声音？”美里问道。

"Don't know yet, I'm guessing probably Shinji being a clumsy oaf again. Excuse me while I go check on the baka" Asuka replied.  
"还不知道，我猜大概又是真嗣那笨手笨脚的傻瓜吧。我去看看那笨蛋，失陪了。" 明日香回答道。

The redhead hung up and returned to the bathroom to see Shinji on the floor. If not for the situation, she would have found the scene quite amusing; a half-naked Shinji was sprawled out on the floor, completely soaked and shaking.  
红发女孩挂断电话，回到浴室，看到真嗣躺在地上。如果不是在这种情境下，她可能会觉得这一幕相当滑稽；半裸的真嗣四肢摊开躺在地上，浑身湿透，瑟瑟发抖。

"What happened?" she asked, trying not to sound annoyed.  
"发生了什么？" 她问道，尽量不显得不耐烦。

"I t-tripped… I still get dizzy" Shinji answered timidly.  
"我、我绊了一下……现在还头晕" 真嗣怯生生地回答道。

"Oh, you would have tripped either way you klutz" the girl shot back.  
"哼，不管怎样你都会摔倒的，笨手笨脚的" 女孩回敬道。

Asuka moved over to helpless boy and gave him her hand. After helping him stand, she moved him next to the wall so he could steady himself. The redhead took a towel and wrapped it around the boy. Shinji was grateful to finally be out of that freezing cold bath.  
明日香走到无助的男孩身边，向他伸出手。帮助他站起来后，她把他移到墙边，让他可以稳住自己。红发女孩拿起一条毛巾，裹在男孩身上。真嗣感激终于能从那冰冷刺骨的浴缸中解脱出来。

"I'll help you to your room, then you should dry yourself. We don't want water dripping everywhere" the girl directed.  
"我帮你回房间，然后你得把自己弄干。我们可不想水滴得到处都是。" 女孩指示道。

"Ok" he said, nodding. "好的" 他点头说。

"You know this is all your fault" she declared.  
"你知道这都是你的错" 她宣称。

"Yeah, I know" he assented.  
“是啊，我知道。”他同意道。

"Next time just get Misato to pick you up" she advised.  
“下次直接让美里来接你就行了。”她建议道。

"But I enjoy your company Asuka" Shinji replied, smiling.  
“但我喜欢和你在一起，明日香。”真嗣笑着回答。

"You're gonna enjoy some brain damage in a second" she threatened.  
"你马上就要体验到脑损伤的乐趣了"她威胁道。

The two eva pilots made their way to Shinji's room. Asuka found it slightly uncomfortable as he was soaking her clothes because he was wet. The occasional droplet would drip off his hair and onto her shoulder or face. Arriving at his room, the girl opened the door and placed Shinji down on his bed where he sat up and begun to dry himself with his towel.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员走向真嗣的房间。明日香感到有些不自在，因为他湿漉漉的身体浸湿了她的衣服。偶尔会有水滴从他的头发上滴落到她的肩膀或脸上。到达他的房间后，女孩打开门，将真嗣放在床上，他坐起身来，开始用毛巾擦干自己。

"Do I get a kiss to make me feel better?" Shinji asked jokingly.  
"我能不能得到一个吻来让我感觉好些？"真嗣开玩笑地问道。

The redhead smiled seductively as she moved next to Shinji and brought her face mere inches from his. Shinji looked a little surprised as she began to close the distance between their lips. As they were about to touch, Shinji pulled away. A frown formed on the redhead's face but she quickly masked it with a scowl.  
红发女孩魅惑地微笑着，移步到真嗣身边，将脸凑到离他仅几英寸的地方。真嗣看起来有些惊讶，当她开始缩短两人唇间的距离时，他退缩了。红发女孩的脸上闪过一丝不悦，但很快被怒容所掩盖。

"Asuka I was joking, I'm with Aria remember" the boy stated.  
“明日香，我开玩笑的，我和亚莉亚在一起，记得吗？”男孩说道。

"Yeah, she's so great isn't she? Good boy Shinji would never betray her" she replied sarcastically, "But whatever, I wasn't trying to kiss you. I was just testing your loyalty and to see if you would take advantage of a girl"  
“是啊，她那么棒，对吧？好孩子真嗣绝不会背叛她。”她讽刺地回答，“不过无所谓，我并不是真的想吻你。我只是想测试你的忠诚，看看你是否会占女孩子的便宜。”

"Did I pass?" he asked.  
“我通过了吗？”他问道。

"Yeah, one hundred percent" she muttered, leaving the room.  
“嗯，百分之百。”她咕哝着，离开了房间。

Shinji pondered Asuka's unusual behaviour today and wondered if it had anything to do with Aria. Then he smiled upon realising what was happening. _'This could work out'_ he thought. The boy continued drying himself when he heard the front door open.  
真嗣思考着明日香今天不同寻常的行为，想知道这是否与亚里亚有关。随后他意识到发生了什么，便微笑起来。‘这可能会顺利进行’他想。男孩继续擦干自己，这时他听到前门打开了。

"I'm home!" Misato called out.  
"我回来了！" 美里大声喊道。

"About time!" Asuka called back.  
"终于来了！" 明日香回应道。

The redhead made her way to the front door to see Misato and Ritsuko entering their residence. Misato closed their door and turned to greet the young girl.  
红发少女走向前门，看到美里和律子进入他们的住所。美里关上门，转身向年轻女孩打招呼。

"Hey Asuka, how you doing? Have you been crying over Shinji?" Misato asked, noticing the moisture on her face.  
"嘿，明日香，你还好吗？又在为真嗣哭鼻子了？" 美里问道，注意到她脸上的泪痕。

"What? Why would I be crying over _him_?" Asuka retorted immediately.  
"什么？我为什么要为他哭？" 明日香立刻反驳道。

"Then why have you got tears on your face?" Ritsuko asked.  
"那你脸上的泪水是怎么回事？" 律子问道。

"I don't! Shinji was just dripping water all over me when I carried him out of the bath" the redhead refuted.  
"我没有！我只是把真嗣从浴室里抱出来时，他身上的水滴到我脸上了。" 红发女孩辩解道。

"You don't have to be ashamed Asuka" Misato teased.  
"你不必感到羞愧，明日香。" 美里打趣道。

"You can't even let up when I was assisting that helpless retard while he's sick!" Asuka shouted at Misato.  
"我帮那个无助的傻瓜时，你都不能放松一下！" 明日香对美里喊道。

"Look, I've come to see Shinji. Can you argue another time?" Ritsuko interjected, trying to stop the two girls from fighting.  
"听着，我是来看真嗣的。你们能换个时间再吵吗？" 律子插话道，试图阻止两个女孩争吵。

"Fine" they both replied.  
"好的" 他们俩同时回答道。

"Now, how is he at the moment?" the doctor asked.  
"那么，他现在情况如何？" 医生问道。

"He seems better now to me, though I think he's still a bit dizzy" Asuka answered.  
"我觉得他现在看起来好些了，不过我认为他还有点晕" 明日香回答道。

"When did his symptoms start?" Ritsuko inquired.  
“他的症状是什么时候开始的？” 律子询问道。

"Probably this morning? He was acting strange and he was a bit out of it. After we got to school, he seemed fine again only for it to come back after midday. Then he passed out as we were walking home and his temperature was through the roof so I threw him into the bathtub full of cold water" the redhead detailed.  
“大概是从今天早上开始的？他表现得有些奇怪，精神状态也不太好。到了学校后，他似乎恢复正常了，但中午过后又变得不对劲。然后在我们回家的路上，他就晕倒了，体温高得吓人，所以我赶紧把他扔进了装满冷水的浴缸里。” 红发女孩详细叙述道。

"You really do act fast Asuka" the doctor praised. "Let me go check on him and we'll see what we can do for him. Where is he?"  
“你反应真快，明日香。” 医生称赞道，“让我去看看他，我们再决定怎么帮他。他在哪儿？”

"He's in his room, just follow me" Asuka directed.  
"他在自己房间里，跟我来。" 明日香指引道。

Misato sat down on the couch in the living room, deciding to have a break from her work at NERV and to give Ritsuko some space while she examined the boy. The redhead walked off to Shinji's room with the blonde doctor following closely behind. Asuka opened the door to his room and held her arm out.  
美里坐在客厅的沙发上，决定暂时放下 NERV 的工作，给律子一些空间来检查那个男孩。红发女孩走向真嗣的房间，金发的医生紧随其后。明日香打开房门，伸出手臂。

"Shinji Ikari, baka extraordinaire, is ready to receive examination" the young girl announced.  
"真嗣·碇，超级大笨蛋，准备接受检查吧" 少女宣布道。

Ritsuko just shook her head as she went inside to check on the sick eva pilot. The redhead waited outside to eavesdrop as she was curious about Shinji's condition. Ritsuko took out her equipment and began to do a few tests on Shinji to determine his illness. The boy had a slight temperature and other than the dizziness he described, the doctor could not find anything else wrong, making her unable to work out what the problem could be.  
律子只是摇了摇头，走进去检查那位生病的 EVA 驾驶员。红发女孩在外面等着偷听，因为她对真嗣的状况感到好奇。律子拿出她的设备，开始对真嗣进行几项测试以确定他的病情。男孩有些低烧，除了他描述的头晕之外，医生没有发现其他问题，这让她无法弄清楚问题所在。

"Damn, my hand's hurting again" Shinji said aloud as he flexed his palm.  
“该死，我的手又疼了。”真嗣大声说道，同时弯曲着他的手掌。

"Your hand… wait a second don't tell me…" Ritsuko said, trailing off.  
“你的手……等等，别告诉我……”律子说着，话音渐渐低了下去。

The one thing the doctor had missed was the boy's injured hand; she hadn't bothered to check it as she had forgotten about it.  
医生唯一疏忽的是男孩受伤的手；她没有费心去检查，因为她已经忘记了这件事。

"Show me your hand Shinji" the older woman requested.  
“给我看看你的手，真嗣。”那位年长的女士请求道。

Shinji presented the doctor his injured hand and she unwrapped his bandages, before examining his wound. She let out a gasp of shock, causing Shinji to grow worried.  
真嗣向医生展示了他受伤的手，她解开绷带，仔细检查伤口。她惊讶地倒吸一口气，这让真嗣感到担忧。

"What's wrong Ritsuko?" Shinji asked, nervous.  
"怎么了，律子？" 真嗣紧张地问。

"I'm sorry Shinji, you have an STD" she said with a serious face.  
"对不起，真嗣，你得了性传播疾病。" 她严肃地说。

"WHAT!" Shinji cried out.  
"什么！" 真嗣惊呼道。

A loud crash was heard as the two observed a certain redhead rolling on the floor with laughter. Asuka stood up and wiped the tears from her eyes.  
一声巨响传来，两人看到某个红发女孩在地上笑得打滚。明日香站起身，擦去眼角的泪水。

"Oh come off it, as if Shinji would _ever_ get laid" Asuka said, smirking.  
“哦，得了吧，好像真嗣会有那种艳遇似的。”明日香说着，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。

"Ritsuko, don't scare me like that" Shinji said, relieved that it was just a joke.  
“律子，别这样吓我。”真嗣松了口气，原来只是个玩笑。

"What, are you that dense Shinji? You can't contract an STD unless you have sex with someone, you should have known she was joking immediately" Asuka remarked.  
"什么，你真有那么迟钝吗，真嗣？除非和别人发生关系，否则是不会染上性传播疾病的，你应该立刻就知道她在开玩笑。" 明日香评论道。

Shinji sat there like a deer in headlights; he had finally been caught out by Asuka for the first time.  
真嗣坐在那里，像一只被车灯照到的鹿；他终于第一次被明日香逮个正着。

"Ah well, what's to expect from a baka like you anyway" the young girl finished, before walking off still chuckling.  
"啊，好吧，像你这样的笨蛋还能指望什么呢" 少女说完，一边笑着一边走开了。

When they were both sure she was out of hearing range, they both sighed in relief. That was the closest Asuka had come to discovering their past sexual relationship. Shinji found it ironic that when he had actually let something slip, she hadn't realised it.  
当他们俩都确定她已经听不见时，他们都松了一口气。那是明日香最接近发现他们过去性关系的一次。真嗣觉得讽刺的是，当他真的不小心说漏嘴时，她却没意识到。

"That was too close Ritsuko, I thought for sure she had worked out that I had sex. Although it's funny, she's been trying very hard to get information out of me and I let it slip when she used no effort at all" Shinji commented.  
“太险了，律子，我以为她肯定猜到我和她有过性关系。不过说来好笑，她一直费尽心思从我这儿套话，我却在她毫无努力的情况下说漏了嘴。”真嗣评论道。

"We'll just consider ourselves lucky then" Ritsuko started, "But back to your diagnosis. Your hand has obvious signs of infection; you haven't been cleaning your wound properly. Shinji you must not neglect this, sometimes you don't even realise when you get an infection and it could get quite serious before you notice. Anyways, it's definitely a bacterial infection so I'll prescribe some antibiotics for you. It doesn't look contagious, but you should stay home anyway and get some rest"  
“那我们就庆幸一下吧。”律子开始说，“不过回到你的诊断上来。你的手明显有感染迹象；你没有好好清洁伤口。真嗣，你不能忽视这一点，有时候你甚至意识不到自己感染了，等到发现可能已经相当严重。总之，这肯定是细菌感染，我会给你开些抗生素。看起来不具传染性，但你还是应该待在家里休息。”

"But I need to go somewhere tomorrow" Shinji replied.  
"但明天我需要去某个地方" 真嗣回答道。

"If you really must go, please make sure you take care of yourself and don't exert yourself" the doctor advised.  
"如果你真的必须去，请务必照顾好自己，不要过度劳累" 医生建议道。

"Sure thing" he agreed. "当然" 他同意道。

"One more thing… something happened at NERV" Ritsuko recalled.  
“还有一件事……NERV 发生了一些事情。” 赤木律子回忆道。

"What happened?" he asked.  
“发生了什么？” 他问道。

"We momentarily detected an AT-field this morning. It was too small and too short to determine where, but we know it was in Tokyo-3. Did you happen to notice anything at all?" the doctor explained.  
“今天早上我们短暂地检测到了一个 AT 力场。它太小太短暂，无法确定具体位置，但我们知道它在第三新东京市。你有没有注意到任何异常？” 医生解释道。

"Nope" he answered. "不" 他回答道。

"I guess it was possibly a glitch then, the Magi did report a five percent chance of error and so it probably was" Ritsuko remarked. "In any case, I'll be heading off now. Make sure you take care of yourself, take it easy"  
"我想那可能是个故障，Magi 确实报告了百分之五的错误几率，所以很可能就是那样" 律子评论道。"无论如何，我现在要走了。你要照顾好自己，放松点"

"Thanks Ritsuko, see ya" Shinji replied.  
"谢谢律子，再见" 真嗣回答道。

At this, the doctor left the room and Shinji began to change into some clothes.  
听到这话，医生离开了房间，真嗣开始换上衣服。

Ritsuko walked over to Misato sitting on the couch who stood up as she approached. "Let's drive back to NERV Misato, I've already checked Shinji out and he should be alright" she explained.  
律子走向坐在沙发上的美里，她走近时美里站了起来。“我们开车回 NERV 吧，美里，我已经帮真嗣办好出院手续了，他应该没事了。”她解释道。

"What was wrong with him?" the Major inquired.  
“他怎么了？”美里少校询问道。

"His hand got infected, I'll get him some antibiotics and he'll recover without issue" Ritsuko answered.  
"他的手感染了，我给他拿些抗生素，他就能顺利康复" 律子回答道。

"Alright, good to hear" Misato said, sounding grateful. "Before we leave, let me say goodbye to Shinji first"  
"好的，听到这个消息真好" 美里说道，听起来很感激。"在我们离开之前，让我先和真嗣道个别"

"No problem" the doctor replied.  
"没问题" 医生回答道。

The purple haired woman walked over to Shinji's door and knocked. "Can I come in Shinji?"  
紫发女子走向真嗣的房门，敲了敲。“我可以进来吗，真嗣？”

"Yes!" the boy answered. “当然！”男孩回答道。

At this, the Major opened his door and saw Shinji sitting up on his bed already changed into some clothes. "Hey Shinji, sorry I won't be able to stay and chat, I need to go back to work. I also heard the details from Ritsuko, it's good to know you'll be recovering without much problems. I just wanted to say hi and bye" she declared.  
听到这话，美里少校打开门，看到真嗣已经换好衣服坐在床上。“嘿，真嗣，抱歉我不能留下来聊天，我得回去工作了。我也从律子那里听说了细节，知道你会顺利康复真是太好了。我只是想打个招呼，再见。”她宣布道。

"Thanks Misato! I feel better at the moment as well, I'll come see you out" the boy replied, standing up.  
"谢谢美里！我现在感觉好多了，我送你出去。" 男孩回答着，站起身来。

"You don't have to" Misato responded.  
"你不用送的" 美里回应道。

"I want to!" Shinji professed, exiting his room and standing next to his guardian.  
"我想送！" 真嗣坚定地说，走出房间站在他的监护人旁边。

At this, the Major gave the boy a quick hug. "Thanks Shinji"  
听到这话，少校迅速拥抱了男孩一下。“谢谢你，真嗣。”

Misato then turned around and head back to Ritsuko to exit the apartment. Hearing the commotion, the redhead also got out of her room to see her guardian off.  
美里随后转身，朝律子走去，准备离开公寓。听到骚动，红发女孩也从房间里出来，目送她的监护人离开。

"Ok, let's go Ritsuko" Misato told the doctor.  
“好了，我们走吧，律子。”美里对医生说道。

Ritsuko stood up and Misato turned back to face her two wards. "Goodbye you two, I have to go back to NERV. I'll try not to come back too late, but no promises. And Asuka, make sure Shinji's ok while I'm gone!" Misato requested.  
律子站起身，美里转回来面对她的两个监护对象。“再见，你们俩，我得回 NERV 了。我会尽量不回来得太晚，但不保证。还有，明日香，我不在的时候确保真嗣没事！”美里请求道。

"Whatever" Asuka said in response.  
“随便啦”明日香回应道。

"Goodbye Misato" Shinji said, waving.  
“再见，美里”真嗣挥手道。

"Goodbye Misato" the redhead added.  
“再见，美里。”红发女子补充道。

"Goodbye" the Major finished. The two adults then left the residence, leaving the two teens alone.  
“再见。”少校说完，两位成年人便离开了住所，留下两个青少年独自相处。

Rei was leaving school when someone approached her.  
绫波在离开学校时，有人向她走来。

"You're the first child aren't you, Rei Ayanami?" the person asked.  
"你是第一个孩子，对吧，绫波零？" 那人问道。

Rei looked at the person, unable to recognise them.  
绫波看着那人，无法认出他们。

"You're the same as I am" the person continued.  
"你和我是一样的" 那人继续说道。

"Who are you?" Rei asked.  
“你是谁？”丽问道。

The person just smiled. 那人只是微笑着。

---

Back at Misato's apartment, Asuka didn't end up hearing what was wrong with Shinji and so decided to ask him. The redhead turned to face him before speaking up. "So, what did you do this time baka?"  
回到美里公寓后，明日香最终没能听到真嗣出了什么问题，于是决定直接问他。红发少女转过身面对他，开口道：“所以，这次你又做了什么蠢事，笨蛋？”

"My hand got infected" he answered.  
"我的手感染了" 他回答道。

"You're kidding me? You are so stupid sometimes" she remarked.  
"你在开玩笑吧？你有时候真是蠢得可以" 她评论道。

"Well, I learn from the best" he retorted, sticking his tongue out at her.  
"好吧，我是跟高手学的" 他反驳道，朝她吐了吐舌头。

"Yeah, I'll bet Touji gives you private tutoring for it" she countered.  
"是啊，我打赌东治会私下给你辅导的" 她反驳道。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling at her response.  
真嗣忍不住被她的回答逗笑了。

"You going to stay home tomorrow?" she asked.  
"你明天会待在家里吗？" 她问道。

"Most likely, but I don't want to miss my date so I'll only stay home to skip school" he replied.  
"很有可能，但我不想错过我的约会，所以我会待在家里逃学" 他回答道。

"You lazy bum, you just want to get out of school" Asuka joked.  
"你这个懒鬼，你就是想逃课" 明日香开玩笑说。

"Excuse me! You don't remember, but these past few months have been so boring at school. I'd use any excuse to get days off" the boy remarked.  
"对不起！你不记得了，但这几个月学校里实在太无聊了。我会找任何借口请假" 男孩说道。

"So, did Ritsuko say anything else to you?" the girl asked curiously.  
"那么，赤木博士还跟你说了些什么吗？" 女孩好奇地问道。

"Not really, she just mentioned a glitch where the Magi reported detecting an AT-field for a short amount of time in Tokyo-3" he mentioned.  
"其实也没什么，她只是提到了一个故障，MAGI 系统在东京-3 短暂检测到了 AT 力场的存在" 他提及道。

"How random" she commented.  
"真奇怪" 她评论道。

"In any case… thanks for taking care of me today Asuka" Shinji thanked. "I still feel bad about what happened with you today, and I only added to your strife by ignoring you at the start"  
"无论如何……谢谢你今天照顾我，明日香。" 真嗣感谢道。"今天发生的事我还是觉得很抱歉，而且一开始我还忽视了你，让你更加烦恼了。"

"So you should! But I'm over it already" she replied. "And no worries, you were sick after all. I'm not useless like that birdbrained girl of yours"  
"你确实应该道歉！不过我已经不在意了。" 她回答。"别担心，毕竟你当时生病了。我可不像你那个笨蛋女孩那么没用。"

"Hey! Don't say that about her" Shinji refuted.  
"嘿！别这么说她。" 真嗣反驳道。

"I can say what I want. Speaking of which, I find this whole situation strange. I got punched by your idiot friend about this after all, weren't you supposed to like _me?_" the girl said aloud, unable to contain the burning question.  
"我可以随心所欲地说我想说的。说到这个，我觉得整个情况很奇怪。毕竟，你的那个蠢朋友因为这事打了我，你不是应该喜欢我吗？" 女孩大声说道，无法抑制那燃烧的问题。

'_How can she ask that so directly?'_ the boy wondered. "How can you ask that? What am I supposed to say to that? You've clearly shown your feelings on that aspect"  
'她怎么能这么直接地问呢？' 男孩心想。 "你怎么能这么问？我该怎么回答？你显然已经表明了你对那方面的感受"

"Meh, I didn't realise your feelings were so shallow. A new girl comes along offered on a silver platter and you immediately jump ship, seems I was quite justified after all" Asuka retorted nastily.  
"哼，我没想到你的感情这么浅薄。一个新女孩出现，像银盘上的礼物一样奉上，你就立刻跳槽了，看来我终究是有道理的" 明日香尖刻地反驳道。

'_God damn why does she have to be so difficult?'_ he thought angrily. _'Who am I kidding though, she has a point. There's no use getting upset over this… it's_ _**because**_ _of her I need to do this'_  
“该死的，她为什么总是这么难搞？”他气愤地想。“不过说真的，她说的有道理。为这事生气也没用……正是因为她，我才需要这么做。”

"It's a wonder you expected something else to occur with comments like that" Shinji countered.  
“你那样说，还能指望发生什么别的事呢？”真嗣反驳道。

At his remark, the redhead stayed silent. The silence soon became awkward as neither could think of anything more to say. They continued to stare blankly at each other until Asuka's stomach grumbled loudly, making her blush slightly.  
听了他的话，红发女孩沉默了。不久，沉默变得尴尬起来，两人都想不出更多的话可说。他们继续茫然地对视着，直到明日香的肚子咕噜作响，让她微微脸红。

"You haven't made dinner yet Shinji" Asuka announced, thankful for the broken silence.  
"你还没做晚饭呢，真嗣。" 明日香宣布道，庆幸打破了沉默。

"But I'm sick" the boy refuted.  
"但我生病了。" 男孩反驳道。

"The fuck I care. I am _not_ making it this time" Asuka replied stubbornly.  
"我才不在乎。这次我不会做的。" 明日香固执地回答。

"Ok Asuka, I'll make dinner" he conceded.  
“好的，明日香，我来做饭。”他妥协道。

Shinji got up and found he was able to walk without help again. He moved past the girl and made his way to the kitchen to begin preparing dinner. Asuka instead, went off to her room while she waited for the food to be ready. The redhead opened her drawer to take out some pencils and caught sight of Shinji's ring. Her face saddened slightly as she looked at the object in disgust. _'This type of ring could only be for an engagement, I don't understand why he has this. Oh, why do I even care. Clearly that boy doesn't concern me… his feelings were so fleeting after all'_ she thought, feeling a little frustrated. Why couldn't she shake the feeling that there was something off? Why couldn't she stop thinking about that idiot roommate of hers?  
真嗣起身发现自己又能独立行走了。他绕过女孩，走向厨房开始准备晚餐。明日香则回到自己的房间，等待食物准备好。红发少女打开抽屉取出几支铅笔，却瞥见了真嗣的戒指。她看着那枚戒指，脸上掠过一丝悲伤，带着厌恶之情。‘这种戒指只能是订婚戒指，我不明白他为什么会有这个。哦，我为什么还要在乎。显然那个男孩与我无关……毕竟他的感情总是那么短暂’她心想，感到有些沮丧。为什么她就是摆脱不了那种不对劲的感觉？为什么她就是无法停止想念那个愚蠢的室友？

"Dinner's ready!" Shinji shouted, bringing the girl out of her thoughts.  
“晚饭好了！”真嗣喊道，将女孩从思绪中拉回。

Asuka placed the ring back in her drawer and exited her room. When she arrived at the dining table, Shinji was already sitting down waiting patiently for her to appear. The redhead sat down at the table and ate her meal in silence. Shinji sensed a drop in her mood but chose not to pursue it, today had been stressful for the both of them after all and he was exhausted. And so, the two finished their meals, placed their dishes in the sink and went off to their rooms without saying another word to the other.  
明日香将戒指放回抽屉，离开了房间。当她到达餐桌时，真嗣已经坐在那里，耐心地等待她的出现。红发少女默默地坐下用餐。真嗣察觉到她的情绪低落，但选择不去追问，毕竟今天对他们两人来说都很紧张，他自己也疲惫不堪。于是，两人默默吃完饭，把餐具放进水槽，各自回房，没有再对彼此说一句话。

Shinji was very tired, after all he was sick, and as he lay down on his bed his eyes felt heavy. He went off to sleep without another thought.  
真嗣非常疲惫，毕竟他生病了，当他躺在床上时，眼皮感到沉重。他没再多想，便沉沉睡去。

---

Late at night, Misato came back to the apartment to find both teens fast asleep. She sighed, a little depressed as she had wanted to talk to her two wards, having missed the opportunity when she came over with Ritsuko. However, the Major was satisfied enough with seeing Shinji sleeping peacefully in his room. What bothered her was when she checked on Asuka; she was thrashing about as she had a nightmare. Misato knew that Asuka hadn't had nightmares for quite a while now and was disconcerted to see they had returned. _'I don't know what to do anymore, this situation is so complicated… and work is so busy… I'm always on edge, the last angel could attack at any moment'_ she thought wearily. The Major then switched off the lights and went to bed herself.  
深夜时分，美里回到公寓，发现两个少年已经熟睡。她叹了口气，有些沮丧，因为她本想和她的两个监护对象谈谈，之前和律子一起来时错过了机会。然而，看到真嗣在房间里安稳地睡着，美里感到些许满足。让她困扰的是，当她查看明日香时，发现她在噩梦中挣扎。美里知道明日香已经有一段时间没有做噩梦了，看到它们再次出现让她感到不安。'我不知道该怎么办了，这种情况太复杂了……而且工作又那么忙……我总是处于紧张状态，最后一个使徒随时可能发动攻击'，她疲惫地想着。美里随后关掉灯，自己也去睡觉了。

End Notes: I personally liked the beginning of this chapter, with previous chapters having had Asuka remembering something as she woke up and the title of this chapter, you straight away think 'OMG she's remembering their relationship!' Hehe I'm evil :D.  
尾注：我个人很喜欢这一章的开头，之前的章节中明日香醒来时总会回忆起一些事情，而这个章节的标题，你立刻会想'天哪，她想起了他们的关系！'呵呵，我真坏 :D。

I originally had a short rant about people asking what's going to happen next etc, those notes are largely irrelevant now as the story is finished. Besides, readers are entitled to their opinions and questions :D. Sorry if I ruffled anyone's feathers unnecessarily.  
我原本打算发一通牢骚，抱怨人们总是追问接下来会发生什么之类的，但现在这些笔记大多无关紧要了，因为故事已经完结。此外，读者有权持有自己的观点和疑问。如果我无意中冒犯了谁，在此表示歉意。

Author's Notes: This chapter has very little dialogue, it is mostly self-reflection. Enjoy the chapter :D, it's a much shorter one than the previous two.  
作者的话：这一章对话极少，主要是内心独白。尽情享受这一章吧 :D，它比前两章短得多。

Original Notes: 作者笔记：

_Yay 16th chapter done and quite quickly too. Would have been posted sooner only I had some problem with Microsoft Word. While typing the chapter the mouse would move on its own, scroll to the top of the document and Word would freeze. After a while I would get the message 'Microsoft Word has caused a fatal error etc.' I did some spyware and virus scans but nothing came up. Have no idea what it was, but it was really annoying as I had to rewrite some parts as I wasn't able to save.  
耶，第 16 章完成了，而且相当快。本可以更早发布，只是遇到了一些微软 Word 的问题。在打字过程中，鼠标会自行移动，滚动到文档顶部，然后 Word 就会冻结。过了一会儿，我会收到‘微软 Word 引发了一个致命错误’之类的消息。我进行了间谍软件和病毒扫描，但什么也没发现。不知道是什么原因，但真的很烦人，因为我不得不重写一些部分，因为我无法保存。_

_I have to celebrate though, I now have over 100 reviews, woohoo. That's something special I just know it :D. Well thanks to all my loyal readers for sticking with me and posting your comments, it's been wonderful.  
不过我得庆祝一下，我现在有超过 100 条评论了，哇呼。这绝对是特别的，我深信不疑 :D。非常感谢所有忠实读者一直陪伴我，发表你们的评论，真是太棒了。_

I had also answered some questions to some reviewers which are no longer really relevant.  
我也回答了一些评论者的问题，但那些内容现在已不再相关。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 16 (First rewrite - though it's practically the same as the first version).  
说明一下，这是重写的第 16 章（首次重写——虽然实际上与初版几乎相同）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 16: I Love Shinji  
第 16 章：我爱真嗣

"Status report on the pilots" the woman announced.  
“驾驶员状态报告。”女子宣布道。

"Go ahead" the Commander replied.  
“请讲。”指挥官回应。

"First child, Ayanami Rei. She is in perfect health. Her eva Unit 00 is undamaged, as it did not participate in the last angel battle. Latest sync ratio 65. Second child, Sohryu Asuka Langley. She has no physical problems, however her current state of mind is not stable. Her eva Unit 02 has been 80 percent repaired since the last battle. Latest sync ratio 69. Third child, Ikari Shinji. He recently had a bacterial infection but otherwise perfectly healthy. His eva Unit 01 has been fully repaired since the last battle. Latest sync ratio 85. Fourth child, Suzuhara Touji. He is in perfect health. His eva Unit 03 has been fully repaired and all angel contaminants removed. Latest sync ratio unknown as he has resigned from piloting, however it is believed he would achieve a sync ratio of 40" she reported.  
“第一适格者，绫波零。她身体状况良好。EVA 初号机未参与上次使徒战斗，因此完好无损。最新同步率 65。第二适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。她身体无恙，但心理状态不稳定。EVA 二号机自上次战斗后已修复 80%。最新同步率 69。第三适格者，碇真嗣。他最近患了细菌感染，除此之外健康状况良好。EVA 初号机自上次战斗后已完全修复。最新同步率 85。第四适格者，铃原东治。他身体状况良好。EVA 三号机已完全修复，所有使徒污染已清除。最新同步率未知，因为他已辞去驾驶员职务，但据信他能达到 40 的同步率。”她报告道。

"Very well Ritsuko, it is just as I had expected. Dismissed" the Commander declared.  
“很好，律子，正如我所料。解散。”指挥官宣布道。

"Yes sir" the doctor affirmed.  
“是，长官。”医生肯定道。

The past few days had left the redhead feeling miserable. Ever since Shinji had come back from his first date with Aria on Wednesday, she felt gloomy. The boy had excitedly given her all the details of their date, leaving Asuka feeling resentful. He had looked so happy and one pervading thought kept repeating itself in her head, "How could I lose to her?" The second child refused to believe she had feelings for the third child, but there was a part of her that knew it was true.  
过去的几天让红发女孩感到痛苦不堪。自从周三真嗣和亚里亚第一次约会回来后，她就一直心情阴郁。男孩兴奋地向她详细描述了约会的所有细节，这让明日香感到愤恨。他看起来那么开心，一个挥之不去的念头在她脑海中反复出现，“我怎么会输给她？”第二适格者拒绝承认自己对第三适格者有感情，但内心深处有一部分她知道这是真的。

The third child, he had been growing distant from her ever since he became Aria's boyfriend. The boy wouldn't pay as much attention to her or have as many conversations with her; it was almost as if he was ignoring her. The girl readily admitted that she missed having his attention, missed talking to him and even missed his small signs of affection towards her. The male eva pilot would still do what the redhead asked of him, but even then, he didn't fight her and she had enjoyed the trivial arguments they had. He had become the old Shinji, nice and obedient.  
作为第三个孩子，自从他成为 Aria 的男朋友后，他就逐渐与她疏远了。这个男孩不再像以前那样关注她，与她交谈的次数也少了；他几乎像是在忽视她。女孩坦然承认，她怀念他的关注，怀念与他交谈，甚至怀念他对她的小小示好。这位男性 EVA 驾驶员仍然会按照红发女孩的要求去做，但即便如此，他也不再与她争执，而她曾经享受过他们之间那些琐碎的争论。他变得像过去的真嗣，善良且顺从。

This pissed Asuka off even more; with all the work she presumably went through to give Shinji some backbone, Aria comes along and snatches him receiving all the benefits without doing anything. The female eva pilot couldn't understand how Shinji himself could go along with that girl; she just seemed so fake. Asuka wanted to strangle her every time she saw her, using that stupid sweet voice of hers and smiling like an idiot to the boy.  
这让明日香更加恼火；她费尽心思让真嗣变得有主见，结果 Aria 一来就把他抢走了，什么都没做就享受了所有好处。这位女性 EVA 驾驶员无法理解真嗣怎么会接受那个女孩；她看起来太假了。每次看到她，明日香都想掐死她，用她那愚蠢的甜美声音对男孩傻笑。

To make matters worse, her sync ratio had fallen dramatically. So much so she was almost as low as Rei. Nothing was happening to her that she could blame the bad results on, not even a period. She was forced to admit that Shinji and Aria dating made her feel sick; it was a strange feeling. She hated the other redhead. First off, she had taken the object of her amusement from her and second, she was making her sync ratio bad. But Asuka hated herself even more, to be so weak that she was losing herself like this to such a small slip of a girl.  
更糟糕的是，她的同步率急剧下降，几乎跌到了与丽相当的低谷。没有任何事情可以让她归咎于这些糟糕的结果，甚至连生理期都没有。她不得不承认，真嗣和亚里沙的约会让她感到恶心；这是一种奇怪的感觉。她讨厌那个红发女孩。首先，她夺走了她的娱乐对象，其次，她让自己的同步率变差。但阿斯卡更恨自己，竟然如此软弱，以至于被这样一个小丫头搞得迷失自我。

At school, Hikari had taken quite an interest in Touji ever since he asked her out on a date. Thus, Asuka was left alone most of the time, she had no one to turn to or talk to; not that she would have even shared her troubles anyway, but it made her feel discarded. Asuka couldn't even speak to Misato as she was always either working at NERV or off at Kaji's, only sometimes coming home late at night to sleep and eat. She was so sick and tired of everyone abandoning her, first her mother, then Kaji, Shinji, Hikari and Misato. Was she such a horrible person that no one could stand her?  
在学校，自从托基向光表白后，光对托基产生了浓厚的兴趣。因此，阿斯卡大部分时间都是独自一人，她无人可倾诉，无人可交谈；尽管她本就不会分享自己的烦恼，但这让她感到被抛弃。阿斯卡甚至无法与美里交谈，因为美里总是要么在 NERV 工作，要么在加持那里，偶尔深夜回家睡觉和吃饭。她对每个人都抛弃她感到厌倦和疲惫，先是母亲，然后是加持、真嗣、光和美里。她难道真的是个如此糟糕的人，以至于没人能忍受她吗？

Her feelings of abandonment intensified during the night when she suffered her nightmares. The girl would always have the same dream, first she would see her mother hanging from the ceiling, but the body would change into Shinji. Shinji would then smirk at her, telling her she was so pathetic for thinking that he would want her. Asuka hadn't had nightmares ever since she lost her memory, she didn't know why they had returned or why they had even disappeared in the first place. This only added to her misery, as she was always tired from being unable to sleep.  
每当夜晚被噩梦折磨时，她被抛弃的感觉愈发强烈。女孩总会做同一个梦，起初她看到母亲悬吊在天花板上，但身体却变成了真嗣。真嗣随后会对她冷笑，告诉她竟然以为他会想要她，真是太可悲了。自从失忆后，明日香再也没有做过噩梦，她不明白为什么这些梦会回来，也不明白它们最初为何消失。这只会增加她的痛苦，因为她总是因为无法入睡而疲惫不堪。

Asuka was staring up at her ceiling to pass time as she didn't want her thoughts to bring her to a nervous breakdown. She glanced at her clock and noticed that it was finally time to get up. Not wanting to spend another hour staring up at her ceiling, she got off her bed. The girl looked awful; her once vibrant red hair was quite dull and frizzled and she had dark circles under her eyes. Asuka went over to her door and opened it. As she exited her room, she closed her door quietly so as not to wake anyone and sneaked quietly to the kitchen.  
明日香盯着天花板发呆，以免思绪让她陷入神经崩溃。她瞥了一眼时钟，发现终于到了起床的时间。不想再花一个小时盯着天花板，她从床上起身。女孩看起来糟透了；她曾经鲜亮的红色头发变得暗淡无光，乱糟糟的，眼圈也黑黑的。明日香走到门口，打开门。她轻轻地走出房间，关上门以免吵醒任何人，然后悄悄地溜向厨房。

Upon arriving at the kitchen, the redhead opened the fridge and scrounged through looking for something edible. She didn't really care what to eat; she just wanted something to take her mind off everything. Finally deciding on some instant noodles, the girl placed the container inside the microwave. After heating up the noodles, she sat down at the dining table and began to eat her meal. Her stomach felt strangely empty and it felt good to fill it up with some sustenance. The girl ate slowly, having no need to rush.  
一进厨房，红发女孩便打开冰箱，翻找着能吃的东西。她并不在意吃什么，只是想找点什么来转移注意力。最终决定吃些方便面，女孩将容器放入微波炉。加热好面条后，她坐在餐桌前开始用餐。胃里感觉异常空虚，填满些食物感觉很好。女孩慢慢吃着，无需匆忙。

The sun was already up this Saturday morning as its rays shone through the window. Asuka heard a sound and realised someone was coming. "Who's there?" she asked out loud.  
周六的早晨，阳光已经透过窗户洒了进来。明日香听到声响，意识到有人来了。“谁在那儿？”她大声问道。

She highly doubted it was Misato, so she wasn't surprised to hear Shinji's voice reply. "What are you doing up so early Asuka? Couldn't sleep?"  
她高度怀疑不是美里，所以听到真嗣的声音回答并不惊讶。“你这么早起来干嘛，明日香？睡不着吗？”

"Something like that" she answered.  
"差不多吧" 她回答道。

"I would have offered to make you breakfast, but I see that you're already eating" Shinji noted.  
"我本想给你做早餐的，但看来你已经在吃了" 真嗣注意到。

"Do whatever you want" she replied abruptly.  
"随你便" 她突然回答道。

"Ok Asuka…" he said timidly.  
“好的，明日香……”他怯生生地说道。

The boy had been somewhat puzzled by her behaviour the past few days, but thought maybe she was just passing through a phase. The redhead seemed more aggressive than usual and would be angered by the smallest of things. He thought it was best to just try to avoid her, as he was sure he was the one that was pissing her off. Of course, he hadn't realised that the avoidance was what was making her angry. However, his worry and concern were still there; Shinji had noticed her drop in sync ratio and he was wondering if it was all a good idea after all. He silently prayed for the strength to continue on.  
男孩对过去几天她的行为感到有些困惑，但认为她可能只是在经历一个阶段。红发女孩似乎比平时更具攻击性，对最微小的事情都会发怒。他认为最好尽量避开她，因为他确信是自己惹她生气了。当然，他没意识到这种回避正是让她生气的原因。然而，他的担忧和关心依然存在；真嗣注意到她的同步率下降了，他开始怀疑这一切是否真的是个好主意。他默默祈祷着能有继续前进的力量。

He went on to prepare breakfast for himself, knowing Misato wouldn't be here as she had constantly been away either at NERV or at Kaji's, not that he could blame her; there was such much she had to take care of with the imminent angel attack and whatever would occur after. Shinji continued to think about what had happened these past few days. He hadn't gone to school on Wednesday but he had heard the news from Asuka that day that Touji had finally asked Hikari out. Shinji had asked Touji about it the following day and he had simply replied that he finally got the courage to ask her on a date after his friend had asked Aria out. Shinji was happy for them; it was so obvious they liked each other and he was thinking it was about time they became a couple.  
他继续为自己准备早餐，心里清楚美里不会在这里，因为她一直不是在 NERV 就是在加持那里，这倒不是说他能怪她；即将到来的使徒袭击以及之后可能发生的一切，她有太多需要处理的事情。真嗣继续思考着过去几天发生的事情。他周三没去上学，但那天从明日香那里听到了消息，说是铃原终于向光表白了。第二天真嗣问起铃原，他只是简单地回答说，在朋友向亚里沙表白后，他终于鼓起勇气约她出去。真嗣为他们感到高兴；他们彼此喜欢是如此明显，他觉得是时候他们成为一对了。

Soon the boy had finished making his breakfast, setting it down on the dining table and beginning to eat. He was a little surprised to see Asuka still there; she usually ate as fast as she could. Asuka herself was a little relieved it was Saturday as she wouldn't have to see Aria today and Shinji would stay home. Perhaps they could do something together, after all it would alleviate her boredom and she could have a decent conversation for once.  
不久，男孩完成了他的早餐，将其放在餐桌旁开始用餐。看到明日香还在那里，他有些惊讶；她通常吃得飞快。明日香自己也有点庆幸今天是周六，因为她不必见到绫波今天，真嗣也会待在家里。也许他们可以一起做些什么，毕竟这样可以缓解她的无聊，而且她终于可以有一次像样的对话了。

"What are your plans for today Ikari?" she decided to bring up.  
“今天你有什么计划吗，碇？”她决定提起这个话题。

Shinji looked up at the girl and couldn't help noticing she looked in complete disarray. Her hair was all messy as if it hadn't been washed for a few days and she had dark circles under her eyes as if she hadn't been sleeping lately.  
真嗣抬头看着女孩，不禁注意到她看起来完全是一团糟。她的头发乱糟糟的，好像几天没洗了，眼睛下面还有黑眼圈，似乎最近都没怎么睡觉。

"Why do you ask?" he replied.  
"你为什么问这个？" 他回答道。

"Can't I be curious? Maybe I might consider doing something with you, I'm bored as hell" she answered casually.  
"我就不能好奇一下吗？也许我会考虑和你一起做点什么，我无聊得要命" 她随意地回答。

"Well sorry, I won't be able to" he stated.  
"嗯，抱歉，我没法做到" 他声明道。

"Why in the world not?" Asuka snapped, betraying her true intentions.  
"为什么不行？" 明日香厉声反问，暴露了她的真实意图。

"Aria asked me to visit her house today, I'm going to leave for her place early as her house isn't close" he explained.  
"Aria 今天邀请我去她家，她家离这儿不近，所以我打算早点出发。" 他解释道。

"What! _Her_ again?" she shot back angrily, unable to hide her frustration.  
"什么！又是她？" 她愤怒地回击，无法掩饰自己的沮丧。

"Is there a problem?" he asked, slightly taken aback.  
"有什么问题吗？" 他问道，略感意外。

"Can't you give her a rest?! You saw her _every_ day at school, what am I supposed to do at home alone?" she shouted.  
"你就不能让她休息一下吗？！你在学校每天都见到她，我在家里一个人怎么办？" 她喊道。

"I can't go back on my word, I said I would go" Shinji retorted.  
"我不能食言，我说过我会去的。" 真嗣反驳道。

"I do not give you permission to go!" the redhead refuted.  
"我不允许你去！"红发女孩反驳道。

"Asuka stop behaving so silly, you are not my guardian either" Shinji replied, slightly amused at her behaviour.  
"明日香，别这么孩子气了，你也不是我的监护人啊" 真嗣回答，对她这种行为感到有些好笑。

"When Misato leaves the Katsuragi household, the province of Sohryu begins and I rule autocratically" she declared.  
"当美里离开片桐家，绫波省便由我独裁统治" 她宣称道。

Shinji couldn't help laughing; did she really want him to stay that much? "The Province of Sohryu is now currently under civil war with the Ikari rebels"  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来；她真的那么希望他留下吗？“现在，龙宫省正处于与碇叛军的内战之中。”

"Then I declare martial law!" Asuka retorted.  
“那我就宣布戒严！”明日香反驳道。

"Look Asuka I pretty much have to go now, I really don't have time for this. Is there something you want to tell me before I have to go?" he asked.  
“听着，明日香，我现在真的得走了，实在没时间了。我走之前，你有什么想对我说的吗？”他问道。

"It seems like you never have time" the redhead snapped, banging her fist angrily on the table.  
"你总是没时间似的" 红发女孩厉声说道，愤怒地用拳头敲打着桌子。

"Lay off second child!" he replied, raising his voice.  
"别对次子大呼小叫！" 他回敬道，提高了嗓门。

Asuka just sat their stunned, this was the first time Shinji had addressed her as "second child," he must really be annoyed. The boy stood up abruptly from the table and walked off to his room. Despite Shinji being angry, the redhead wasn't just about to give up; she could not allow him to go to Aria's house. Shinji returned with a bag in his hand and strode towards the exit. At this, Asuka moved in front of the door.  
明日香只是坐在那里，震惊不已，这是真嗣第一次称她为"次子"，他一定是真的生气了。男孩突然从桌旁站起身，走向自己的房间。尽管真嗣在生气，红发女孩并不打算就此放弃；她不能让他去亚莉亚的家。真嗣带着一个包回来，大步走向出口。见状，明日香挡在了门前。

"Asuka please move" he requested.  
“明日香，请挪一下。”他请求道。

"You can't go to her house" Asuka demanded. "She'll offer to sleep with you and we can't have a pilot impregnating someone"  
“你不能去她家，”明日香坚决地说，“她会提出和你上床的，我们不能让一个驾驶员搞出人命来。”

"First of all, she wouldn't offer to sleep with me in the first place. Secondly, I wouldn't sleep with her even if she offered and lastly, even if for some stupid reason we did end up having sex, LCL acts as a contraceptive" Shinji retorted.  
“首先，她根本不会一开始就提出和我上床。其次，即使她提了，我也不会和她上床。最后，即使出于某种愚蠢的原因我们真的发生了关系，LCL 也有避孕作用。”真嗣反驳道。

Asuka was running out of excuses. "You just shouldn't go"  
明日香已经快找不到借口了。“你就不该去”

"Give me _one_ good reason why I should stay" the boy solicited.  
“给我一个留下来的好理由”男孩追问道。

"Because I'm telling you to" she replied.  
“因为我让你这么做”她回答道。

"Goodbye Asuka" he said in response, pushing past her.  
“再见，明日香。”他回应道，从她身边挤了过去。

The redhead grabbed his wrist and the boy turned to face her. "Don't go" she said almost pleadingly.  
红发女孩抓住他的手腕，男孩转过身面对她。“别走。”她几乎恳求地说。

'_That's it… just one more push… just admit it you stubborn girl'_ Shinji thought. "Why?"  
“就是这样……再使一把劲……承认吧，你这倔强的女孩。”真嗣心想。“为什么？”

She opened her mouth to say something, but was at a loss for words. It seemed she was fighting desperately to say something and Shinji looked at her with hopeful eyes.  
她张开嘴想说些什么，却一时语塞。她似乎在拼命寻找话语，而真嗣则用充满希望的眼神看着她。

"Fuck you, just go" she relented, releasing his wrist.  
“去你的，走吧”她终于松口，放开了他的手腕。

"Goodbye Asuka" he said once again as he walked through the door and closed it behind him.  
“再见了，明日香”他再次说道，穿过门去，随后将门关上。

After a few minutes, Asuka just shouted in outrage. She kicked her chair as hard as she could, sending it flying into the wall where it broke. She pounded her fists on the dining table.  
几分钟后，明日香愤怒地大喊起来。她用力踢飞了自己的椅子，椅子重重地撞在墙上碎裂开来。她用拳头猛击餐桌。

"Why? Why? WHY? Damn that stupid baka, why does he have to make me feel this way?"  
“为什么？为什么？为什么？该死的笨蛋，他为什么要让我有这种感觉？”

She forced herself to calm down as she sat back down on another chair at the dining table. _'It doesn't make sense, recently he would always do what I asked him, why did he fight me so strongly?'_ Asuka could only see one possible explanation; he really liked Aria or perhaps even… loved her. _'Why does it bother me? Why did I really want him to stay?'_ So many "whys", so many damn questions she couldn't answer. Asuka didn't want to think anymore, it only made her feel worse. But she wasn't able to come up with anything to get her mind off everything.  
她强迫自己冷静下来，重新坐在餐桌旁的另一把椅子上。“这说不通，最近他总是按我说的做，为什么这次他这么强烈地反抗我？”明日香只能想到一种可能的解释：他真的喜欢阿里亚，或者甚至……爱她。“为什么这让我心烦？为什么我真希望他留下？”太多的“为什么”，太多的该死的问题她无法回答。明日香不想再想了，这只会让她感觉更糟。但她想不出任何办法来转移自己的注意力。

"That baka Shinji always has issues, I'm sure he needs some time to get away from his thoughts, how does he do it?" she asked out loud.  
“那个笨蛋真嗣总是有问题，我敢肯定他需要一些时间来逃避自己的思绪，他是怎么做到的呢？”她大声问道。

The answer hit her straight away, it was so obvious; his SDAT. Shinji would listen to music to forget about the world for a while. Asuka didn't feel like playing her violin or Shinji's cello for that matter, but was uneasy about using Shinji's SDAT. _'Why should I care about that stupid baka anyway? He won't even notice that I had used it'_ she thought, giving her the resolve.  
答案立刻击中了她，如此明显；他的 SDAT。真嗣会听音乐来暂时忘却这个世界。明日香不想拉小提琴，也不想拉真嗣的大提琴，但使用真嗣的 SDAT 让她感到不安。‘我干嘛要关心那个笨蛋？他甚至不会注意到我用过它’她想，这给了她决心。

The girl went over to Shinji's room and searched through his drawers, looking for his device. The redhead found it soon enough and sat down on Shinji's bed. She placed the earplugs in her ears and lay down on the bed. His bed seemed familiar for some reason. Asuka pressed the rewind button and was surprised to see that the tape was only about ten minutes from the beginning. She pressed play and listened to the music, which she soon recognised as Madonna's "Frozen." _'Why would that guy listen to this? I thought he liked opera and old classicals.'_ But she soon dismissed her thoughts as she was finally able to find peace listening to the music. The words impacted on her a little.  
女孩走到真嗣的房间，翻找他的抽屉，寻找他的设备。红发女孩很快就找到了，然后坐在真嗣的床上。她把耳塞塞进耳朵，躺在床上。不知为何，他的床似乎有些熟悉。明日香按下倒带按钮，惊讶地发现磁带离开头只有大约十分钟。她按下播放键，听着音乐，很快就认出是麦当娜的《冻结》。‘那家伙为什么会听这个？我以为他喜欢歌剧和古典老歌。’但她很快抛开了这些想法，因为终于能在音乐中找到平静。歌词对她产生了些许影响。

The music cut off abruptly, replaced by silence. Then a voice.  
音乐戛然而止，取而代之的是一片寂静。随后，一个声音响起。

_"Yo, you're late"_ a man said aloud.  
“哟，你迟到了。”一个男人大声说道。

Asuka recognised the man's voice as Kaji's. Then a gunshot was heard and a pair of footsteps running off. Asuka listened on curiously, the only sound was the occasional moan. After a few minutes, she heard a grunt.  
明日香认出了那个男人的声音是加持的。随后传来一声枪响和一阵急促的脚步声。明日香好奇地继续听着，唯一的声音是偶尔的呻吟。几分钟后，她听到了一声闷哼。

"_You missed Katsuragi"_ “你没打中葛城。”

_'Did Misato shoot Kaji?'_ Asuka thought. She then heard a sound like someone getting up before it stopped, only to come back to Kaji speaking.  
'是美里开枪打了加持吗？'明日香心想。接着她听到有人起身的声音，然后停了下来，只听到加持再次说话。

_"Yo Shinji, I know you might be wondering what's going on, but this is Kaji. I have given you this tape because I am not ready to present myself to Misato yet. Don't worry if you didn't recognise me, I wanted it that way. In any case, I want you to know I'm still alive. Misato shot me but only wounded me as you heard in the recording. One favour I ask is not to tell Misato about this, not yet anyway. I know she's probably grief stricken over thinking that she killed me, but I will show myself soon enough. I wanted you to know though…"  
哟，真嗣，我知道你可能在想发生了什么，但这是加持。我给你这盘磁带是因为我还没准备好向美里现身。如果你没认出我，别担心，我本意如此。无论如何，我想让你知道我还活着。美里朝我开枪，但只让我受了伤，正如你在录音中听到的。我有一个请求，就是暂时不要告诉美里这件事。我知道她可能因为以为杀了我而悲痛欲绝，但我很快就会现身。不过，我想让你知道……_

Asuka listened on in shocked silence, as the tape seemed to pause for a moment.  
明日香震惊地沉默着继续聆听，录音似乎暂停了一会儿。

_"That ring I gave you was the one I was planning to propose to Misato with a long time ago, except I never had the courage to do so. I think you need it more. You might be wondering how I know you would need it, well let's just say I infiltrated NERV and discovered what happened in the battle with the 15th angel. If you want to know how I found you, I followed you when you exited the apartment alone; I am a spy after all. One last thing… I warn you, DO NOT go see the movie 'Angels and Evas'. I was desperate for money, so I sold some information about NERV. I'd never think they'd go so far as to make a movie and an awful one at that. So yeah, sorry about that movie and don't try looking for me, I will come soon enough. I hope you're doing good kid"  
“我给你的那枚戒指，是很久以前我打算向美里求婚用的，只是我从未有勇气这么做。我想你更需要它。你或许会好奇我怎么知道你需要它，这么说吧，我潜入了 NERV，发现了与第 15 使徒战斗时发生的事。至于我是如何找到你的，你独自离开公寓时我跟踪了你；毕竟我是个间谍。最后一件事……我警告你，千万别去看电影《天使与 EVA》。我那时急需用钱，就卖了一些 NERV 的情报。没想到他们会做到这种地步，还拍了部烂片。所以，对那部电影我只能说抱歉，也别试图找我，我很快就会回来的。希望你一切都好，孩子。”_

The music returned and Asuka pressed pause. _'Well now we know who the leak at NERV was'_ she thought, recalling the movie. _'But what is all this? Shinji has some tape with Kaji recording his attempted assassination? Misato really tried to kill him? This is all so confusing.'_ Asuka thought over what she had just heard. _'Alright so Shinji got the ring from Kaji, that's one mystery solved. It still doesn't answer_ _**why**_ _Kaji gave it to him though. What happened in the battle of the 15th angel? Shinji said I defeated that one, did he leave anything out?'_  
音乐再次响起，明日香按下了暂停键。'现在我们知道 NERV 的泄密者是谁了'她想，回忆着那部电影。'但这都是些什么？真嗣有一盘记录着加持试图暗杀他的磁带？美里真的想杀他？这一切都太混乱了。'明日香思考着刚刚听到的内容。'好吧，真嗣从加持那里得到了戒指，这个谜团算是解开了。但还是没解释为什么加持会给他。第 15 使徒的战斗中发生了什么？真嗣说我打败了那个，他有没有遗漏什么？'

She took out Shinji's earplugs and returned his SDAT to his drawer. The redhead then tried to remember the battle with the 15th angel, a few scenes flashed in her mind. She saw the angel in the sky; she was aiming her rifle at it. Then she saw a bright light shining down on her. Asuka focused on these thoughts, desperately trying to remember.  
她取出真嗣的耳塞，将他的 SDAT 放回抽屉。红发少女随后试图回忆与第 15 使徒的战斗，几个场景在她脑海中闪现。她看到使徒在天空中；她正瞄准它举起步枪。然后她看到一道强光照在她身上。明日香集中精神，拼命试图记起。


_**"Get out of my head, get out!" she screamed. The young girl clutched her head in agony and struggled against the assault.  
“从我脑中滚出去，滚出去！”她尖叫着。少女痛苦地抱住头，挣扎着抵抗这突如其来的攻击。**_

_**"Ritsuko?!" Misato shouted.  
"律子？！" 美里喊道。**_

_**"It seems the angel is attacking Asuka with some sort of particle wave, it's assaulting the pilot's mind directly!" the doctor said frantically.  
“看来天使正在用某种粒子波攻击明日香，它直接攻击了驾驶员的意识！”医生慌乱地说道。**_

_**"Any suggestions? Anything that can stop this attack?!" Misato shouted urgently.  
“有什么建议吗？有什么能阻止这次攻击的吗？！”美里急切地喊道。**_

_**"I don't know Misato. It would take too long to analyse and I just don't know where to start and-" Ritsuko started.  
“我不知道，美里。分析需要太长时间，而且我根本不知道从何开始——”律子开始说道。**_

_**"Rei fire!" Misato ordered.  
"丽，开火！" 美里命令道。**_

_**Upon receiving Misato's command, the blue haired girl fired at once, the long energy beam shooting off into the sky. However, the beam was reflected as it hit a series of octagons.  
接到美里的命令后，蓝发女孩立刻开火，一道长长的能量光束射向天空。然而，光束在击中一系列八角形物体时被反射了。**_

_**"The AT-Field is too strong!" Ritsuko called out.  
“AT 力场太强了！”律子大声喊道。**_

_**"Damn it" the Major cursed at the failure.  
“该死”，美里因失败而咒骂道。**_

_**"Ah God, I don't want to remember this! Make it stop, make it stop!" Asuka cried out, still under attack.  
“啊，上帝，我不想回忆这些！让它停下，让它停下！”明日香哭喊着，仍在遭受攻击。**_

_**"Father!" Shinji cried out. "Father, please let me help her!" he pleaded.  
“父亲！”真嗣喊道。“父亲，请让我帮助她！”他恳求道。**_

_**"Permission denied" the Commander replied coldly. "Unit 01 is too valuable, I cannot take the risk"  
“权限拒绝”指挥官冷冷地回答，“初号机太过珍贵，我不能冒这个险。”**_

_**Asuka continued to scream in pain, desperately fighting against her foe.  
明日香继续痛苦地尖叫，拼命与对手抗争。**_

_**"At this rate the pilot could receive irreversible mental damage, we need to do something!" Ritsuko announced.  
“照这样下去，驾驶员可能会遭受不可逆的精神损伤，我们必须采取行动！”律子宣布道。**_

_**"If not send out Unit 01, what do you suggest Commander?!" Misato shouted furiously.  
“如果不派出零号机，你有什么建议，指挥官？！”美里愤怒地喊道。**_

_**"Father please, I have to go help her. Let me go, I can do this!" Shinji pleaded again.  
"父亲，求您了，我必须去帮她。让我去吧，我能做到！" 真嗣再次恳求道。**_

_**"Permission denied" the Commander replied again. "Rei, retrieve the lance" he ordered.  
"权限已拒绝" 指挥官再次回答。"丽，去取长矛" 他命令道。**_

_**"Hai" was Rei's response before she stood up and went over to the elevator so she could be brought back down to retrieve the lance.  
"明白" 是丽的回应，她随即起身走向电梯，以便被送下去取长矛。**_

_**"The Lance?! You can't be serious Commander?!" Misato shouted in disbelief.  
"朗基努斯之枪？！指挥官，你不是认真的吧？！" 美里难以置信地喊道。**_

_**"Follow your orders" was all the Commander said in response.  
"执行命令" 指挥官只是这样回应道。**_

_**The young boy opened a com link to Asuka's evangelion.  
少年打开了一个与明日香 EVA 的通讯链接。**_

_**"Asuka, can you hear me?" Shinji asked.  
“明日香，你能听到我说话吗？”真嗣问道。**_

_**The young girl shifted as she heard his voice. "Y-Yes" she replied in pain, unable to hold back her screams.  
少女听到他的声音，身体微微一动。“是-是的。”她痛苦地回答，无法抑制自己的尖叫。**_

_**"Listen to me Asuka, you have to fight it!" he urged.  
"听我说，明日香，你必须战斗！" 他催促道。**_

_**"I-I can't! It hurts s-so much! P-Please h-help me!" the girl replied desperately.  
"我-我做不到！太疼了！请-请帮帮我！" 女孩绝望地回答。**_

_**"I'm here Asuka, be strong, you always were" Shinji responded.  
"我在这里，明日香，要坚强，你一直都很坚强" 真嗣回应道。**_

_**"I don't wanna be strong anymore!" she screamed. "I've acted strong all my life, I'm sick of it! In the end I still have to suffer all this, I just can't take the pain anymore" she refuted.  
“我不想再坚强了！”她尖叫道，“我一生都在假装坚强，我已经厌倦了！最终我还是得承受这一切，我再也受不了这种痛苦了。”她反驳道。**_

_**"In all my life I have never met a girl with a stronger will, with more determination, with more stubbornness. No matter what, you always stood by your pride even if it hurt you and I've experienced it from you personally. Surely this angel is nothing then right? You can do it Asuka, I believe you can, I know you can!" Shinji replied.  
"在我的一生中，从未遇到过一个意志如此坚强的女孩，如此坚定，如此倔强。无论发生什么，你总是坚守你的骄傲，即使这会伤害到你，我也亲身体验过。那么这个天使又算得了什么呢？你可以做到的，明日香，我相信你能，我知道你能！" 真嗣回答道。**_

_**Asuka felt something stir inside her as she heard those words, but she was still battling desperately against the angel. She just couldn't see how she could get out of this one, how could his words alone help her? "S-So what Shinji? You're just a p-pathetic wimpy little boy. So what if you believe in me? So what if you give a damn? It doesn't change a-anything…" she retorted.  
听到那些话，明日香内心有所触动，但她仍在与使徒殊死搏斗。她实在看不出自己如何能脱困，他的话怎能帮到她？“那又怎样，真嗣？你不过是个可悲的小男孩。就算你相信我，就算你在乎，那又怎样？什么都不会改变……”她反驳道。**_

_**"You're wrong Asuka. You're wrong because…" he said trailing off.  
"你错了，明日香。你错了，因为……" 他说着，声音渐渐低了下去。**_

_**"Because what?" she asked.  
“因为什么？”她问道。**_

_**"Because I…" "因为我…"**_


Asuka came back from her flashback, unable to remember what he had said. She sighed in frustration but was a little relieved as she had been in great torment the entire memory. It seemed to her that the angel was trying to enter her mind. The redhead was really determined to work out what had happened and so focused her thoughts on the 15th angel again.  
明日香从她的闪回中回过神来，记不起他说了什么。她懊恼地叹了口气，但也有点松了口气，因为她整个记忆过程中都备受折磨。她觉得那个天使似乎想要进入她的内心。红发女孩决心要弄清楚发生了什么，于是再次将思绪集中在第 15 使徒上。


_**"You mother fucking angel, you're gonna die!" she yelled out.  
"你这个该死的天使，你死定了！"她大声喊道。**_

_**The redhead's face darkened with anger as she mustered all her will to erect her AT-Field, which successfully blocked the wave. The girl, having finally been relieved of the alien presence in her mind, became slightly more relaxed, no longer clutching her head in pain. The angel up in space was astonished the eva pilot could manage it and so increased the power of its attack. Asuka thought over the situation quickly, deciding how she could possibly fight the angel up in space.  
红发少女的脸因愤怒而阴沉，她集中所有意志力展开了 AT 力场，成功挡住了冲击波。女孩终于摆脱了脑海中的异物，稍稍放松下来，不再痛苦地抱头。太空中的天使对 eva 驾驶员能做到这一点感到惊讶，于是增强了攻击力度。明日香迅速思考着局势，决定如何才能对抗太空中的天使。**_

_**"I'm so glad you're okay Asuka!" Shinji cried out happily.  
“太好了，明日香，你没事！”真嗣高兴地喊道。**_

_**"It won't last forever Shinji, I need some way to attack the angel!" Asuka replied.  
“这不会持续太久的，真嗣，我需要找到攻击天使的方法！”明日香回应道。**_

_**"I think I have a way" Ritsuko suddenly announced.  
"我想我有个办法" 律子突然宣布道。**_

_**"I'm up for any suggestion" Asuka said, encouraging the doctor to go on.  
"我支持任何建议" 明日香说，鼓励医生继续说下去。**_

_**"Currently your AT-Field is blocking the wave, however, if you invert your AT-Field you could redirect and focus the particle wave. If concentrated enough, the particle wave could turn into a high energy gamma beam and slice right through the angel's AT-Field" Ritsuko explained.  
“目前你的 AT 力场正在阻挡这股波动，但如果你反转 AT 力场，就能重新引导并聚焦粒子波。如果足够集中，粒子波可以转化为高能伽马射线，直接切穿使徒的 AT 力场。”律子解释道。**_

_**"I think I understand" Asuka said in response.  
“我想我明白了。”明日香回应道。**_

_**The young girl proceeded to invert her AT-Field and began redirecting the angel's weapon right back at it. Sweat began pouring down Asuka's forehead as she concentrated on focusing the particle wave. Pressing her AT-Field together, she focused the particle wave into a tiny concentrated beam and swung it in an upward arc, causing the beam to cut straight through the angel's AT-Field and the angel itself.  
年轻女孩开始反转她的 AT 力场，将天使的武器反向引导回其自身。随着阿斯卡集中精力聚焦粒子波，汗水开始从她的额头上倾泻而下。她将 AT 力场紧压在一起，将粒子波聚焦成一个微小而集中的光束，并以向上的弧线挥动，使光束直接切穿了天使的 AT 力场和天使本身。**_


She stopped; she just couldn't remember anything else. _'Well I did destroy the angel, like Shinji said I did. I was a little hysterical, but I suppose with something invading my mind it can't be helped. I can't really see anything that special about that battle. As Shinji explained we became close friends so of course he would care about me. What is so special about this angel battle? It even caused Shinji's time in prison. None of this makes sense… and what did Shinji say?'_  
她停了下来；她就是记不起其他的事情了。'好吧，我确实像真嗣说的那样摧毁了天使。我当时有点歇斯底里，但我想在有东西侵入我的意识时，这也是无可奈何的。我真的看不出那场战斗有什么特别的。正如真嗣所解释的，我们成为了亲密的朋友，所以他当然会关心我。这场天使之战有什么特别的呢？它甚至导致了真嗣的牢狱之灾。这一切都没有意义……真嗣到底说了什么？'

Asuka decided she would just ask Shinji about the tape and the 15th angel; he would know for sure. But now the boy's actions seemed even more puzzling. The girl thought she understood him, but perhaps she was wrong. _'He doesn't have a traumatic past like mine; he should be easy to understand. Maybe I should ask him about his past, after all he knows about mine…'_  
明日香决定直接问真嗣关于那盘磁带和第 15 使徒的事；他肯定知道。但现在这个男孩的行为似乎更加令人费解。女孩原以为自己理解他，但或许她错了。'他没有像我那样悲惨的过去；他应该很容易理解。也许我应该问问他关于他的过去，毕竟他知道我的…'


"_**Asuka?" she heard Shinji call through the door.**_  
“明日香？”她听到真嗣在门外喊道。

_**Asuka lay on her bed, not responding.  
明日香躺在床上，没有回应。**_

"_**I'm coming in" he announced.**_  
"我进来了" 他宣布道。

_**The boy opened the door and entered her room, before closing the door behind him.  
男孩打开门，走进她的房间，随后关上了门。**_

"_**I know you hate it when I say sorry, but after reflecting on the fight we had, I was definitely in the wrong. I insulted you, but more importantly I shouldn't have pushed you to talk about something sensitive like your past, especially out of anger" Shinji admitted.**_  
"我知道你不喜欢听我说对不起，但经过对我们争吵的反思，我确实错了。我侮辱了你，但更重要的是，我不该在愤怒中逼你谈论像过去那样敏感的话题" 真嗣承认道。

_**She didn't say anything and continued to stare at him blankly.  
她什么也没说，继续面无表情地盯着他。**_

"_**Look Asuka, I know you're being stubborn" he said, sighing, "But even so, I would like some sort of response. I won't judge you"**_  
“听着，明日香，我知道你在固执”他叹了口气说，“但即便如此，我还是希望你能有所回应。我不会评判你。”

_**She still didn't respond.  
她依旧没有回应。**_

"_**You know what, I'm going to wait here for you, I'm not gonna give up. While I'm waiting, I'll tell you my story, I'll tell you about my past. Maybe it's similar to what happened to you" he declared.**_  
“你知道吗，我会在这里等你，我不会放弃的。在等待的时候，我会告诉你我的故事，我会告诉你我的过去。也许它和你经历的事情有些相似。”他宣称。

_**She lifted her head up a bit to listen.  
她微微抬起头，开始倾听。**_

"_**Back when I was very young, probably three or four, my mother and father were working on project Eva. I barely remember that time, it was so long ago, back when my father actually cared about me" he started, his voice wavering a little. "My mother was used as the test subject for Unit-01… my eva. But something horrible happened in the experiment and she vanished. As a young child I watched my mother disappear right in front of my eyes and I never saw her again, I can't even remember her face" he continued, his eyes watering.**_  
“在我很小的时候，大概三四岁吧，我的父母正在参与 Eva 项目。我对那段时间几乎没什么记忆，太久远了，那时我父亲还真的关心我。”他开始讲述，声音有些颤抖。“我母亲被用作 01 号机——我的 Eva 的试验对象……但实验中发生了可怕的事情，她消失了。作为一个孩子，我亲眼看着母亲在我面前消失，从此再也没有见过她，我甚至记不清她的脸。”他继续说着，眼中泛起了泪光。

"_**To make it worse, that's when my father abandoned me, discarded me as if I was trash. He left me with some professor who didn't really like me anyway. Years later, one day I get called by my father to come to Tokyo-3 only to be let down as I realised he just wanted to use me to pilot Unit-01. In the end after all that time, my father still just saw me as another pawn. That was one of the reasons why I got so angry when you said I was like my father, I would never do what he did…" the boy explained, sitting down on the bed next to Asuka.**_  
"更糟糕的是，就在那时，我父亲抛弃了我，把我像垃圾一样丢弃。他把我留给了一个本来就不怎么喜欢我的教授。多年后，有一天我被父亲叫到第三新东京市，结果却发现他只是想利用我驾驶初号机。到最后，经过那么长时间，我父亲仍然只把我当作另一枚棋子。这就是为什么当你说我像我父亲时，我会那么生气，我绝不会做他所做的那些事……" 男孩解释道，坐在 Asuka 旁边的床上。

_**Shinji took the girl's hand and she didn't pull away. "Anyway Asuka, because of my past… I didn't want to expose my heart to anyone, I was afraid of getting hurt like that again. So… every time I was faced with something too hard to deal with, I just ran away from it – it was how I coped. But because of you Asuka, I now realise running doesn't solve anything and by being all alone you sacrifice your happiness" he finished, squeezing the girl's hand.  
真嗣握住了女孩的手，她没有挣脱。“总之，明日香，因为我的过去……我不想再向任何人敞开心扉，我害怕再次受到伤害。所以……每次面对难以应对的事情时，我只会逃避——这就是我应对的方式。但因为你，明日香，我现在明白逃避解决不了任何问题，独自一人只会牺牲自己的幸福。”他结束时，紧握了女孩的手。**_


Realisation dawned upon the girl. _'He's the same as me! No wonder we became good friends, we both had similar pasts. So that's why he was afraid of opening up to people, but then why would he go out with Aria?'_  
女孩恍然大悟。“他和我是同一种人！难怪我们成了好朋友，我们都有着相似的过去。所以这就是他害怕向人敞开心扉的原因，但那他为什么会和亚里亚交往呢？”


"…_**I now realise running doesn't solve anything and by being all alone you sacrifice your happiness…"**_  
“……我现在明白逃避解决不了任何问题，独自一人只会牺牲自己的幸福……”


_'When that baka comes back home, I am so going to smack him'  
'等那个笨蛋回家，我一定要揍他一顿'_

---

It had taken a lot of will to leave the apartment. When Shinji had looked back at Asuka, she looked so… hurt. Nevertheless, he had set off for Aria's house, which he had to walk to on account of the public transport system being destroyed in the last angel attack and Misato wasn't around to give him a lift. The boy didn't mind walking for a while though; it gave him some time alone and he needed the peace of mind.  
离开公寓需要很大的意志力。当真嗣回头看向明日香时，她看起来那么……受伤。尽管如此，他还是出发去了绫波的家，由于上次使徒袭击破坏了公共交通系统，美里又不在身边无法接送，他只能步行前往。不过，男孩并不介意走一会儿；这让他有时间独处，他需要这份心灵的平静。

The sun was up and shining, but it wasn't as hot today and he had recovered from his illness since Thursday. Not many people were up and about this Saturday morning as Shinji walked along the streets. His thoughts soon turned to Aria and what he thought of her. The boy's first date with her at the movies had been nice. They had held hands while they watched the film. After the movie, they had talked all the way on their walk back to Aria's house. Shinji had learnt much about the girl in their conversation. He had gotten so involved in the conversation, he accidentally called her Asuka by mistake. Aria didn't mind, she said she had red hair so it was an honest mistake, but he couldn't help but think there was another reason for his slip-up.  
阳光明媚，但今天并不像往常那样炎热，自从周四以来，他的病已经痊愈。在这个周六的早晨，街上并没有太多行人，渚薰沿着街道漫步。他的思绪很快转向了 Aria 以及他对她的看法。和她在电影院的那次初次约会非常愉快。看电影时，他们牵着手。电影结束后，他们一路聊着走回 Aria 的家。在交谈中，渚薰了解到了很多关于这个女孩的事情。他太过沉浸在对话中，以至于不小心将她错叫成了明日香。Aria 并不介意，她说自己有着红发，所以这是个无心的错误，但他不禁觉得这个口误背后还有其他原因。

The following two days at school had been spent with him and her sending messages all throughout class and then going off to lunch together also having long conversations about nothing. He had actually grown to like this girl; she had a nice personality and she was so understanding. The only other thing that had happened was a sync test at NERV with some surprising results. His sync ratio had lowered, but nowhere near as much as Asuka's. Rei's had gone up again, but thankfully she was still lower than Asuka. He knew Asuka hated when he beat her, and he couldn't imagine how she would feel if Rei got higher too.  
接下来的两天在学校里，他和她一直在课上互发消息，然后一起去吃午饭，还长时间地聊些无关紧要的事。他真的开始喜欢这个女孩了；她性格很好，而且非常善解人意。唯一发生的事情是 NERV 的一次同步测试，结果有些出人意料。他的同步率下降了，但没有明日香那么严重。绫波的同步率又上升了，但幸运的是她仍然低于明日香。他知道明日香讨厌他超过她，他无法想象如果绫波也超过她，她会怎么想。

After about one and a half hours of walking, Shinji finally arrived at his girlfriend's house. He had only seen it at nighttime when he walked her home and he had never set foot inside. When he took a look at it, it looked a lot smaller than he remembered. Nevertheless, the boy walked up to her door and rang the doorbell. He heard the chime ring out inside and heard a pair of footsteps walking to the door. The door opened and Aria appeared in the doorway.  
大约一个半小时的步行后，真嗣终于到达了他女朋友家。他只在晚上送她回家时见过这房子，从未踏足过里面。当他仔细一看，发现它比记忆中的要小得多。尽管如此，男孩还是走到门前，按响了门铃。他听到门铃在屋内响起，接着是一串脚步声走向门口。门开了，艾丽娅出现在门口。

"Hello Aria" he announced, smiling.  
“你好，艾丽娅。”他微笑着打招呼。

"Oh Shinji, it's you!" she said happily. "Come on in, make yourself at home"  
"哦，是真嗣啊！" 她开心地说道。"快进来，随便坐。"

Shinji followed the excited girl into the house. After closing the door behind him, the boy looked around. Her house really was small, having only one bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a living room. Another thing that he noticed was that there was no one else.  
真嗣跟着兴奋的女孩走进屋内。关上门后，男孩环顾四周。她的房子真的很小，只有一间卧室、一个厨房、一个卫生间和一个客厅。他还注意到，这里没有其他人。

"Aria, where are your parents?" Shinji asked.  
"艾丽娅，你的父母呢？" 真嗣问道。

For the first time, he saw Aria's face sadden. "I don't have any parents…" she replied.  
这是他第一次看到 Aria 的脸色变得悲伤。“我没有父母……”她回答道。

"I'm sorry, I know the feeling" he empathised.  
“我很抱歉，我懂那种感觉”他感同身受地说。

"Don't worry about it" she said, shaking her head.  
“别担心”她摇着头说。

"So, you live here alone?" he continued.  
"那么，你一个人住在这里吗？" 他继续问道。

Aria nodded her head. Shinji was very curious about how it was that she had come from America all by herself, but he didn't want to be rude.  
Aria 点了点头。真嗣对她是如何独自一人从美国来到这里的感到非常好奇，但他不想显得无礼。

"Anyway, you look a little exhausted, you walk here?" she inquired.  
"不管怎样，你看起来有点疲惫，是走过来的吗？" 她询问道。

"Yeah" he answered. “嗯”他答道。

"You must be thirsty, what would you like to drink?" she asked.  
"你一定渴了吧，想喝点什么？" 她问道。

"Just water thanks" he replied.  
"就水吧，谢谢" 他回答道。

The redhead ran off to the kitchen and took out a glass from the cupboard. She then went to the tap and turned it on, pouring water into the empty glass. When it was filled, she went back to Shinji and handed it to him. The boy accepted the glass and drained its contents.  
红发女孩跑进厨房，从橱柜里拿了一个玻璃杯。她走到水龙头前，打开开关，将水倒入空杯中。水满后，她回到真嗣身边，递给他。男孩接过杯子，一饮而尽。

"You wanna see my room?" Aria offered.  
“想看看我的房间吗？”Aria 提议道。

"Sure" he said, nodding. “当然”他点头说。

Aria walked off to the only bedroom in the house and Shinji followed. Upon entering her room, Shinji noticed it looked much like Asuka's except that it was much cleaner. Asuka usually had dirty clothes and underwear lying about, by contrast Aria's room was nice and tidy. But then again, she was expecting a guest and perhaps she had cleaned it up before he got here. There was some schoolwork on her desk though. Aria bent over to pick up a book off the floor, unintentionally revealing her rear to the male audience. Shinji hadn't meant to look; he had been facing her direction when she had suddenly bent down. Extremely embarrassed, he blushed and turned his head away.  
Aria 走向屋里唯一的卧室，Shinji 跟随其后。一进她的房间，Shinji 注意到它看起来很像 Asuka 的房间，只是干净得多。Asuka 通常会把脏衣服和内衣乱丢，相比之下，Aria 的房间整洁宜人。不过话说回来，她可能是在他来之前特意打扫过，因为她知道会有客人来访。她的书桌上还放着一些学校作业。Aria 弯腰从地板上捡起一本书，无意中向男观众展示了她的背影。Shinji 并非有意去看；她突然弯下腰时，他正好面对着她的方向。他感到极度尴尬，脸红着转过头去。

_'That skirt is a_ _**little**_ _short, did she do that on purpose? Nah it can't be, she's way too innocent'_ he thought.  
“那条裙子有点短，她是故意的吗？不可能是的，她太单纯了。”他心想。

Aria turned around to face Shinji again and noticed his red face. "What's the matter Shinji?"  
Aria 转过身再次面对 Shinji，注意到他涨红的脸。“怎么了，Shinji？”

"Nothing" he replied quickly.  
“没什么。”他迅速回答。

The girl shrugged it off. "Well, that's my whole house. I know it's a little small but I just wanted to show you" she remarked.  
女孩耸了耸肩。“好吧，这就是我的整个家。我知道有点小，但我只是想给你看看。”她评论道。

"That all?" he said, dumbfounded.  
“就这些？”他目瞪口呆地说。

"Oh, were you expecting something?" she asked, grinning.  
“哦，你期待着什么吗？”她笑着问。

"Well yes-I mean no… umm" he stuttered.  
“呃，是的——我是说不是……嗯” 他结巴道。

Aria giggled. "You are so funny when you're embarrassed. But I don't play an instrument or anything like that, so I can't really show you much here. However, I did bring you here for a reason" she started.  
Aria 咯咯笑了起来。“你害羞的时候真有趣。但我不会演奏乐器什么的，所以在这里没法给你展示太多。不过，我带你来这里是有原因的。”她开始说道。

"What's that?" he asked, wondering what she wanted.  
“什么原因？”他问道，好奇她想要什么。

Shinji looked on curiously as the girl went behind her wardrobe. _'What is she doing?'_ he thought, before he saw it; she had pulled out a bicycle.  
真嗣好奇地看着女孩走向她的衣柜。'她在做什么？'他想着，随即看到了；她从里面拉出了一辆自行车。

"A bicycle?" he wondered aloud.  
“一辆自行车？”他不禁大声问道。

"Very observant Shinji, I had received this as a gift from someone. Unfortunately, I don't know how to ride a bike. I was hoping I could take a ride… with you" she said, looking away.  
“观察力真敏锐啊，真嗣。这是我从某人那里收到的礼物。可惜，我不会骑自行车。我在想，能不能和你一起骑……”她说着，目光移向别处。

Shinji couldn't help smiling at her request. "I don't mind in the least"  
真嗣听到她的请求，忍不住笑了。“我一点也不介意。”

At once, she brightened up and went over to hug Shinji. "Thank you, you are such a nice guy"  
她立刻高兴起来，走过去拥抱真嗣。“谢谢你，你真是个好人。”

She then kissed him on the cheek and began to move the bicycle out of her room enthusiastically.  
随后，她在他的脸颊上亲了一下，热情地开始把自行车搬出她的房间。

"Here let me help" he volunteered, holding the bike.  
"我来帮你" 他主动说道，扶着自行车。

Together, they carried the bike out of the house. They placed it down on the ground and Aria went back to lock her door. The girl rejoined Shinji as he was getting on. The bike was a female brand, but Shinji didn't really care. The seat was just large enough for two people to sit on it and Aria was a small girl.  
他们一起把自行车抬出屋外。放下后，Aria 回去锁门。女孩回来时，Shinji 正准备上车。这辆自行车是女性品牌，但 Shinji 并不介意。座位刚好够两个人坐，而 Aria 是个娇小的女孩。

"Alright Aria, you sit behind me and hold onto me tightly so you don't fall off" he instructed.  
"好了 Aria，你坐在我后面，紧紧抱住我，这样你就不会掉下去了" 他指导道。

The redhead got on the bike behind Shinji and placed her arms around his waist.  
红发女孩跨上自行车，坐在真嗣后面，双臂环抱住他的腰。

"Just find something to support your legs on and rest them on that" the boy suggested.  
“找点东西支撑你的腿，然后搭在上面。”男孩建议道。

Aria complied and Shinji soon began pedalling. They started off a little slow as Shinji was not used to riding a bike with the extra weight, plus he hadn't ridden a bike for a while. In next to no time, the eva pilot had increased his speed quite significantly. He felt Aria's arms hold onto him tighter as they sped down the street. The boy felt exhilaration as he whizzed past people, the wind sweeping past him blowing his and Aria's hair around. As they approached a hill, Shinji pedalled faster and made it to the top. As he went over the crest, he felt a rush of adrenalin as the bike sped downhill. The bike was going very fast and he was having trouble controlling it.  
亚莉亚照做了，真嗣随即开始蹬车。起初他们速度有点慢，因为真嗣不习惯载着额外的重量骑车，而且他也很久没骑过了。但没过多久，这位 EVA 驾驶员就大幅提升了速度。随着他们沿街疾驰，他感觉到亚莉亚的手臂更紧地抱住了他。男孩感到一阵兴奋，风驰电掣间，风吹乱了他和亚莉亚的头发。当他们接近一个斜坡时，真嗣加快了蹬踏，冲上了坡顶。越过坡顶时，他感到一股肾上腺素激增，自行车飞速下坡。车速非常快，他几乎难以控制。

Suddenly the bike hit a crack in the pavement and they went airborne for a few seconds, causing both their hearts to beat very fast. Fortunately, Shinji managed to land properly and they continued their ride. The boy cycled through the park, enjoying the scenery and the fresh air. The air felt cool as it rushed past him, giving him a nice relief from the blazing sun. After riding for a while, his ass started to hurt and he stopped at a bench. The two got off the bike and sat down on the bench.  
突然间，自行车撞上了路面的一条裂缝，他们短暂地飞了起来，两人的心跳都加速了。幸运的是，真嗣成功地平稳着陆，他们继续骑行。男孩穿过公园，享受着风景和新鲜空气。凉爽的空气迎面扑来，为他带来了烈日下的一丝清凉。骑了一段时间后，他的臀部开始感到疼痛，于是他在一张长椅前停下。两人下了自行车，坐在长椅上。

"That was amazing Shinji, really it was" Aria said, ecstatic.  
“那真是太棒了，真嗣，真的非常棒。”亚莉亚兴奋地说道。

"Glad you enjoyed it. I got a little scared when we went downhill, but we got out okay" he commented.  
“很高兴你喜欢。我们下坡的时候我有点害怕，但我们平安无事。”他评论道。

"I wasn't afraid, I had complete trust in you and I knew you could do it" she commended.  
"我并不害怕，我完全信任你，我知道你能做到" 她赞许地说。

They both stayed silent, just appreciating the other's presence. Aria placed her arm around Shinji's waist and rested her head on his shoulder. The couple stayed like that for a while until Aria decided it was time to go. They both got back onto the bike and Shinji rode all the way back to Aria's house. After they got off the bike, Aria unlocked and opened her door while Shinji carried the bike back in.  
他们俩都保持沉默，只是享受着对方的陪伴。Aria 将手臂环绕在 Shinji 的腰间，头靠在他的肩膀上。这对情侣就这样静静地待了一会儿，直到 Aria 觉得是时候离开了。他们俩重新骑上摩托车，Shinji 一路骑回了 Aria 的家。下车后，Aria 解锁并打开了门，而 Shinji 则把摩托车搬了进去。

"It's been a great day Shinji, thank you for coming" she said happily.  
"今天真是美好的一天，Shinji，谢谢你来" 她开心地说。

"It was my pleasure, honestly" he replied. "I would have loved to stay longer, but I'm getting a little worried about having left Asuka all alone"  
"这是我的荣幸，真的。" 他回答道，"我本想多留一会儿，但我有点担心让明日香一个人待着。"

"I understand completely, don't worry about it" Aria reassured.  
"我完全理解，别担心。" 亚里亚安慰道。"

"Thanks for understanding, Goodbye then Aria" he said, waving to the girl.  
"谢谢你的理解，那么再见了，亚里亚。" 他说着，向女孩挥手告别。"

"Goodbye Shinji" she replied, waving back.  
“再见，真嗣。”她回应道，挥手告别。

Just as he turned around to leave, out of the corner of his eye Shinji thought he saw Aria have a troubled look on her face for a brief moment. The boy chose to dismiss it, putting it down to his imagination. Shinji exited her residence and began to walk back to his apartment.  
正当他转身准备离开时，真嗣眼角的余光似乎瞥见绫有一瞬间面露忧色。男孩选择忽略这一点，将其归咎于自己的想象。真嗣离开她的住所，开始步行返回自己的公寓。

---

She was bored as hell. She would make him pay. She would make him realise she was more important than some slut. After listening to Shinji's SDAT, Asuka had gone to her room in search for something to pass time. The redhead did all her homework and read some books and magazines. After this, the girl had found herself with nothing to do. She didn't want to go shopping and she couldn't go to Hikari's house. The console was boring unless you versed someone else as the computer was too easy nor could be conversed with.  
她无聊透顶。她要让他付出代价。她要让他意识到她比某些荡妇重要得多。听了真嗣的 SDAT 后，明日香回到自己的房间寻找打发时间的东西。红发女孩完成了所有作业，读了几本书和杂志。之后，她发现自己无事可做。她不想去购物，也不能去光的家。游戏机很无聊，除非与人对抗，否则电脑太简单，也无法交流。

Asuka lay down on her bed, attempting to wait the time over, but waiting was something Asuka just could not do. She kept fidgeting, getting back up and watching TV only to switch it off as even more boring shows came on. The girl cooked herself a meal both to satisfy hunger and to pass the time. After a long span, she had just resigned to sitting on the couch waiting for the male eva pilot to return.  
明日香躺在床上，试图熬过这段时间，但等待这种事明日香就是做不到。她不停地扭动，站起来看电视，却又因为更无聊的节目而关掉。女孩为自己做了一顿饭，既为了满足饥饿，也为了打发时间。经过漫长的等待，她只好坐在沙发上，等待男性 EVA 驾驶员归来。

The girl heard the door open after a while, a feeling of anticipation coming over her as she looked to see who it was. Shinji entered and called out "I'm home." She was filled with a strange mix of both happiness and anger at seeing him come. Asuka didn't waste any time to make her presence known as she walked up to the boy and slapped him hard on the cheek. Shocked and surprised, he just looked at her dumbfounded.  
过了一会儿，女孩听到门开了，一种期待感涌上心头，她抬头看是谁。真嗣走了进来，喊道：“我回来了。”看到他回来，她心中涌起了一种奇怪的混合着喜悦和愤怒的情绪。明日香毫不犹豫地走上前去，狠狠地扇了男孩一耳光。他震惊又惊讶，只是呆呆地看着她。

"Don't give me that stupid look Ikari, you know very well what that was for" Asuka snapped.  
“别给我摆出那副蠢样，真嗣，你很清楚这是为什么。”明日香厉声说道。

"I didn't do anyth-" Shinji began to retort.  
"我什么都没做——" 真嗣开始反驳道。

"You left me here, bored out of my ass when I asked you to stay" she refuted.  
"你把我留在这里，无聊得要死，我让你留下的时候" 她反驳说。

"I already told you, I said I would go to her house" he countered.  
"我已经告诉过你了，我说我会去她家的" 他反驳道。

"I'm more important than her!" she shot back.  
"我比她更重要！" 她反驳道。

"She's my girlfriend, don't be ridiculous" he remarked.  
"她是我女朋友，别这么荒谬。" 他评论道。

"For only a few days, seriously! I am your roommate, your co-worker, your…" she paused for a while before saying it "friend… how am I being ridiculous?"  
"就那么几天，说真的！我是你的室友，你的同事，你的……" 她停顿了一会儿才说出口 "朋友……我怎么就荒谬了？

"Stop being so God darn selfish! I-" the boy started, before he was cut off by Asuka's lips on his. She pushed him up against a wall, increasing her attack aggressively. Shinji had no time to react and his body gave in as he accepted Asuka's passion. The redhead twisted his hair painfully as they kissed, as if trying to make sure Shinji got no pleasure out of it.  
"别这么该死的自私！我——" 男孩刚开口，就被明日香的嘴唇打断了。她将他推到墙上，更加激烈地进攻。真嗣来不及反应，身体便屈服了，接受了明日香的热情。红发女孩在亲吻中痛苦地扭动着他的头发，仿佛要确保真嗣从中得不到任何快感。

Finally, his mind came back into gear and he pushed Asuka off him. The girl just looked at him with disappointment and disgust.  
终于，他的思维重新运转起来，他推开了明日香。女孩只是失望和厌恶地看着他。

"Do you love her?" she asked.  
"你爱她吗？" 她问道。

"I don't know I-" he fumbled.  
"我不知道我-" 他结巴道。

"Do you love her?" she repeated louder.  
"你爱她吗？" 她重复道，声音更大了。

"Well, she's a great girl and-" he continued.  
"嗯，她是个很棒的女孩，而且-" 他继续说道。

"DO YOU LOVE HER?" she shouted.  
"你爱她吗？" 她大声喊道。

"I do have feelings for her" he finished.  
"我对她确实有感情" 他补充道。

Asuka just gritted her teeth and slapped him as hard as she could, releasing all the anger that had built up the past few days.  
明日香只是咬紧牙关，用尽全力扇了他一巴掌，将过去几天积累的所有愤怒都释放了出来。

"You are so pathetic you baka! Don't ever come near me again!" she shouted.  
“你真是太可悲了，笨蛋！别再靠近我了！”她大声喊道。

She then stormed off to her room and slammed her door loudly. Shinji stood there absolutely stunned. He had expected her to be difficult, but not like this. This is not what he had wanted. His knees started to wobble as he felt weak, he felt a great pain in his chest and he felt tears start to run down his cheek. The boy collapsed to the floor crying softly, not wanting to be heard by Asuka. The harsh pain in his cheek only served as a constant reminder of what had happened.  
随后，她怒气冲冲地回到自己的房间，砰的一声用力关上门。真嗣站在那里，完全愣住了。他预料到她会很难相处，但没想到会这样。这不是他想要的。他的膝盖开始发软，感到虚弱，胸口传来剧痛，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。男孩瘫倒在地，轻声哭泣，不想让明日香听到。脸上的剧痛只是不断提醒着他刚刚发生的事情。

After a while, his stomach grumbled; he hadn't eaten anything since breakfast. Shinji got up and wiped his tears with his hand. He went over to the kitchen and began preparing a meal for himself, both to satisfy his hunger and to get his mind off the current situation. All too soon, he had finished making his meal and he sat down at the dining table to begin eating. As he ate the food, all alone at the table, he couldn't stop thinking _'how did it come to this…?'_  
过了一会儿，他的肚子咕咕叫了起来；他从早餐后就没吃过任何东西。真嗣站起身，用手擦干眼泪。他走到厨房，开始为自己准备饭菜，既是为了填饱肚子，也是为了转移当前的注意力。很快，他就做好了饭，坐在餐桌前开始吃。独自一人坐在桌前，他无法停止思考：“怎么会变成这样……？”

The redhead lay on her bed sobbing uncontrollably. _'How did this happen?'_ she thought. Unable to come up with an answer, she just cried even more.  
红发女孩躺在床上，无法控制地抽泣着。'这一切是怎么发生的？'她思索着。找不到答案，她哭得更厉害了。

"I…love him" she said out loud. "I love him, I can't believe it but I love him. I fell for him, Shinji…"  
“我……爱他。”她大声说道，“我爱他，难以置信，但我确实爱他。我爱上了他，真嗣……”

The moonlight shone down on her, making her glistening tears sparkle and her red hair shine.  
月光洒在她身上，让她的泪珠闪烁着光芒，红发也熠熠生辉。

"I know he doesn't love me; he loves the other girl. I know it's true, but I still love him anyway. Why does it have to be this way?" she continued, her voice shaking.  
"我知道他不爱我；他爱的是另一个女孩。我知道这是真的，但我还是爱他。为什么非要这样呢？" 她继续说道，声音颤抖。

Suddenly, her face became emotionless and she looked up at her ceiling blankly. The girl sat up, remembering her mission.  
突然，她的表情变得毫无情感，茫然地抬头看向天花板。女孩坐起身，想起了她的任务。

"Adam's call has become too strong to resist anymore, it is time" she declared, moving off her bed.  
"亚当的召唤已经强烈到无法抗拒了，是时候了" 她宣布道，从床上起身。

---

Asuka was furious at Shinji, there was no way she was going to forgive him this time. After she had left him and gone to her room, she had yelled into her pillow to try to calm herself down. Once her temper had subsided slightly, she lay down on her back staring up at her ceiling again. The redhead wanted to punish Shinji, but she also felt a bit of regret at her actions. Why couldn't he just understand what she wanted?  
明日香对真嗣怒不可遏，这次她是绝不会原谅他的。离开他回到自己房间后，她对着枕头大喊大叫，试图平复心情。当怒气稍稍平息时，她仰面躺下，再次凝视着天花板。红发女孩想要惩罚真嗣，但同时也对自己的行为感到一丝后悔。为什么他就是不能理解她的需求呢？

Eager to get her mind off the boy, Asuka tried to count prime numbers or make as many sentences with the word "bitch" in it as she could. But her mind kept coming back to Shinji and _her_. _'Wait that's it! Aria Swung-Oak, what a stupid name. I'll give her a more appropriate name'_  
为了不去想那个男孩，明日香试图数质数，或者尽可能多地用“婊子”这个词造句。但她的思绪总是回到真嗣和她自己身上。'等等，对了！Aria Swung-Oak，这名字真蠢。我要给她起个更合适的名字。'

The girl thought for a while, _'The biggest baka's baka, no that's lame. Ultra-slut? Slut-Oak? Tramp of Tramps? Miss Legs are open to all? Constipated Cock Sucker?'_  
女孩想了一会儿，'最大的笨蛋的笨蛋，不，这太逊了。超级荡妇？荡妇橡树？浪中之浪？腿对谁都开的小姐？便秘的鸡巴吸管？'

Suddenly, her cell phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. She wondered who would be calling her now. Then she heard it and her eyes went wide. The angel alarms klaxons blared loudly throughout the whole city…  
突然，她的手机响了，打断了她的思绪。她想知道这时候谁会给她打电话。随后她听到了那个声音，眼睛瞪得大大的。天使警报的汽笛声在整个城市中轰鸣……

End Notes: I bet you want to find out what happens next!  
尾注：我打赌你想知道接下来会发生什么！

Also, to explain Asuka kissing Shinji. She has been literally deprived of attention the past three days and she is on edge. Asuka is desperate to have Shinji pay attention to her, although of course there is a small part of her that wanted to kiss Shinji too.  
另外，解释一下明日香亲吻真嗣的原因。她过去三天几乎没得到任何关注，情绪非常紧张。明日香迫切希望真嗣能注意到她，尽管当然也有一小部分原因是她自己也想亲吻真嗣。

I like the scene with the redhead saying she loves Shinji, it's setup to look like it's Asuka at first. I hope I tricked a few readers :D.  
我喜欢那个红发女孩表白她爱真嗣的场景，一开始看起来像是明日香。希望我骗到了一些读者 :D。

Author's Notes: Chapter 16 was so short because it was only half the day, here is the second half.  
作者的话：第十六章之所以简短，是因为它只涵盖了半天的时间，这里是后半部分。

If you haven't figured out who Aria is yet, you will in this chapter.  
如果你还不知道 Aria 是谁，这一章你会明白的。

I originally gave a thanks to 'Yamithecardmaster' as I liked his 'Arigato Deadlypole'. Then I had a pretend conversation with Darknemo:  
我最初感谢了'Yamithecardmaster'，因为我喜欢他的'Arigato Deadlypole'。然后我和 Darknemo 进行了一场假想的对话：

_To Darknemo it goes without saying I love your reviews, of course you write more than those 'ZOMG! Write more' comments. Actually, I love you too Darknemo *Deadlypole hugs Darknemo*, *Darknemo rolls his eyes at Deadlypole*.  
对 Darknemo 来说，不言而喻，我喜欢你的评论，当然你写的不仅仅是那些'ZOMG! 快更新'的评论。实际上，我也爱你，Darknemo *Deadlypole 拥抱 Darknemo*，*Darknemo 对 Deadlypole 翻白眼*。_

But ultimately, I was thanking him for all his reviews and suggestions. If this story is any good (I hope you think so, all the readers who got this far!), it is due in large part to Darknemo. There were some other comments to him and other reviewers, but as before are largely irrelevant now.  
但最终，我要感谢他所有的评论和建议。如果这个故事还算不错（希望你们这些读到这里的读者也这么认为！），很大程度上要归功于 Darknemo。还有其他一些对他的评论和其他评论者的留言，但和之前一样，现在大多已无关紧要。

Well anyways, enjoy the chapter.  
总之，尽情享受这一章吧。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 17 (First rewrite – very similar but I added some extra dialogue at the end).  
这里要说明一下，这是重写的第 17 章（第一次重写——非常相似，但我在结尾处增加了一些额外的对话）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读此内容，您正在阅读的是故事的最新版本。如果您在上章未看到此提示，那么您不幸地在所有章节更新前开始阅读。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节和格式已经改变，这可能会在后续阅读中造成混淆。**_

### Chapter 17: Revelations

"An angel attack now?" Asuka said out loud.  
“现在又来天使袭击？”明日香大声说道。

The redhead got up quickly and moved to her door. She wrenched open her door and ran into the dining room to find Shinji sitting at the dining table. Asuka noticed his eyes were red and there were remnants of dry tears on his face; had he been crying? Shrugging it off, the girl quickly moved over to the sullen boy.  
红发女孩迅速起身，走向她的房门。她猛地拉开房门，冲进餐厅，发现真嗣正坐在餐桌旁。明日香注意到他的眼睛红肿，脸颊上还残留着干涸的泪痕；他哭过了吗？明日香耸耸肩，没再多想，快步走向闷闷不乐的男孩。

"Come on you dope, an angel's attacking! We gotta go now!" she shouted at him.  
"快点，你这个笨蛋，天使在攻击！我们得赶紧走！" 她对他喊道。

"Asuka…" Shinji started, trying to say something.  
"明日香…" 真嗣开口，试图说些什么。

"Snap out of it! Look you're temporarily forgiven, so get up already!" she ordered.  
"振作起来！听着，你暂时被原谅了，所以快起来吧！" 她命令道。

Shinji just drooped down on his chair more. Rolling her eyes at his behaviour, Asuka went around to the back of his chair and lifted him up by the shoulders. Finally, the boy complied and got out of the chair. The girl grabbed his hand, the uninjured one this time, and pulled him along. She opened the door and ran down the stairs, not bothering to close the door behind her. As they exited their apartment, a red sports car pulled up at the curb. The car honked at them erratically and a purple haired woman put her head out the window.  
真嗣只是更加无力地瘫坐在椅子上。明日香对他的行为翻了个白眼，绕到他的椅子后面，抓住他的肩膀把他提了起来。最终，男孩顺从地离开了椅子。女孩这次抓住了他未受伤的手，拉着他一起走。她打开门，跑下楼梯，没费心去关门。当他们离开公寓时，一辆红色跑车停在了路边。车子不停地对他们鸣笛，一个紫发女子从车窗探出头来。

"Come on you guys, get in already!" Misato shouted.  
“快点，你们俩，赶紧上车！”美里喊道。

The two eva pilots got into the back of the car and Misato slammed the accelerator. The car shot down the street and Asuka turned to look at the male eva pilot. He had a gloomy expression on his face and it looked like he was brooding. She flicked him on the head, startling him a bit as he looked at her with a confused expression.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员上了车的后座，美里猛踩油门。车子疾驰在街道上，明日香转头看向那位男性 EVA 驾驶员。他脸上带着阴郁的表情，似乎在沉思。她轻轻弹了一下他的头，让他有些吃惊，带着困惑的表情看着她。

"Now's not the time to be depressed third child" she said in response to his face. Though truthfully, it was hurting her to see him sad.  
"现在不是沮丧的时候，三笠。"她回应着他的表情说道。虽然说实话，看到他难过，她也感到心痛。

"What do you know…" he replied bitterly.  
"你知道什么……"他苦涩地回答。

"And here I thought I had rubbed off on you, where's your perseverance? Look Shinji, just forget about what I said at the moment alright?" she consoled.  
"我还以为我已经影响到你了，你的毅力去哪儿了？听着，真嗣，暂时忘掉我刚才说的话，好吗？"她安慰道。

Misato saw Asuka's actions in the rear-view mirror, but decided to lay off her teasing at the time being.  
美里从后视镜中看到了明日香的举动，但决定暂时放过她的戏弄。

"Alright Asuka" he said nodding, his mood improving slightly.  
“好吧，明日香。”他点头说道，心情略有好转。

The two sat in comfortable silence the rest of the way to NERV. Upon arriving at NERV, Misato drove the car into the car elevator as the two eva pilots got off. The two teens ran down the corridor to the elevator. Shinji remembered the last two times he had run to the elevator. Both times he had been chasing after Asuka and received a door in the face, but this time they would go together. After entering the elevator, Asuka pressed the floor number for the eva cages and the elevator began its descent.  
两人一路上舒适地沉默着，直到抵达 NERV。到达 NERV 后，美里将车开进车库电梯，两位 EVA 驾驶员下了车。两个少年沿着走廊跑向电梯。真嗣记得前两次他跑向电梯的经历，两次都是追着明日香，结果被门撞了个正着，但这次他们会一起进去。进入电梯后，明日香按下了 EVA 格纳库的楼层号码，电梯开始下降。

As they were going down, the elevator rocked from a nearby shockwave. The shockwave caused Shinji to fall into Asuka, who caught him in her arms. The two stayed in their accidental embrace, neither of them willing to break it. God knows they both needed some emotional support.  
当他们下降时，附近的冲击波使电梯摇晃起来。冲击波导致真嗣跌入明日香的怀抱，她用双臂接住了他。两人就这样意外地拥抱着，谁也不愿意打破这份温暖。上帝知道他们俩都需要一些情感上的支持。

"What the hell is going on out there?" Asuka asked.  
“外面到底发生了什么？”明日香问道。

"The angel must be inside NERV already" Shinji commented.  
“天使肯定已经进入 NERV 内部了。”真嗣评论道。

"That can't be! I never saw the angel!" she replied in disbelief.  
"那不可能！我从未见过天使！" 她难以置信地回答道。

Another shockwave rocked the elevator, dispelling any of the redhead's doubts. The two were unable to look at each other and settled for resting their heads on each other's shoulders instead. Asuka, who had been deprived of attention the past few days and who had admitted she missed Shinji's affection, didn't mind all that much. Eventually, the elevator reached the eva cages and the two broke the embrace at the same time. They both entered their respective changing rooms and dressed into their plugsuits.  
又一次冲击波撼动了电梯，打消了红发少女的任何疑虑。两人无法直视对方，只好选择将头靠在彼此的肩膀上。过去几天被忽视、承认自己想念真嗣的关爱的明日香，对此并不太介意。最终，电梯到达了 eva 笼区，两人同时松开了拥抱。他们各自进入更衣室，换上了插入栓服。

"Where's Wondergirl?" Asuka wondered aloud.  
"真希波去哪儿了？" 明日香自言自语道。

Shinji just shrugged his shoulders in response. After changing, the two eva pilots ran to the eva cages and entered their respective evas. Both of them noticed Unit 00 was gone, had Rei gone on without them? Their thoughts were interrupted as Misato came up on the viewscreen to give them their briefing.  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩作为回应。换好衣服后，两位 EVA 驾驶员跑向 EVA 笼子并进入了各自的 EVA。两人都注意到 00 号机不见了，丽是独自出发了吗？他们的思绪被屏幕上出现的美里打断，她开始给他们进行简报。

"The angel is currently deep within NERV, we are unaware of how we were not able to detect its presence till now" Misato detailed.  
“使徒目前深入 NERV 内部，我们不知道为何到现在才探测到它的存在。”美里详细说明道。

"Where's the first child?" Asuka questioned.  
“第一适格者在哪里？”明日香问道。

"She is not piloting on account of the fact that her Unit 00 was taken over by the angel" the Major answered.  
"她没有驾驶，因为她的零号机被天使控制了" 少校回答道。

"So, we have to fight an angel _and_ Unit 00?" Shinji asked.  
"那么，我们要对抗天使和零号机吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Correct" Misato replied.  
"没错" 美里回答道。

"Asuka's sync ratio is 55.4 percent and Shinji's is 33.7" Maya interrupted.  
“明日香的同步率是 55.4%，真嗣的是 33.7%。” 真由美打断道。

Misato made a pained face before resuming her briefing. "Alright, we don't have any choice. We're going to have to send you both to fight the angel, regardless of how low your sync ratios are. Make sure to back each other up. You will be going down the access shaft that the angel took. The angel is currently moving too slow to be falling so it is presumed the angel is floating down, you should be able to catch up to it" she explained.  
美里露出痛苦的表情，随后继续她的简报。“好吧，我们别无选择。不管你们的同步率有多低，我们都得派你们去对抗使徒。一定要互相支援。你们将通过使徒进入的通道下降。使徒目前移动得太慢，不像是坠落，所以推测它是漂浮下降的，你们应该能追上它。”她解释道。

"Hai" they said in unison.  
“明白” 他们齐声回答。

Both pilots willed their evas to move towards the shaft. They hesitated momentarily before jumping down. Both teens felt their stomach drop as they free fell. Both felt an adrenalin rush as they sped down to the depths of NERV. After falling for a minute or so, they both saw the outline of an eva in the distance.  
两位驾驶员都指挥他们的 EVA 向通道移动。他们在跳下前犹豫了一瞬。两个少年在自由落体时都感到胃部一沉。随着他们加速向 NERV 的深处坠落，两人都感受到了肾上腺素的激增。大约下落了一分钟后，他们远远地看到了一个 EVA 的轮廓。

"You are approximately 1200 metres from the target, pattern blue is confirmed, get ready for conta-" Misato announced on the comm, before it turned into static.  
“你们距离目标大约 1200 米，蓝色模式已确认，准备接敌——”美里在通讯中宣布，随后信号变成了静电噪音。

"We've lost contact with Misato, we're on our own" Asuka declared.  
“我们与美里的联系中断了，只能靠自己了。”明日香宣布道。

Suddenly Unit 00 was starting to appear larger really fast and the two pilots were momentarily confused, but then realised they had reached the bottom. They braced for impact and the two evas slammed into the ground, creating a massive shockwave. With their sync ratios so low, the evas took a while to get up from the impact. As the dust cleared, what they saw was totally unexpected.  
突然间，零号机迅速变得异常庞大，两位驾驶员一时之间感到困惑，但随即意识到他们已经到达底部。他们做好冲击准备，两台 EVA 猛地撞击地面，引发了一场巨大的冲击波。由于同步率如此之低，EVA 们花了些时间才从撞击中站起。尘埃落定后，他们所见到的情景完全出乎意料。

"A-Aria?" Shinji spoke first, noticing the small outline of a redheaded girl next to Rei's eva.  
"A-Aria？" 真嗣首先开口，注意到雷的 EVA 旁有一个红发女孩的模糊轮廓。

"This is ridiculous, _she's_ the angel?" Asuka declared, bewildered.  
"这太荒谬了，她是使徒？" 明日香宣称，感到困惑不已。

"That can't be…" Shinji said in disbelief.  
“那不可能…” 真嗣难以置信地说。

Aria smiled at the boy. "I've been waiting for you, Shinji. I knew you would come"  
亚里亚对男孩微笑道：“我一直在等你，真嗣。我知道你会来的。”

"Why Aria?! Why are you doing this? Did you betray me? You said you had feelings for me… was it just so that you could manipulate me?" Shinji shouted out.  
“为什么，亚里亚？！你为什么要这么做？你背叛了我吗？你说你对我有感情…难道只是为了操纵我？” 真嗣大声质问。

"No Shinji, my feelings are genuine, I love you. I truly love you, but this is something I must do" Aria replied.  
"不，真嗣，我的感情是真挚的，我爱你。我真的爱你，但这是我必须做的事" 亚莉亚回答道。

"Aria! No! You… you can't be an angel…" Shinji refuted.  
"亚莉亚！不！你…你不可能是天使…" 真嗣反驳道。

"I hate to say it, but I told you so" Asuka told Shinji.  
"虽然我不想这么说，但我早就告诉过你了" 明日香对真嗣说。

"Just shut up Asuka! Now is not the time to rub it in my face that you were right about her" Shinji retorted.  
“闭嘴，绫波！现在不是时候提醒我你对她判断正确。” 真嗣反驳道。

Asuka grew furious again and took out her prog-knife. "Alright, I'll solve this stupid problem right now" she exclaimed.  
绫波再次愤怒起来，拔出了她的进度刀。“好吧，我现在就解决这个愚蠢的问题。”她喊道。

Asuka attacked Aria with her knife only to have it stopped by a series of octagons. "An AT-Field?!" she shouted.  
绫波用刀攻击阿莉亚，却被一系列八角形挡住了。“AT 力场？！”她惊呼道。

"Yes. You Lilims call it so. The holy region that must not be invaded by anyone, the light of the soul" Aria replied.  
“是的。你们莉莉姆称之为圣地，那是任何人不得侵犯的灵魂之光。”亚里亚回答道。

"She is an angel after all" Shinji said angrily.  
“她毕竟是个天使。”真嗣愤怒地说。

The boy burned with a new anger of betrayal. His sync ratio went up and he charged towards Aria. Unit 00, however, stopped his eva and the two began a wrestle, struggling for dominance. Asuka herself went after Aria, but her AT-Field was too weak and her attacks were all deflected by Aria's impenetrable barrier. The German girl never once thought to help Shinji though.  
男孩因背叛感而燃起新的怒火。他的同步率上升，冲向亚里亚。然而，零号机阻止了他的 EVA，两者开始了一场争夺主导权的搏斗。明日香本人也追向亚里亚，但她的 AT 力场太弱，所有攻击都被亚里亚坚不可摧的屏障弹开。尽管如此，这位德国女孩从未想过要帮助真嗣。

Aria continued on to find Adam. She opened heaven's gate and floated through the entrance. Asuka took in the sight with shock and horror. There was a pool of what looked like LCL, which contained millions of parts of evas; it was an eva graveyard. Shinji had finally broken free from Unit 00's wrestling match and followed through only to have his leg caught by Unit 00's hand. The boy, however, momentarily stopped struggling as he took in the same sight that Asuka had seen.  
阿莉亚继续前行寻找亚当。她推开天堂之门，飘然而入。明日香震惊而恐惧地注视着眼前的一切。那里有一池看似 LCL 的液体，内含数百万个 EVA 的部件；这是一个 EVA 的墓地。真嗣终于挣脱了零号机的纠缠，紧随其后，却被零号机的手抓住了腿。然而，男孩在看到明日香所见的景象后，暂时停止了挣扎。

The angel continued on without hesitation, Asuka still trying relentlessly to puncture Aria's AT-Field while Shinji was struggling to get Unit 00 to let go of him. Aria and Asuka came onto a giant white being, crucified to a cross, with a giant lance through the midsection.  
天使毫不犹豫地继续前进，明日香仍不懈地试图刺穿阿莉亚的 AT 力场，而真嗣则在努力让零号机放开他。阿莉亚和明日香来到了一个巨大的白色存在前，它被钉在十字架上，腹部贯穿一柄巨大的长枪。

"Adam our mother being. Those born from Adam must return to Adam? No, this is not Adam… this is…this is Lilith" Aria said, astounded.  
“亚当，我们的母亲。由亚当所生者必须回归亚当？不，这不是亚当……这是……这是莉莉丝。”阿莉亚震惊地说道。

Finally, Shinji broke free of Unit 00's grip and ran towards Aria. Unit 00 decided to go after Asuka instead and charged at her. Being taken totally by surprise, Asuka did not react in time and was knocked over by Unit 00. Unit 00 then pinned Asuka to the floor. Suddenly, a flash came out of nowhere. No one had noticed but a blue haired girl had come and projected her AT-Field, neutralising the angel's. Shinji grabbed Aria unhindered, his face a mixture of anger and sadness.  
最终，真嗣挣脱了零号机的束缚，向亚里亚跑去。零号机转而决定追击明日香，并向她冲去。明日香完全措手不及，未能及时反应，被零号机撞倒。随后，零号机将明日香按在地上。突然，一道闪光不知从何处出现。没有人注意到，一个蓝发女孩已经到来并展开了她的 AT 力场，中和了使徒的力场。真嗣毫无阻碍地抓住了亚里亚，脸上混合着愤怒与悲伤。

Shinji looked at her and said two words, "Why Aria?"  
真嗣看着她，说了两个字：“为什么是亚里亚？”

Asuka stopped struggling and decided to listen in on the conversation.  
明日香停止了挣扎，决定听一听他们的对话。

"I've been destined to live forever, even if humanity is annihilated as a result. However, I am able to die. To be or not to be, it makes no difference to me. My death is the only absolute liberty" Aria replied.  
"我注定要永生，即便因此人类被灭绝。然而，我能够死去。生存还是毁灭，对我而言并无区别。我的死亡是唯一的绝对自由。" 亚里亚回答道。

Suddenly, all of Shinji's anger dissipated. "Aria… you can't…you can't be asking me to kill you? I won't… I can't…"  
突然间，真嗣的所有愤怒都消散了。"亚里亚…你不能…你不能是在要求我杀了你？我不会…我不能…"

"She's an angel Shinji! Stop talking to her and just finish her!" Asuka shouted.  
"她是天使，真嗣！别再跟她说话了，直接结束她！" 明日香喊道。

_'She can be really cold sometimes'_ Shinji thought.  
'她有时候真的很冷酷' 真嗣心想。

"Shinji if I live, then all humanity dies. If I die, then you, and every other man, woman and child, including Asuka, will have a chance to grasp the future" Aria continued, interrupting his thoughts.  
"真嗣，如果我活着，那么全人类都会灭亡。如果我死了，那么你，以及每一个男人、女人和孩子，包括明日香，都将有机会抓住未来" 亚里亚继续说道，打断了他的思绪。

"No! Surely there's a way to avoid it. Come back with me, you could forget about all this. You don't have to do this!" Shinji said desperately.  
"不！一定有办法避免的。跟我回去，你可以忘记这一切。你不必这么做！" 真嗣绝望地说道。

"How can you say that? She became your girlfriend, just to use you for her own gains. She just happened to fall in love with you and is giving you the choice to kill her!" Asuka shouted again.  
"你怎么能这么说？她成为你女朋友，只是为了利用你达到自己的目的。她恰好爱上了你，并给你选择杀死她的机会！" 明日香再次喊道。

"No, it's not true, it was _I_ who became her boyfriend to use her. Aria I must tell you that-" Shinji started.  
"不，这不是真的，是我主动成为她男朋友的，目的是利用她。亚里亚，我必须告诉你——" 真嗣开始说道。

"I already know Shinji, I've always known" Aria interrupted.  
"我已经知道了，真嗣，我一直都知道" 亚里亚打断道。

"Then why?" he asked. "那为什么？" 他问道。

"Because I love you, and to love is not loving someone perfect, but loving someone imperfect, perfectly. Love doesn't always have a happy ending, it simply doesn't end" Aria replied.  
"因为我爱你，而爱不是爱一个完美的人，而是完美地爱一个不完美的人。爱并不总是有幸福的结局，它只是不会结束。" 艾丽娅回答道。

Asuka stayed silent this time.  
明日香这次保持了沉默。

"Aria please, you can still have a happy ending…" he pleaded.  
"Aria，求你了，你仍能拥有一个幸福的结局……" 他恳求道。

"No… my true name is Tabris, I am the Angel of Free Will. This is why I was given this form. Unlike my brothers, I could choose my destiny, like you Lilims do every day. But the price of free will is responsibility. Once you make a choice, you cannot erase the past and you must accept the consequences of your chosen path. I could no longer resist the call of Adam, so I left the life of Aria Swung-Oak behind and now here we are. You chose to come here to stop me, now is the time for you to accept the outcome of your choice" Aria explained.  
"不……我的真名是 Tabris，我是自由意志的天使。这就是我被赋予这个形态的原因。与我的兄弟们不同，我可以选择我的命运，就像你们 Lilim 每天所做的那样。但自由意志的代价是责任。一旦你做出选择，你无法抹去过去，你必须接受你所选道路的后果。我再也无法抗拒 Adam 的召唤，所以我离开了 Aria Swung-Oak 的生活，现在我们在这里。你选择来这里阻止我，现在是时候接受你选择的结果了" Aria 解释道。

"Aria I…can't" he protested.  
"Aria，我……做不到" 他抗议道。

"Please Shinji, one must live and the other must die. You must be the one to live, this is my wish. Shinji… I'm glad I met you. You Lilims have short fragile lives and so your emotions are very strong. I can understand you better now, Shinji. You are all so beautiful" Aria professed.  
"请吧，真嗣，一个必须活，另一个必须死。你必须是活下来的那个，这是我的愿望。真嗣……我很高兴遇见你。你们莉莉姆生命短暂而脆弱，因此你们的情感非常强烈。我现在能更好地理解你了，真嗣。你们都是如此美丽。" 阿莉亚深情地说道。

Shinji was crying; even though he had only been using Aria, she had become his friend. Shinji wasn't one who could kill his friends.  
真嗣在哭泣；尽管他一直只是在利用阿莉亚，但她已成为他的朋友。真嗣不是那种能对朋友下手的人。

"Thank you Shinji, my life was meaningful because of you" Aria finished, smiling.  
"谢谢你，真嗣，因为有你，我的生命才有了意义。" 阿莉亚微笑着说完。

"Kill her!" Asuka shouted, making Shinji react. His hand squeezed automatically and Aria's tiny body was crushed instantly.  
“杀了她！”明日香大喊，让真嗣做出了反应。他的手不由自主地收紧，爱丽娅娇小的身躯瞬间被碾碎。

Shinji stared at his eva's hand for a while in disbelief. There was blood, real blood on it, dripping off slowly. The boy lost it and screamed. When Aria had died, her hold over Unit 00 was lost and Asuka was released. The redhead threw off the offending eva and heard Shinji screaming. She instantly regretted what she had said; she couldn't even begin to comprehend what Shinji was feeling.  
真嗣难以置信地盯着他的 EVA 手掌，上面有血，真实的血，正缓缓滴落。男孩崩溃了，尖叫起来。当爱丽娅死去，她对零号机的控制也随之消失，明日香得以解脱。红发少女甩开那台惹事的 EVA，听到了真嗣的尖叫声。她立刻后悔自己说过的话；她甚至无法开始理解真嗣此刻的感受。

The boy passed out, unable to handle the stress, and his eva slumped. Asuka looked down at his eva, a mix of emotions swirling in her. Part of her wanted to comfort him as she could see he was in great pain. Although part of her was depressed that he had hesitated in killing Aria, the redhead knew it could only mean he really did have feelings for Aria. Asuka was also confused as to what Shinji had said.  
男孩承受不住压力，昏了过去，他的 EVA 也随之瘫倒。明日香低头看着他的 EVA，心中五味杂陈。一方面，她想安慰他，因为她能看出他正承受着巨大的痛苦。尽管另一方面，她因他在杀死爱丽娅时的犹豫而感到沮丧，红发少女明白这只能说明他对爱丽娅确实有感情。明日香也对真嗣所说的话感到困惑。


**"**_**No, it's not true, it was**_ **I** _**who became her boyfriend to use her…"**_  
“不，这不是真的，是我为了利用她才成为她男朋友的……”


_'What did he mean by that? What other reason would he date her other than liking her?'_ the girl thought.  
“他那话是什么意思？除了喜欢她，他还能有什么别的理由和她约会？”女孩心想。

Asuka shrugged it off for the moment and went back to the task at hand. The redhead picked up Shinji's eva and carried him back to the access shaft where they had entered in from. She looked up into the long, seemingly endless tunnel; she had no idea how she was going to get back up with Unit 01. Her plan was never made as Shinji's entry plug was ejected somehow. Asuka looked at it in confusion and came up with an idea.  
明日香暂时抛开这些念头，回到手头的任务上。红发少女拿起真嗣的 EVA，将他带回他们进入的接入井。她抬头望向那条漫长、看似无尽的隧道；她完全不知道如何带着初号机返回。她的计划还未成型，真嗣的插入栓却不知怎地被弹出了。明日香困惑地看着它，随即灵机一动。

Unit 02 took Shinji's entry plug out of his eva and placed it on the ground. The girl then exited her own eva and moved down to where his plug was. She moved her hands onto his hatch to open it and swore in pain as it was extremely hot. Gritting her teeth, she once again grabbed his hatch and opened it, hissing in pain. A little LCL poured out and she looked inside the entry plug to see Shinji's prone form inside. Asuka quickly picked up the unconscious boy, carrying him with ease as she was still pumped with adrenalin.  
初号机将真嗣的插入栓从机体中取出，放置在地面上。随后，少女从自己的 EVA 中走出，移步到他的插入栓旁。她伸手去开他的舱门，却因温度极高而痛苦地咒骂了一声。咬紧牙关，她再次抓住舱门，忍痛将其打开，倒吸一口凉气。一些 LCL 液体流出，她向插入栓内望去，看到了真嗣躺在里面的身影。明日香迅速抱起昏迷的少年，轻松地将他带走，她的肾上腺素仍在激增。

The redhead went back to her eva, closed her entry plug and reinserted herself. The plug filled up with LCL and Asuka moved into her usual position, placing Shinji's head on her lap. Asuka looked up and began the long climb back up the shaft…  
红发少女回到自己的 EVA 旁，关闭插入栓并重新进入。插入栓内充满 LCL 液体，明日香移动到平时位置，将真嗣的头放在自己腿上。她抬头望去，开始了漫长的返回通道的攀爬……

"What in the world is going on down there?" a frantic Misato shouted.  
“下面到底发生了什么？”美里焦急地喊道。

"We lost contact with the pilots exactly 57 minutes ago and have been trying to re-establish communication with them since then" Maya replied.  
“我们与飞行员的联系在 57 分钟前中断，自那以后一直在尝试重新建立通信。”玛雅回答道。

"We need to know what's going on!" Misato shouted yet again.  
“我们必须知道发生了什么！”美里再次喊道。

"Misato calm down, there's nothing we can do at the moment except trust in them" Ritsuko reassured. "Seeing as we're not dead yet, they likely succeeded in subduing the angel"  
“美里，冷静下来，目前我们除了相信他们别无他法。”律子安慰道，“既然我们还没死，他们很可能已经成功制服了天使。”

Misato stopped pacing around and just sighed. "Sorry it's just… I'm just worried, they're both my precious children"  
美里停止了踱步，只是叹了口气。“抱歉，只是……我真的很担心，他们都是我珍爱的孩子。”

"I understand… have some coffee, maybe it'll make you feel more at ease" the doctor replied, handing her friend a cup.  
“我理解……喝点咖啡吧，也许会让你感觉轻松些。”医生回答道，递给朋友一杯。

"Thanks" Misato accepted, sitting down.  
“谢谢。”美里接过，坐了下来。

"-to Misato. Earth to Misato. Why isn't anyone responding dammit?!" a voice suddenly said over the comms.  
"Misato，地球呼叫 Misato。为什么没人回应，该死！" 一个声音突然在通讯中说道。

"Asuka!" the Major cried out.  
"明日香！" 少校喊道。

"Well der, who else would it be?" Asuka replied, annoyed.  
"哎呀，除了我还能有谁？" 明日香不耐烦地回答。

"Are you alright? Is Shinji alright?" Misato asked, worried.  
“你还好吗？真嗣还好吗？”美里担忧地问道。

The young girl seemed to pause for a moment before replying. "We're both fine, I had to get Shinji out of his eva and into mine. I am currently climbing up the shaft we came in through, I think I'm almost at the top now" she answered.  
年轻女孩似乎停顿了一下才回答。“我们都还好，我得把真嗣从他的 EVA 里转移到我的 EVA 里。我现在正沿着我们进来的通道往上爬，我想我快到顶了。”她回答道。

"Did you defeat the angel?" the Major inquired.  
“你打败使徒了吗？”少校询问道。

"Yeah, Shinji killed her…" Asuka said, trailing off.  
“是啊，真嗣杀了她……”明日香说道，声音渐渐低了下去。

"Her?" Misato prompted. “她？”美里追问。

The redhead stayed silent.  
红发少女保持沉默。

At Asuka's silence, Misato continued. "Well… I'm just glad you two are okay" she said, relieved.  
在明日香沉默之际，美里继续说道：“嗯……我只是很高兴你们俩都没事。”她松了一口气地说。

After a few minutes, they saw the red form of Unit 02 climbing out of the shaft. After reaching the top, Shinji had woken up. He opened his eyes to see Asuka's face looking grim. He then realised his position and blushed, quickly moving off her. Asuka was a little surprised at his return to consciousness and she hadn't noticed him blush.  
几分钟后，他们看到红色机体 02 号从竖井中爬出。到达顶部后，真嗣醒了过来。他睁开眼睛，看到明日香的脸色阴沉。他随即意识到自己的姿势，脸一红，迅速从她身上移开。明日香对他的苏醒有些惊讶，并未注意到他的脸红。

"What happened? Why am I…" he paused looking around "…in your eva?"  
“发生了什么？为什么我会……”他停顿了一下，环顾四周，“……在你的 EVA 里？”

"Don't get any perverted ideas. You were unconscious and I couldn't bring Unit 01 back up, so I took you out and placed you in here with me and climbed back up the shaft" she explained, attempting to sound angry, but Asuka was feeling just as down as Shinji.  
"别胡思乱想。你当时昏迷了，我没法把初号机弄上来，所以把你带出来和我一起待在这里，然后爬回了通道。"她试图听起来很生气，但明日香和真嗣一样情绪低落。

Shinji just stayed silent; he was still in desolation over what had happened. So much had happened, there were so many conflicting emotions and he didn't know what to feel. The boy was disgusted at how much Asuka wanted Aria dead, he expected her to strongly dislike her but not want her dead. Asuka, the reason this had all started, what was he going to say to her now? His plan had failed and there was no way he was going to do it again. He felt so horrible; he had been so angry at Aria for betraying him, but Aria had forgiven him for betraying her. Shinji wanted comfort, but was also currently at odds with the girl in front of him.  
真嗣只是沉默不语；他仍沉浸在所发生的事情带来的绝望中。发生了太多事，有太多矛盾的情绪，他不知道该如何感受。他对明日香如此渴望杀死绫波感到厌恶，他预料到她会强烈不喜欢她，但没想到她会想要她死。明日香，这一切的始作俑者，他现在该对她说些什么呢？他的计划失败了，他绝不会再尝试一次。他感到非常糟糕；他对绫波背叛他感到愤怒，但绫波已经原谅了他对她的背叛。真嗣渴望安慰，但目前与面前的女孩关系紧张。

The boy reached out and caressed Asuka's cheek, causing the girl to stop moving the eva. Her surprised look soon changed to one of confusion, but she didn't pull away. Shinji wanted to kiss her and slap her but couldn't bring himself to do either, so as he moved forward, he instead embraced the girl. The redhead remained silent and the boy wasn't sure if she was accepting his affection or not. Finally, Asuka gently pushed the boy away without a word and continued moving the eva back to the eva cages.  
男孩伸出手，轻抚着明日香的脸颊，使得女孩停止了移动 EVA。她惊讶的表情很快转变为困惑，但她没有躲开。真嗣想吻她又想打她，却无法做出任何一种行为，于是他向前移动时，选择了拥抱女孩。红发女孩保持沉默，男孩不确定她是否接受他的感情。最终，明日香一言不发地轻轻推开男孩，继续将 EVA 移回 EVA 笼中。

Upon arriving, Asuka's entry plug was ejected and the two eva pilots got out, neither of them looking at each other. A group of medics were already assembled, waiting to cater to their needs.  
到达后，明日香的插入栓被弹出，两位 EVA 驾驶员走出来，彼此都没有看对方一眼。一群医疗人员已经集结，等待着照顾他们的需求。

"Are you two alright? Do you need any medical attention?" one of the medics asked.  
“你们俩还好吗？需要医疗援助吗？”一名医疗人员问道。

"No, we're fine" they answered in unison.  
"不，我们没事" 他们异口同声地回答。

The two teens heard some pushing and shoving and watched slightly surprised as the tactical operations director pushed her way through to them. As Misato reached them, she pulled them both into a big bear hug.  
两个少年听到一些推搡声，略带惊讶地看着战术操作主任挤过人群向他们走来。当美里到达他们身边时，她把两人都紧紧地拥入了一个大熊抱。

"I was so worried about you two, we lost communications and had no idea what happened" Misato started, anguish evident in her voice. "What exactly did happen?"  
"我真的很担心你们两个，我们失去了通讯，完全不知道发生了什么" 美里开始说道，声音中明显流露出痛苦。"究竟发生了什么？"

"I killed her, I killed the angel, I murdered her…" Shinji said, trailing off.  
"我杀了她，我杀了那个天使，我谋杀了她……" 真嗣说道，声音渐渐低沉。

"Shinji, it was just an angel" Misato replied, trying to cheer up Shinji.  
"真嗣，那只是一个天使" 美里回答，试图让真嗣振作起来。

_'Not good Misato'_ Asuka thought.  
'不太妙啊，美里' 明日香心想。

"That angel just happened to be my friend! She told me to kill her because she wanted me to live. I don't deserve to live, she was the better person. She wasn't a monster and I… I killed her…" he said breaking off, he couldn't cry anymore.  
“那个天使恰好是我的朋友！她让我杀了她，因为她想让我活下去。我不配活着，她才是更好的人。她不是怪物，而我……我杀了她……”他说着，哽咽得再也哭不出来。

Asuka just avoided her guardian's gaze. Misato looked at them, unable to do or say anything to comfort them so she turned around.  
明日香只是避开了她的监护人的目光。美里看着她们，无法做任何事或说任何话来安慰她们，于是她转身离开。

"When you're ready, I'll… I'll take you home. Take as much time as you want" Misato replied, before walking off.  
“等你准备好了，我会……我会带你回家。你想花多少时间都可以。”美里回答后，便走开了。

The two eva pilots felt a little guilty for making Misato feel bad, but they really weren't in the mood to discuss what had happened. Shinji and Asuka went off together to the changing rooms, neither of them looking or saying anything to the other. They stripped their plugsuits off and both took showers to wash off the LCL before changing into new clothes. As they exited their changing rooms, Asuka turned to the boy.  
两位 EVA 驾驶员对让美里感到难过有些内疚，但他们确实没有心情去讨论发生了什么。真嗣和明日香一起走向更衣室，两人都没有看对方或说话。他们脱下插入栓服，各自洗了个澡，洗去 LCL，然后换上新衣服。当他们走出更衣室时，明日香转向男孩。

"Shinji…" she started, attempting to say something.  
“真嗣…”她开口，试图说些什么。

"Yes?" he asked. “嗯？”他问道。

The redhead didn't really know what she had been trying to say and paused for a while. "I've been meaning to ask you something" she asked suddenly remembering, covering up her mistake.  
红发女孩其实不太清楚自己原本想说什么，停顿了一会儿。“我一直想问你件事”她突然想起来，掩饰了自己的失误。

"Go ahead" he prompted. “说吧”他催促道。

"I… I was listening to your SDAT to pass time and I came across this weird recording with Kaji" Asuka recounted. "Did Misato really try to kill Kaji? Why didn't you tell me about this?"  
“我…我为了打发时间听了你的 SDAT，结果发现了一段奇怪的录音，是和加持的”明日香回忆道。“美里真的想杀加持吗？你为什么不告诉我这件事？”

"You listened to that tape? And yeah… Misato was ordered to kill Kaji, I didn't even know about it till recently, so it's not something you forgot, neither of us knew" he explained.  
"你听了那盘磁带？是啊……美里被命令去杀加持，我也是最近才知道的，所以这不是你会忘记的事，我们俩之前都不知情" 他解释道。

Asuka was just about to ask him about the ring, but she didn't want him to know she took it and so she decided to ask him about the 15th angel instead.  
明日香正要问他关于戒指的事，但她不想让他知道自己拿了戒指，于是决定改问他关于第 15 使徒的事。

"Kaji also mentioned the battle with the 15th angel, what was so special about it? What happened in that battle? I can remember parts of it, there was some angel in the sky and it was trying to invade my mind, but you told me something and I destroyed the angel. I don't understand why you didn't fill me in on all the details of the fight and how it went… and what did you say to me? I guess you were trying to convince me not to give up, and to me it was irrelevant that you believed in me, but you replied with conviction... all I could remember was 'Because I…'," she described.  
"加持也提到了与第 15 使徒的战斗，那场战斗有什么特别的？发生了什么？我只能记得一些片段，天空中有个使徒，它试图侵入我的意识，但你跟我说了些什么，然后我摧毁了那个使徒。我不明白你为什么不告诉我战斗的所有细节和经过……你当时对我说了什么？我想你是在试图说服我不要放弃，对我来说，你相信我并不重要，但你坚定地回答……我能记得的只有'因为我是……'，" 她描述道。

Despite being annoyed by the redhead's questions, it momentarily took his mind off what had just happened. Shinji didn't know if he should just admit it right there and then. The redhead already knew so much, plus he really didn't care that much about anything at the moment.  
尽管被红发女孩的问题惹恼，但这暂时让他忘却了刚刚发生的事。真嗣不知道是否应该当场承认。红发女孩已经知道了很多，而且他此刻确实不太在乎其他事情。

"I didn't tell you, because I didn't want you to remember the painful experience of having your mind violated. About what I said, I said… 'Because I love you'," he answered.  
“我没有告诉你，是因为我不想让你回忆起心灵被侵犯的痛苦经历。关于我说的，我说……‘因为我爱你’，”他回答道。


"_**Because I… love you Asuka"**_  
“因为我……爱着你，明日香。”


Asuka's memory jogged; he wasn't lying, she knew it. The sentence repeated in her head dozens of times, she just couldn't believe what he had just said.  
明日香的记忆被触动了；他没有撒谎，她心里清楚。那句话在她脑海中反复回响了数十遍，她就是无法相信他刚刚所说的话。

"You… you love me?" she asked, surprised.  
"你…你爱我？" 她惊讶地问道。

"Surprising isn't it? Even after all that crap you put me through, despite how you cold-heartedly wanted me to kill Aria and the fact that you've rejected me and told me we will never be together millions of times I…still do" Shinji admitted.  
"这很意外吧？即使你让我经历了那么多糟糕的事情，尽管你冷酷地希望我杀死亚里亚，还有你无数次拒绝我并告诉我我们永远不会在一起，我…依然爱你" 真嗣坦白道。

Asuka's barrier shattered, this pathetic excuse for a boy had destroyed her defences and found a way into her heart. _'No this can't be, I can't accept it. I don't love him; it's as simple as that. Why does he make me feel so strange then…? I don't want to be alone… no! I don't need anyone. What am I saying? This just cannot happen. He will abandon me just like everyone else does'_ she thought.  
明日香的屏障破碎了，这个可悲的男孩竟然摧毁了她的防御，闯入了她的心扉。'不，这不可能，我无法接受。我不爱他；就这么简单。那他为何让我感觉如此奇异……？我不想孤单一人……不！我不需要任何人。我在说什么？这绝不可能发生。他会像其他人一样抛弃我'她心想。

Asuka disliked him and wanted him at the same time. He was already in such emotional distress, she didn't want to add to it. That gentle caress of her cheek, that gentle embrace… his affection before had been genuine. After all he did with Aria, she couldn't bring herself to return it… even though she wanted to. Another part of her wanted her to hurt him, as much as she could; he wasn't worthy of her. Such a turmoil of emotions raged inside the redhead, the only one she understood being anger. She focused on it, she couldn't lose herself to Shinji, she was superior and he was just a pathetic boy.  
明日香既讨厌他又想拥有他。他已深陷情感困境，她不想再雪上加霜。那轻抚脸颊的温柔，那轻拥入怀的温暖……他之前的情感是真挚的。尽管与 Aria 发生了一切，她仍无法回应……即便她渴望如此。另一部分的她却想伤害他，尽可能地；他不配得到她。红发少女内心情感纷乱如麻，唯一能理解的就是愤怒。她专注于愤怒，不能让自己迷失在真嗣身上，她是优越的，而他只是个可悲的男孩。

"No, it's not true. You are a liar Ikari, just like always" she refuted.  
“不，这不是真的。你是个骗子，碇，一如既往”她反驳道。

"I'm not lying I-" he began.  
"我没有撒谎，我——" 他开始说道。

"No! You loved _her_, I know you did. You can't just switch people like that" she interrupted.  
"不！你爱过她，我知道你爱过。你不能就这样轻易换人" 她打断道。

"I never loved Aria. Yes I liked her, she was a great friend, but I never loved her. It has always been you" Shinji elaborated.  
"我从没爱过 Aria。是的，我喜欢她，她是个很好的朋友，但我从没爱过她。一直是你" 真嗣详细解释道。

"But you said… you said you loved her" Asuka retorted.  
“但你说过……你说你爱她。”明日香反驳道。

"No I didn't, you asked if I loved her and I never answered yes" he countered.  
“不，我没有，你问我是否爱她，而我从未回答是。”他反驳道。


_**"DO YOU LOVE HER?" she shouted.  
"你爱她吗？" 她大声喊道。**_

_**"I do have feelings for her"  
“我对她确实有感情。”**_


Shinji was right and she knew it; he had never actually said he loved Aria. But that still didn't mean it wasn't true.  
真嗣说得没错，她心里清楚；他从未真正说过他爱亚莉亚。但这并不意味着那不是真的。

"Well regardless if you didn't admit it to me, you loved that bitch. No matter what you tell me, you still went out with her. Why would you do that if you loved me? You're full of crap Shinji. You're just coming to me now because I'm the last option. Now that Aria is dead, you don't have anyone else. Well I am _not_ going to be used, you go find someone else to feel sorry for you!" the redhead snapped.  
“好吧，就算你没向我承认，你也爱过那个婊子。不管你怎么跟我说，你还是跟她出去了。如果你爱我，为什么会那样做？你满嘴胡言真嗣。你现在来找我，只是因为我成了你最后的选择。既然亚莉亚死了，你没人可找了。我不会被利用的，你去找别人同情你吧！”红发女孩厉声说道。

"No Asuka I-" Shinji began, attempting to explain himself.  
“不，明日香，我——”真嗣开始试图解释自己。

"Save your bullshit Ikari, I'm leaving" she interrupted, turning around.  
"省省你的废话吧，碇，我要走了" 她打断道，转身离开。

Asuka hadn't given him the chance to explain himself because she was afraid; afraid she might fall for him, if she hadn't already. Shinji couldn't take the stress; everything just went from bad to worse. Aria dead, now Asuka leaving him forever; he didn't have the will to go on. He had to try one last attempt and so he grabbed the girl's wrist.  
明日香没有给他解释的机会，因为她害怕；害怕自己可能会爱上他，如果她还没有的话。真嗣承受不了这种压力；一切都变得越来越糟。亚里亚死了，现在明日香又要永远离开他；他没有继续下去的意志了。他必须做最后一次尝试，于是他抓住了女孩的手腕。

"Please don't go" he pleaded.  
"请不要走" 他恳求道。

"You're out of luck third child" she replied, shaking his hand off her and walking off. Asuka wanted to show him what it felt like when he left her this morning after she asked him to stay. She would show him who he was dealing with. However, as she walked away, a sickening feeling developed in her gut.  
“你运气不好，三笠。”她回答道，甩开他的手，径自走开。明日香想让他体会一下今早她请求他留下而他离开时的感受。她要让他知道自己在和谁打交道。然而，当她走开时，一种令人作呕的感觉在她腹中蔓延。

Shinji watched in disbelief as the redhead walked down the corridor and out of sight. He collapsed, he had admitted it, finally told her his feelings and she just shoved it in his face. The tears couldn't come, he just couldn't cry, he couldn't let it out. The poor distressed boy didn't know what to do, all alone, on the floor. Then his face turned into rage, there was one person he could vent his anger out on, if only to make him feel better. He went off in the direction of the Commander's office.  
真嗣难以置信地看着红发女孩沿着走廊走远，直至消失。他瘫倒在地，终于承认了，向她坦白了心意，她却当面践踏。泪水无法涌出，他就是哭不出来，无法宣泄。这个可怜的、心烦意乱的男孩不知所措，独自一人坐在地上。随后，他的脸上转为愤怒，有一个人可以让他发泄怒火，哪怕只是为了让自己感觉好些。他朝着司令官办公室的方向走去。

---

Asuka had gone to Misato's office, she just wanted to leave this depressing place behind. The young girl knocked on the Major's door and it was opened almost immediately by Misato.  
明日香去了美里小姐的办公室，她只想逃离这个令人沮丧的地方。少女敲了敲美里少校的门，门几乎立刻就被美里打开了。

"Hi Asuka, you ready to go now?" Misato asked warmly.  
"嗨，明日香，准备好了吗？" 美里热情地问道。

"Yeah, let's go home" the redhead answered.  
"嗯，我们回家吧。" 红发女孩回答道。

"Where's Shinji?" the older woman asked, concerned.  
"真嗣呢？" 年长的女人担忧地问道。

"He's not coming" Asuka lied, truth is she didn't want to see him.  
“他不会来了。”明日香撒谎道，实际上她是不想见到他。

"Oh… ok" Misato replied, thinking he didn't want to come because of her.  
“哦……好吧。”美里回答，心想他可能是因为她才不想来的。

Misato exited her office and closed the door. The two girls made their way to the car elevator in silence. It was so quiet, they heard every little sound. Every sound reminded Asuka of Shinji and she scowled angrily, trying to rid her thoughts of the boy. Fortunately for her, they had arrived at the car elevator and she eagerly hopped inside her guardian's car. The Major got into the driver's seat and the elevator began its ascent to the surface.  
美里走出办公室，关上了门。两个女孩默默地走向车库电梯。四周静得连一点小声音都能听见。每一个声音都让明日香想起真嗣，她愤怒地皱起眉头，试图将那个男孩从脑海中赶走。幸运的是，她们已经到达了车库电梯，明日香急切地跳进了监护人的车里。美里坐上驾驶座，电梯开始上升，向地面驶去。

"So, how is Shinji?" Misato asked, trying to find out how he was doing.  
“那么，真嗣怎么样了？”美里问道，试图了解他的近况。

"Would you stop asking about him? Don't you care about me as well? About what I went through?" Asuka shot back immediately. The young girl had enough of thinking about him for the moment.  
“你能别再问他的事了吗？难道你就不关心我吗？我经历的那些你就不在乎吗？”明日香立刻回击道。这个年轻女孩此刻已经受够了总是想着他。

Misato opened and closed her mouth, trying to think of something to say but in the end decided it was better to just stay silent. Asuka seemed very agitated, there was a sadness about her and something was bugging her. The Major had very little idea about what had happened, she didn't even know who Aria was because she had been absent most of the time Aria and Shinji had been dating. At the moment, Misato was very cautious about discussing the event as thus far she had been met with gloomy expressions; she was at quite a loss of what to do. The Major did decide, however, that at the moment there was nothing she could do and resolved to discuss this with her two wards tomorrow.  
美里张了张嘴，试图找些话说，但最终决定还是保持沉默为好。明日香显得非常烦躁，她身上有一种悲伤，似乎有什么事情困扰着她。美里对发生的事情知之甚少，她甚至不知道 Aria 是谁，因为她大部分时间都不在场，错过了 Aria 和真嗣交往的时光。此刻，美里非常谨慎，因为到目前为止，每次提起这件事都会遇到阴郁的表情，她完全不知道该怎么办。不过，美里最终决定，目前她无能为力，并决心明天与她的两个养子讨论此事。

As they drove, there wasn't a single star visible in the night sky and clouds had covered the moon. The darkness gave an oppressive feeling to the two girls on their way back to the apartment. Despite the last angel being defeated, neither of them felt happy, neither of them felt proud at saving the world.  
当她们驱车行驶时，夜空中一颗星星也看不见，云层遮住了月亮。黑暗给两个女孩回公寓的路上带来了一种压抑的感觉。尽管最后一个天使已被击败，她们俩都没有感到快乐，也没有因为拯救了世界而感到自豪。

Upon arriving at their apartment, Misato parked the car. They both got out of the car and entered their building. The pair took the elevator up to their floor. They exited the elevator and went to their door. The door had been left wide open and the two of them entered their residence, closing the door behind them. Thankfully, nothing had been taken; obviously no one had come in. Asuka immediately retreated to her room, just wanting to find some peace in sleep.  
到达公寓后，美里停好车。她们都下了车，走进大楼。两人乘电梯上到她们的楼层。走出电梯，来到她们的门前。门大开着，她们进了屋，关上门。幸运的是，什么也没被拿走；显然没有人进来过。明日香立刻回到自己的房间，只想在睡眠中寻找一丝安宁。

Misato sat down on their couch and silently pondered about how Shinji was doing. She wondered what happened these past few days… what happened with the angel. Misato recalled the promise she had made to Asuka in the past that she would not neglect her again. The past few days she hadn't interacted much with the redhead, she was at NERV working hard to make sure they were prepared for what was to come… so that her kids could have a future. The Major had tried her best to make sure Asuka was doing well, but it probably wasn't enough and she had probably neglected Shinji even more as a result. _'I have to talk to them both tomorrow… I have a promise to keep'_  
美里坐在他们的沙发上，默默地思考着真嗣的近况。她想知道过去几天发生了什么……天使的事情怎么样了。美里回想起过去对明日香许下的承诺，她不会再忽视她。过去几天她与红发少女的互动不多，她一直在 NERV 努力工作，确保他们为即将到来的事情做好准备……为了让她的孩子们有一个未来。美里尽力确保明日香过得好，但这可能还不够，她可能因此更加忽视了真嗣。'我明天必须和他们俩谈谈……我有承诺要遵守'

---

The young boy stood in front of the doors to the Commander's office with trepidation. Even though he came to blow off at his father, he still had second thoughts. However, there was nothing to stop him now and he didn't care anymore. Without any further hesitation, he pushed open the door and walked through. Instantly, he saw the Commander's imposing figure behind his desk. At Shinji's entry, the Commander looked down at him curiously.  
少年站在指挥官办公室门前，心中忐忑不安。尽管他是来向父亲发泄的，但他仍有疑虑。然而，现在没有什么能阻止他，他也不再在乎了。没有再犹豫，他推开门走了进去。立刻，他看到了指挥官在办公桌后威严的身影。真嗣一进门，指挥官便好奇地低头看着他。

"Pilot Ikari, state the reason for your presence" the man announced nonchalantly.  
“碇司令，说明你的来意”指挥官漫不经心地宣布道。

"To inform you, _your_ plan has failed you bastard" Shinji shot back.  
"告诉你，你的计划失败了，混蛋" 真嗣回击道。

"Oh?" Gendo prompted. "哦？" 源渡催促道。

"How can you be so cold? Is there any part inside of you that still resembles my father?" the young boy remarked.  
"你怎么能如此冷漠？你内心还有哪一部分像我父亲吗？" 少年质问道。

"Irrelevant questions, why have you come here?" the Commander replied.  
"无关紧要的问题，你为何来此？"指挥官回答道。

"Don't you get it?" Shinji asked, the tears finally starting to trickle down his cheek. "I lost her, I lost Asuka. Your suggestion to use jealousy failed, I should never have done it. To make matters worse, the girl I chose to use to make Asuka jealous was an angel. You know what else? That angel was a good person, I liked her, she was a good friend and she loved me. She loved me, the bastard that I am, even though she knew I was using her all along" he explained.  
"你还不明白吗？"真嗣问道，泪水终于开始顺着他的脸颊滑落。"我失去了她，我失去了明日香。你建议我用嫉妒的方法失败了，我本不该那么做。更糟糕的是，我用来让明日香嫉妒的女孩是个天使。你还知道什么？那个天使是个好人，我喜欢她，她是个好朋友，而且她爱我。她爱我，我这个混蛋，尽管她一直知道我在利用她"他解释道。

The boy couldn't hold back anymore, the dam had been broken and tears flowed freely down his face. "Can you believe that? She forgave me and I _killed_ her. She said I was a good person, what a load of crock. All I was doing was manipulating her to get Asuka back, but I never should have stooped to your level and used someone for my own needs in the first place"  
男孩再也控制不住了，堤坝已被冲破，泪水自由地从他的脸上流淌下来。"你能相信吗？她原谅了我，而我却杀了她。她说我是个好人，真是胡说八道。我所做的只是操纵她来赢回明日香，但我一开始就不该降低自己的底线，利用别人来满足自己的需求"

"Pilot Ikari, I merely gave you a suggestion as the second child is a difficult person. In the end, you were the one who chose to follow my advice" he said emotionlessly.  
"碇司令，我只是作为第二适格者是个难相处的人，给你提了个建议。最终，是你自己选择了听从我的建议" 他毫无感情地说道。

"FATHER YOU DAMN BASTARD! YOU KNEW I WAS DESPERATE, DON'T GIVE ME THAT PATHETIC EXCUSE!" Shinji yelled at him, "I could have gotten her back another way, but now my hope is all lost. Why, how father? How can you forget the pain of loss? What am I supposed to do now?"  
"父亲你这个混蛋！你知道我有多绝望，别给我找这种可悲的借口！" 真嗣对他吼道，"我本可以用其他方法找回她的，但现在我的希望全破灭了。为什么，父亲？你怎么能忘记失去的痛苦？我现在该怎么办？"

"Son…" Gendo started. "儿子……" 源堂开口道。

Shinji looked up, surprised at being addressed as "son" by him. The Commander removed his glasses and fixed his gaze upon the eva pilot.  
真嗣抬头，对他称呼自己为“儿子”感到惊讶。司令摘下眼镜，目光紧紧锁定在 eva 驾驶员身上。

"I never forget what I had with your mother, but the means by which for my instrumentality scenario to occur are gone and so I turned to the only thing left. To make sure that at least you have a chance. You know who I am; I cannot change myself this far ahead. I only suggested to you what I saw as the most successful course of action" the Commander answered.  
“我从未忘记与你母亲共度的时光，但实现我统一化计划的手段已不复存在，于是我转向了仅剩的选择。确保至少你有一线生机。你知道我是谁；我无法在这般境地改变自己。我只是向你建议了我所认为的最成功行动方案。”司令回答道。


"…_**Once you make a choice, you cannot erase the past and you must accept the consequences of your chosen path..."**_  
“…一旦做出选择，你无法抹去过去，必须接受所选道路的后果…”


Shinji sighed, "Asuka's right I am pathetic, I don't deserve her anyway. I guess this is my punishment for the sin I committed." The young boy had stopped crying and paused for a while, the silence dragging on. "I have nothing left to say"  
真嗣叹了口气，“明日香说得对，我真是可悲，反正我也不配拥有她。这大概是对我所犯罪行的惩罚吧。”少年停止了哭泣，沉默了一会儿，寂静持续着。“我无话可说了。”

The Commander placed his tinted glasses back on, once again hiding his facial expression.  
指挥官重新戴上了他的墨镜，再次隐藏了他的面部表情。

"One last piece of advice pilot Ikari… do not give up hope. Dismissed" the older man finished.  
“给碇真嗣驾驶员的最后一条建议……不要放弃希望。解散。”年长者结束了话语。

Shinji turned around and left the Commander's office without saying another word. As he closed the doors behind him and began to walk down the corridor, his mind became lost in his thoughts. The boy felt much relieved at having let out all his anger and tears, but still felt a sense of hopelessness. He remembered how desperate he had been to get Asuka back and his father had suggested using jealousy. It seemed like a good idea at the time and he never once thought about how it would affect the person being used.  
真嗣转过身，一言不发地离开了指挥官的办公室。当他关上身后的门，开始沿着走廊走下去时，他的思绪陷入了沉思。男孩感到释放了所有的愤怒和泪水后轻松了许多，但仍有一种无望的感觉。他记得自己曾多么绝望地想要让明日香回来，而他的父亲建议利用嫉妒。当时这主意似乎不错，他从未想过这会对被利用的人产生什么影响。

On the first day back at school, he had decided to go find some girl that was willing to date him. With the arrival of Aria, his plan had been delayed but then he saw her as the perfect candidate. She was bright and cheerful and it was obvious she liked him. He then waited till Touji pushed him into asking her out so it didn't look suspicious. The only person who was suspicious was Kensuke, but he couldn't say anything so it was fine.  
返校的第一天，他决定去找个愿意和他约会的女孩。随着爱丽亚的到来，他的计划被推迟了，但随后他觉得她是完美的候选人。她开朗活泼，显然喜欢他。于是他等到阿薰推了他一把，让他去表白，这样看起来就不那么可疑了。唯一怀疑的人是剑介，但他什么也不能说，所以没关系。

Two things happened that screwed up his plans. First off, he grew to like Aria and dreaded the moment he would break up with her. Shinji didn't want to see her hurt, but had been too far into the plan to back out. The second was that she was an angel. Of all the girls he picked, he had to pick an angel to go out with; talk about bad luck. The most annoying thing was that Asuka had been so close to breaking her stubbornness; it had almost been worth it. But like all other times, he had failed; she had rejected him, even after he admitted he loved her.  
两件事打乱了他的计划。首先，他开始喜欢上了 Aria，害怕分手的那一刻。真嗣不想看到她受伤，但计划已经进行得太深入，无法回头。其次，她是个天使。在所有他挑选的女孩中，他偏偏选了一个天使来交往；真是倒霉透顶。最令人恼火的是，明日香几乎要打破她的固执了；这几乎值得一试。但和其他时候一样，他失败了；即使他承认爱她，她还是拒绝了他。

To say he felt depressed was an understatement. The boy felt like such a horrible person; not only had he been using Aria, but he had killed her. It seemed like nothing had gone right. He knew things never worked out to how you planned, but did it have to fail completely? Shinji also didn't know how he'd face Asuka now and he didn't want to see Misato either as she would ask questions which he wouldn't want to answer.  
说他感到沮丧都是轻描淡写。这个男孩觉得自己是个可怕的人；他不仅利用了 Aria，还害死了她。似乎一切都没有顺利进行。他知道事情永远不会按照你的计划发展，但难道非要彻底失败吗？真嗣也不知道现在该如何面对明日香，他也不想见美里，因为她会问一些他不想回答的问题。

The male eva pilot looked at his options, he could go home with Misato and Asuka but he really didn't want to. But then what else could he do? There was no way he'd stay at NERV after what had happened; besides he always felt this place was depressing. Maybe he could stay at one of his friend's places. With this, Shinji continued on to the elevator. The boy pressed the button and waited for the lift to come up. _'Why is it coming up? Didn't I use this same lift before?'_ he thought.  
男性 EVA 驾驶员审视着自己的选择，他可以和美里与明日香一起回家，但他实在不想这么做。那么他还能做什么呢？经历了那些事后，他绝不可能留在 NERV；况且他一直觉得这个地方令人压抑。或许他可以去某个朋友那里暂住。想到这里，真嗣继续走向电梯。男孩按下按钮，等待电梯上来。'为什么它会往上走？我不是之前也用过这同一部电梯吗？'他疑惑地想。

As the elevator door opened, he was met with the sight of the first child.  
当电梯门打开时，他迎面见到了第一个孩子。

"Rei?" he asked, surprised.  
“绫波？”他惊讶地问道。

"What is it Shinji?" she asked, confused.  
"什么事，真嗣？" 她困惑地问道。

"Never mind, where are you going now?" he inquired.  
"没关系，你现在要去哪儿？" 他询问道。

"I am returning to the surface so that I may proceed to my apartment" she answered.  
"我要回到地面，然后去我的公寓。" 她回答道。

"Would you mind if I stayed at your apartment with you tonight?" he requested.  
"你介意我今晚和你一起住在你公寓里吗？" 他请求道。

"It is acceptable, you will cause me no issues. May I ask why you request to stay at my residence tonight?" the girl replied.  
"可以的，你不会给我添麻烦的。我能问一下为什么你今晚要求住在我这里吗？" 女孩回答道。

"A lot has happened today and I just can't face Misato and Asuka. And don't worry, I'll return home tomorrow" he explained.  
"今天发生了很多事，我实在不想面对美里和明日香。别担心，我明天就回家" 他解释道。

"I understand. Very well then, let us proceed" she declared.  
"我明白了。那么，我们开始吧" 她宣布道。

Shinji nodded in affirmative and entered the elevator. The two stayed in silence as the elevator ascended. Rei decided to break the silence.  
真嗣点头表示同意，并走进了电梯。两人在电梯上升过程中保持沉默。绫波决定打破沉默。

"That girl, the angel, she approached me on Tuesday and said that she was the same as me. I should have realised then that she was an angel and I could have told you and-" she started.  
"那个女孩，天使，她在周二接近我，说她和我一样。我当时就应该意识到她是天使，我本可以告诉你的——" 她开始说道。

"Rei please, don't try to place the blame on yourself. It's ok, I'll deal with it. No one suspected that, I mean Asuka thought there was something strange about her but I doubt she thought Aria was an angel" Shinji interrupted.  
“丽，请不要试图把责任归咎于自己。没关系，我会处理的。没人怀疑过，我是说，明日香觉得她有些奇怪，但我怀疑她是否认为亚里亚是个天使。”真嗣打断道。

"You just looked very distressed. I am told that this is called 'cheering someone up.' I don't really understand it, but if it makes someone feel better then it is worth trying" Rei replied.  
“你看起来非常苦恼。我听说这叫做‘安慰某人’。我并不真正理解，但如果这能让某人感觉好些，那么尝试一下是值得的。”丽回答道。

Shinji couldn't help smiling a little; Rei was so oblivious when it came to human emotions, but it was nice to see her trying to make him feel better even if she didn't understand what she was doing. The boy went over to the blue haired girl and embraced her warmly. He needed comfort and she gave it to him as she hugged the boy back. Shinji held onto her tightly, fearing the loss of this temporary reprieve from pain.  
真嗣忍不住微微一笑；丽在人情世故上如此迟钝，但看到她努力让他感觉好些，即使她并不明白自己在做什么，也让人感到温暖。男孩走到蓝发女孩身边，热情地拥抱了她。他需要安慰，而她给予了他，同样紧紧地回抱了男孩。真嗣紧紧地抱着她，害怕失去这暂时的痛苦缓解。

The elevator reached its destination and the two eva pilots got off. The pair exited NERV and headed in the direction of Rei's apartment. The night sky was completely black as no stars were visible and clouds covered the moon. All was quiet, as if the entire city was sleeping. A cool night breeze blew about them, making the two teens shiver slightly.  
电梯到达目的地，两位 EVA 驾驶员走了出来。两人离开 NERV，朝着绫波的公寓方向走去。夜空漆黑一片，星星不见踪影，云层遮住了月亮。四周静悄悄的，仿佛整个城市都在沉睡。一阵凉爽的夜风吹过，让两个少年微微颤抖。

Shinji took Rei's hand and she entwined her fingers with his. As they walked hand in hand, Shinji couldn't help but remember how he had walked like this with Aria. He could see her smiling face, the cute way she would look at him when he was talking with her, then an explosion of blood. She was gone; it was so hard to accept. Just this day he had been riding a bike with her, had her holding him tightly and now she was gone forever. Tears threatened to come again, but he had cried all his worth in the Commander's office and he couldn't cry anymore.  
真嗣牵起绫波的手，她将手指与他的交缠在一起。他们手牵手走着，真嗣不禁回想起曾与亚里沙这样走过的情景。他能看到她微笑的脸庞，她看着他时那可爱的模样，然后是一片血色的爆炸。她消失了；这难以接受。就在今天，他们还一起骑着自行车，她紧紧地抱着他，而现在她永远地离开了。泪水再次涌上眼眶，但他在司令的办公室里已经流尽了所有的眼泪，再也无法哭泣。

Finally, the two arrived at the apartment and relief filled Shinji. He knew he could temporarily find peace with sleep, perhaps he would feel better tomorrow. The pair entered the building and walked up the stairs to Rei's room. Arriving at her door, Rei opened it and the two stepped inside before closing the door behind them. Shinji noticed the place looked a lot tidier than the last time he had come. He supposed Rei was really trying to improve herself.  
终于，两人到达了公寓，真嗣感到一阵释然。他知道可以暂时在睡眠中找到安宁，或许明天会感觉好些。两人进入大楼，走上楼梯，来到绫波的房间。到达门口，绫波打开门，两人走进去后关上了门。真嗣注意到这个地方比上次来时整洁多了。他猜想绫波真的在努力提升自己。

The boy let go of Rei's hand and sat down on her couch. The blue haired girl grabbed her nightgown and began to disrobe.  
男孩松开了绫波的手，坐在她的沙发上。蓝发女孩拿起睡裙，开始脱衣。

"Rei, I know you don't understand modesty but please go change in the bathroom" Shinji requested, blushing.  
“绫波，我知道你不理解羞耻感，但请去浴室换衣服。”真嗣请求道，脸红了。

Rei simply nodded and entered her bathroom, closing the door behind her. The male eva pilot went to her cupboard and took out a blanket just as he had done last time. He lay down on the couch, pulling the blanket over him. Soon, Rei had come out of the bathroom dressed in her nightgown. The boy looked at Rei, noting that she looked really beautiful. Unlike Asuka who had a strong attractive beauty, Rei was more the mysterious and calm beauty. The girl went over to Shinji and kissed him on the forehead before moving to her bed. Rei lay down on her bed and pulled her covers over her. There was a moment of silence before Rei spoke up.  
丽只是点了点头，走进浴室，关上了门。男性 eva 驾驶员走到她的橱柜前，像上次一样拿出一条毯子。他躺在沙发上，拉过毯子盖在身上。不久，丽穿着睡衣从浴室出来。男孩看着丽，注意到她看起来真的很美。与有着强烈吸引力的明日香不同，丽更多的是那种神秘而沉静的美。女孩走到真嗣身边，在他额头上轻轻一吻，然后走向自己的床。丽躺在床上，拉过被子盖好。一阵沉默之后，丽开口了。

"Shinji…" Rei started, "You never ended up explaining what happened the last time you were here when Asuka arrived"  
“真嗣…”丽开始说，“你上次在这里时，明日香来了，你还没解释发生了什么。”

"I suppose I should tell you… but it's a little awkward" the boy began explaining. "Because I stayed the night at your place, because Asuka didn't understand your relationship with me and various other reasons… she thought I was cheating on her with you… umm that is… she thought that I was in a romantic relationship with you"  
“我想我应该告诉你…但有点尴尬”男孩开始解释。“因为我留在你这里过夜，因为明日香不理解你和我的关系，还有其他各种原因…她以为我在和你出轨…嗯，也就是说…她以为我和你在谈恋爱。”

"Is that why she called me a 'slut?' Because she thought I was… I think she used the word 'fucking' you? Is that what 'fucking' means?" the girl asked curiously.  
"这就是她为什么叫我'荡妇'的原因吗？因为她以为我是……我想她用了'操'这个词，对吧？'操'是什么意思？" 女孩好奇地问道。

Shinji blushed and stifled a laugh at how Rei so casually said profanities. "Ummm… where do I begin, Rei do you know what 'sex' is?"  
真嗣脸红了，忍住笑意，因为丽如此随意地说着脏话。"嗯……我从哪里开始解释呢，丽，你知道'性'是什么吗？"

"Dr. Akagi has informed me of how humans reproduce, though I must admit the process does sound strange to me" she answered.  
"赤木博士已经告诉我人类是如何繁殖的，不过我必须承认这个过程对我来说听起来很奇怪" 她回答道。

"Well the word 'fucking' is just a more crude way of saying 'having sex' and a 'slut' is a horrible insult. It's a word used to describe a woman who has sex with several different men with little regard for who they are and usually for the pleasure of sex only. In any case, that was all a misunderstanding. I apologise for what Asuka said about you" Shinji explained.  
"嗯，'操'这个词只是表达'做爱'的一种更粗俗的方式，而'荡妇'则是一个非常恶毒的侮辱。这个词用来形容一个女人与多个不同的男人发生性关系，很少考虑对方是谁，通常只是为了性快感。无论如何，那都是一场误会。我为明日香对你说的话道歉" 真嗣解释道。

"I think I understand, I cannot fathom how she came to those conclusions but I suppose it is no longer relevant. Were you and Sohryu having sex?" she asked innocently.  
"我想我明白了，我无法理解她是怎么得出那些结论的，但我想这已经不重要了。你和惣流在做爱吗？" 她天真地问道。

Shinji could not help blushing at how direct Rei was with her questions. "Yes… before she lost her memory. However… it was not all good. Asuka suffered greatly at my hands at the beginning of our relationship… that's why I want you to be understanding with her" he said with sadness.  
真嗣不禁因为绫波问问题的直接而脸红。"是的…在她失忆之前。然而…并不是一切都好。在我们关系开始时，明日香在我手中遭受了极大的痛苦…这就是为什么我希望你能理解她" 他带着悲伤说道。

"While I find her behaviour unpleasant at times, I have no ill feelings towards Sohryu" she replied and paused for a moment. "And… what did you do to her?"  
"虽然我有时觉得她的行为令人不快，但我对相柳并无恶意"她回答道，并停顿了一下。"而且…你对她做了什么？"

"You may not understand the seriousness of what I did when I explain it… if you did you would be disgusted with me as soon as I told you. You see… I…" the boy began, before pausing. It was very difficult to admit this to Rei, but she should know who he was. He didn't even know why he was admitting all this after what happened today, but it did feel slightly cathartic letting go of the secrets. "I forced Asuka… to have sex with me"  
"当我解释我所做的事情的严重性时，你可能无法理解…如果你明白了，你会在我告诉你之后就对我感到厌恶。你看…我…"男孩开始说道，然后停了下来。向丽承认这一点非常困难，但她应该知道他是什么样的人。他甚至不知道为什么在今天发生这些事情之后还要承认这一切，但释放这些秘密确实感觉有些宣泄。"我强迫明日香…和我发生性关系"

"You forced her? Against her will? She would have stopped you or fought back if she did not want to partake in such a process" she said in response, a little confused; she knew Asuka would not placidly accept something she didn't want.  
"你强迫她？违背她的意愿？如果她不想参与这种事情，她会阻止你或反抗的"她回应道，有些困惑；她知道明日香不会平静地接受她不想要的事情。

"She did fight back, but I had cut her with a blade, strangled her, used violence against her to force her to submit… it was abhorrent what I did to her. It's not just because of the physical pain, she was forced to partake in something that is meant to be special, solely for my gratification at her expense. And… it's invasive, she was forced to bear my intercourse… I'm not sure how much you understand what I'm saying. She was forced violently, she was made powerless, it was an evil act Rei… and I did that to her" he admitted.  
"她确实反抗了，但我用刀划伤了她，勒住了她的脖子，对她施以暴力，强迫她屈服……我对她所做的一切令人憎恶。这不仅仅是因为肉体上的痛苦，她被迫参与了一件本应是特别的、只为了满足我的私欲而牺牲她的事情。而且……这是侵犯性的，她被迫承受我的交媾……我不确定你理解我所说的有多少。她被暴力强迫，被剥夺了力量，这是一个邪恶的行为，丽……我就是这样对她做的"他承认道。

The girl stayed silent at the revelation; she certainly did not expect to hear that he did such a thing. Rei couldn't fully comprehend how severely he had hurt the redhead but she had some idea based on how Shinji talked about it. Rei couldn't understand how it could have happened; she didn't feel anything close to that sort of hostility from the boy.  
女孩在得知这一真相后保持沉默；她当然没想到他会做出这样的事。丽无法完全理解他对红发女孩造成了多大的伤害，但根据真嗣谈论此事的方式，她有了一些概念。丽无法理解这是如何发生的；她并没有从男孩身上感受到任何接近那种敌意的情绪。

"Ikari… I… this disturbs me. Why did you do such a thing to Sohryu?" she couldn't help asking.  
"碇……我……这让我感到不安。你为什么要对草薙做这样的事？"她忍不住问道。

"I'm so ashamed of what I did Rei, you are right to be disturbed. I can leave if you want" he suggested.  
"我对所做的事感到非常羞愧，丽，你有理由感到不安。如果你愿意，我可以离开" 他提议道。

"No Shinji… you should stay. I can tell you have changed… Sohryu was in love with you even after… that event and I do not feel that sort of anger from you at all. But it is difficult to… accept hearing this" Rei replied.  
"不，真嗣……你应该留下。我能感觉到你已经改变了……即使在那件事之后，惣流还是爱着你，而我丝毫没有从你身上感受到那种愤怒。但听到这些确实很难……接受" 丽回答道。

"Thanks Rei… I appreciate it. As for your previous question… I can't give you a good answer. There is no justifiable reason for what I did, I was angry at her, she had hurt me, she had insulted me… but it's all so insignificant to what I did. I truly regret it though… that time I was in prison was punishment for doing that to her. During that time, I reflected on my actions a lot. Asuka was very kind to forgive the wrong I did to her" he confessed.  
"谢谢你，丽……我很感激。至于你之前的问题……我无法给你一个合理的答案。我所做的事没有任何正当理由，我当时对她感到愤怒，她伤害了我，她侮辱了我……但这些都与我做的事相比微不足道。我确实后悔了……那段时间我在监狱里，是对我那样对待她的惩罚。在那段时间里，我对自己的行为进行了很多反思。明日香非常宽容，原谅了我对她的伤害" 他坦白道。

"Thank you… for telling me Shinji. If Sohryu forgave you, then I can forgive your act as well. I… apologise for talking about this topic after you looked so down. I did not realise it was this… serious" Rei finished off.  
"谢谢你……告诉我这些，真嗣。如果明日香原谅了你，那么我也可以原谅你的行为。我……为在你看起来如此沮丧之后还提起这个话题而道歉。我没有意识到这件事……如此严重。" 绫波说完。

"I appreciate you listening and… still accepting me" he replied with gratitude before yawning. "Listen Rei, we can talk more tomorrow… I just want to sleep and… put this day behind me. Goodnight Rei"  
"我很感激你倾听并且……仍然接受我" 他带着感激回答，然后打了个哈欠。"听着，绫波，我们明天可以再聊……我现在只想睡觉，……把今天抛在脑后。晚安，绫波"

"It was no problem Shinji, goodnight" she said, closing her eyes.  
"没什么的，真嗣，晚安" 她说着，闭上了眼睛。

At last, Shinji was finally able to close his eyes and find some solace in sleep.  
终于，真嗣得以闭上双眼，在睡眠中寻得一丝慰藉。

The redhead was moving about restlessly in her bed. On the one hand, she wanted to go to sleep because she wanted to just forget about everything at the moment. But on the other hand, she remembered about her nightmares and she didn't have the strength to endure one. In the end, she was really tired and perhaps she had no choice but to take the risk. Frustrated, Asuka threw her covers off of her and sat up on her bed. She looked around the room; she didn't think she could handle another sleepless night.  
红发女孩在床上辗转反侧。一方面，她想入睡，因为此刻她只想忘却一切。但另一方面，她记起了自己的噩梦，没有勇气去承受。最终，她实在疲惫不堪，或许别无选择，只能冒险一试。沮丧之下，明日香掀开被子，坐在床边。她环顾房间，觉得自己无法再忍受又一个无眠之夜。

The girl then opened her drawer randomly, just looking through it to do something. An object caught her eye, the ring. Asuka picked up the beautiful ring and examined it. _'This ring… I understand what Kaji meant now… it was meant for me all along. It was so obvious when I think about it now, that baka loves me,_ _**me**_ _of all people…'_ she thought sadly.  
女孩随后随意打开抽屉，漫无目的地翻找。一个物品吸引了她的目光，那枚戒指。明日香拿起那枚美丽的戒指仔细端详。'这戒指……我现在明白了，加治的意思……它从一开始就是为我准备的。现在想来，那笨蛋爱我，我这样的人……'她悲伤地想道。

Upon reading the inscription, a single tear trickled down the redhead's cheek and dropped onto the floor. _'Love is forever, that's what it says… my mum's love wasn't forever, what bullcrap'_ she thought, another tear making its way down her face.  
读完那段铭文，一滴泪珠从红发女孩的脸颊滑落，滴在了地板上。'爱是永恒的，上面是这样写的……可我妈妈的爱并没有永恒，这简直是胡扯'，她心想，另一滴泪又顺着脸颊流下。


**"…**_**Love doesn't always have a happy ending, it simply doesn't end"**_  
……爱并不总是有幸福的结局，它只是不会结束。


The tears came freely now, all those feelings she had been holding back flowing free. Asuka, the proud arrogant girl who never cried, had finally broken down, all because a little boy named Shinji Ikari…  
泪水此刻自由地流淌，所有她一直压抑的情感都释放了出来。那个从不哭泣、骄傲自大的明日香，终于崩溃了，这一切都只因为一个名叫真嗣的小男孩……

End Notes: If I made at least one person cry after reading this then I have succeeded. Wow Aria's an angel, I hope that was a surprise to most readers. There are many clues which you can work it out from. I also purposely didn't give her the same personality as Kaworu, because I just didn't think that if Kaworu was a girl that he'd act like he did in the series. Kaworu was also my least favourite character. Any parallels Aria had to Mana's character is unintentional but I guess it helped to throw off readers anyway. Oh btw I liked Girlfriend Of Steel, fun game :D, especially the second one hehe.  
尾注：如果我让至少一个人在读完这篇后落泪，那我就成功了。哇，Aria 真是个天使，希望这对大多数读者来说是个惊喜。有很多线索可以让你推断出来。我故意没有赋予她与渚薰相同的性格，因为我觉得如果渚薰是个女孩，他不会像在系列中那样行事。渚薰也是我最不喜欢的角色。Aria 与真嗣的角色的任何相似之处都是无意的，但我想这无论如何都帮助迷惑了读者。哦，顺便说一下，我喜欢《钢铁女友》，有趣的游戏:D，尤其是第二部，呵呵。

I think most people thought that Kaji suggested to use jealousy, though you see I was thinking what advice would Gendo give to his son to get back with Asuka. The answer hit me straight, of course he would suggest to use someone else, that's what Gendo always does.  
我想大多数人认为阿卡伊建议利用嫉妒，但你看，我在想真嗣的父亲源堂会给他儿子什么建议来和明日香复合。答案直接击中了我，当然他会建议利用别人，这是源堂一贯的做法。

About Aria's name I created it by making an anagram of Kaworu Nagisa, see Aria Swung-Oak. If anyone worked out it was anagram for Kaworu Nagisa before I revealed it, you are a genius. It took me near two hours of playing around with letters to come up with her name, I almost gave up too, but then I came up with her name. I thought it was a little dodgy, but my readers wouldn't argue about her name so I put it in.  
关于 Aria 的名字，我是通过 Kaworu Nagisa 的字母重组创造出来的，参见 Aria Swung-Oak。如果有人在我揭示之前就猜到这是 Kaworu Nagisa 的字母重组，那你真是天才。我花了将近两个小时摆弄字母才想出她的名字，差点就放弃了，但最终还是想出来了。我觉得有点牵强，但我的读者们不会对她的名字有异议，所以我就采用了。

I also previously answered questions that reviewers had and gave a few explanations about various parts of the story. But again, most of that is not really relevant now and with the final notes of the new Epilogue I plan to write, the story points will all be explained.  
我也曾回答过评论者的疑问，并就故事的各个部分给出了一些解释。但再次强调，现在这些大多已不相关，随着我计划为新的尾声所写的最终注释，所有故事要点都将得到解释。

Author's Notes: Yay 18th chapter woohoo. This chapter was quite difficult to write originally, additionally because in the past I had been constantly interrupted by my brother.  
作者注：是的，第 18 章 woohoo。这一章本来写起来就挺困难的，再加上以前经常被哥哥打断。

So much of the original notes were answering questions from previous reviewers and much of it is no longer relevant. I mentioned that I have portrayed the eva pilots with all their weaknesses and selfishness because I wanted to show that the eva characters are not goodie two-shoes; both of them are human. I also mentioned Aria was one of the hardest parts of the story to write as she was just being used from the beginning by Shinji – however harsh it was, this story was meant to have such conflict.  
原来的笔记中有很多都是在回答以前审稿人的问题，其中很多已经不再相关了。我提到我描绘了 eva 飞行员的所有弱点和自私，因为我想表明 eva 角色不是好人的两鞋;他们都是人类。我还提到咏叹调是故事中最难写的部分之一，因为她从一开始就被真嗣利用——无论多么残酷，这个故事本来就应该有这样的冲突。

Some notes: 一些注意事项：

Ja wohl mein fuhrer - Yes my leader. However, fuhrer was the term given to Hitler during the Nazi regime and in the context this line is used, it is referring to that.  
Ja wohl mein fuhrer - 是的，我的领袖。然而，“元首”是纳粹政权时期对希特勒的称呼，在使用这句话的上下文中，它指的是希特勒。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 18 (First rewrite – there are a few minor differences but it's mostly the same as before).  
需要注意的是，这是重写的第 18 章（第一次重写 - 有一些细微的差别，但与以前基本相同）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读本文，那么您正在阅读该故事的最新版本。如果您在上一章没有看到此注释，那么您很不幸在我更新所有章节之前开始阅读本文。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节以及格式都会发生变化，这会在进一步阅读时造成一些混乱。**_

Chapter 18: The Last Resort  
第18章：最后的手段

_Shinji broke free of Unit 00's grip and ran towards Aria. Unit 00 decided to go after Asuka instead and charged at her. Being taken totally by surprise, Asuka did not react in time and was knocked over by Unit 00. Unit 00 then pinned Asuka to the floor. Suddenly, a flash came out of nowhere and the angel's AT-Field was neutralised. Shinji grabbed Aria unhindered, his face a mixture of anger and sadness.  
真嗣挣脱了00号的束缚，跑向亚莉亚。 00号部队决定去追击明日香并向她发起冲锋。明日香大吃一惊，反应不及，就被00号机撞倒。00号机随后将明日香按倒在地。突然，一道闪光不知从何而来，天使的AT力场被抵消了。真嗣毫无阻碍地抓住了亚莉亚，他的脸上充满了愤怒和悲伤。_

_Shinji looked at her and said two words, "Why Aria?"  
真嗣看着她，说了两个字：“为什么是亚莉亚？”_

"_Because you're such a loser, what made you think that I would have ever liked you for even one second? I was just using you, because it was fun. But you had been using me too so we're even anyway" Aria replied cruelly._  
“因为你真是个失败者，为什么你认为我会喜欢你哪怕一秒钟？我只是在利用你，因为这很有趣。但你也一直在利用我，所以我们还是扯平了”阿丽亚残忍地回答道。

"_What about all those things you said?" he asked, taken aback._  
“那你说的那些话呢？”他惊讶地问道。

"_All lies obviously, but regardless I'm an angel so just kill me already. You are so pathetic I can't be bothered killing you. You humans will destroy each other anyway and that is far more fitting and enjoyable" Aria said, smiling evilly._  
“显然一切都是谎言，但不管我是天使，所以就杀了我吧。你太可怜了，我懒得杀你。无论如何，你们人类都会互相毁灭，这更合适、更愉快”，阿丽亚说道，邪恶地微笑着。

"_How can you say that Aria? Did what we shared mean nothing to you?" Shinji refuted._  
“你怎么能这么说阿丽亚？我们分享的东西对你来说毫无意义吗？”慎二反驳道。

"_Because I hate you, and to hate is to make sure that person suffers the most pain possible. Physical pain is nowhere near as painful as emotional pain. Hate never has a happy ending, that's why I like it" Aria said, laughing._  
“因为我恨你，而恨就是让那个人遭受尽可能多的痛苦。身体上的痛苦远没有情感上的痛苦那么痛苦。仇恨永远不会有美好的结局，这就是我喜欢它的原因。”阿丽亚笑着说。

"_Aria please-" he started._  
“阿丽亚，请——”他开始说道。

"_Just kill me! I'm sick of listening to your whining already!" the angel shouted at him angrily._  
“杀了我吧！我已经听腻了你的抱怨了！”天使愤怒地对他喊道。

_Shinji looked at the small girl laughing maniacally and didn't move in hesitation.  
真嗣看着狂笑的小女孩，没有犹豫。_

"_Thank you Shinji, watching you suffer made my day" she remarked nastily._  
“谢谢你真嗣，看着你受苦让我很开心”她恶狠狠地说。

_Then Aria's face changed into Asuka's.  
然后阿莉亚的脸变成了明日香的脸。_

"_What are you waiting for third child? You're such a coward, as always, you never have the courage to do anything. You wanted to rape me so desperately. I saw it in your eyes. Well go on, just fuck me and get it over with or do you lack the courage to do so?" the redhead mocked._  
“老三还等什么？你就是个胆小鬼，一如既往，从来没有勇气做任何事，你那么拼命地想强奸我，我从你的眼神里看到了。好啦，操我吧。”还是你缺乏勇气这样做？”红发人嘲笑道。

"_No…NO…NO!" Shinji let out._  
“不不不！”慎二放了出来。

"_Just do it, I know you want to. Hell you even know you'll get away with it, so what's stopping you?" she provoked._  
“就去做吧，我知道你想这么做。天哪，你甚至知道你会逃脱惩罚，那是什么阻止了你呢？”她挑衅了。

"_I love you" the boy said desperately._  
“我爱你”男孩绝望地说。

"_You love me? That is the worst joke I've ever heard!" Asuka rebuked._  
“你爱我？这是我听过的最糟糕的笑话！”明日香斥责道。

_Her face changed back to Aria's._ "_Just kill me!"_  
她的脸又变回了阿莉亚的脸。 “杀了我吧！”

_Her face changed back to Asuka's._ "_Just rape me!"_  
她的脸变回了明日香的样子。 “就强奸我吧！”

"_Just kill me!"_ “杀了我吧！”

"_Just rape me!"_ “就强奸我吧！”

_Shinji smashed his fist into his own chest and ripped his heart out and screamed…  
真嗣用拳头猛击自己的胸口，撕碎了自己的心脏，尖叫起来……_

Shinji awoke screaming at the top of his lungs. The boy was covered with sweat, his face set into a look of horror. Adrenalin pumped through all his veins and his heart was beating fast. He shook nervously, the nightmare he had just experienced felt frighteningly real and it took a while for his mind to register the fact that it had all been a dream. Suddenly, he felt a cool hand caress his face, giving a calming effect on the tormented boy. Shinji finally relaxed and slowed down his breathing.  
真嗣尖叫着醒来。男孩满头大汗，脸上露出惊恐的表情。肾上腺素在他所有的血管中涌动，他的心脏跳动得很快。他紧张地颤抖着，刚刚经历的噩梦感觉真实得可怕，过了好一会儿他才意识到这一切都是一场梦。突然，他感觉到一只冰凉的手抚上了他的脸，让这个饱受折磨的男孩平静下来。真嗣终于放松下来，呼吸也放慢了。

"Are you alright Shinji?" Rei asked, concerned.  
“慎二你还好吗？”雷伊关切地问道。

"I'm… ok" he answered weakly.  
“我……好吧。”他有气无力地回答。

"You look unwell Shinji, are you ill? Why did you scream, are you in pain?" the girl continued questioning.  
“你看起来不太舒服，真嗣，你生病了吗？你为什么尖叫，你疼吗？”女孩继续追问。

"I'm perfectly healthy, well physically anyway. I just had a bad nightmare Rei, that's all. If you don't mind… I really don't want to talk about it" he replied.  
“我非常健康，无论如何身体都很好。我只是做了一个噩梦，Rei，仅此而已。如果你不介意的话……我真的不想谈论这件事”他回答道。

"I see…" she said a little hurt.  
“我明白了……”她有点受伤地说。

Shinji sighed. "Look Rei I understand your concern, but it's alright" he said, attempting a smile but failing. "Also, I don't want to relive it"  
慎二叹了口气。 “听着，Rei，我理解你的担忧，但没关系，”他说，试图微笑，但失败了。 “而且，我也不想重蹈覆辙”

The blue haired girl wrapped her arms around the boy. "Very well Shinji. Despite your earlier behaviour, you seem calmer today"  
蓝发少女用双臂搂住了少年。 “很好，真嗣。尽管你之前表现得很好，但今天你看起来平静多了”

"Trust me Rei, I'm not calm at all. Yesterday I had to kill a good friend and Asuka… well you know her" Shinji remarked.  
“相信我，丽，我一点也不冷静。昨天我不得不杀死一个好朋友和明日香……你了解她”真嗣说道。

Rei nodded in understanding.  
雷表示理解地点点头。

"I don't really know _what_ exactly to do, but I do know that I have to face her, despite how difficult and painful it will be. And so, I must appear calm to confront her or I will most definitely fail" Shinji explained.  
“我真的不知道到底该怎么做，但我确实知道我必须面对她，尽管这将是多么困难和痛苦。所以，我必须表现得冷静面对她，否则我肯定会失败。”真嗣解释道。

"You are welcome to stay at my residence today if you do not feel ready" the girl offered.  
“如果你还没有准备好，欢迎你今天住在我的住处。”女孩说道。

"Thanks for the offer, but I can't run away, not this time. It has to be now, while she is vulnerable, I have to face the storm…" he resolved, moving out of Rei's embrace.  
“谢谢你的好意，但我不能逃跑，这次不行。必须是现在，趁着她很脆弱，我必须面对风暴……”他下定决心，从丽的怀抱中移开。

Shinji stood up, his face uneasy. He knew he was almost certainly doomed to fail, but he had to at least try, not just for him but also for the redhead.  
慎二站了起来，脸上满是不安。他知道他几乎注定会失败，但他至少必须尝试一下，不仅是为了他，也是为了红发。


_**"One last piece of advice pilot Ikari… do not give up hope…"  
“最后一条忠告飞行员碇……不要放弃希望……”**_


Rei stood up, turned her back to him and leant against him, holding his hands in hers. Shinji looked up, fear biting at him. Steeling himself he moved forward, letting go of Rei's hands and exiting her room. Whatever dismal amount of strength and courage he had left, kept him from running back in. The girl kept her back turned to him as the boy steadied his beating heart and walked down the stairs. As Shinji went down the stairs, he heard Rei's door close. He made it down all the way and exited the building.  
雷站起来，背对着他，靠在他身上，握住他的手。真嗣抬起头，恐惧袭来。他定定神，放开丽的手，往前走，走出了她的房间。无论他还剩下多少微弱的力量和勇气，都阻止了他跑回来。当男孩稳定住跳动的心脏并走下楼梯时，女孩背对着他。真嗣下楼时，听到丽的门关上的声音。他一路下来，走出了大楼。

The boy felt the rush of cool morning air in his face as he exited the building. Shinji momentarily wondered how Rei had known about the angel yesterday, but shrugged it off. He turned his head in the direction of their apartment and took a step. As he walked, many thoughts raged in his head; some trying to convince him to run and some, a very small amount, to keep going. His confrontation with Asuka yesterday had left him feeling many things. One of the strongest being anger, he had really wanted to kill her yesterday as he had done to Aria. However, as much he had wanted to hurt her or force her to be his he just couldn't do it; he loved her.  
当男孩走出大楼时，他感到清晨凉爽的空气扑面而来。真嗣一时想知道丽昨天是怎么知道天使的事的，但耸了耸肩。他扭头看向他们公寓的方向，迈出了一步。他一边走，一边脑子里闪过许多念头。有些人试图说服他逃跑，有些人则说服他继续前进。昨天与明日香的对峙让他感触良多。最强烈的情绪之一是愤怒，他昨天真的很想杀了她，就像他对阿丽亚所做的那样。然而，尽管他很想伤害她，或者强迫她成为他的人，但他却做不到。他爱她。

And so, Shinji continued to walk on to his apartment where he would confront Sohryu Asuka Langley.  
于是，真嗣继续走向他的公寓，在那里他将与宗流·明日香·兰利对峙。

---

The redhead woke up. Fortunately, she had had a dreamless sleep and was able to finally relieve her drowsiness; she felt a lot better than she had yesterday. Asuka sat up on her bed, finally remembering how she had fallen asleep. She had started crying and fallen onto her bed, crying herself to sleep. The girl couldn't believe she had cried over Shinji, she had promised herself she would never cry again, what made him so special?  
红发醒了。好在她睡了一个无梦的觉，总算是解除了睡意。她感觉比昨天好多了。明日香从床上坐起来，终于想起自己是怎么睡着的。她开始哭泣，倒在床上，哭着睡着了。女孩不敢相信她为真嗣哭了，她发誓自己再也不会哭了，是什么让他如此特别？


_**"I love you Asuka" “我爱你明日香”**_


Asuka had heard that line from so many boys, especially in all the love letters she had received at school. But what made it different when Shinji said it? _'He actually meant it, I can tell when he's lying and that's what surprises me the most; he wasn't lying. How does he get under my skin? Why did it hurt so much to leave him yesterday? Could I possibly have feelings for the third child? But that's just not possible, yet it's the only explanation. Regardless if my pathetic heart has opened up to him, I don't need anyone. I will shove him away like all other times and I'll be strong like I always am, be independent like I always am, be superior like I always am and be… miserable like I always am…'_  
明日香从很多男孩那里听到过这句话，尤其是在她在学校收到的所有情书中。但当真嗣说出这句话时，情况有何不同呢？ “他确实是这么想的，我能看出他什么时候在撒谎，这就是最让我惊讶的地方；”他没有说谎。他怎么会惹我生气呢？为什么昨天离开他会这么痛苦？我可能对第三个孩子有感情吗？但这是不可能的，但却是唯一的解释。不管我可怜的心是否向他敞开，我都不需要任何人。我会像其他时候一样把他推开，我会像往常一样坚强，像往常一样独立，像往常一样优越，而且……像往常一样痛苦……”

The redhead got off her bed and stretched her arms. She walked to her door and exited her room. Noticing the apartment was extremely quiet, she moved to Shinji's room and wrenched his door open. Asuka was a little surprised when she noticed he wasn't there, but then soon remembered she had come home without Shinji because she didn't want to see him. Perhaps he found Misato missing and just decided to go to one of his friend's houses. The young girl stood there for a while in his doorway, just staring at his bed.  
红发女郎下了床，伸展双臂。她走到门口，退出了房间。她注意到公寓里非常安静，于是走到真嗣的房间，用力打开了门。当明日香发现他不在时，她有点惊讶，但很快就想起她回家时没有真嗣，因为她不想看到他。也许他发现美里失踪了，所以决定去他朋友的家里。少女在他的门口站了一会儿，只是盯着他的床。

"He's not there" a voice announced.  
“他不在那儿”一个声音宣布。

"I can see that" Asuka replied angrily.  
“我看得出来”明日香愤怒地回答。

"Then stop standing there already" the other voice continued.  
“那就别站在那里了。”另一个声音继续说道。

The redhead turned around to see Misato looking at her slightly annoyed. _'That's why it was so quiet, Misato wasn't snoring'_ Asuka thought. Seeing the Major had the young girl's attention, Misato spoke up.  
红发回头，看到美里有些恼怒地看着她。 “这就是为什么这么安静，美里没有打鼾。”明日香想道。见少校吸引了少女的注意，美里开口说道。

"Now Miss Sohryu, you're sitting down at the table with me and you're going to tell me what happened yesterday" the older woman ordered.  
“现在，素柳小姐，你和我一起坐在桌边，你要告诉我昨天发生了什么，”年长的女人命令道。

"And if I don't want to?" Asuka replied defiantly.  
“如果我不愿意呢？”明日香挑衅地回答道。

"You have no choice" Misato shot back.  
“你别无选择。”美里反驳道。

"I don't care! I won't do it!" the redhead retorted.  
“我不在乎！我不会这么做！”红发反驳道。

Misato just grabbed the redhead's wrist and pulled the stubborn girl along. Asuka screamed and shouted, but Misato ignored it and sat her down at the dining table. The Major had been sick of Asuka getting her way all this time. Misato had no idea what had happened with Shinji, but she knew Asuka was related. If she asked Shinji, she knew he would never say anything against Asuka, she needed to hear what happened from Asuka herself. The redhead was glaring at Misato furiously.  
美里只是抓住红发的手腕，拉着顽固的少女往前走。明日香尖叫着，大叫着，但美里没有理睬，让她坐在餐桌旁。少校已经厌倦了明日香一直为所欲为。美里不知道真嗣发生了什么事，但她知道明日香有关系。如果她问真嗣，她知道他永远不会对明日香说任何话，她需要听明日香亲口说发生了什么。红发男子愤怒地瞪着美里。

"I have been away most of the day each day since Wednesday and haven't been monitoring you two as I was caught up at NERV. So to start, you will tell me what happened while I was gone" Misato directed.  
“从周三开始，我每天大部分时间都在外面，并且因为我被 NERV 困住，所以没有监视你们两个。所以首先，你们要告诉我我不在的时候发生了什么，”美里指示道。

"Nothing happened" Asuka replied defiantly.  
“什么都没发生。”明日香挑衅地回答道。

"Don't give me that crap, both of your sync ratios were abysmal. I'll ask again, what happened while I was gone?" Misato repeated.  
“别跟我废话了，你们两个的同步率都很糟糕。我再问一遍，我不在的时候发生了什么？”美里重复道。

"Shinji hooked up with some girl at school alright? I hated this girl, she pissed me off to no end. Yesterday, Shinji and me had a fight because he left me alone at home bored out of my ass just to go to his girlfriend's house" the redhead answered.  
“真嗣在学校勾搭了一个女孩好吗？我讨厌这个女孩，她把我气坏了。昨天，真嗣和我吵架了，因为他把我一个人留在家里无聊，只为了去他女朋友家。”房子”红发回答。

"That's all? You both had such low sync ratios because of that?" the older woman said incredulously.  
“仅此而已？你们的同步率都这么低，就是因为这个吗？”老妇人难以置信的说道。

"Well as if I know what Shinji was thinking, but I was sure as hell pissed. Definitely ruined my already crap day" Asuka shot back.  
“好吧，好像我知道真嗣在想什么，但我确实非常生气。这绝对毁了我本就糟糕的一天。”明日香反击道。

"And what happened with the angel?" Misato inquired, continuing on.  
“天使怎么了？”美里继续问道。

"Well guess what, Shinji's girlfriend _was_ the angel. I told him she was strange, but he didn't listen. He killed her…" the redhead paused remembering how much she wanted Aria dead, thinking it would solve all her problems, but it had only made her feel worse, "…and then he passed out so I carried that moron back up with me. Then he told me he loved me and I told him to rack off! Understood Major Katsuragi?"  
“好吧，你猜怎么着，真嗣的女朋友是天使。我告诉他她很奇怪，但他不听。他杀了她……”红发停了下来，想起她是多么希望阿丽亚死，认为这会解决她所有的问题，但是这只会让她感觉更糟，“……然后他昏倒了，所以我把那个白痴带了回来。然后他告诉我他爱我，我让他放手！明白葛城少校吗？”

"He told you he loved you?" Misato asked, a little surprised.  
“他告诉你他爱你？”美里有些惊讶地问道。

"Yes, that baka actually said that" the young girl confirmed.  
“是的，那个baka确实是这么说的。”少女确认道。

"So why did you shove him away? Didn't he go through enough already?" the Major replied.  
“那你为什么把他推开？他经历的还不够多吗？”少校回答道。

"Because Shinji is just a pathetic little boy, why would I want to be with him? Furthermore, he was going out with that slut, which proves he wasn't in love with me. Besides, I don't need anyone and I was making my point!" Asuka snapped.  
“因为真嗣只是一个可怜的小男孩，我为什么要和他在一起？而且他还和那个贱人出去，这证明他不爱我。再说了，我不需要任何人，我正在表达我的观点！”明日香厉声说道。

"Regardless of whether he went out with that girl or not, he does love you" Misato assured.  
“不管他是否和那个女孩出去，他确实爱你。”美里保证道。

"Even if he did, what difference does it make?" the redhead shot back.  
“就算他这么做了，那又有什么区别呢？”红发女郎反击道。

"It makes all the difference! He is a person that will understand you better than anyone else because he lives with you and pilots an eva like you. Asuka you can't do this to yourself, you have to let go of the past. I'll tell you right now that you cannot callous the soul, it always hurts the same if not more the next time" Misato explained, trying to get through to the redhead. "You must get past your fear of pain and abandonment, running away does not solve anything. Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists. Running away is the same as denying it exists, the only way you can bear the pain is to have happiness to pull you through. Being alone does not bring you happiness!"  
“这很重要！他是一个比任何人都更了解你的人，因为他和你住在一起，驾驶着像你一样的 eva。明日香，你不能这样对自己，你必须放弃过去。我现在就告诉你，你不能麻木不仁的灵魂，下一次它总是会伤害同样的，甚至更多。”美里解释道，试图接通红发女郎的电话。 “你必须克服对痛苦和被遗弃的恐惧，逃跑并不能解决任何问题。只有当我们知道痛苦会结束时，痛苦才是可以忍受的，而不是否认它的存在。逃跑和否认痛苦的存在是一样的，唯一的方法你能忍受痛苦，才能有幸福陪伴你度过，孤独并不能给你带来幸福！”

"Don't lecture me! You don't know anything Misato!" the young girl retorted.  
“别教训我！美里你什么都不知道！”少女反驳道。

"As a matter of fact, I do. First of all, don't forget I know about your past and secondly I now have Kaji" Misato countered.  
“事实上，我知道。首先，别忘了我知道你的过去，其次我现在有了加持。”美里反驳道。

"But you tried to kill him!" Asuka rebuked.  
“但你却想杀他！”明日香斥责道。

"Yes, I was ordered to kill him but you know what? You don't know how much you want something till it's gone. Don't make the same mistake as me; I was lucky that he survived" the Major advised.  
“是的，我被命令杀掉他，但你知道吗？直到它消失之前你都不知道自己有多想要某样东西。不要犯和我一样的错误；我很幸运他活了下来”少校建议道。

"NO! THAT DICKHEAD WILL JUST LEAVE ME LIKE ALL THE OTHERS!" Asuka yelled.  
“不！那个白痴只会像其他人一样离开我！”明日香喊道。

"I never left you Asuka and as far as I can tell, neither has he" Misato replied calmly.  
“我从未离开过你明日香，据我所知，他也没有离开过你。”美里平静地回答道。


"…_**Even after all that crap you put me through, despite how you cold-heartedly wanted me to kill Aria and the fact that you've rejected me and told me we will never be together millions of times I…still do"**_  
“......即使在你让我经历了那么多的废话之后，尽管你冷酷无情地希望我杀死阿丽亚，并且事实上你拒绝了我并告诉我我们永远不会在一起数百万次，我......仍然如此”


Asuka desperately fought the urge to cry, she would _not_ cry over him again. The redhead stood up abruptly, sending her chair flying backwards.  
明日香拼命忍住想哭的冲动，她不会再为他哭泣了。红发猛地站了起来，椅子被掀飞了出去。

"Even so, it does not matter because I DO NOT love him!" the redhead shouted at Misato.  
“即便如此，也没关系，因为我不爱他！”红发对美里喊道。

"It is not for me to say whether you love him or not, it is something you must find out and realise by yourself" the older woman remarked.  
“你爱不爱他，这不是我能说的，而是你自己去发现、去体会的。”老妇人说道。

"This conversation is over!" Asuka snapped, going off to her room and slamming the door.  
“这次谈话结束了！”明日香厉声说道，转身走进自己的房间，关上了门。

The sound seemed to echo throughout the apartment as a stunned Misato was left sitting at the dining table. The Major just sat there wondering if she had done the right thing. But then, she figured it must be so hard on Shinji. Whatever his reasons for dating that other girl, it couldn't be because he loved her; that much she knew. Having to kill his girlfriend, then having been rejected by Asuka after admitting his feelings to her must be having a heavy toll on him. Shinji had done all the initiative so far and Asuka just required a little push, well maybe a massive push, but a push nonetheless. _'That boy needs all the help he can get…'_  
这声音似乎在整个公寓里回响，只有震惊的美里坐在餐桌旁。少校只是坐在那里想知道她是否做了正确的事。但转念一想，她觉得这对真嗣来说一定很难受。无论他与另一个女孩约会的原因是什么，都不可能是因为他爱她；而是因为他爱她。她知道的就这么多。不得不杀死他的女朋友，然后在向她承认自己的感情后又被明日香拒绝，这一定对他造成了沉重的打击。到目前为止，真嗣已经采取了所有主动行动，而明日香只需要一点点推动，也许是大力推动，但无论如何还是要推动。 “那个男孩需要他能得到的所有帮助……”

As she thought about the boy, she did wonder where Shinji was at the moment. When he came back, he would also have some explaining to do. The Major stood up from her chair and walked into the kitchen, before opening the fridge and taking out a beer. Opening the can, she drained its contents in one gulp. Now that she felt better, she went back to the dining table only to hear the front door open. Misato turned her head to see Shinji entering their residence.  
当她想起那个男孩时，她确实想知道真嗣现在在哪里。等他回来，他也得解释一下。少校从椅子上站起来，走进厨房，打开冰箱，拿出一瓶啤酒。打开罐子，她一口气喝光了里面的东西。现在感觉好多了，她回到餐桌前，却听到前门打开的声音。美里转过头，看到真嗣走进了他们的住处。

"I'm home" Shinji called out.  
“我回来了。”真嗣喊道。

The woman walked over to where Shinji was and he looked at her curiously.  
女人走到真嗣所在的地方，真嗣好奇地看着她。

"You're sitting down at the table with me" she said firmly, turning around and walking off to the dining room.  
“你和我一起坐在桌边。”她坚定地说，转身朝餐厅走去。

"Ok, but why?" he asked, following her.  
“好吧，但是为什么呢？”他追随她问道。

"We're going to have a talk" she simply replied.  
“我们要谈谈。”她简单地回答。

Shinji stayed silent as they sat down at the dining table. Misato gave him a solemn look before starting the conversation.  
两人在餐桌边坐下时，真嗣保持沉默。美里严肃地看了他一眼，然后开始谈话。

"Now the past few days I've been away… I know something had happened to you two because of your low sync scores before battling the angel. I've already asked Asuka about it and she said you started to date a girl. Is this true?" Misato started off.  
“这几天我不在……我知道你们两个发生了什么事，因为你们在与天使战斗之前的同步分数很低。我已经问过明日香了，她说你们开始和一个女孩约会了。是吗？”这是真的？”美里出发了。

"Yeah" he admitted. “是的”他承认。

"Why in the world did you start dating another girl? I thought you loved Asuka" she said a little loudly.  
“你到底为什么开始和另一个女孩约会？我以为你爱明日香”她大声说道。

"Of course I love Asuka! I was dating another girl as part of a plan to make Asuka jealous. It failed horribly, but I shouldn't have done it in the first place" the boy explained.  
“我当然爱明日香！我正在和另一个女孩约会，作为让明日香嫉妒的计划的一部分。它失败得很惨，但我一开始就不应该这样做”男孩解释道。

Misato chuckled slightly. "You were trying to get Asuka jealous? Who gave you that idea? Kaji?"  
美里轻轻一笑。 “你想让明日香嫉妒？是谁给你出这个主意的？加持？”

"No, it was my father" Shinji confessed.  
“不，是我父亲。”真嗣承认道。

"You mean last week when he requested to talk to you, that's what he said to you?" the Major asked.  
“你是说上周他要求和你谈话时，他就是这么对你说的？”少校问道。

"Yeah" he replied. “是的”他回答道。

"Well, that explains everything actually. That's why you were so down yesterday, Asuka told me about the fight you two had you see" she commented. "Anyway, did you tell Asuka why you were dating the other girl?"  
“好吧，这实际上解释了一切。这就是为什么你昨天如此沮丧，明日香告诉我你们两个看到的战斗”她评论道。 “不管怎样，你告诉明日香你为什么要和另一个女孩约会吗？”

"She didn't give me the chance. Speaking of which, where is she now?" he inquired.  
“她没有给我机会，说起来，她现在在哪里？”他询问道。

"She's in her room at the moment. After our discussion, she left in a fit of rage" Misato answered, sighing.  
“她现在在自己的房间里，我们商量之后，她就气冲冲地走了。”美里叹了口气说道。

"What did you say?" Shinji asked, sweat dropping.  
“你说什么？”真嗣汗流浃背地问道。

"Hey! Don't try to blame it on me! She's just being her typical angry self… I was just trying to give her a little push towards understanding her feelings" she defended.  
“嘿！别试图把责任归咎于我！她只是表现出典型的愤怒状态……我只是想给她一点推动力，让她理解自己的感受”她辩解道。

"I barely lack the courage to confront her as it is, she really hurt me yesterday and to see all the effort I had gone through just to have a chance at being with her to be in vain was aggravating. I was only able to get out of my depression because Rei comforted me a little, but even now I'm only just managing not to lose myself" Shinji said, looking downcast.  
“我几乎没有勇气面对她，她昨天真的伤害了我，看到我为了有机会和她在一起而付出的所有努力都徒劳无功，这让我很恼火。我只能得到丽安慰了我一下，让我摆脱了抑郁，但即使现在我也只是设法不迷失自己。”真嗣一脸沮丧地说道。

"You were at Rei's last night?" she asked.  
“昨晚你在雷家吗？”她问。

"Yeah" he confirmed. “是的”他确认道。

Misato tried to give him a cheery expression; he needed all the support he could get. "In any case… just let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I'm sorry I was away these past few days, maybe things would have been different if I wasn't so busy at work"  
美里试图让他表现出愉快的表情，但他并没有这么做。他需要他能得到的所有支持。 “无论如何……如果有什么我可以帮忙的，请告诉我。很抱歉这几天我不在，如果我工作不是那么忙，也许事情会有所不同”

"That's ok, honestly, you had to do what you had to do. And thanks by the way, I appreciate it… I think all you can do at the moment is wish me luck" the boy requested.  
“没关系，说实话，你必须做你必须做的事。顺便说一句，谢谢，我很感激……我想你现在能做的就是祝我好运”男孩请求道。

"Good luck Shinji, you'll need it" Misato replied.  
“祝你好运，真嗣，你会需要它的。”美里回答道。

Shinji just nodded and moved in the direction of Asuka's room. _'How does he get back up after everything, no matter what hits him? How does he act so calm when he's hurting so much inside? I hope you'll be okay Shinji'_ Misato thought.  
真嗣只是点了点头，就朝明日香房间的方向走去。 “无论遭遇什么打击，他如何在一切之后重新站起来？当他内心受到如此严重的伤害时，他如何表现得如此冷静？希望你一切都好，真嗣美里想。

The boy just stared at the redhead's door. Minutes passed by, but it felt like hours. There were so many things he wanted to do, run away, barge through the door or just simply wait and stare. Eventually he reached up and knocked on her door.  
男孩只是盯着红发的门。几分钟过去了，但感觉就像几个小时。他想做的事情太多了，逃跑，闯门，或者只是等待和凝视。最终他还是伸手敲了敲她的门。

"Go away!" was the immediate response.  
“离开！”这是立即的回应。

Deciding that knocking or requesting permission to enter wouldn't work, Shinji just opened the door and rushed into her room.  
真嗣觉得敲门或者请求进入都不管用，于是就打开门冲进了自己的房间。

"Oh my God Asuka, I heard a star fell from the sky and landed in this room! Wow! I didn't know it was so pretty" he exclaimed.  
“天哪，明日香，我听到一颗星星从天而降，落在这个房间里！哇！我不知道它这么漂亮”他惊呼道。

Asuka fought the urge to smile and stood up, slapping the male eva pilot on the face.  
明日香强忍住微笑的冲动，站起来，一巴掌打在了男EVA飞行员的脸上。

"You come into my room to say something so stupid? You think I would fall for such a lame line?" the spat angrily.  
“你到我房间来就说这么蠢的话？你认为我会接受这种蹩脚的台词吗？”愤怒地吐口水。

"No, I was just trying to get your attention. I guess I succeeded" he replied, attempting to smile.  
“不，我只是想引起你的注意。我想我成功了”他回答道，试图微笑。

"Well then, what do you want? You want to waste more of my time with your pathetic presence?" she shot back nastily.  
“那么，你想做什么？你想用你这个可悲的存在来浪费我更多的时间吗？”她恶狠狠地回击。

"No, I wanted to talk to you" he answered.  
“不，我想和你谈谈。”他回答道。

"I already talked with Misato enough about you" Asuka retorted, sighing.  
“关于你，我已经和美里谈够了。”明日香叹了口气反驳道。

"You did?" Shinji prompted.  
“你做到了？”真嗣提示道。

"Yeah, she thought it was cruel of me to just shove you away like I did yesterday, especially after what you went through" the girl explained.  
“是的，她认为我像昨天一样把你推开，这太残忍了，尤其是在你经历了这些之后。”女孩解释道。

"Did you think it was cruel?" he asked.  
“你觉得这很残忍吗？”他问。

"No, of course not! I was telling you straight off so that you would abandon any hope, I think that's less cruel than leaving you hope so you would be disappointed later" Asuka remarked.  
“不，当然不是！我直截了当地告诉你，让你放弃任何希望，我认为这比让你希望然后让你失望要来得残酷。”明日香说道。

"So, you were thinking of me?" he queried.  
“所以，你在想我吗？”他问道。

"No, I just didn't want you stalking me or anything!" she answered.  
“不，我只是不想让你跟踪我什么的！”她回答。

"Err Asuka… I happen to live with you…" he countered.  
“呃明日香……我碰巧和你住在一起……”他反驳道。

"I know! Why the hell are you so calm anyway? I thought you'd be in depressed Shinji mode, crying and apologising over everything" the girl refuted.  
“我知道！你到底为什么这么冷静？我以为你会处于抑郁状态的真嗣模式，为所有事情哭泣并道歉”女孩反驳道。

"I guess you have rubbed off on me" he commented.  
“我想你已经感染了我”他评论道。

"Shinji, what are you really here for?" she asked seriously.  
“慎二，你来这里到底是为了什么？”她认真地问道。

"I want you to know why I was dating Aria" Shinji began.  
“我想让你知道我为什么和阿丽亚约会”真嗣开始说道。

"…"

"You see the only reason I dated Aria was because I was trying to make you jealous, that's the truth" he admitted.  
“你看，我和阿丽亚约会的唯一原因是因为我想让你嫉妒，这是事实，”他承认。


_**"No, it's not true, it was**_ **I** _**who became her boyfriend to use her…"**_  
“不，这不是真的，是我成为她男朋友，利用她的……”


Asuka was a little surprised at his admission, but it made complete sense and explained his actions over the past few days entirely. What she had been clinging onto for all this time as to why he couldn't love her, was in fact one of the strongest reasons to support the fact that he did love her; the redhead was running out of excuses.  
明日香对他的承认有些惊讶，但这完全有道理，也完全解释了他这几天的举动。她一直坚持认为他为什么不能爱她，事实上这是支持他确实爱她这一事实的最有力的理由之一；他爱她。红发女郎已经没有借口了。

"Well… I did become a _little_ jealous of your attention, you almost completely ignored me after all. But I hate being ignored is all, it doesn't mean anything else at all" she defended.  
“嗯……我确实有点嫉妒你的关注，毕竟你几乎完全忽视了我。但我讨厌被忽视就是这样，这根本不意味着其他任何事情”她辩解道。

"Why did you want me to stay with you then?" Shinji asked her.  
“那你为什么要我留在你身边？”真嗣问她。

"I was bored" she answered.  
“我很无聊”她回答。

"Why did you kiss me then?" he continued.  
“那你为什么要吻我？”他继续。

"I was bored. Just like the last time I kissed you, excluding play practice, I was bored then too" the redhead elaborated.  
“我很无聊，就像上次我吻你一样，除了练习之外，我当时也很无聊。”红发解释道。

"You were just bored? Why were you so angry when you thought I loved Aria then?" the boy pushed, trying to break Asuka's stubbornness.  
“你只是觉得无聊？为什么当你以为我爱Aria时你那么生气？”男孩用力一推，试图打破明日香的固执。

"I was annoyed that you were treating her more important than me" Asuka admitted.  
“我很生气你把她看得比我还重要”明日香承认道。

"Since when have you cared about what people think about you or how I treat you compared to other girls? Why were you really angry?" he countered.  
“你从什么时候开始关心别人对你的看法，或者与其他女孩相比，我如何对待你？你为什么这么生气？”他反驳道。

Asuka stayed silent. 明日香保持沉默。

"Were you angry because you thought I had chosen her over you?" the boy suggested.  
“你生气是因为你认为我选择了她而不是你吗？”男孩提议道。

"Definitely not!" Asuka retorted immediately.  
“当然不！”明日香立刻反驳道。

"Then why?" he shot back promptly.  
“那么为什么？”他立即还击。

"I… I just wanted… I don't know" Asuka replied, struggling to understand herself.  
“我……我只是想……我不知道”明日香回答道，努力理解自己。

Finally, Shinji had the upper hand. "I can show you why"  
最终，真嗣占据了上风。 “我可以告诉你为什么”

"How-" she started, before being cut off by Shinji's lips on hers.  
「怎么——」她刚开口，就被真嗣的嘴唇打断了。

The boy pushed her down onto the bed, moving on top of her and increasing his assault on her quivering lips. The girl struggled slightly against him, but soon gave in. Shinji parted from her lips, but moved his mouth down to her neck where he started to nuzzle her. Asuka let out a moan as she felt his warm mouth on her neck. She tried to push him off of her, but found herself clutching onto him instead. The girl felt something pressing against her thigh and realised he was aroused, as was she. _'I can't think straight… everything is so complicated, what do I want from Shinji? What am I doing?'_ she thought as she tried to resist his efforts.  
男孩把她推倒在床上，压在她身上，加大了对她颤抖的嘴唇的攻击力度。女孩轻轻地反抗着他，但很快就屈服了。真嗣离开了她的嘴唇，但他的嘴移到了她的脖子上，开始用鼻子蹭她。当明日香感觉到他温暖的嘴唇贴在她的脖子上时，她发出了一声呻吟。她试图把他推开，却发现自己却紧紧抓住了他。女孩感觉到有什么东西压在她的大腿上，意识到他和她一样被唤起。 “我无法正常思考……一切都那么复杂，我想从真嗣那里得到什么？我在做什么？'她一边想，一边试图抵抗他的努力。

Shinji moved his hand down to the girl's chest and Asuka gasped as she felt him fondle her breast.  
真嗣把手移到女孩的胸前，当明日香感觉到他抚摸着她的胸部时，她倒吸了一口气。

"Shinji… stop!" she finally let out.  
“真嗣……站住！”她终于释然了。

Immediately, the boy halted his actions and looked at her questioningly. The redhead was panting slightly. His hands were still on either side of her and their faces were mere inches away, looking at each other intensely.  
男孩立刻停下了动作，疑惑地看着她。红发微微喘着气。他的双手仍然放在她的两侧，两人的脸仅相距几英寸，目光深邃地看着对方。

"Look… this can't happen Shinji, I don't know why you can kiss so well, but it doesn't matter. I… don't love you and we can't be together. I can see your feelings are genuine and perhaps… I led you on somehow, so I'll let this go. This is where it ends… just leave me alone, give it up already" Asuka said, acknowledging his admission at last.  
“听着……这不可能发生，真嗣，我不知道为什么你能吻得这么好，但这没关系。我……不爱你，我们不能在一起。我能看到你的感受真诚的，也许……我以某种方式引导了你，所以我会让这一切结束……就让我一个人呆着吧，已经放弃了”明日香说道，最后承认了他的承认。

Even though Asuka was being a lot nicer this time, Shinji's suppressed emotions were coming back again and he desperately fought to keep himself under control; he was so close after all.  
虽然明日香这次表现得好很多了，但真嗣压抑的情绪又回来了，他拼命地控制着自己；毕竟他是如此接近。

"But Asuka, I love you! Surely you must feel something at least close to that! I know it's hard for you to admit any feelings you may have but… I'm not gonna hold it over you… we can move at a slower place… we can figure this out. Don't give this up!" Shinji responded desperately.  
“但是明日香，我爱你！当然你一定有某种至少接近的感觉！我知道你很难承认你可能有的任何感觉，但是……我不会把它压在你身上……我们可以放慢速度这个地方……我们可以解决这个问题，不要放弃！”真嗣绝望地回应。

"Enough! How can I make it _any_ clearer?" she rebuked, shoving him off of her. "Read my lips Shinji, I-do-not-love-you, I-do-not-want-to-be-to-ge-ther. I don't need anyone alright? Just get over it already, you set your sights a little high. Why would the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley want to be with a pathetic boy like you?" she said venomously.  
“够了！我怎样才能说得更清楚呢？”她斥责道，把他从身上推开。 “读我的嘴唇，真嗣，我不爱你，我不想和你在一起。我不需要任何人，好吗？已经克服它了，你设置你的眼界有点高啊，为什么伟大的宗流·明日香·兰利会想和你这样一个可怜的男孩在一起呢？”她恶毒地说。

"You are not perfect yourself Asuka! Stop placing yourself in such high regard, stop making it seem like it's such a great deal on your part to be with me. Why are you so stubborn? Why are you so afraid of this possibility? Why don't you realise your own feelings? Why can't you just give me a chance?" he shot back, his anger starting to take over him.  
“你自己并不完美，明日香！别再把自己看得那么高了，别再把和我在一起显得很重要了。你为什么这么固执？为什么你这么害怕这种可能性？为什么你连自己的感受都不清楚吗？”他反击道，愤怒开始占据他的全身。

"Why are you so deaf?! I already told you, I don't need anyone! Is it _so_ hard to understand?" the girl retorted.  
“你怎么这么聋？！我都说了，我不需要任何人！有那么难懂吗？”女孩反驳道。


_**"Just rape me!" “就强奸我吧！”**_

**"**_**Just kill me!"**_ “杀了我吧！”


Shinji glared at Asuka menacingly and she was truly frightened for a moment. The boy was reaching breaking point, so rather than do something he'd regret, Shinji jumped off of her, picked up her chair and threw it against the wall as hard as he could, breaking it instantly. Unable to contain himself, he turned to face her with a look of disgust.  
真嗣恶狠狠地瞪了明日香一眼，她一时间确实被吓到了。男孩已经到了崩溃的边缘，所以真嗣不想做一些让他后悔的事情，而是从她身上跳下来，拿起她的椅子，用尽全力把它扔到墙上，立刻把它打破了。他按捺不住，转头看向她，一脸厌恶。

"Fine! Be a miserable little bitch for the rest of your life. I shouldn't have expected more from a fucking Nazi!" he spat nastily. He knew he hit low, but he was just so pissed.  
“好吧！你的余生就当个可怜的小贱人吧。我不应该对一个他妈的纳粹抱有更多的期望！”他恶狠狠地吐了口口水。他知道自己的表现很低，但他实在是太生气了。

"What did you call me?" Asuka said sitting up straight, suddenly enraged.  
“你叫我什么？”明日香坐直身子，突然怒气冲冲地说道。

"A NAZI!" he shouted louder.  
“纳粹！”他喊得更大声。

At this, the redhead snapped and launched herself at the boy. She threw punch after punch at Shinji, while he attempted to defend himself. Many of her blows connected and the boy howled in pain. Shinji retaliated by kicking her in the shins, making Asuka cry out in pain as she collapsed. He picked her up and was about to throw her, when two arms grabbed him from behind.  
听到这里，红发女郎突然怒吼一声，向男孩扑去。当真嗣试图自卫时，她一拳又一拳地打向真嗣。她的多次攻击连在一起，男孩痛苦地嚎叫起来。真嗣报复性地踢了她的小腿，让明日香痛得大叫一声，倒在了地上。他把她抱起来，正要扔出去，两只手臂从后面抓住了他。

"Shinji no!" Misato shouted.  
“慎二不！”美里喊道。

Shinji reluctantly let down the female eva pilot.  
真嗣不情愿地让女EVA飞行员失望了。

"I could hear the shouting and screaming, but I didn't want to interrupt your argument. However, I will not allow you two to kill each other, no matter how angry you are. Both of you calm down this instant!" Misato commanded, looking at her two wards sternly.  
“我听到了喊叫声，但我不想打断你们的争吵。不过，我不会允许你们两个互相残杀，无论你们有多愤怒，你们都冷静一下！”美里严厉地看着自己的两个结界，命令道。

"Stay away from me Shinji. I don't ever want to see you again" Asuka replied furiously.  
“真嗣，离我远点。我再也不想见到你了。”明日香愤怒地回答。

"Ja wohl mein fuhrer!" he said, bowing mockingly, "If that's how you want it, I'll be gone from your life for good!" Shinji shouted.  
“我的元首！”他嘲讽地鞠了一躬，“如果你愿意的话，我就永远从你的生活中消失！”真嗣喊道。

"Fine with me!" Asuka shouted back.  
“我都可以！”明日香回喊道。

The boy hurried out of the room immediately.  
男孩立刻就快步走出了房间。

"Shinji wait!" Misato called out after him, seeing Shinji rush towards the exit. But her response was the slamming of the front door.  
“慎二等等！”美里在他身后喊道，看到真嗣冲向出口。但回应她的是前门的关上声。

"I hope you're happy" Misato said, turning to Asuka.  
“我希望你幸福”美里转向明日香说道。

"What the hell do you care? No one cares about my point of view, you just want Shinji to be happy" the young girl rebuked.  
“你管什么？没人关心我的观点，你只想真嗣幸福。”少女斥责道。

"I want you _both_ to be happy, you benefit from it just as much as he would Asuka!" Misato countered.  
“我希望你们俩都能幸福，你们从中受益，就像他对明日香一样！”美里反驳道。

"Aren't you supposed to be against this?" Asuka asked, annoyed.  
“你不是应该反对吗？”明日香生气地问道。

"Why is that relevant? Besides, I couldn't care less if NERV didn't approve of a relationship between pilots if it made you two finally get along. Furthermore, all the angels are dead now anyway" Misato answered.  
“这有什么关系？此外，如果NERV不批准飞行员之间的关系，如果这能让你们两个最终相处融洽，我也不在乎。而且，无论如何，现在所有的天使都死了。”美里回答道。

"But you said Seele will attack us, so we're still needed" Asuka remarked.  
“但是你说过希儿会攻击我们，所以我们还是需要的。”明日香说道。

"It would actually _help_ your sync ratio, and therefore improve your fighting capability" the older woman retorted.  
“这实际上会提高你的同步率，从而提高你的战斗能力。”老妇人反驳道。

"So, you just wanted us together so we could fight better?" the redhead scoffed.  
“所以，你只是想让我们在一起，这样我们就能更好地战斗？”红发女郎嘲笑道。

"No, that's not what I meant and you know it!" Misato rebuked.  
“不，我不是这个意思，你也知道！”美里斥责道。

"Either way, we had this conversation before Misato. I already told you _and_ him it's not going to happen" Asuka said adamantly.  
“不管怎样，我们在美里之前就已经谈过了。我已经告诉过你和他这不会发生。”明日香坚定地说。

"Are you just being stubborn or are you afraid?" the Major asked.  
“你只是固执还是害怕？”少校问道。

"I am not afraid of anything! I just don't want to be with him, it's as simple as that" the young girl answered.  
“我什么都不怕！我只是不想和他在一起，就这么简单。”少女回答道。

"If you can honestly tell me right here, right now that you don't care about Shinji at all, that you have no feelings whatsoever towards him, I will never speak of this again. So, do you feel anything for him, yes or no? I won't ask for an explanation, a justification or anything - just a simple yes or no" Misato put forward.  
“如果你现在能在这里诚实地告诉我，你根本不关心真嗣，对他没有任何感情，我就不会再提这件事了。那么，你对他有感觉吗，是的。”或不？我不会要求解释、理由或任何东西——只是简单的是或否”美里提出。

Asuka stayed silent, hesitating on her answer. She could just say no and get Misato off her back, but she knew she'd be lying if she said that. On the other hand, she refused to admit such a thing to her guardian.  
明日香沉默不语，犹豫着要不要回答。她可以直接说“不”，让美里摆脱她的困扰，但她知道如果她这么说，那就是在撒谎。另一方面，她又拒绝向监护人承认这样的事情。

"No" the redhead replied.  
“没有。”红发回答道。

At this, Misato sighed, "It seems I was mistaken then. I just wanted you to go after him before he does something he regrets, but I guess you don't care"  
说到这里，美里叹了口气，“看来我当时错了。我只是想让你在他做出后悔的事之前追上他，但我猜你不在乎”

"Yeah I don't, now bye" Asuka finished off, before retiring to her room without another word.  
“是的，我不知道，现在再见”明日香结束了，然后一言不发地回到了自己的房间。

The Major sat down on the couch in frustration, pondering what she should do. She was sure Asuka was just being stubborn, but she just didn't know how to overcome it. _'Shinji, I can't believe you two got together before… she is some work'_  
少校沮丧地坐在沙发上，思考着自己该怎么办。她确信明日香只是固执，但她只是不知道如何克服。 “真嗣，我不敢相信你们两个之前就在一起了……她很出色”

The redhead in question was laying down on her bed brooding. All three conversations were going through her head multiple times. Asuka felt guilty for lying to Misato, but also annoyed that she seemed to be supporting the boy rather than her. She felt so confused about Shinji as well, there was the genuine love and affection from him and then the anger when he lashed out at her. The girl had really made him suffer yesterday… and he had been holding back and doing everything for her sake… in an awful roundabout way… but it was all for her.  
红发女郎正躺在床上沉思。这三个对话都在她脑海中多次闪过。明日香为对美里撒了谎而感到内疚，但也因为她似乎支持的是男孩而不是她而感到恼火。她对真嗣也感到很困惑，他有真诚的爱和感情，但当他猛烈攻击她时，她又感到愤怒。昨天那个女孩真是让他受苦了……而他却一直忍着，做着一切都是为了她……以一种可怕的迂回方式……但这一切都是为了她。


"_**It seems I was mistaken then. I just wanted you to go after him before he does something he regrets, but I guess you don't care"**_  
“看来我错了。我只是想让你在他做出让他后悔的事情之前追上他，但我猜你不在乎”


Asuka gritted her teeth and groaned in annoyance. _'Why does this baka always cause me so many damn problems?'_ she thought. _'Fine, I'll go get that moron Misato'_  
明日香咬牙切齿，不满地呻吟着。 “为什么这个笨蛋总是给我带来这么多该死的问题？”她想。 “好吧，我去找那个白痴美里”

The redhead got off her bed and looked around to see if she needed anything, before she snuck out. The girl noticed the ring on her bed where she had left it. Sighing, she picked it up and placed it in her pocket, thinking that perhaps returning this object would convince the boy to let her go. Asuka once again looked around and with nothing else coming to mind, she exited her room. She began walking quietly towards their front door, making sure Misato didn't notice her leave. _'I won't hear the end of it from Misato if she sees me going out to get him…'_ she thought.  
红发女郎下了床，环顾四周看看是否需要什么，然后就偷偷溜了出去。女孩注意到她放在床上的戒指。她叹了口气，把它捡起来放进口袋，心想也许归还这个东西就能说服男孩放她走。明日香再次环顾四周，脑子里什么也没想，就退出了房间。她开始悄悄地朝前门走去，确保美里没有注意到她离开。 “如果美里看到我出去抓他，我就不会听到它的结局了……”她想。

Reaching their front door, the young girl slowly opened the door without a sound, exited the residence and closed it behind her. She walked quietly to the stairs and upon reaching them, ran down the steps to begin her search for the object of the most frustration in her life.  
到了家门前，少女无声无息地缓缓打开门，出了府邸，然后关上了门。她静静地走向楼梯，到达楼梯后，她跑下楼梯，开始寻找她一生中最沮丧的对象。

Unbeknownst to Asuka, the Major had watched the redhead leave from the corner of her eye. Misato stifled a laugh as she knew that if she let the redhead know she could see her leaving, her pride would make her go back to her room stubbornly.  
明日香不知道的是，少校用眼角的余光看着红发女郎离开。美里忍住笑，因为她知道，如果让红发知道她能看到她离开，她的骄傲就会让她固执地回到自己的房间。

"Go bring back our love-sick boy" Misato said aloud to herself.  
“去把我们的相思病男孩带回来吧。”美里自言自语道。

Shinji was walking along a deserted alleyway when he took out his cell phone. He had bought it when he was out on one of his dates with Aria; in fact, she had even helped him choose it. The boy forced himself to stay calm as his emotions threatened to overwhelm him again. He was still traumatised by Aria's death and had only barely just managed to keep himself from going insane. But now that Asuka had truly rejected him, he just didn't think he had the strength to go on anymore. Shinji decided with all that had happened, there was only one thing left to do. He dialed in a number, hit the call button and then held it to his ear, waiting for the person to pick up. After a while, the person picked up and answered.  
真嗣正走在一条无人的小巷里，这时他拿出了手机。这是他在与 Aria 约会时买的。事实上，她甚至帮他选择了它。男孩强迫自己保持冷静，因为他的情绪再次淹没了他。阿丽亚的死仍然给他带来了创伤，他才勉强控制住自己不发疯。但现在明日香真的拒绝了他，他只是觉得自己已经没有力气继续下去了。真嗣决定，发生了这一切之后，只剩下一件事要做了。他拨通了一个号码，按下通话键，然后将手机放在耳边，等待对方接听。过了一会儿，那人接起电话，接听。

"Hello this is Ryouji Kaji speaking" Kaji greeted.  
“大家好，我是梶良司”梶打招呼。

"Yes, hello Kaji this is Shinji. I would like to tell you something before I go" Shinji started.  
“是的，你好，加持，我是真嗣。在我走之前，我想告诉你一些事情。”真嗣开始说道。

"Hey Shinji! What do you mean?" Kaji asked, confused.  
“嘿真嗣！你什么意思？”卡吉疑惑地问道。

"It's about Asuka…" “是关于明日香的事……”

---

The redhead was walking around Tokyo-3, wondering where Shinji could have possibly gone. Thinking that he might be trying to leave the city, she first went to the train station. However, when she arrived, she saw a demolished building and then remembered all public transport systems had been destroyed. Asuka then decided to go check at his friend's houses. She went to Kensuke's house first as it was closer. She went up to his door and rang the doorbell. Soon, the military otaku opened the door and was a little surprised at seeing the redhead there.  
红头发的人在第三东京走来走去，想知道真嗣可能去了哪里。想到他可能要出城，她先去了火车站。然而，当她到达时，看到一座被拆除的建筑，然后才想起所有的公共交通系统都被摧毁了。明日香决定去他朋友的家里看看。她先去了健介家，因为距离比较近。她走到他的门前，按响了门铃。很快，军宅打开了门，看到门口的红发，有些惊讶。

"Is Shinji with you?" she asked, getting straight to the point.  
“慎二和你一起吗？”她问，开门见山。

"No sorry, he's not here? Why? Is he lost again?" Kensuke asked.  
“不抱歉，他不在这儿？为什么？他又迷路了吗？”健介问道。

"Something like that" she replied, "Anyway, if he's not here then bye"  
“差不多吧，”她回答道，“不管怎样，如果他不在这里，那就再见了。”

As Asuka turned around, Kensuke decided to say something. "Asuka, Shinji's a loyal guy at heart. Just remember that"  
明日香转过身来，剑介决定说点什么。 “明日香，真嗣本质上是个忠诚的人。记住这一点”

The girl just continued walking away, pretending she had heard nothing. Though deep down the words impacted on her greatly. It was true; she had been proven time and time again that he always stuck with her. The redhead dismissed her thoughts and continued onto the next destination, Touji's house. It was not long before Asuka had arrived at the jock's residence. She approached Touji's house and rang on his doorbell, completely oblivious to whatever else was happening at the moment. Asuka was a little surprised to see not Touji, but Hikari open the door.  
女孩假装什么也没听到，继续走开。虽然这句话内心深处对她的影响很大。这是真的；她已经一次又一次地证明，他总是和她在一起。红发打消了自己的念头，继续前往下一个目的地，东次家。没多久，明日香就来到了运动员的住所。她走到东二家门口，按响了门铃，完全没有注意到此刻发生的一切。明日香有些惊讶地发现开门的不是东二，而是光。

"Asuka?" the class rep asked.  
“明日香？”班代表问道。

"Hikari?" Asuka said, surprised.  
“希卡里？”明日香惊讶地说。

"Touji invited me over today, he's in the bathroom right now… but why are you here Asuka?" Hikari inquired.  
“冬治今天邀请我过来，他现在在洗手间……但是明日香你怎么在这里？”光问道。

"I'm looking for Shinji, is he with you guys by any chance?" the redhead replied.  
“我在找真嗣，他和你们在一起吗？”红发回答道。

"No, Shinji didn't come here. Also… you look down today Asuka, is something wrong?" Hikari asked, concerned for her friend.  
“没有，真嗣没有来这里。还有……你今天低头看明日香，有什么问题吗？”光关心她的朋友，问道。

"No I'm fine, don't worry about me. Anyway, thanks for the help Hikari. I'll be going now" Asuka said, turning around.  
“不，我很好，别担心我。不管怎样，谢谢光的帮助。我现在就走了。”明日香说着转身。

"Asuka!" Hikari started, "I'm here for you… if you ever need to talk" she offered.  
“飞鸟！” Hikari 开始说道：“如果你需要说话，我就在你身边……”她说道。

"Thanks" the redhead replied, walking away and waving to her friend. Hikari looked a little bewildered at the short meeting and returned inside Touji's house.  
“谢谢”红发女郎回答道，走开并向她的朋友挥手。光对短暂的会面感到有些困惑，然后回到了东二的屋内。

As Asuka walked away, she really began to wonder where he was. _'Does he know anyone else? Does he have any other friends? Aria's dead, so it can't be her place. Wait of course, Wondergirl!'_  
当明日香走开时，她真的开始想知道他在哪里。 “他还认识其他人吗？他还有其他朋友吗？阿丽亚已经死了，所以这里不能是她的位置。当然要等等，神奇女孩！

Asuka moved off in the direction of Rei's apartment.  
明日香朝丽的公寓方向走去。

The panicked man quickly dialed in the Major's number, praying to God he wouldn't be too late. He had just called the Commander of NERV and informed him of the situation. He had simply replied "do whatever is necessary." Thankfully, Misato picked up and answered the call.  
惊慌失措的男人赶紧拨通了少校的电话，祈祷上帝不要来得太晚。他刚刚给NERV的指挥官打了电话，告知了他的情况。他只是简单地回答“做任何必要的事情”。值得庆幸的是，美里接听了电话。

"This is Misato speaking" Misato greeted on her home phone.  
“我是美里。”美里用家里的电话打招呼。

"Hi Misato it's Kaji. Shinji just called me and told me something disturbing. He said he was going to the convenience store near Rei's apartment to 'end it all.' He then said goodbye and hoped I wouldn't miss him. Normally I wouldn't think much of it, I would have thought he was just going to run away, but he told me what happened. For him to call me like that and after all he's gone through, I'm afraid he might try to do something more than just run away. Please Misato, drive there now and stop him, take Asuka with you as well!" Kaji explained frantically.  
“嗨，美里，我是加持。真嗣刚刚打电话给我，告诉我一些令人不安的事情。他说他要去丽公寓附近的便利店来‘结束这一切’。”然后他说再见并希望我不会想念他，通常我不会想太多，我以为他只是要逃跑，但他告诉我发生了什么事，他这样打电话给我。在他经历了这一切之后，我担心他可能会尝试做一些不仅仅是逃跑的事情，请美里，现在开车去阻止他，也带上明日香吧！”梶急忙解释道。

Misato's eyes went wide as she dropped the phone. _'No it can't be, he wouldn't, not after all he did.'_ She got up quickly and grabbed her keys, sprinting out of her apartment at full speed and to her car. _'Dammit Asuka, where the hell are you? You're the only one who can stop him.'_ She silently prayed that Asuka having gone out to look for him earlier was beneficial as she might find him.  
美里睁大了眼睛，放下了电话。 “不，不可能，他不会，毕竟他已经这么做了。”她迅速起身，抓起钥匙，全速冲出公寓，奔向汽车。 “该死的明日香，你到底在哪儿？你是唯一能阻止他的人。她默默地祈祷明日香早点出去寻找他对她有好处，因为她可能会找到他。

The Major turned the ignition and slammed down on the accelerator, trying as fast as she could to get to Shinji.  
少校打开点火开关，猛踩油门，试图以最快的速度接近真嗣。

The redhead looked up at the building; it seemed familiar. As she entered the building, she realised she had been here before. _'That's right, that dream I had before, it was a memory. I was searching for Shinji here before, I wonder why?'_  
红发女郎抬头看着大楼。这看起来很熟悉。当她走进大楼时，她意识到自己以前来过这里。 ” “没错，我之前做的那个梦，是一段记忆。我之前一直在这里寻找真嗣，不知道为什么？

Asuka walked up the stairs and arrived at Rei's door. Opening the door, she found Rei sitting on her bed looking out the window. As she entered, Rei turned her head towards the redhead and cocked her head curiously.  
明日香走上楼梯，来到了丽的门口。打开门，发现雷正坐在床上，看着窗外。进来后，丽转头看向红发，好奇地歪着头。

"Hi Wonder-I mean Ayanami" Asuka corrected herself, remembering Shinji's favour.  
“嗨，Wonder——我是说绫波”明日香纠正自己，想起了真嗣的恩惠。

"Greetings Pilot Sohryu, what business brings you here?" Rei asked.  
“您好，飞行员 Soryu，有什么事让您来这里的？”雷问道。

"I was looking for Shinji, though I can see he's not here" the redhead answered.  
“我在找真嗣，但我看得出来他不在这里。”红发回答道。

"He was here… he stayed the night, unable to confront you till today. I remember he left this morning quite distressed, he was going to try and speak with you" Rei explained.  
“他在这里……他留了一晚，直到今天才与你对峙。我记得他今天早上离开时非常痛苦，他打算尝试与你交谈。”雷解释道。

"Yeah, he came. Our discussion didn't end well and I told him to go away. Now I have to find that baka" Asuka confirmed.  
“是的，他来了。我们的讨论没有结束，我让他走开。现在我必须找到那个巴卡”明日香确认道。

"Why did you tell him to go, if you were only going to have to search for him?" Rei asked, confused.  
“如果你只是要寻找他，为什么要让他走呢？”雷疑惑地问道。

"I didn't want to search for him! But anyway, that's beside the point" the redhead retorted. Curious to see if Rei could tell her about last night and the time before, she questioned her. "Did anything happen here last night?"  
“我本来不想去找他的！不过，这也不是重点。”红发反驳道。她很好奇丽能否告诉她昨晚和之前的事情，于是她询问了她。 “昨晚这里有发生什么事情吗？”

"I do not understand what you mean, we merely talked a short while before he fell asleep on the couch not long after we arrived" Rei answered.  
“我不明白你的意思，我们只是聊了一会儿，我们到达后不久他就在沙发上睡着了。”雷回答道。

"I recall Shinji was here before and I came here searching for him back then also, do you remember why?" Asuka inquired.  
“我记得真嗣曾经来过这里，当时我也来这里找过他，你还记得为什么吗？”明日香询问道。

"Upon learning about my true origin, he came to confront me and has since considered me as a sister. You came searching for him because he stayed the night then as well and I disallowed him to leave on account of it being too late" Rei explained.  
“得知我的真实来历后，他来找我对质，并把我当妹妹。你来找他，因为他当时也过夜，我不让他离开，因为已经太晚了。”解释道。


_**"I most definitely do**_ **not** _**like Rei in that way, nor do I wish to sleep with her"**_  
「我绝对不喜欢丽那样，也不想和她一起睡觉」


_'I understand what he meant now. Guess he was after me all along'_ Asuka thought.  
“我现在明白他的意思了。我猜他一直在追杀我。明日香想。

"One last question Rei, would you have any idea where Shinji is now?" the redhead asked, hopeful.  
“最后一个问题，丽，你知道真嗣现在在哪里吗？”红发满怀希望地问道。

"I am unaware of the third child's current location" Rei replied.  
“我不知道第三个孩子现在在哪里。”雷回答道。

"I guess I'll keep looking for him then, hopefully he's around here somewhere" Asuka said, turning around.  
“我想我会继续寻找他，希望他就在这附近的某个地方。”明日香转身说道。

"Pilot Sohryu, do not forget… you are the only one who can make Shinji happy" Rei commented.  
“飞行员素流，别忘了……你是唯一能让真嗣开心的人。”丽评论道。

Asuka continued out of Rei's room, down the stairs and outside the building. The redhead had a strange feeling; it was like everyone knew about Shinji and her. But when she thought about it, Shinji admitted his love in the battle of the 15th angel so she presumed Misato and Rei had known all along. _'As a matter of fact, the whole of NERV would have known! That explains everyone's behaviour when I woke up in the hospital! I must have rejected him or something and he saw my memory loss as another chance to get with me'_  
明日香继续走出丽的房间，走下楼梯，来到大楼外面。红发有一种奇怪的感觉；就好像每个人都知道真嗣和她一样。但转念一想，真嗣在第十五天使之战中承认了自己的爱情，所以她认为美里和丽一直都知道。 ‘事实上，整个NERV都会知道！这就解释了当我在医院醒来时每个人的行为！我一定是拒绝了他什么的，而他把我失忆视为和我在一起的另一个机会。”

It was almost comical she couldn't fathom that it was the opposite reason. Her thoughts were soon interrupted by the sound of a car zooming down the street. She heard a massive screech as the car stopped and reversed back to where she was.  
她无法理解这是相反的原因，这几乎是滑稽的。她的思绪很快就被街道上疾驰的汽车声打断了。当汽车停了下来并倒回她所在的位置时，她听到一声巨大的尖叫声。

"Asuka, GET YOUR ASS IN HERE NOW!" Misato screamed, honking at the redhead.  
“明日香，现在就把你的屁股放在这里！”美里尖叫着，对着红发女郎按喇叭。

The young girl jumped in surprise at the yell and at the fact that it was Misato. The female eva pilot ran down to the car, puzzled at Misato's appearance.  
听到这声叫喊，以及那人是美里，少女惊讶地跳了起来。女EVA飞行员跑下车，对美里的样子感到困惑。

"Fancy meeting you here… Misato" Asuka said weakly as she opened the door and sat in the front seat.  
“很高兴在这里见到你……美里。”明日香有气无力地说，她打开车门，坐到了前排座位上。

Misato simply ignored her remark. As soon as Asuka had her seatbelt on, Misato once again shot off down the street. Sensing the urgency of the Major's behaviour, the redhead spoke up  
美里根本就没有理睬她的话。明日香一系好安全带，美里就再次沿着街道飞奔而去。察觉到少校行为的紧迫性，红发开口说道

"Misato, what in the world is going on?" Asuka asked.  
“美里，这到底是怎么回事？”明日香问道。

"It's Shinji. He gave a call to Kaji and he thinks he's going to try to…" Misato began, trailing off.  
“是真嗣。他给加持打了电话，他想他会尝试……”美里开口说道，声音逐渐减弱。

"Try to what?" the young girl prompted.  
“尝试什么？”少女提示道。

"Try to… take his life" Misato finished quietly.  
“尝试……夺走他的生命。”美里平静地说道。


"…_**If that's how you want it, I'll be gone from your life for good!"**_  
“……如果你愿意的话，我就永远从你的生活中消失！”


The true impact of his words finally dawned on Asuka. The young girl suddenly felt very weak, _'No… that can't be, he can't leave me… what have I done?'_ The redhead willed herself to hold together as they sped down the road. Very soon, Misato stopped at a store and hurried out of the car. Asuka swiftly followed after her guardian and heard some voices speaking in a nearby alley.  
明日香终于明白了他的话的真正影响。少女突然感觉很虚弱，“不……这不可能，他不能离开我……我到底做了什么？”当他们沿着道路疾驰时，红发女郎强迫自己抱在一起。很快，美里在一家商店前停下，急忙下了车。明日香迅速跟在她的守护者身后，听到附近的小巷里传来一些说话的声音。

"…you forgot to put the safety off. I'll help you with that" a voice was heard.  
“……你忘了关掉安全装置。我会帮你的。”一个声音传来。

"Thank you" “谢谢”

The two girls ran over to the alley as fast as they could and let out a gasp at the sight they saw.  
两个女孩以最快的速度跑到巷子里，看到这一幕，不禁倒吸了一口冷气。

---

The boy entered the store, taking in its features. There was nothing particularly special about this store; it was quite ordinary. In fact, he couldn't remember much of the details of the shop. However, this was where he had met her for the first time, Aria. She had been up at the counter when he had turned her around, thinking it was Asuka. Yes, a fitting place this was for the moment that was about to happen; the place where he had first met the only girl, it seemed, to have truly loved him.  
男孩走进商店，打量着它的面貌。这家店并没有什么特别之处，就是没有什么特别之处。这很普通。事实上，他已经记不起这家店的太多细节了。然而，这是他第一次见到她，阿莉亚。当他把她转过身来时，她正站在柜台前，以为是明日香。是的，对于即将发生的那一刻来说，这是一个合适的地方；在那里，他第一次遇见了唯一一个真正爱他的女孩。

Shinji looked at the clock in the store and thought it was about time to start. He exited the store and walked over to the nearby alley. The boy looked around briefly and then took out a handgun from his pocket. He stared at the cold metallic object with fascination, this tool could end lives so easily. Shinji waited a few moments, finding the resolve to continue, this would be… the last resort.  
真嗣看了看店里的时钟，觉得差不多该开始了。他出了商店，朝附近的小巷走去。男孩环视了一圈，然后从口袋里掏出了一把手枪。他出神地看着那冰冷的金属物体，这种工具竟然可以轻而易举地结束生命。真嗣等了一会儿，下定决心继续下去，这将是……最后的手段。

He wanted to feel what the trigger was like before he shot the gun and so slowly pulled the trigger, aiming away. The boy found himself unable to squeeze the trigger and looked at the gun bewildered, why wasn't it working? He tried squeezing it harder, but had the same result, he was unable to move the trigger.  
他想在开枪前感受一下扣动扳机的感觉，于是慢慢地扣动扳机，瞄准远处。男孩发现自己无法扣动扳机，困惑地看着枪，为什么它不起作用？他试着用力扣动扳机，但结果还是一样，他无法扣动扳机。

Suddenly he heard a car screeching to halt and Shinji panicked, standing up. At that moment, a man with a balaclava approached him. "Hey kid… you forgot to put the safety off. I'll help you with that" the man spoke.  
突然，他听到一辆汽车急刹车的声音，真嗣惊慌失措地站了起来。就在这时，一个戴着巴拉克拉法帽的男人向他走来。 “嘿孩子……你忘了关安全装置。我会帮你的。”男人说道。

The man took the gun off Shinji, stood back and aimed it at his chest. The boy just stood there, rooted to the spot.  
男人从真嗣手中夺下枪，往后退了一步，瞄准了他的胸口。男孩只是站在原地，一动不动。

"Thank you" the young boy said calmly.  
“谢谢你。”少年平静地说。

Just as the other man clicked off the safety, Shinji heard a gasp and turned his head around.  
就在另一个人关掉保险时，真嗣听到一声喘息，转过头来。

"Shinji! DON'T DO IT!" a frantic Misato shouted out.  
“真嗣！别这么做！”美里疯狂地喊道。

"Misato?" was Shinji's only response.  
“美里？”这是真嗣唯一的回应。

Had the boy even wanted to stop, there was nothing he could do as the older man fired the gun at him. Shinji's chest exploded with blood, making him fall to the floor. The gunshot rang out loudly and the two girls stood there stunned as the older man ran off, leaving the boy there. Misato and Asuka broke out of their momentary daze and took in the sight of Shinji on the ground with blood all over him. The redhead ran over to him in disbelief, while Misato just collapsed to the floor crying. Very few people were in this area at the moment. Some stopped to look at the commotion, but no one had cell phones to call the ambulance or police. The store's phone itself was broken too, so people just watched on as the boy lay there helplessly.  
即使男孩想停下来，他也无能为力，年长的男子向他开枪。真嗣的胸口喷出鲜血，他倒在了地上。枪声响起，两个女孩惊呆了，年长的男人跑开了，留下男孩在那里。美里和明日香从短暂的呆滞中回过神来，看到了满身是血倒在地上的真嗣。红发难以置信地跑到他身边，而美里则倒在地上哭了起来。目前这个地区的人很少。有些人停下来观看骚乱，但没有人拿着手机叫救护车或警察。店里的电话也坏了，所以人们只能眼睁睁地看着男孩无助地躺在那里。

"Shinji?" Asuka asked croaking, unable to believe the boy was dying in front of her.  
“真嗣？”明日香声音嘶哑地问道，不敢相信这个男孩就在她面前死去。

Shinji coughed and blood came out of his mouth. "Asuka?" he started. "You came Asuka. I'm sorry it had to be this way, but now I will never bother you again. You know that store was where I first met Aria, a fitting place this is for a murderer like me to die"  
慎二咳嗽了一声，嘴里流出了血。 “明日香？”他开始。 “你来了明日香。我很抱歉事情必须这样，但现在我再也不会打扰你了。你知道那家商店是我第一次见到阿丽亚的地方，这是一个适合像我这样的杀人犯死去的地方”

"YOU BAKA! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! I NEVER WANTED YOU TO DIE!" she said as tears started to fall from her face.  
“你个笨蛋！你怎么能这样对我？！我从来不想让你死！”她说着，眼泪开始从脸上流下来。

"Ich Liebe Dich Asuka" he said weakly. Shinji then began choking and his eyes rolled up in his head.  
“Ich Liebe Dich Asuka”他有气无力地说。真嗣开始窒息，他的眼睛翻了起来。

_'Why am I crying? Do I like him? After all this time, I like him? But how is that possible? He's just a pathetic cowardly baka is all'  
'我为什么哭？我喜欢他吗？这么久了，我还喜欢他吗？但这怎么可能呢？他只是一个可悲的胆小鬼而已”_


_**"His kindness and politeness are fake" Asuka retorted, "He uses it so that people will like him or at least not hate him! And he fluctuates between being strong and weak and being brave and cowardly so much I can't tell anymore"  
“他的善良和礼貌都是假的，”明日香反驳道，“他只是为了让人们喜欢他，或者至少不讨厌他！而且他在强与弱、勇敢与懦弱之间摇摆不定，我已经说不清了。”**_

_**;**_

"…_**You're so weak and cowardly, always running away from something if it's too hard or putting the blame onto yourself" she refuted.**_  
“……你太软弱、太懦弱了，遇到困难就逃避，或者把责任归咎于自己。”她反驳道。


_'Why does it hurt so much then?'  
“那为什么这么疼呢？”_


_**"Look everyone has their faults, but the whole point of liking someone is to see past the bad aspects of the person and focus on the good aspects" Aria countered. "It's about accepting him for who he is. No one in this world is perfect, so why expect him to be?"  
“每个人都有自己的缺点，但喜欢一个人的重点就是要看到这个人不好的方面，而关注他好的方面。”Aria 反驳道。 “这是关于接受他本来的样子。这个世界上没有人是完美的，所以为什么期望他是完美的呢？”**_

_**;**_

"…_**You're right, I am cowardly and weak, I struggle with it a lot. But at least I'm honest about it and try to work on it" he defended.**_  
“……你是对的，我胆小又软弱，我为此挣扎了很多。但至少我对此很诚实，并努力解决它，”他辩解道。


_'But still, I'm the Great Asuka! He doesn't deserve to be with me!'  
'但是，我仍然是伟大的飞鸟！他不配和我在一起！_


_**"You are not perfect yourself Asuka! Stop placing yourself in such high regard, stop making it seem like it's such a great deal on your part to be with me…"  
“你自己并不完美，明日香！别把自己看得这么高，别让自己觉得和我在一起对你来说是多么重要……”**_


_'But does he really love me?'  
“但是他真的爱我吗？”_


"_**Because I… love you Asuka"**_  
“因为我……爱你，明日香”

_**;**_

_**"Surprising isn't it? Even after all that crap you put me through, despite how you cold-heartedly wanted me to kill Aria and the fact that you've rejected me and told me we will never be together millions of times I…still do"  
“令人惊讶不是吗？即使在你让我经历了那么多的废话之后，尽管你冷酷无情地希望我杀死阿丽亚，而且事实上你拒绝了我并告诉我我们永远不会在一起数百万次，我......仍然这样做”**_

_**;**_

_**"You see the only reason I dated Aria was because I was trying to make you jealous, that's the truth"  
“你看，我和 Aria 约会的唯一原因是我想让你嫉妒，这就是事实”**_

_**;**_

_**"Ich Liebe Dich Asuka" “我爱你明日香”**_


_'How could he fall for someone like me?'  
“他怎么会爱上我这样的人呢？”_


"_**In all my life I have never met a girl with a stronger will, with more determination, with more stubbornness..."**_  
“我这辈子从来没有遇到过一个比她意志更坚强、更坚定、更固执的女孩……”

_**;**_

_**"Because Asuka is more than just a pretty girl, she has a hundred times more depth and intelligence. She taught me how to be stronger and how to persevere, she is irreplaceable"  
“因为明日香不仅仅是一个漂亮的女孩，她还有一百倍的深度和智慧。她教会了我如何变得更强，如何坚持，她是不可替代的”**_

_**;**_

"_**Pilot Sohryu, do not forget… you are the only one who can make Shinji happy"**_  
“苍龙飞行员，别忘了……你是唯一能让真嗣开心的人”


_'Even if he does love me, what does it matter?'  
“就算他爱我，那又有什么关系呢？”_


_**"…He is a person that will understand you better than anyone else because he lives with you and pilots an eva like you…"  
“……他是一个比任何人都更了解你的人，因为他和你住在一起，驾驶着像你一样的eva……”**_


_'So what if he's good for me, he'll just end up leaving me like everyone always does'  
“就算他对我好又怎么样，他最终会像每个人一样离开我”_


_**"****_As_uka, Shinji's a loyal guy at heart. Just remember that"**  
“明日香，真嗣本质上是个忠诚的人。记住这一点”_

_**;**_

"_**I know you're proud Asuka, but you gotta stop pushing people away!"**_  
“我知道你为明日香感到骄傲，但你不能再把人推开！”

_**;**_

"**…**_**You can't keep pushing everyone away just because you think anyone who you open your heart to will betray you"**_  
“……你不能仅仅因为你认为任何你敞开心扉的人都会背叛你，就一直把所有人都推开”

_**;**_

_**"…You must get past your fear of pain and abandonment, running away does not solve anything…"  
“……你必须克服对痛苦和被遗弃的恐惧，逃跑并不能解决任何问题……”**_


_'But no matter how much he loves me, he'll still end up hurting me, even if unintentionally'  
“但无论他多么爱我，他最终还是会伤害我，即使是无意的”_


_**"…you cannot callous the soul, it always hurts the same if not more the next time…"  
“……你不能麻木不仁的灵魂，下次它总是会受到同样的伤害，甚至更多……”**_

_**;**_

_**"…Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists. Running away is the same as denying it exists, the only way you can bear the pain is to have happiness to pull you through…"  
“……只有当我们知道痛苦会结束时，痛苦才是可以忍受的，而如果我们否认它的存在，就无法忍受。逃避就等于否认它的存在，你能忍受痛苦的唯一方法就是有幸福来拉你度过……”**_


_'I can be happy alone, I don't need anyone!'  
“我一个人就能快乐，不需要任何人！”_


_**"…Being alone does not bring you happiness!"  
“……孤独不会给你带来快乐！”**_

_**;**_

"**…**_**I now realise running doesn't solve anything and by being all alone you sacrifice your happiness…"**_  
“……我现在意识到跑步并不能解决任何问题，独自一人会牺牲你的幸福……”


_'Do I really need him? Do I really… love him?'  
‘我真的需要他吗？我真的……爱他吗？_


_**"It is not for me to say whether you love him or not, it is something you must find out and realise by yourself"  
“你爱不爱他，这不是我能说的，而是你自己去发现、去体会的。”**_


_'Could I really love that baka?'  
“我真的会喜欢那个巴卡吗？”_


_**"…to love is not loving someone perfect, but loving someone imperfect, perfectly…"  
“……爱不是爱一个完美的人，而是爱一个不完美的人，完美……”**_


_'No! I can't love him!'  
'不！我不能爱他！_


_**"Are you just being stubborn or are you afraid?"  
“你只是固执还是害怕？”**_


_'Even if I love him, it doesn't matter anymore… he's dying. He left me, because he couldn't bear me'  
“即使我爱他，也不再重要了……他快死了。”他离开了我，因为他无法忍受我”_


_**"Love is always a complicated thing Asuka, it brings pain and happiness at the same time. It can make you do things you'd never think you'd ever do"  
“爱总是一件复杂的事情，明日香，它同时带来痛苦和快乐。它可以让你做你从未想过会做的事情”**_


_'Oh you stupid baka! This is not what I wanted. But I know it's my fault. Why? Why couldn't I see this before?'  
‘噢，你这个愚蠢的巴卡！这不是我想要的。但我知道这是我的错。为什么？为什么我以前看不到这个？_


_**"…You don't know how much you want something till it's gone…"  
“……你不知道自己有多想要某样东西，直到它消失了……”**_


The tears poured down Asuka's cheeks freely. She had been denying her true feelings about the third child the whole time and in the end she only just realised when he was about to die; she was truly pathetic.  
泪水顺着明日香的脸颊肆意流淌。她一直在否认自己对老三的真实感情，最后直到他快要死的时候才意识到；她真是可怜。

"No Shinji, don't leave me! I don't want to be alone anymore, I want someone, I need someone, I need you. I need you by my side, so please Shinji you can't leave me now… you just can't… please…" she shouted to the boy.  
“不，真嗣，不要离开我！我不想再一个人了，我想要一个人，我需要一个人，我需要你。我需要你在我身边，所以拜托真嗣你现在不能离开我......你就是不能……求你……”她对男孩喊道。

But the brown-haired boy didn't respond…  
但棕发少年却没有回应……

End Notes: No Shinji, No! Though I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter.  
尾注：不，真嗣，不！但我希望你喜欢阅读这一章。

When Misato says 'you cannot callous the soul,' she's basically just saying 'no matter what you do, it'll always hurt.'  
当美里说“你不能麻木不仁的灵魂”时，她基本上只是在说“无论你做什么，总会受伤。”

The whole kissing scene with Shinji and Asuka was to show that Asuka has gotten past some of her barriers and sees Shinji as physically attractive.  
真嗣和明日香的整个接吻场景是为了表明明日香已经克服了一些障碍，并认为真嗣在外表上很有吸引力。

About Shinji speaking German, he has been living with Asuka for a while and I also presume he has done World War II history.  
关于真嗣说德语，他已经和明日香住了一段时间了，我还推测他学过二战历史。

The last scene was extremely difficult to write. I was wondering how I could possibly make Asuka convince herself she had feelings for Shinji and of course, there were so many lines from throughout my story. I went as far back as the 5th chapter I think. But anyway, I also had to do this the next day as Asuka's emotions were at her peak, from first being jealous of Aria the past few days, having witnessed her die and played a part in it as well and then have Shinji admit his love. All the emotions weigh down on her and she is finally able to realise her feelings. It still took a lot of convincing, yikes she is a difficult girl. Anyways, I had read so many fanfiction that made Asuka realise she loves Shinji after he uses jealousy and I always thought it wasn't sufficient to make Asuka crack like that, so I went one step further.  
最后一个场景非常难写。我想知道如何才能让明日香说服自己她对真嗣有感情，当然，我的故事中有很多台词。我想我可以追溯到第五章。但无论如何，第二天我也必须这样做，因为明日香的情绪达到了顶峰，从这几天开始嫉妒亚莉亚，到目睹她的死亡并参与其中，再到让真嗣承认他的爱。所有的情绪都压在她身上，她终于能够意识到自己的感受。仍然需要很多说服力，哎呀，她是一个很难相处的女孩。无论如何，我读了很多同人小说，在真嗣使用嫉妒之后，明日香意识到她爱着真嗣，我一直认为这还不足以让明日香那样崩溃，所以我更进一步。

Author's Notes: To all my readers there were some oddities at the end of the last chapter, however, believe me when I say that after reading this chapter the previous chapter will make much more sense.

### Chapter 19: At Last
The scene looked tragic; a boy covered in blood on the ground being held by a crying redhead in an alleyway. The NERV Tactical Operations Director was also on the floor crying, a little further back from where the two eva pilots were. A few bystanders were watching in horror, as they could do nothing to help. It was in the afternoon and the sun still beat down on the group mercilessly. _'Damn NERV, why were there no Section 2 agents here to stop him? Wait a second… I didn't even see someone go chase after the man who shot Shinji… this doesn't make any sense…'_ Misato thought.  
场面看起来很悲惨。一名男孩浑身是血倒在小巷里，被一名哭泣的红发男子抱住。 NERV 战术行动总监也在地板上哭泣，距离两名 eva 飞行员所在的位置稍远一些。一些旁观者惊恐地看着，却无能为力。已经是下午了，阳光依然无情地照射着一行人。 “该死的NERV，为什么没有第二处特工来阻止他？等一下……我什至没有看到有人去追那个射杀真嗣的人……这没有任何意义……”美里想道。

The Major got up, sensing something completely wrong with what had happened. At that moment, the man with the balaclava returned from his hiding spot and took off his balaclava, revealing the face of Kaji.  
少校站了起来，他感觉到发生的事情完全不对劲。就在这时，戴着巴拉克拉法帽的男子从藏身之处回来，脱下了巴拉克拉法帽，露出了卡吉的脸。

"Kaji?!" Misato shouted in shock.  
“加吉？！”美里震惊地喊道。

"Operation 'Asuka confesses' successfully completed Shinji" Kaji announced.  
“‘明日香告白’行动成功完成了真嗣”，梶宣布。

Shinji sat up and spat two tablets out of his mouth.  
真嗣坐起身来，从嘴里吐出了两粒药片。

"Urghh, I can't believe you told me to bite down as hard as I could on those stupid pastels, I almost choked on that crap" Shinji remarked casually.  
“呃，我不敢相信你让我尽我所能地咬那些愚蠢的粉彩，我差点被那些垃圾噎住了”真嗣漫不经心地说道。

Asuka looked up wide-eyed, unable to believe what was going on.  
明日香睁大了眼睛，不敢相信发生了什么。

"Well it gave more of an effect, hell _I_ thought you were dead for a second" Kaji replied.  
“好吧，它产生了更多的效果，天哪，我还以为你死了呢，”卡吉回答道。

Misato started to glare at her lover menacingly and Kaji cringed in fear.  
美里开始恶狠狠地瞪着她的爱人，加持害怕地畏缩起来。

"Alright Section 2, you can stop playing innocent bystanders" Kaji called out.  
“好吧，第二部分，你可以停止扮演无辜的旁观者了”卡吉喊道。

All the people who were pretending to be bystanders walked off and everything resumed as if nothing had happened.  
那些假装围观的人全部散去，一切又恢复如初，就像什么都没发生过一样。

"You died Shinji… I saw you get shot. What's going on?" Asuka asked weakly.  
“你死了，真嗣……我看到你被枪杀了。发生了什么事？”明日香弱弱地问道。

Shinji just smiled sheepishly at her and pulled open his shirt, revealing an exploded sachet still oozing with fake blood. He then pulled a remote out of his pocket and held it up for Asuka to see.  
真嗣只是羞涩地对她微笑，拉开衬衫，露出一个爆炸的香袋，里面还渗着假血。然后他从口袋里掏出一个遥控器，举起来让明日香看。

"This packet is set to explode with the press of a button on this remote. Kaji fired a blank at me and I timed the explosion with the gunshot, giving the illusion of me being shot. It still hurt a bit though" Shinji explained.  
“只要按一下遥控器上的按钮，这个包就会爆炸。梶向我开了一发空弹，我用枪声计时了爆炸的时间，给人一种我被枪杀的错觉。不过还是有点痛，”真嗣解释道。

"We need to talk" Misato said icily to Kaji.  
“我们需要谈谈。”美里冷冷地对加持说道。

"Of course Katsuragi" Kaji conceded, sweat dropping.  
“当然是葛城。”梶承认道，汗水流了下来。

The two adults walked off out of sight, leaving the two eva pilots alone. Asuka had an angry look on her face; she looked just about ready to blow up.  
两个成年人消失在视线之外，只剩下两名逃生飞行员。明日香脸上露出愤怒的表情。她看起来快要爆炸了。

"HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME YOU FUCKING MORON?! I THOUGHT YOU DIED YOU STUPID PIECE OF SHIT!" Asuka shouted, slapping him on the face as hard as she could.  
“你怎么能这样对我，你这个白痴？！我还以为你死了，你这个蠢货！”明日香大叫一声，用尽全力打在他脸上。

In the background another voice could be heard shouting and Shinji silently prayed that Kaji wouldn't get severely injured.  
背景中传来另一个声音的叫喊声，真嗣默默地祈祷加持不要受重伤。

"I know Asuka, I know. I really didn't want to resort to this, but you left me no choice" Shinji defended.  
“我了解明日香，我知道。我真的不想诉诸这个，但你让我别无选择”真嗣辩解道。


_**"No Shinji, don't leave me! I don't want to be alone anymore, I want someone, I need someone, I need you. I need you by my side, so please Shinji you can't leave me now… you just can't… please…"  
“不，真嗣，不要离开我！我不想再一个人了，我想要一个人，我需要一个人，我需要你。我需要你在我身边，所以拜托真嗣你现在不能离开我......你就是不能……拜托……”**_


The redhead remembered her admission; she couldn't take back what she had said and it was true anyway. "I thought you were dead Shinji" she started, her voice wavering a little, "Don't EVER scare me like that again!" she said, tears strolling down her face. Asuka quickly wiped her tears, not wanting to show him any weakness.  
红发女郎记得她承认过。她无法收回自己说过的话，但无论如何，这都是事实。 “我以为你死了，真嗣，”她开始说道，声音有点颤抖，“别再这样吓我了！”她说，泪水从她的脸上滑落。明日香赶紧擦掉眼泪，不想向他示弱。

"I swear I will never scare you like this again Asuka… I just didn't know how else to get you to realise your feelings for me. I promise I will never leave you again" Shinji assured firmly.  
“我发誓我再也不会像这样吓到你了，明日香……我只是不知道还能怎样让你意识到你对我的感情。我保证我再也不会离开你了。”真嗣坚定地保证。

"You are such a dickhead Ikari! To think I was actually regretting what I did earlier. How the hell did you get Kaji in on this as well? How the in the world did you set this up?" Asuka asked incredulously.  
“碇你真是个白痴！没想到我真的在后悔自己之前的所作所为。你到底是怎么把加持也卷入这件事的？你到底是怎么安排的？”明日香不可置信地问道。

"Do you recall a while ago Kaji and I having a talk?" the boy reminded her. "He gave me this suggestion because he really wanted to see you happy Asuka. Kaji said faking my death was probably the only thing that would work. However, I told him to only use this as a last resort, when I had no other way. He called the Commander today and he arranged for this part of the city to be cleared of people so no one would witness it. Then he got the section 2 agents watching us to play as innocent bystanders so you wouldn't suspect anything"  
“你还记得我和加持之前谈过话吗？”男孩提醒她。 “他给我这个建议是因为他真的很想看到你快乐的明日香。卡吉说假死可能是唯一可行的办法。然而，我告诉他这只能作为最后的手段，当我没有其他办法时今天他给指挥官打电话，安排了这部分区域的人员清理，这样就不会有人目睹这一情况，然后他让第二区的特工监视我们，让我们扮演无辜的旁观者，这样你就不会怀疑任何事情。”

"You might just actually die anyway boy, I really feel like killing you myself third child! What's to stop me from murdering you right here, right now?" the redhead threatened.  
“无论如何，你可能真的会死，孩子，我真的很想亲手杀死你，第三个孩子！有什么可以阻止我现在就在这里谋杀你？”红发威胁道。

"I love you" Shinji quickly replied, cowering in fear.  
“我爱你。”真嗣迅速回答，害怕得瑟瑟发抖。

But instead of the multiple blows Shinji thought he would receive, he instead received a passionate kiss from the young girl. Shinji was amazed at the sheer emotion behind it and after he got over the initial shock, he kissed her back just as fiercely. Asuka felt the disgusting taste of the fake blood in the kiss, but didn't really care. After a while, the two parted and Asuka looked at him with an irritated expression.  
然而，真嗣并没有想象中会受到多重打击，反而收到了少女的热烈吻。真嗣对这背后的纯粹情感感到惊讶，在克服了最初的震惊后，他同样猛烈地回吻了她。明日香在这个吻中感受到了假血的恶心味道，但并不在意。过了一会儿，两人分开，明日香一脸恼怒地看着他。

"Love… love is such a strong word for you Shinji, I…I tolerate you" Asuka said, smirking.  
“爱……爱对真嗣来说是一个很强烈的词，我……我容忍你”明日香笑着说。

The young boy grinned at her and the two teens got up off the floor. Asuka then turned around to face Shinji.  
小男孩对她笑了笑，两个青少年从地板上站了起来。然后明日香转过身来面对真嗣。

"You are not getting away with this by the way. When we get home, you're in for some punishment. No one makes a fool of the Great Asuka!" the redhead declared.  
“顺便说一句，你是逃不掉的。当我们回到家时，你会受到一些惩罚。没有人会愚弄伟大的明日香！”红发宣称。

"Yes Asuka" Shinji said, sighing. "Well let's go get Misato and Kaji before Misato kills him"  
“是的，明日香”真嗣叹了口气说道。 “好吧，我们在美里杀死他之前去救美里和加持吧”

The young girl nodded in agreement. The two eva pilots walked hand in hand to where the two adults had walked off. There they saw Kaji cowering in fear behind a trashcan as Misato yelled at the top of her lungs.  
少女点头同意。两名逃亡飞行员手牵手走向两名成年人离开的地方。在那里，他们看到加持害怕地蜷缩在垃圾桶后面，美里大声喊叫。

"You stupid idiot! Why didn't you at least tell _me_ about this?!" Misato shouted at her lover.  
“你这个白痴！你为什么不至少告诉我这件事？！”美里对她的爱人大喊。

"It would have been too suspicious. We couldn't tell you, it most certainly would have ruined the plan" Kaji explained.  
“这太可疑了。我们不能告诉你，这肯定会毁掉计划”卡吉解释道。

Misato stopped her actions when she saw the two teens looking at her with curious expressions, before she sighed.  
看到两个少年用好奇的眼神看着自己，美里停下了动作，叹了口气。

"You get off the hook this time, but _only_ because it worked. If you EVER pull a stunt like this again, I will _personally_ make sure you won't be able to have children EVER AGAIN!" the Major threatened.  
“这次你摆脱了困境，但只是因为它起作用了。如果你再做出这样的事，我将亲自确保你再也不能生孩子了！”少校威胁道。

"Understood Major Katsuragi" Kaji acknowledged, getting up warily.  
“明白了，葛城少校。”梶承认道，小心翼翼地站了起来。

"Alright you two, we're going home. And Shinji, Kaji is not the only one who is in trouble. Be prepared for some disciplinary action" Misato advised to the two eva pilots.  
“好吧，你们两个，我们要回家了。还有真嗣，加持并不是唯一遇到麻烦的人。做好接受纪律处分的准备。”美里对两名EVA飞行员建议道。

"Hai" Shinji replied, sweat dropping. But he didn't care, it was all worth it to finally have Asuka at his side again.  
“嗨”真嗣回答道，汗水流了下来。但他不在乎，终于能再次拥有明日香在自己身边，这一切都是值得的。

"May I have a word with Shinji before he goes?" Kaji requested.  
“在真嗣走之前我可以和他说句话吗？”梶请求道。

Both women eyed him suspiciously and Kaji couldn't help withering a little under their gaze. After what seemed liked years, Misato finally sighed. "Alright, but make it quick" the Major said.  
两个女人都狐疑地看着他，加持在她们的注视下不禁脸色有些萎靡。过了好几年，美里终于叹了口气。 “好吧，但是要快点。”少校说道。

The young boy walked over to Kaji, grateful for the temporary release from the two fuming women. The spy looked down at Shinji, smiling slightly.  
小男孩走到加持身边，感谢这两个愤怒的女人暂时的解脱。间谍低头看着真嗣，微微一笑。

"I have just one question. When I got to you, I saw you trying to shoot the gun yourself. I know I was running late but I still made it before the girls did, why did you do that?" Kaji asked.  
“我只有一​​个问题。当我找到你时，我看到你试图自己开枪。我知道我迟到了，但我还是比女孩们先到了，你为什么这么做？”加治问道。

"Well actually, I was just testing it out to see if it worked in case you didn't come and I had to shoot myself. I was actually a little worried when I couldn't pull the trigger, I thought the whole plan was going to fail or that you had given me the wrong gun or something. Thanks for taking the gun off me, I had no idea about the safety" Shinji explained.  
“其实，我只是想测试一下，万一你不来，​​我就得开枪自杀。当我扣动扳机时，我其实有点担心，我以为整个计划都是这样的。”会失败，或者你给了我错误的枪什么的，谢谢你把枪从我身上拿走，我不知道安全性。”真嗣解释道。

"Yeah no problem, I was a bit late in reaching you after all. Once I heard a car screech to a halt, I knew they had arrived so I had no time to explain anything and immediately got ready to shoot you" Kaji replied.  
“是啊，没问题，毕竟我来晚了一点。当我听到汽车急刹车时，我知道他们已经到了，所以我没有时间解释任何事情，立即准备向你开枪。”卡吉回答道。

"Yep, that makes sense. Anyways it worked out well, so thanks for the help" Shinji said, before noticing the two girls were still glaring at him, "Well I've _really_ got to go now, see ya"  
“是的，这是有道理的。无论如何，效果很好，所以谢谢你的帮助。”真嗣说道，然后注意到两个女孩还在瞪着他，“好吧，我现在真的要走了，再见”

The young boy walked back to his two roommates cautiously, noticing they eyed him as a hawk eyed their prey.  
小男孩小心翼翼地走回他的两个室友身边，注意到他们看着他，就像鹰看着猎物一样。

"You remember what I said Shinji?" Misato asked.  
“你还记得我对慎二说的话吗？”美里问道。

Shinji nodded gravely. 慎二郑重地点点头。

"Don't worry Misato, I'll be sure MY Shinji gets what he deserves" Asuka remarked, smiling cruelly.  
“别担心美里，我一定会确保我的真嗣得到他应得的报应”明日香说道，笑容残酷。

The two girls shared an evil grin that Shinji didn't like in the least. _'Goodbye independence, freedom and dignity'_ Shinji thought wearily. Kaji had mysteriously disappeared and Misato exhaled in irritation. The three roommates went back to the Major's car and got in, with both Shinji and Asuka in the back. Misato drove off, speeding down the road towards their apartment. As they sat, Shinji edged his hand towards Asuka's. The redhead noticed his actions and rolled her eyes, giving him her hand.  
两个女孩露出邪恶的笑容，真嗣一点也不喜欢。 “再见，独立、自由和尊严。”真嗣疲倦地想。加持神秘地消失了，美里恼怒地呼了口气。三个室友回到少校的车里坐了进去，真嗣和明日香都坐在后面。美里开车离开，沿着道路飞速朝他们的公寓驶去。当他们坐下时，真嗣把手伸向明日香的手。红发女郎注意到了他的动作，翻了个白眼，把手伸给了他。

"For God's sake, just take it already you retard" Asuka let out, annoyed.  
“看在上帝的份上，就接受吧，你这个弱智”明日香恼怒地说道。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling as he entwined his fingers with hers. The boy moved closer to her, he knew she was still hurting inside and would never admit how deeply the incident affected her. The redhead just gave him a curious glance as he put an arm around her and pulled her closer to him. Shinji decided to be a little bolder and moved his face to her neck where he nuzzled her softly, eliciting a pleased moan from the young girl.  
真嗣忍不住笑了，手指与她十指相扣。男孩靠近了她，他知道她内心仍在受伤，却永远不会承认这件事对她的影响有多深。红发女郎只是好奇地看了他一眼，然后用一只手臂搂住她，把她拉得更近。真嗣决定大胆一点，把脸移到她的脖子上，轻轻地用鼻子蹭着她，引得年轻女孩发出愉悦的呻吟声。

"You know I'm not going to cut you any slack" Asuka declared.  
“你知道我不会对你有任何懈怠”明日香宣称。

"I know" he replied. “我知道”他回答道。

"Baka" the redhead added.  
“巴卡”红发补充道。

"Your baka" he answered. “你的巴卡”他回答道。

"Damn straight you're mine!" Asuka said possessively.  
“该死的，你就是我的了！”明日香占有欲十足地说道。

The young girl turned her head and kissed him on the lips once again. Cheekily, she held his nose and pulled his hair painfully as she deepened the kiss. Misato was watching the couple's actions in the rear-view mirror with an amused expression.  
少女转过头，再次吻住了他的唇。她厚颜无耻地捏住他的鼻子，痛苦地揪着他的头发，加深了这个吻。美里一脸有趣地从后视镜里注视着这对夫妇的举动。

"Ok you two lovebirds, keep your hands off each other please!" Misato remarked.  
“好吧，你们两只爱情鸟，请把手放开！”美里说道。

The two teens parted instantly, blushing.  
两个少年脸色通红，立刻分开。

"I am not a slut like you Misato! You keep your eyes on the road where they're supposed to be!" Asuka shouted.  
“我不是像你一样的荡妇美里！你的眼睛要盯着它们应该在的地方！”明日香喊道。

Misato slammed the brakes, making the two eva pilots lurch forward.  
美里猛踩刹车，两名EVA飞行员猛地向前倾斜。

"We're home" Misato announced, smiling innocently.  
“我们到家了”美里宣布，天真地微笑着。

The pair cast a glare at Misato and got out of the car, just glad to finally be back at their apartment. The trio walked up the stairs and to their door. Misato unlocked the door and held the door open for the two teens to walk through.  
两人看了美里一眼，下了车，很高兴终于回到了公寓。三人走上楼梯，来到了门口。美里打开门锁，并把门打开，让两个青少年走进去。

"Actually, it's your lucky day today Shinji. I'm going to go find Kaji and kick his ass. Although I'm sure _Asuka_ can take care of you well enough" Misato said, grinning mischievously as she closed the door, leaving the two eva pilots alone in the apartment.  
“其实，今天是你的幸运日，真嗣。我要去找到加持，狠狠地踢他的屁股。不过我相信明日香能照顾好你。”美里说着，调皮地笑着关上门，离开了房间。两名 eva 飞行员独自待在公寓里。

Shinji looked at Asuka warily, wondering what she was going to do. She took a step forward and he backed away instantly in fear. Asuka smiled at his reaction and raised her leg. Shinji just looked at her confused, before getting kicked hard in the stomach. The poor boy collapsed onto the floor, utterly winded, gasping for air.  
真嗣警惕地看着明日香，不知道她要做什么。她向前迈了一步，他立刻害怕地后退。明日香对他的反应微笑并抬起腿。真嗣只是困惑地看着她，然后就被狠狠地踢在了肚子上。可怜的男孩倒在地板上，气喘吁吁，气喘吁吁。

"I don't think I'll ever forgive you for doing what you did to me Shinji, but I have an idea" she said, smiling smugly.  
“我想我永远不会原谅你对我所做的事，真嗣，但我有一个主意，”她得意地微笑着说道。

Shinji found himself unable to move as he was in immense pain and so he just looked up at the redhead expectantly.  
真嗣发现自己无法动弹，因为他感到剧烈的疼痛，所以他只是抬起头期待地看着红发。

"Your punishment, Shinji Ikari, is as follows" she started, stepping her foot down onto his chest, "I demand that you become my lawful and wedded husband, who will be totally obedient to me, respect me, never leave me and always be mine. Do you accept?" she finished, taking the ring out of her pocket and holding it out.  
“你的惩罚，碇真嗣，”她开始说，把脚踩在他的胸口上，“我要求你成为我的合法丈夫，完全服从我，尊重我，永远不离开我，永远成为我的，你接受吗？”她说完，从口袋里掏出戒指，递了过去。

"Do I have a choice?" Shinji asked, which was followed by a glare so frightening the boy instantly accepted her proposal.  
“我还有选择吗？”真嗣问道，紧接着是一个令人恐惧的眼神，男孩立即接受了她的提议。

The redhead looked at him expectantly for a while, Shinji himself just looked up at her confused. The girl kicked the boy in frustration.  
红发期待地看了他一会儿，真嗣自己也只是疑惑地抬头看着她。女孩沮丧地踢了男孩一脚。

"You baka, you're supposed to slip the ring on my finger" she directed.  
“你这个笨蛋，你应该把戒指戴在我的手指上”她指示道。

"Oh" was all Shinji said as he reached up to take the ring. He slipped the ring onto the redhead's finger and Asuka smiled. "How did you get my ring anyway Asuka?" Shinji asked, curious.  
当真嗣伸手接过戒指时，他只说了一声“哦”。他把戒指戴到红发的手指上，明日香微笑起来。 “明日香你是怎么得到我的戒指的？”真嗣好奇地问道。

"Found it in your room. A curious item, especially as it had an engraving on it you asked me to translate. What was it? 'Love is forever' what rubbish, it should have said 'idiocy is forever.' Honestly you couldn't go about it like a sensible person, no you had to be a total idiot" Asuka complained.  
“在你的房间里发现的。一件奇怪的东西，尤其是上面有一个雕刻，你让我翻译。那是什么？‘爱是永恒的’什么垃圾，它应该说‘白痴是永恒的’。”老实说，你不能像一个明智的人那样去做，不，你必须是一个彻头彻尾的白痴。”明日香抱怨道。

"I'm the idiot? You are the most difficult woman I've ever met, denying and resisting any attempt I took at getting together. What the hell was I supposed to do?" Shinji shot back, getting up.  
“我是白痴？你是我见过的最难相处的女人，否认并抵制我任何想要在一起的尝试。我到底该怎么办？”真嗣反击，站了起来。

"Trust you not to understand women at all!" Asuka snapped.  
“相信你根本不懂女人！”明日香厉声说道。

"Trust you not to realise how impossible you are!" Shinji retorted.  
“相信你不会意识到你是多么不可能！”慎二反驳道。

"How stupid do you have to be to fake your own death just to get a girl?" she refuted.  
“你到底有多蠢，为了得到一个女孩而假死？”她反驳道。

"How stupid do you have to be to have to have someone fake their own death for you to realise you like them?" he countered.  
“你得有多蠢才会让别人假死你才发现你喜欢他们？”他反驳道。

"You are just a stupid, perverted baka. That's all there is to it!" she rebuked.  
“你就是个又蠢又变态的笨蛋，仅此而已！”她斥责道。

"You are just a stuck up, arrogant bitch. _That's_ all there is to it!" he shot back.  
“你就是一个自以为是、傲慢的贱人。仅此而已！”他还击了。

"_I_ am the Great Sohryu Asuka Langley" she declared.  
“我是伟大的Sohryu Asuka Langley”她宣称。

"And _I_ am the Invincible Shinji Ikari" he replied.  
“我是无敌碇真司”他回答道。

"You can't win against me, just stop arguing already!" the redhead demanded.  
“你赢不了我的，别再争论了！”红发问道。

Shinji was just about to retort when she forced her lips onto his, shoving him up against the wall and forcing her tongue inside his mouth. The boy wilted under her assault and gave in to her fury. Their two tongues battled ferociously for dominance as Asuka ran her hand through Shinji's hair roughly. Shinji finally managed to free his arms from behind his back and wrapped his arms around the redhead's waist pulling her closer. Boldly, the boy moved one of his hands down and groped her ass. She responded by grabbing his hand and twisting it painfully. The boy cried out in pain, halting the passionate exchange.  
真嗣正要反驳，她却用力吻上了他的嘴唇，将他推到墙上，将舌头塞进他的嘴里。男孩在她的攻击下萎靡不振，屈服于她的愤怒。当明日香的手粗鲁地穿过真嗣的头发时，他们的两条舌头为争夺主导地位而激烈地战斗。真嗣终于从背后挣脱了双手，环住了红发的腰，将她拉近了一些。男孩大胆地放下一只手，摸索着她的屁股。她的反应是抓住他的手，痛苦地扭动着。男孩痛苦地大叫起来，停止了激烈的交流。

"That's my injured hand!" Shinji shouted.  
“那是我受伤的手！”真嗣喊道。

"Serves you right for trying to cop a feel" Asuka rebuked.  
“你试图去应对一种感觉，这是你的错。”明日香斥责道。

"Was it so unpleasant?" he teased.  
“有那么不愉快吗？”他取笑道。

"You didn't ask my permission" she retorted.  
“你没有征求我的同意。”她反驳道。

"You didn't ask my permission to kiss me either" he countered.  
“你也没有征求我的同意来吻我，”他反驳道。

"That's different!" she contended.  
“那不一样！”她争辩道。

"No, you were just using a cheap method to win the argument!" he rebuked.  
“不，你只是用了一种廉价的手段来赢得这场争论而已！”他斥责道。

"Get used to it you retard!" she shot back.  
“你这个弱智，要习惯了！”她还击。

The two looked at each other and burst out laughing. All their anger at each other had finally been released. The two teens then noticed their current position and blushed slightly. Shinji still had one arm around her waist and they were so close, they were practically grinding. The boy couldn't help but think how sexy Asuka looked. Her illustrious red hair hung loosely about her and she had a playful smile on her. From his view, he could see down her top and he liked what he saw. Shinji kissed her neck, sucking on her skin gently. He moved his mouth over her shoulders and neck, planting wet kisses all over.  
两人对视一眼，哈哈大笑起来。彼此之间所有的怒火，终于都释放了出来。两个少年这才注意到自己现在的位置，脸都微微红了。真嗣仍然用一只手臂搂着她的腰，他们离得很近，几乎磨碎了。男孩忍不住想到明日香看起来多么性感。一头红发披散在身上，脸上挂着俏皮的笑容。从他的角度来看，他可以看到她的上半身，他喜欢他所看到的。真嗣亲吻她的脖颈，温柔地吮吸着她的肌肤。他的唇移过她的肩膀和脖颈，湿漉漉的吻遍布全身。

"I love you" he said softly.  
“我爱你”他轻声说。

"And so you should" she replied matter-of-factly.  
“所以你应该”她实事求是地回答。

Shinji looked deeply into her eyes and Asuka flicked him on the forehead, giving him a puzzled look. Truth be told, Asuka was uncomfortable with their new relationship, but she knew she loved him. She loved him because she trusted him and believed he would never leave her. However, the girl still couldn't help but feel a little vulnerable, after all Shinji had finally broken down all her barriers. And Asuka knew that no matter what, they would experience pain caused by the other. But at the moment she felt happy, genuinely happy, for once.  
真嗣深深地看着她的眼睛，明日香轻拍他的额头，露出困惑的表情。说实话，明日香对他们的新关系感到不舒服，但她知道她爱他。她爱他，因为她信任他，相信他永远不会离开她。不过，女孩还是忍不住感到有些脆弱，毕竟真嗣终于打破了她所有的障碍。而明日香知道，无论如何，他们都会经历对方带来的痛苦。但此刻她却感到幸福，真正的幸福，这一次。

"I think you should clean yourself up, the blood splattered look doesn't do anything for you" Asuka remarked.  
“我觉得你应该把自己清理干净，血迹斑斑的样子对你没有任何帮助。”明日香说道。

The redhead moved off of Shinji as he looked at himself, noticing that the fake blood that had dripped down onto his chin had dried there. His shirt was soaked with crimson and his pants were a little splattered.  
红发从真嗣身上移开，看着自己，发现滴在下巴上的假血已经干了。他的衬衫被猩红浸湿，裤子上也沾满了血迹。

"Yeah, I gotta go have a shower to clean this gunk off. You wanna join me?" he asked, winking at her.  
“是的，我得去洗个澡，把这些东西洗掉。你想和我一起去吗？”他问，对她眨了眨眼。

"No way!" she snapped, slapping him; though not as hard as she usually did. "Stop being such a pervert, honestly"  
“决不！”她厉声喝道，打了他一巴掌。虽然不像平时那么努力。 “别再这么变态了，老实说”

"I'm just voicing your desires for you" he teased.  
他开玩笑说：“我只是表达你对你的渴望。”

"My mind is not full of sick perverted fantasies like yours. If you keep going on like this, I won't even let you hold my hand for a month!" she threatened.  
“我脑子里可没有你这种病态的变态幻想，你再这样下去，我一个月都不会让你牵我的手的！”她威胁道。


_**'One of these days, I'll probably become your slave anyway'  
“总有一天，我可能会成为你的奴隶”**_


It had been a passing thought at the time, but he couldn't believe that it was becoming a reality. Shinji kept his mouth shut, as he wanted to do much more than hold her hand. As Shinji walked off, Asuka smiled in triumph. The boy went to his room with his shoulders slumped. He wondered how long it would take to get Asuka to sleep with him. The sexual tension was building up again and now that she was his again, he didn't know if he could hold himself back. The male eva pilot opened his door and entered his room, dismissing his thoughts; he didn't want to think of Asuka as just an object, there was more to his love than just sex.  
当时这个想法只是一闪而过，但他不敢相信这正在成为现实。真嗣闭上了嘴，因为他想做的不仅仅是握住她的手。当真嗣走开时，明日香露出胜利的微笑。男孩垂着肩膀走进自己的房间。他想知道需要多长时间才能让明日香和他一起睡觉。性的紧张感再次增强，现在她又是他的了，他不知道自己是否能克制住自己。男EVA飞行员打开门，走进自己的房间，打消了自己的思绪；他不想把明日香仅仅视为一个物体，他的爱不仅仅是性。

Shinji looked through his wardrobe to get some new clothes. He momentarily wondered when Asuka had taken the ring from his room, but then figured she could have taken it anytime last week as he hadn't checked on it since he got it. The boy looked out the window and saw the sun wasn't setting just yet, but it was a little darker and he probably guessed it was somewhere around five o'clock. Shinji looked up at his clock and found his thoughts confirmed as he read 4:53. _'Has that much time passed already? When I think about it though, we arranged for Misato and Asuka to arrive at around four o'clock so I guess that's right'_  
真嗣翻遍衣柜，想买几件新衣服。他一时想知道明日香什么时候从他的房间拿走了戒指，但随后又想到她可能在上周的任何时候拿走了它，因为自从他拿到戒指以来他就没有检查过它。男孩向窗外望去，发现太阳还没有落山，但天色有些暗了，他猜大概已经是五点左右了。真嗣抬头看了看时钟，当他读到4点53分时，他的想法得到了证实。 ‘已经过去那么久了吗？不过仔细想想，我们安排美里和明日香在四点左右到达，所以我想是的。”

Shinji left his new clothes on his bed, exited his room and headed towards the shower, noticing some music playing. He nearly fell over as he saw Asuka dancing in the living room to the music. The boy had rarely ever seen the redhead dance and only had the pleasure of dancing with her once. He wondered why he hadn't heard the music till now. The redhead noticed Shinji staring at her and pulled her lip down at him with her finger seductively. Shinji's chest exploded as his heart began to pound heavily. _'God, doesn't she realise what a turn on she is?'_ Part of him wanted to run into the bathroom and escape, another part wanted to go into the living room to show Asuka just how much he loved her. His indecision left him rooted to the spot.  
真嗣把新衣服放在床上，离开房间朝淋浴间走去，注意到正在播放音乐。当他看到明日香在客厅随着音乐跳舞时，他差点摔倒。男孩很少见过红发跳舞，也只有幸和她跳舞过一次。他想知道为什么他到现在才听到音乐。红发女郎注意到真嗣在盯着她看，于是用手指诱惑地向他拉下嘴唇。真嗣的胸口爆炸了，他的心脏开始剧烈地跳动。 “天哪，她难道没有意识到自己有多令人兴奋吗？”他一方面想跑进浴室逃走，另一方面又想走进客厅，向明日香展示他有多么爱她。他的优柔寡断让他呆在原地。

Asuka smiled cheekily and bent over, revealing her ample bosom to the boy, causing his jaw to drop. _'Since when was Asuka such a tease?'_ he thought. Shinji was deeply tempted, but decided one night was better than a month. He tore his face away and walked into the bathroom. Asuka was a little shocked he had resisted her charms, but knew he would wear down eventually. Having exhausted herself a little from the dancing, she turned the music off and sat down on the couch.  
明日香厚颜无耻地笑了笑，弯下腰，向男孩展示了她丰满的胸部，让他下巴都掉下来了。 “明日香什么时候变得这么爱捉弄人了？”他以为。真嗣深受诱惑，但决定一晚比一个月好。他撇开脸，走进了浴室。明日香对他抗拒了她的魅力感到有点震惊，但他知道自己最终会疲惫不堪。跳舞有点累了，她关掉音乐，坐在沙发上。

Today had been quite a turmoil for the redhead. Having woken up only to have a heated discussion with Misato, forcing her to remember the awful day that was yesterday. All the emotions from that day had surged up again and she just wanted to go back to her room to stay in solitude. Next thing, Shinji barges into her room saying the lamest pick-up line in history, followed by his kiss. She had just wanted to give in then; she had been growing tired of pushing him away, especially that she knew he loved her. Her fear, however, had stopped her as always. Then Misato guilted her into looking for that baka, which she grudgingly accepted to do so in secret. Although, having snuck out ended up being pointless as Misato later found her outside Rei's apartment.  
今天对于红发来说是相当混乱的一天。醒来后却和美里激烈地讨论，让她回想起昨天那糟糕的一天。那天的情绪又涌了上来，她只想回自己的房间去静静。接下来，真嗣闯进她的房间，说出了史上最蹩脚的搭讪台词，然后是他的吻。那时她只想屈服；她已经厌倦了把他推开，尤其是她知道他爱她。然而，她的恐惧一如既往地阻止了她。然后美里对她寻找那个巴卡感到内疚，她勉强接受秘密这样做。不过，偷偷溜出去最终毫无意义，因为美里后来在丽的公寓外面找到了她。

Asuka had been angry the entire time, it seemed like everyone was ganging up on her now. If she wanted to be with Shinji, she wanted to choose it herself not be coerced into it. However, a part of her knew that her stubbornness was something to be reckoned with and perhaps everyone just realised that. Of course, the most shocking part of the day had been after Misato picked her up and drove her to the store. One of the strongest feelings was that of betrayal. After all Shinji had said, he was going to leave her anyway. The redhead had felt her stomach drop when she saw him get shot. In her head it just seemed impossible, after all he was the "invincible Shinji." Running over to him and seeing him cough up blood dispelled her doubts however and she hadn't even bothered to check his wound.  
明日香一直很生气，看来现在所有人都在联合起来对付她。如果她想和真嗣在一起，她要自己选择，而不是被强迫。然而，她的一部分知道，她的固执是不可忽视的，也许每个人都刚刚意识到这一点。当然，这一天最令人震惊的部分是美里接她并开车送她去商店之后。最强烈的感觉之一就是背叛。真嗣说了这么多，他无论如何都要离开她。当红发女郎看到他被枪杀时，她感到胃部一沉。在她看来，这似乎是不可能的，毕竟他是“无敌的真嗣”。跑到他身边，看到他咳血，她的疑虑就打消了，她甚至懒得去检查他的伤口。

His death had hurt the girl quite profoundly, most of it coming from the fact that she finally realised she loved him and now their chance together was gone. When Shinji had sat back up as if nothing had happened, she really felt like killing him herself. The only thing that had stopped her is that she knew Shinji had gone through much the same pain because of her. Naturally, her anger had then turned to Kaji; first for suggesting the idea to Shinji and then shooting him, but he had mysteriously disappeared. Though Asuka supposed that Misato would give him what he deserved. Upon coming home, Asuka was glad Misato had left her alone with him. Now she had Shinji all to herself.  
他的死对这个女孩造成了相当深的伤害，大部分是因为她终于意识到自己爱他，而现在他们在一起的机会已经消失了。当真嗣若无其事地坐起来时，她真想亲手杀了他。唯一阻止她的是她知道真嗣因为她而经历了同样的痛苦。自然，她的愤怒转向了加持。首先是向真嗣提出这个想法，然后开枪射杀了他，但他却神秘地消失了。尽管明日香认为美里会给他他应得的。回到家后，明日香很高兴美里把她单独留在身边。现在真嗣就属于她一个人了。

There were so many conflicting emotions within the girl, she wanted to kick him and she wanted to kiss him at the same time, so she did both. Asuka hadn't remembered about the ring till she had entered their residence. As she recalled her having it, she thought that it was a fabulous way to ensure Shinji stayed with her. Besides, what better punishment was there than to be her husband. _'That bastard loves me fine, but I'll show him what he got himself into'_ she thought mischievously.  
女孩心里有太多矛盾的情绪，她想踢他，又想亲他，所以她就两者都做了。明日香直到进入他们的住所才想起戒指的事。当她回忆起自己拥有它时，她认为这是确保真嗣留在她身边的绝佳方式。再说了，还有什么比成为她的丈夫更好的惩罚呢。 “那个混蛋很爱我，但我会让他看看他陷入了什么困境，”她调皮地想。

And so, with her anger at the boy released and everything turning out wonderfully for the redhead, she was finally at peace. The day was getting late and they had school tomorrow. Asuka still wanted to do something today and now that she had Shinji with her as well, she could have some extra fun. The redhead got off the couch and went over to her room.  
于是，随着她对男孩的愤怒得到释放，红发的一切都变得美好，她终于平静了。天色已晚，明天还要上学。明日香今天还想做点什么，现在又有真嗣在身边，她就可以玩得更开心了。红发女郎从沙发上下来，朝自己的房间走去。

---

The boy had walked into the bathroom and closed the door quickly before he decided otherwise. He stripped off his clothes and entered the shower. After turning on the hot water, he relaxed under the gentle stream of water as it calmed his nerves. Shinji made sure to clean himself thoroughly, not wanting any trace of the crimson substance left on him. Alone in the shower, he began to think about the incident today.  
男孩走进浴室，迅速关上门，然后又做出了其他决定。他脱掉衣服，走进淋浴间。打开热水后，他在轻柔的水流下放松下来，安抚着紧张的神经。真嗣一定要把自己彻底清洗干净，不想让红色物质在自己身上留下任何痕迹。一个人洗澡的时候，他开始回想今天的事情。

After having left the house, the boy was still angry at Asuka's stubbornness but knew it was difficult for her. He really didn't want to have to resort to using Kaji's plan, but he saw no alternative. Plus, with all the recent happenings that had happened, it would indeed have seemed like he was trying to take his life, not that he wasn't actually depressed. So with this resolve, Shinji had called Kaji to initiate the plan and made his way to the spy's place to get the gun, blood pastels and the fake blood sachet from him.  
离开家后，男孩仍然对明日香的固执感到愤怒，但也知道这对她来说很困难。他确实不想采用加持的计划，但他别无选择。另外，考虑到最近发生的所有事情，他确实看起来像是在试图结束自己的生命，而不是说他实际上并不沮丧。于是，真嗣下定决心，打电话给加持，启动了这个计划，并前往间谍的住处，从他那里拿到了枪、血粉笔和假血袋。

Shinji had then left Kaji to get everything else prepared while he made his way to the store. As he was waiting in the alleyway for Kaji to come, he had pulled out the gun to test it. The boy had panicked when he first heard the car screeching to a halt as he knew Asuka had arrived; thankfully Kaji showed up just in time. Little did Shinji know, that it had been pure luck that Asuka had shown up as he didn't know she had gone out to look for him. As the girls came, he had a few moments of uncertainty but luckily Kaji was the one who was shooting him and the older man went through with it.  
真嗣留下加持去准备一切，自己则前往商店。当他在巷子里等待加持到来的时候，他已经掏出枪来试探一下。当男孩第一次听到汽车急刹车时，他惊慌失措，因为他知道明日香已经到了。幸亏加吉及时出现。真嗣并不知道，明日香的出现纯属运气，因为他不知道她已经出去寻找他了。当女孩们到来时，他有一段时间犹豫不决，但幸运的是，卡吉是开枪射杀他的人，年长的男人也照办了。

Having washed himself thoroughly, the boy turned off the water in the shower. He exited the shower and took a towel to dry himself. Shinji then placed the towel around his waist and exited the bathroom. Asuka was on her way back to her room as the door to the bathroom opened, revealing a half-naked Shinji with a towel around his waist. Shinji raised an eyebrow at the girl and she blew him a kiss.  
彻底洗漱完毕后，男孩关掉了淋浴间的水龙头。他退出淋浴间，拿起毛巾擦干身体。真嗣将毛巾围在腰上，走出了浴室。明日香正在回房间的路上，浴室的门打开了，真嗣露出了半裸的身躯，腰间围着一条毛巾。真嗣对女孩扬起一边眉毛，女孩给了他一个飞吻。

"Stop tempting me Asuka" he remarked.  
“别再诱惑我了，明日香”他说道。

"So you think I'm tempting you now?" she asked innocently.  
“那你觉得我现在是在诱惑你吗？”她天真地问道。

"Well then, what _are_ you doing?" Shinji retorted.  
“那么，你在做什么？”慎二反驳道。

"I don't know what you're talking about, but then again, my natural charms usually tempt many men" she said smugly, flinging her hair back.  
“我不知道你在说什么，不过话又说回来，我天生的魅力通常会吸引很多男人。”她得意地说，把头发甩到脑后。

A naughty grin made its way onto Shinji's face. _'Two can play at this game'_  
真嗣的脸上露出顽皮的笑容。 “这个游戏可以两个人玩”

"Oops" Shinji let out, dropping his towel to the floor right in front of the redhead, much to her embarrassment.  
“哎呀”真嗣大叫一声，把毛巾掉到了红发女郎面前的地板上，这让她很尴尬。

Asuka turned away quickly, her face as red as a tomato. "Dammit you dickhead, I did not want to see that!"  
明日香迅速转过头去，脸红得像西红柿。 “该死的白痴，我不想看到这样的事情！”

"I don't know what you're talking about, my towel accidentally fell" he replied innocently.  
“我不知道你在说什么，我的毛巾不小心掉下来了。”他天真地回答道。

"I don't care, just put it back on!" she demanded, her face still averted.  
“我不管，你快把它装回去吧！”她问道，脸仍然别开。

The male eva pilot wrapped the towel around his waist again. "Ok, it's done"  
男EVA飞行员再次将毛巾缠在腰上。 “好的，完成了”

The redhead turned to look at him again, scowling. "Anyway, I wanted to do something together before we go back to school tomorrow" she proposed.  
红发再次转头看向他，眉头皱起。 “无论如何，我想在明天回学校之前一起做点什么，”她提议道。

"Are you asking me out on a date?" the boy asked.  
“你约我出去约会吗？”男孩问道。

"No you numbskull. We happen to be fucking engaged, to my misfortune, and I want to make use of my fiancé" the girl shot back.  
“不，你这个笨蛋。我们碰巧订婚了，这真是不幸，我想利用我的未婚夫”女孩反驳道。

Shinji chuckled a little, "And what do you suggest my lovely princess?"  
真嗣轻笑一声，“那我可爱的公主有什么建议吗？”

"If I hear anymore corny rubbish from you, you'll get a fist in the face. I was thinking something nice and simple like maybe a walk, we don't really have time to do anything else anyway" Asuka suggested.  
“如果我再听到你说些老生常谈的废话，你就会挨打。我在想一些美好而简单的事情，比如散步，反正我们真的没有时间做任何其他事情。”明日香建议道。

"I would suggest you change then Asuka, some of the fake blood has gone onto your shirt" Shinji advised.  
“我建议你把明日香换掉，一些假血已经沾到了你的衬衫上”真嗣建议道。

The girl looked down to see her shirt had a few red smears here and there from the passionate exchange when they arrived. Asuka took off her shirt and threw it at Shinji, leaving her chest covered only by her bra. "Take that to the laundry boy, I'll go to my room to find a new shirt" she ordered, walking off.  
女孩低头一看，发现自己的衬衫上到处都是因为他们到达时的激烈交锋而留下的红色污迹。明日香脱下衬衫扔给真嗣，只用胸罩遮住胸口。 “把它交给洗衣工，我去我的房间找一件新衬衫”她命令道，走开了。

The redhead had taken off her shirt in front of him and Shinji couldn't resist anymore. The boy dropped the shirt on the floor and snuck up behind her, his hands ready.  
红发女郎当着他的面脱掉了衬衫，真嗣再也无法抗拒了。男孩把衬衫扔在地板上，偷偷溜到她身后，双手做好了准备。

"Don't even think about it" she warned, turning around just as he moved. Shinji tried to stop himself, but lost balance and fell over onto Asuka.  
“想都别想。”她警告道，在他移动时她转过身来。真嗣试图阻止自己，但失去平衡，摔倒在明日香身上。

They both fell to the floor with a thud, but luckily Shinji had stopped his fall with his hands. Asuka looked up into Shinji's face with annoyance. "Get off me you klutz or I'll mmph" she started, interrupted as Shinji closed the distance between their lips.  
两人都重重地摔倒在地，幸好真嗣用手阻止了他的倒下。明日香不满地抬头看着真嗣的脸。 “你这个笨蛋，给我滚开，不然我就哼哼。”她开口说道，被真嗣拉近了他们嘴唇之间的距离打断了。

With Shinji on top, she had no escape as he kissed her. The redhead reached up to his ear and pinched it hard.  
真嗣在上面，当他亲吻她时，她无处可逃。红发伸手到他的耳朵边，用力捏了一下。

"Oww, there's no need to do that" Shinji exclaimed.  
“哇哦，没必要这么做。”真嗣惊呼​​道。

"Well I ask you to get off and you smooch me. I thought you misheard me and was just making sure your ear was working right" she replied, smirking.  
“好吧，我请你下车，然后你吻了我。我以为你听错了，只是想确保你的耳朵正常工作。”她笑着回答。

Shinji got off her, allowing the girl to get up. Looking around her room, he noticed it was still as messy as always. They both stood up and Asuka moved towards her wardrobe to find a new shirt. Shinji went up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He began to nuzzle her neck as she looked through the wardrobe.  
真嗣从她身上下来，让女孩站起来。环视了一下她的房间，发现还是一如既往的凌乱。他们都站了起来，明日香走向衣柜寻找一件新衬衫。真嗣走到她身后，伸手搂住她的腰。当她翻看衣柜时，他开始用鼻子蹭她的脖子。

"You just can't resist, can you?" she asked, irritated.  
“你就是无法抗拒，不是吗？”她恼怒地问道。

"Well, you only are the most beautiful girl in all of Tokyo-3" he complimented.  
“好吧，你是第三东京最美丽的女孩”他称赞道。

"Damn straight! But you need to dress up as well, so shoo!" she snapped, prying his arms off her.  
“该死的正经！但你也需要打扮一下，所以快点！”她厉声说道，把他的手臂从她身上撬开。

"But-" he started. “但是——”他开口说道。

"Go!" she interrupted, kicking him out the door.  
“去！”她打断了他，把他踢出了门。

The boy turned around only to be met with a closed door and decided he better just dress up. He knew Asuka was enjoying his affection, regardless of how much she resisted him. Nevertheless, he didn't mind taking a walk with her at the moment. It would be night in a few hours and so it would be nice and cool. The male eva pilot noticed Asuka's shirt on the floor and picked it up. He went to the laundry and placed her shirt into the pile of dirty clothes.  
男孩转过身来，却看到一扇关着的门，他决定最好还是穿好衣服。他知道明日香正在享受他的爱，不管她多么抗拒他。不过，他此刻并不介意和她一起散步。几个小时后就会是夜晚，所以天气会很凉爽。男EVA飞行员注意到明日香的衬衫在地板上并捡了起来。他去了洗衣店，把她的衬衫放进了一堆脏衣服里。

Shinji then returned to his room and changed into the new clothes he had left on his bed. After changing, he left his room only to find Asuka waiting outside his room for him. She had put on a dark red shirt and was currently playing with her hair. At the sound of his door opening, the girl looked up at him with a smirk.  
真嗣回到自己的房间，换上了放在床上的新衣服。换好衣服后，他出了房间，却发现明日香正在房间外等他。她穿上了深红色的衬衫，正在玩弄自己的头发。听到开门的声音，女孩抬起头，微笑地看着他。

"It's your lucky day today Shinji, I'm going to let you hold my hand while we walk" she declared smugly.  
“今天是你的幸运日，真嗣，我要让你牵着我的手走路，”她得意地宣称。

"Thanks for the permission" he replied sarcastically.  
“谢谢你的许可”他讽刺地回答。

Asuka smiled at him, not her usual forced expression of joy, but rather a heartfelt and sincere manifestation of the true feelings within her heart. Shinji had always thought Asuka was beautiful, but she was absolutely gorgeous when she was truly smiling. He loved how her red hair clung about her face and he loved the way her stunning blue eyes seemed brighter when she was addressing him. The boy must have been staring at her for a while, because she smacked him on the head, startling him a little.  
明日香对他微笑，不是平时强颜欢喜的表情，而是发自内心、真挚流露的内心真情。真嗣一直认为明日香很漂亮，但当她真正微笑的时候，她绝对是美丽的。他喜欢她的红发贴在脸上，也喜欢她对他说话时那双迷人的蓝眼睛显得更加明亮。男孩肯定盯着她看了一会儿，因为她拍了拍他的头，把他吓了一跳。

"We don't have time for you to just stand and stare, let's go already" she remarked impatiently, grabbing his hand.  
“我们没时间让你站着看，我们走吧。”她不耐烦地说道，抓住了他的手。

The two eva pilots went through the front door and closed it behind them. The redhead then turned to face Shinji, a devious grin on her face.  
两名逃亡飞行员穿过前门，关上身后的门。红发女郎转过身来面对真嗣，脸上露出狡猾的笑容。

"Let's have a race, shall we?" she proposed.  
“我们来一场比赛吧，好吗？”她提议道。

"A race?" Shinji asked, confused.  
“一场比赛？”慎二疑惑地问道。

"Yeah, whoever can make it down the stairs first wins. How about it?" she explained.  
“是啊，谁先下楼梯就赢了，怎么样？”她解释道。

"Sure" he replied, he couldn't see an issue with a simple race.  
“当然，”他回答道，他看不出简单的比赛有什么问题。

"But if you lose you have to sing 'I'm Asuka's bitch' at the front of our school in your underwear" the redhead elaborated.  
“但是如果你输了，你就必须穿着内衣在我们学校门口唱‘我是明日香的婊子’，”红发女郎解释道。

"That's ridiculous!" Shinji retorted, no longer wanting to participate with such stakes.  
“这是荒谬的！”真嗣反驳道，不想再以这样的赌注参与了。

"Hang on a moment. You get to sleep with me if _I_ lose, so how about it?" the girl offered.  
“等一下，我输了你就陪我睡，怎么样？”女孩提议道。

"Deal!" Shinji agreed instantly.  
“交易！”慎二立刻答应了。

Asuka smiled triumphantly and turned towards the stairs. "Ready, Set, Go!" Asuka shouted and the two teens ran down the stairs, both wanting to win.  
明日香得意地笑了笑，转身朝楼梯走去。 “预备，准备，开始！”明日香大喊一声，两个少年跑下楼梯，都想赢。

Shinji was taking three steps at a time, desperate to win. The boy felt disheartened when he saw Asuka ahead of him; he was going to lose. He urged himself onwards and jumped the remaining steps and just made it to the bottom of the stairs as Asuka did. The male eva pilot fell over from the impact while Asuka giggled at him.  
真嗣一步三步，渴望获胜。当男孩看到前面的明日香时，他感到很沮丧。他快要输了。他催促自己继续前进，跳过剩下的台阶，和明日香一样来到了楼梯底部。男EVA飞行员因撞击而摔倒，而明日香则对他咯咯地笑。

"Well looks like it's a tie" Asuka announced, disappointed.  
“看来是平局了”明日香失望地宣布。

Shinji stood up quickly, desperate to receive his prize, "No, if we tied that means we both lose. Therefore, we _both_ have to do what is required of us" he compromised.  
真嗣迅速站起来，迫切地想要获得他的奖品，“不，如果我们打平那就意味着我们都输了。因此，我们都必须做我们需要做的事情”他妥协道。

"Sounds fair" Asuka settled, a little too quickly.  
“听起来不错”明日香平静下来，有点太快了。

Shinji shrugged off her rapid agreement; anything was worth the sacrifice of being able to make love to Asuka once again.  
真嗣对她的迅速同意不屑一顾。为了能够再次与明日香做爱，任何事情都值得牺牲。

"Let's go then" Asuka commented as she exited the building, followed by Shinji.  
“那我们走吧”明日香一边退出大楼，真嗣也跟着退出。

The boy took Asuka's hand and felt elated as she entwined her fingers with his; her hand felt soft and warm. The sun was beginning to set and a cool breeze blew about them, blowing the redhead's hair about her. The couple made their way to the park, just enjoying the other's presence. Asuka motioned to sit down on a bench, but Shinji shook his head remembering whom he had sat there with previously.  
男孩握住明日香的手，当她与他的手指缠绕在一起时，他感到很高兴。她的手感觉柔软又温暖。太阳开始落山，一阵凉爽的微风吹过他们，吹动了红发女郎的头发。这对夫妇前往公园，只是享受对方的存在。明日香示意自己在长凳上坐下，但真嗣想起自己之前和谁坐在一起，摇了摇头。

"Look just before she died, Aria and I sat down there. It's not that I loved her but… she was a friend and I still feel guilty about killing her. I… err, can we just sit somewhere else?" Shinji said gloomily.  
“看看她死前，我和阿丽亚坐在那里。这并不是说我爱她，而是……她是我的朋友，我仍然对杀了她感到内疚。我……呃，我们可以坐在其他地方吗？”慎二阴沉地说道。

The redhead knew Shinji must still be hurting inside from that incident and she herself didn't want to be reminded of how much she had urged Shinji on to take her life. Besides, if it wasn't for her, they wouldn't be together. Without saying a word, Asuka pulled Shinji away to the other side of the park. They soon found another bench and the two sat down next to each other. Asuka laid her head on Shinji's shoulder as the two looked up at the darkening sky. As the night was getting cooler, the two teens shivered slightly and Shinji placed his arm around Asuka's waist pulling her closer.  
红发知道真嗣一定仍因那件事而内心受伤，而她自己也不想被提醒她曾多么强烈地催促真嗣结束自己的生命。更何况，如果不是她，他们也不会在一起。明日香一言不发，拉着真嗣往公园的另一边走去。很快，他们又找到了一张长凳，两人挨着坐下。明日香把头靠在真嗣的肩膀上，两人抬头看着渐渐暗下来的天空。夜色渐凉，两个少年微微颤抖，真嗣用手臂搂住明日香的腰，将她拉得更近。

"You know I went to Rei's apartment today, she told me you stayed there last night" Asuka commented, finally breaking the silence.  
“你知道我今天去了丽的公寓，她告诉我你昨晚住在那里”明日香评论道，终于打破了沉默。

"I didn't do anything" he replied immediately, panicking a little. "I just had a short conversation and slept on the couch and-" the boy continued explaining.  
“我什么也没做。”他立刻回答道，心里有些惊慌。 “我只是进行了简短的交谈，然后就睡在沙发上了——”男孩继续解释道。

"Baka! I know you're not THAT stupid to cheat on me, and I'll make you rot in hell forever if you ever do" Asuka retorted. "Why _did_ you go to Rei's place though?"  
“巴卡！我知道你不会那么愚蠢地欺骗我，如果你这样做的话，我会让你永远在地狱里腐烂。”明日香反驳道。 “那你为什么要去雷家？”

"I couldn't face you after what had happened, so I decided I would stay somewhere else. I was originally planning to go to either Kensuke's or Touji's house, but I found Rei at NERV and asked her if I could stay with her. I only think of her a sister though, you're the only one I want" Shinji answered.  
“发生了那件事之后，我无法面对你，所以我决定留在别的地方。我本来打算去健介家或东司家，但我在NERV找到了丽，问她我是否可以和她一起住。虽然我只把她当妹妹，但你是我唯一想要的。”真嗣回答道。

"Yeah, I remember the kiss you gave me to prove that already" she said, grinning. "She told me something as I left though"  
“是的，我记得你给我的吻已经证明了这一点，”她笑着说。 “我离开时她告诉了我一些事情”

"What's that?" he prompted.  
“那是什么？”他提示道。

"She said 'Pilot Sohryu, do not forget… you are the only one who can make Shinji happy.' But you know I just couldn't understand it, what do you see in me Shinji? What made you go through all this effort just for me?" she asked him.  
“她说‘飞行员素柳，别忘了……你是唯一能让真嗣开心的人。’”但你知道我就是无法理解，你在我身上看到了什么，真嗣？是什么让你为了我而付出这么多努力？”她问他。

"I've always admired your courage and determination, also you weren't like many other pretty girls. You were smart for one and you were the first one to see the real me. Everyone thought I was just a nice quiet guy, but you would badmouth me and put me down. You may be a bitch, but at least you were honest about what you were thinking and you were never afraid to express yourself. Plus, in spite of all your bad qualities, I had seen how vulnerable you could be. I knew despite how much you pushed people away, you needed someone. It was then I think I started to love you and I was sick of running away" Shinji explained.  
“我一直很佩服你的勇气和决心，而且你和很多漂亮女孩不一样。你很聪明，你是第一个看到真正的我的人。每个人都以为我只是一个安静的好男人，但是你可能会说我坏话，贬低我，但至少你对自己的想法很诚实，而且你从不害怕表达自己。另外，尽管你有很多不好的品质，我还是看到了你的脆弱。你可能是的。我知道，尽管你多么排斥别人，但你还是需要一个人，从那时起，我想我开始爱你了，我厌倦了逃跑。”真嗣解释道。

"Well Shinji you know me, I hate all that sentimental rubbish so I'll get straight to the point. You're the biggest baka ever to exist on this planet, but I don't mind. If you can manage to stick with me all this time, then you're worthy of being with me" she replied, grinning mischievously.  
“好吧，真嗣，你了解我，我讨厌所有那些伤感的垃圾，所以我会开门见山。你是这个星球上有史以来最大的笨蛋，但我不介意。如果你能坚持下去的话一直都是我，那你就值得和我在一起了。”她调皮地笑着回答道。

Shinji smiled at hearing that and moved his face close to hers. The two shared a kiss, not a strong passionate kiss, but a gentle one full of love and affection. The couple parted and Shinji stroked Asuka's magnificent red hair tenderly. The redhead then got up and took the boy's hand, leading him away from the park. The sky had gone dark and the moon was out, casting a radiant glow on the two teens. Asuka's face betrayed no emotion as she walked on, but Shinji occasionally felt the soft squeeze of her hand when his hand loosened its grip.  
真嗣闻言笑了笑，将脸凑近了她的脸。两人接吻，不是浓烈的热吻，而是充满爱意和深情的温柔。两人分开，真嗣温柔地抚摸明日香华丽的红发。红发女郎随后起身握住男孩的手，带着他离开了公园。天色已经暗了下来，月亮出来了，给两个少年洒下了灿烂的光芒。明日香面无表情地走着，但真嗣松开手时，偶尔会感觉到她的手被轻轻捏住。

The two eva pilots eventually made it up to the top of the hill overlooking Tokyo-3. They looked down, seeing all the buildings and the lights in the city. The girl turned to face Shinji, her expression a little sullen.  
两名 eva 飞行员最终登上了俯瞰东京三号的山顶。他们低头望去，看到了城里所有的建筑和灯火。少女转头看向真嗣，表情有些阴沉。

"We've protected this city and the world from the angels and now they are all gone. But now NERV is of no use and Seele will come and try to initiate Instrumentality through Third Impact. It sucks that in the end, we have to protect ourselves from each other" she commented, looking down.  
“我们已经保护了这座城市和世界免受天使的侵害，但现在他们都消失了。但是现在 NERV 没有用了，Seele 会来尝试通过第三次冲击启动工具性。这很糟糕，最后我们不得不保护我们自己免受彼此伤害”她低着头评论道。

"Asuka I know the responsibility we carry is a massive burden, but I believe together we can do this" he assured her, taking her hand.  
“明日香，我知道我们所肩负的责任是巨大的，但我相信我们可以共同做到这一点，”他握着她的手向她保证。

"There's only one thing I ask of you Shinji. In the final battle to save mankind, just don't… don't die" she implored.  
“我只要求你一件事，真嗣。在拯救人类的最后一战中，不要……不要死”她恳求道。

Shinji wrapped his arms around the redhead, embracing her warmly. He ran his hand up and down her back, soothing her. The boy then took her hand and they began their walk back to the apartment. Wanting to lift the mood a little, Asuka spoke up. "So… how did you get the idea of trying to make me jealous?"  
真嗣伸出双臂搂住红发女郎，温暖地拥抱着她。他的手在她的背上来回抚摸，安抚着她。然后男孩拉着她的手，他们开始走回公寓。为了稍微缓和一下气氛，明日香开口说道。 “那么……你是怎么想到要让我嫉妒的呢？”

"My father" Shinji answered.  
“我的父亲。”真嗣回答道。

"The Commander suggested to try to make me jealous? Well, it makes sense that he suggested _that_ method, but why would he want you to get with me?" she asked, curious.  
“指挥官提出要让我吃醋？嗯，他提出这个办法也是有道理的，但是他为什么要让你跟我在一起呢？”她好奇地问道。

"Yeah he did, it was that time he requested to speak to me alone. As for your question, perhaps the little part inside of him that is still my father decided to help me" he surmised.  
“是的，他确实这么做了，当时他要求单独和我说话。至于你的问题，也许他内心仍然是我父亲的那一小部分决定帮助我。”他猜测道。

"Well maybe when this is all over, that bastard might grow a soul" Asuka remarked.  
“好吧，也许当这一切结束后，那个混蛋可能会长出灵魂。”明日香说道。

"Maybe, I don't know. Although, I was wondering if I actually did make you jealous" he commented.  
“也许，我不知道。不过，我想知道我是否真的让你嫉妒了”他评论道。

"The main thing I was feeling was hatred towards her, I was in disbelief that I had lost to her. I felt many other feelings too and I suppose your aim to get me jealous succeeded to an extent. But I'll tell you the truth; I was scared of being with you. In my logical reasoning, all I could see was, no matter whom the person, they would eventually leave me. But you know I can't go on like that anymore and you were different from others. I've insulted you, slapped you, rejected you, hurt you, fought you, belittled you, shoved you away and even told you I hated you. Yet you still came back, you always came back, even when I thought you had died, you came back and that is why I want to be with you" she explained.  
“我最主要的感觉就是对她的仇恨，我不敢相信我输给了她。我也感受到了很多其他的感觉，我想你让我嫉妒的目的在某种程度上成功了。但我会告诉你事实；我害怕和你在一起，我所能看到的是，无论是谁，他们最终都会离开我，但你知道我不能再这样下去了，你和你不同。我侮辱过你，扇过你耳光，拒绝过你，伤害过你，贬低过你，推开过你，甚至告诉过你我恨你，但你还是回来了，你总是回来，即使我以为你是你。她死了，你回来了，这就是为什么我想和你在一起。”她解释道。

"Even if I'm a cowardly, perverted, henpecked baka?" Shinji joked.  
“就算我是个懦弱、变态、怕老婆的笨蛋？”慎二开玩笑道。

"Yeah, I can live with that" she replied, smirking.  
“是的，我可以忍受这一点，”她笑着回答。

The couple continued walking on together and soon arrived at their apartment. They walked up the stairs in silence, just happy that for once they weren't running away from each other. Arriving at their door, they unlocked it and opened it. The two teens entered their residence, noticing their guardian had not returned.  
夫妻俩继续前行，很快就到了自己的公寓。他们默默地走上楼梯，庆幸这一次他们没有互相逃离。到了门口，他们打开门锁，打开了门。两名青少年进入住所，发现监护人还没有回来。

"Gee, I wonder what punishment required Misato to stay all night at Kaji's place" Asuka said disdainfully, closing the door and locking it.  
“哎呀，不知道是什么惩罚让美里在加持家过夜。”明日香不屑地说，关上门，锁上。

"Most probably she is-" Shinji started.  
“她很可能是——”真嗣开口说道。

"Don't even go there" Asuka shot back threateningly.  
“别去那里。”明日香威胁地反击道。

Shinji instantly shut his mouth and went over to the kitchen to make supper. Noticing what he was doing, the girl sat down at the dining table waiting for the meal to be ready. The redhead watched in fascination at his ability, even with his injured hand. Though she would never admit it to the boy, she sometimes watched him as he cooked as it was one of the rare times he was truly confident. She always thought that the look of concentration he had on looked adorable. Soon, the supper was ready and Shinji placed the meals on the table. Asuka eagerly began eating her food, grateful to be able to satisfy her hunger. The girl finished her meal quickly and soon began to watch Shinji as he finished his meal.  
真嗣立刻闭嘴，去厨房做晚饭了。看到他的动作，女孩就在餐桌前坐下来等待饭菜上桌。红发人着迷地看着他的能力，即使他的手受伤了。尽管她永远不会向男孩承认这一点，但她有时会看着他做饭，因为这是他难得真正自信的时候之一。她总觉得他专注的样子很可爱。很快，晚饭就做好了，真嗣把饭菜端到了桌子上。明日香急切地开始吃东西，很庆幸自己能填饱肚子。少女很快就吃完了饭，很快就开始看着真嗣吃完饭。

"Why are you always so slow?" she complained.  
“你为什么总是这么慢？”她抱怨道。

"I don't have a particular German stomach that doesn't get indigestion after shoving a ton of food into it. Besides, I like to enjoy my meal" he answered.  
“我没有一个特殊的德国胃，在塞进大量食物后不会消化不良。此外，我喜欢享受我的饭菜”他回答道。

"Whatever" was all she responded with.  
她只回答了“随便”。

The boy just shook his head and continued to eat his supper. Upon finishing, he looked up at Asuka who was staring off into space.  
男孩只是摇摇头，继续吃晚饭。说完，他抬头看向凝视着太空的明日香。

"Your room or mine?" he suddenly asked.  
“你的房间还是我的房间？”他突然问道。

"Huh?" she said, breaking out of her daze.  
“嗯？”她说道，从茫然中挣脱出来。

"Your room or mine?" he repeated.  
“你的房间还是我的房间？”他重复道。

"What are you talking about?" she asked, confused.  
“你在说什么？”她困惑地问道。

"Why did you wait for me to finish?" he inquired.  
“你为什么要等我说完？”他询问道。

"You don't want me to wait for you?" she refuted, unable to understand his questioning.  
“你不想让我等你吗？”她反驳道，无法理解他的问题。

"Don't tell me you've forgotten" Shinji replied.  
“别告诉我你忘记了。”真嗣回答道。

"Forgotten what?" Asuka prompted.  
“忘记了什么？”明日香提示道。

"Your promise from the race we had" he answered.  
“你在比赛中做出的承诺”他回答道。

"Oh!" she let out, finally understanding. "Your room I guess"  
“哦！”她松了口气，终于明白了。 “我猜是你的房间”

"Well it is late, so we better get to bed now" he said eagerly.  
“好吧，现在已经很晚了，所以我们最好现在就睡觉。”他急切地说。

"Sure thing" she replied.  
“当然可以，”她回答道。

The two eva pilots got up from the table and walked towards Shinji's room. Asuka was grinning as they walked and Shinji couldn't help shake the feeling that she was up to something. They entered the boy's room and Shinji closed the door behind them. Asuka went over to Shinji's bed and got under the covers, lying down to sleep. Shinji just looked at her confused.  
两名eva飞行员从桌子上起身，朝真嗣的房间走去。明日香一边走一边咧着嘴笑，真嗣不由得摆脱了她在图谋不轨的感觉。他们走进男孩的房间，真嗣关上了身后的门。明日香走到真嗣的床边，盖上被子，躺下睡觉。真嗣只是困惑地看着她。

"What are you doing Asuka?" he asked her.  
“明日香你在做什么？”他问她。

"I'm sleeping in your bed, what does it look like?" she answered.  
“我睡在你的床上，你觉得怎么样？”她回答。

"Why don't you take your clothes off?" he continued.  
“你为什么不把衣服脱掉？”他继续。

"Why would I sleep naked with you?" she asked incredulously.  
“我为什么要和你一起裸睡？”她难以置信地问道。

"Because it's easier to have sex that way" he said bluntly.  
“因为这样更容易发生性行为，”他直言不讳地说。

"Who said anything about sex?" Asuka questioned.  
“谁说了有关性的事？”明日香问道。

"You did, you promised if you lost-" Shinji began.  
“你做到了，你答应过如果你输了——”真嗣开始说道。

"That I would sleep with you, not have sex with you, and I will" Asuka finished. "We are going to sleep in the same bed tonight; Asuka doesn't go back on her word" she said, smiling evilly.  
“我会和你一起睡觉，而不是和你做爱，我会的，”明日香说完。 “今晚我们要睡在同一张床上；明日香不会食言的。”她邪恶地笑着说道。

"But-" he started. “但是——”他开口说道。

"You don't want me to? I can leave if you want" she interrupted.  
“你不想让我这么做吗？如果你愿意的话我可以离开。”她打断道。

"No, stay" he conceded, defeated.  
“不，留下来”，他失败了，承认道。

The boy joined Asuka under the covers and wrapped his arms around her waist. The redhead felt soft and warm as he held her.  
男孩走到明日香的被子里，用双臂搂住她的腰。红发男人抱着她，感觉柔软而温暖。

"Just remember to keep up your end of the deal. Sweet dreams" she said mockingly.  
“只要记住遵守协议即可。做个好梦”她嘲笑道。

_'Oh crap'_ he thought as he remembered what he had to do tomorrow…  
“哦，糟糕”，当他想起明天要做什么时，他这样想……

End Notes: Heh, you didn't think I'd make them have sex the first night do you :P? But anyway yeah, Shinji faked his own death to get together with Asuka. You see Kaji was thought dead by Misato and only then did she realise she loved him, that's why Kaji suggested death because he's experienced the results. There was only one real giveaway as to what Kaji's plan was and that was the soap opera that Asuka watched after the discussion. A line said there was 'Do I have to die for you to realise your feelings for me?' Of course in the previous chapter, he calls Kaji first so you do suspect that something's going on as I'm sure many readers did.  
尾注：呵呵，你没想到我会让他们第一晚就做爱吧：P？但无论如何，真嗣假死是为了和明日香在一起。你看加持被美里认为死了，直到那时她才意识到自己爱他，这就是为什么加持建议死亡，因为他经历过结果。关于梶的计划只有一个真正的泄露点，那就是明日香在讨论后观看的肥皂剧。有一句台词说“我必须死才能让你意识到你对我的感情吗？”当然，在上一章中，他先给加治打电话，所以你确实怀疑发生了什么事，我相信很多读者都这么认为。

If anyone says I made Shinji live because of my readers is lying, this was always intended to happen. I know all the WAFF addicts will love this chapter. So there you go, Shinji and Asuka finally get back together.  
如果有人说我让真嗣活着是因为我的读者在撒谎，这总是有意发生的。我知道所有 WAFF 迷都会喜欢这一章。就这样，真嗣和明日香终于复合了。

Original Notes: 原注：

_Oh fina-fucking-ly got it done, phew! I've been so pissed that it's taken this long to update. I got writer's block! (THE DREADED WRITER'S BLOCK!) So I was staring at my screen for like 2 weeks straight having no idea what to write. Well actually I did know what I wanted to happen in the chapter but for some reason I just had a massive block on how to get there. PLUS I started university, so I haven't had much time to write when I finally got past the writer's block. Anyways people never be scared of me not updating I am always updating this story and promise to finish it. Unless I die the next chapter WILL come. Anyways sorry for the long wait, I hope this chapter is worth the wait (though it's probably not). This chapter is more a relief from all the drama than anything else and I tried to be humorous, so I hope you laugh but I'm sorry if you don't heh.  
噢，终于搞定了，唷！我真是气死了，这么久才更新。我遇到了写作障碍！ （可怕的作家的障碍！）所以我连续两周盯着屏幕，不知道该写什么。好吧，实际上我确实知道我想在这一章中发生什么，但由于某种原因，我对如何实现这一目标有很大的障碍。另外，我已经开始上大学了，所以当我终于克服了写作障碍时，我没有太多时间写作。无论如何，人们永远不会害怕我不更新，我总是更新这个故事并承诺完成它。除非我死，下一章就会到来。无论如何，抱歉让您久等了，我希望这一章值得等待（尽管可能不值得）。这一章比其他任何事情都更能让你从所有的戏剧中解脱出来，我试着变得幽默，所以我希望你笑，但如果你不笑，我很抱歉。_

I had also said it was my longest chapter at 14000 words, which is a lot, but easily overtaken by the rewrites now :D.  
我还说过这是我最长的一章，有 14000 字，虽然很多，但很容易被现在的重写所超越:D。

Well enjoy! As said in the original notes, this chapter is a relief from all the drama.  
好好享受吧！正如原注中所说，这一章是所有戏剧性事件的解脱。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 20 (First rewrite – though it's practically identical to the original version).  
需要注意的是，这是重写的第 20 章（第一次重写 - 尽管它实际上与原始版本相同）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读本文，那么您正在阅读该故事的最新版本。如果您在上一章没有看到此注释，那么您很不幸在我更新所有章节之前开始阅读本文。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节以及格式都会发生变化，这会在进一步阅读时造成一些混乱。**_

### Chapter 20: The Bet
"You requested to speak with me?" he asked.  
“你要求和我说话吗？”他问。

"Yeah and it's about damn time _sir_!" she replied, annoyed.  
“是的，先生，现在正是时候了！”她生气地回答。

"Your discussion was not of high priority and as I was engaged in the middle of an important meeting, your delay was of little concern to me" the Commander remarked.  
“你的讨论不是最重要的，而且我正在参加一个重要的会议，所以你的拖延对我来说并不重要”，指挥官说道。

"A meeting with Seele no doubt" she spat.  
“毫无疑问是与希儿会面，”她吐槽道。

"Major Katsuragi I do not care about your pointless speculations, why have you come here?" he asked.  
“葛城少校，我不在乎你的无谓猜测，你为什么来这里？”他问。

"Is it true that you gave Ryouji Kaji the authorisation to arrange for the third child's fraudulent death?" Misato inquired.  
“你真的授权梶亮二安排第三个孩子被骗死吗？”美里问道。

"I merely gave him permission to use whatever resources he wished. I did not give authorisation for any specifics" the Commander replied emotionlessly.  
“我只是允许他使用任何他想要使用的资源，我并没有授权任何具体细节。”指挥官面无表情地回答道。

"I am higher ranking than Mr. Ryouji, why was I not informed?" the Major demanded.  
“我的地位比良二先生高，为什么没有通知我？”少校问道。

"It was to be handled by him alone, it was unnecessary to notify you of the situation" Gendo answered.  
“这事由他一个人处理，情况没必要通知你。”源堂回答道。

Misato gritted her teeth; it wasn't worth arguing over. Besides, Asuka had finally realised her own feelings for Shinji because of the plan. Sighing, she decided to ask him about Seele's intent, after all that was originally why she came.  
美里咬紧牙关；这不值得争论。而且，明日香也因为这个计划，终于认识到了自己对真嗣的感情。叹了口气，她决定问问他希儿的来意，毕竟她本来就是为了这个而来的。

"With all the angels dead, do Seele still intend to assault NERV?" Misato asked.  
“天使都死了，希儿还想攻击NERV吗？”美里问道。

"It is without a doubt" the Commander confirmed.  
“毫无疑问”指挥官确认道。

"How long do we have?" she queried.  
“我们还有多久？”她问道。

"I am unaware of how long it will take them to mobilise, however, I can guarantee you that their attack will commence soon" he answered.  
“我不知道他们需要多长时间才能动员起来，但是我可以向你保证他们的攻击很快就会开始”他回答道。

"But without Seele's financial support, we are without means of preparing ourselves. What are we supposed to do?" Misato replied, annoyed at the Commander's calm.  
“但是如果没有元一的资金支持，我们就没有办法做好准备。我们该怎么办？”美里回答道，对指挥官的冷静感到恼火。

"All that is required of you is to ensure that the pilots arrive at their evas" he directed.  
“你们所要做的就是确保飞行员到达他们的撤离点”他指示道。

"But what about infiltration?" she asked.  
“但是渗透呢？”她问。

"Distribute firearms to every NERV Personnel in the facility" he advised.  
他建议：“向设施内的每位 NERV 人员分发枪支”。

"Pardon my rudeness, but what the hell will _you_ be doing during the attack?" she retorted.  
“请原谅我的无礼，但是在袭击期间你到底要做什么？”她反驳道。

"In the event of failure, which is most likely, I will self-destruct NERV headquarters to prevent Seele initiating Third Impact" he explained.  
“如果失败（这是最有可能的），我将自毁 NERV 总部，以防止 Seele 发起第三次冲击”他解释道。

Misato looked at him shocked, but as always, the Commander betrayed no emotion. A silence followed after as Misato couldn't think of anything else to say. Gendo leaned back into his chair.  
美里震惊地看着他，但指挥官一如既往地没有流露出任何情绪。一阵沉默，美里想不出还有什么可说的。源多靠在椅子上。

"If you have nothing else to discuss, please depart from my office and make sure you discharge Mr. Ryouji from his prison cell. Dismissed" he said impassively.  
“如果你没有其他事情要讨论，请离开我的办公室，并确保将 Ryouji 先生从牢房中释放出来。解雇”他面无表情地说。

The Major's lips curved up slightly as she remembered imprisoning the spy. Misato bowed and exited the Commander's office, feeling a slight relief. This was short-lived as a sense of foreboding enveloped her; it was only a matter of days before Seele attacked, hell it could even be a matter of hours. Misato was really worried for her two charges, they had both gone through so much and finally broken the dam between them and now they had to risk their lives again. After all that Shinji went through, she didn't think he could handle Asuka's death and who knows what Asuka would do should Shinji actually die.  
想起囚禁间谍的事，少校的嘴唇微微上扬。美里鞠了一躬，退出了指挥官办公室，心中稍稍松了口气。但这是短暂的，因为一种不祥的预感笼罩着她。希儿袭击的时间不过是几天的事，甚至可能是几个小时的事。美里真的很担心她的两个指控，他们都经历了这么多，终于冲破了他们之间的大坝，现在又要冒着生命危险了。在真嗣经历了这一切之后，她认为他无法应对明日香的死，谁知道如果真嗣真的死了，明日香会做什么。

The Major shook her head to clear her thoughts, not wanting to be depressed. She continued down the long corridor towards the elevator hoping, that whatever happened, that at least the two children got to be with each other after this. After saving the world they deserved that much. Upon arriving at the elevator, Misato entered it and pressed the floor number for the NERV holding cells. The elevator began its time-consuming descent and the Major tapped her heel impatiently. She recalled the events that had transpired after she left the two eva pilots alone at her apartment.  
少校摇了摇头，理清思绪，不想再郁闷了。她继续沿着长长的走廊朝电梯走去，希望无论发生什么，至少两个孩子在此之后能够在一起。在拯救了世界之后，他们应得的。到达电梯后，美里进入电梯，按下了 NERV 拘留室的楼层号码。电梯开始费时地下降，少校不耐烦地跺着脚跟。她回想起她把两名EVA飞行员单独留在公寓后发生的事情。

Deciding that her "beloved" darling was stupid enough to return to his apartment, she had headed over there. As the spy opened the door, she almost punched his face in, greeting her with that stupid smile of his. He then said his typical "Hello Katsuragi," infuriating her even more. But the look of shock on his face when she handcuffed him was priceless. The Major had been smiling the whole journey to the NERV cells. The best part was when she had locked him in prison and the man had finally realised it wasn't a joke.  
她认定她的“心爱”的宝贝愚蠢到回到他的公寓，所以她就去了那里。当间谍打开门时，她几乎用拳头打了他的脸，用他那愚蠢的微笑向她打招呼。然后他说了他典型的“你好葛城”，这让她更加生气了。但当她给他戴上手铐时，他脸上的震惊表情是无价的。少校在前往 NERV 牢房的整个旅程中一直面带微笑。最棒的是当她把他关进监狱时，那个男人终于意识到这不是一个笑话。


**"**_**Oi Misato. You aren't serious, are you?" Kaji asked.**_  
“喂美里。你不是认真的吧？”加治问道。

**"**_**As punishment for your insubordination I have imprisoned you, too bad you work here and I'm Major" she remarked, suppressing a grin.**_  
“作为对你不服从命令的惩罚，我监禁了你，太糟糕了，你在这里工作，而我是少校，”她抑制住笑容说道。

**"**_**Come on Katsuragi, I did it for Shinji!" he implored.**_  
“来吧，葛城，我是为了真嗣才这么做的！”他恳求道。

**"**_**Don't give me that crap. If you just did it for Shinji, why did you run off?" she asked.**_  
“别跟我说那些废话。如果你只是为了真嗣做的，那你为什么要逃跑呢？”她问。

**"**_**I was scared!" he admitted.**_  
“我被吓到了！”他承认。

**"**_**There's no reason to be scared unless you're guilty! Maybe a night in this cell will help you understand Mr. Ryouji" she retorted.**_  
“除非你有罪，否则没有理由害怕！也许在这个牢房里待一晚会帮助你了解 Ryouji 先生，”她反驳道。

_**The man looked back at her in disbelief. Misato was smiling innocently as she closed the door, plunging the prison into darkness.  
男人不可置信地回头看着她。美里微笑着，关上门，监狱陷入一片黑暗。**_


The Major had left the poor man in the cell all night. She had found the paperwork she had to do in her office much easier to do than usual, perhaps because all she kept thinking about was his face as she closed the door, followed by a snigger.  
少校把这个可怜的人留在牢房里一整夜。她发现她必须在办公室做的文书工作比平时容易得多，也许是因为她关上门时脑子里一直想着的就是他的脸，然后是一声窃笑。

_'That jerk deserved it, so what if I was abusing my authority. The Commander does it all the time, can't I have fun for once?'_ she thought, trying to silence her conscience.  
“那混蛋罪有应得，万一我滥用职权又如何。”指挥官每次都这样，我就不能玩一次吗？她想，试图压制自己的良心。

The elevator finally reached its level and the door opened. Misato stepped out and proceeded to the cell where she had left the unfortunate spy. As she arrived at his cell, she put on a blank face and opened the door. Kaji covered his eyes with his hand as the light assaulted him. The man almost smiled as he saw the familiar figure of Misato. The purple-haired woman turned to face her lover and spoke.  
电梯终于到了楼层，门打开了。美里走出去，走向她关押不幸间谍的牢房。当她到达他的牢房时，她面无表情地打开了门。当光芒袭来时，梶用手捂住了眼睛。当看到美里那熟悉的身影时，男人几乎笑了。紫发女子转身面向自己的爱人开口说道。

"The Commander requested that I release you. You're lucky this time Kaji" she announced.  
“指挥官要求我释放你。这次你很幸运，加持”她宣布道。

"But of course I'm lucky. I have the most wonderful woman in the world, I consider myself lucky everyday" he replied charmingly.  
“但我当然很幸运。我拥有世界上最好的女人，我每天都觉得自己很幸运。”他迷人地回答道。

"Shut your mouth and get your ass out of here before I change my mind" she retorted.  
“在我改变主意之前，闭上你的嘴，滚出去。”她反驳道。

"Understood Katsuragi!" he affirmed, mock saluting.  
「葛城明白了！」他肯定地说，假装敬礼。

Misato just rolled her eyes as the man got up and approached her. As his eyes finally adjusted to the light, he could clearly see the Major.  
当男人起身走近她时，美里只是翻了个白眼。当他的眼睛终于适应了光线时，他可以清楚地看到少校。

"It seems you look more beautiful than ever Katsuragi, or maybe it's the fact that I haven't seen anything at all for a whole night" he complimented playfully.  
“看来你比以前更漂亮了，葛城，或许是我一晚上什么都没看到。”他戏谑地称赞道。

"I swear I will shoot you again and I won't miss this time" she warned, annoyed.  
“我发誓我会再次向你开枪，这次我不会错过”她恼怒地警告道。

The man grabbed her and forcefully placed his lips on hers. The Major found herself kissing him back, as well as other things. The two adults parted, leaving Misato red-faced and breathless. Kaji gave her his pleasant smile before walking off.  
男人一把抓住了她，用力将自己的唇印在了她的唇上。少校发现自己也在回吻他，还有其他的事情。两个大人分开了，美里脸色通红，气喘吁吁。加治给了她一个愉快的微笑，然后走开了。

"See you Katsuragi, I really must get home. I suppose you should check up on your two kids" he remarked, waving his hand to her and disappearing out of sight.  
“再见葛城，我真的必须回家了。我想你应该检查一下你的两个孩子。”他说道，向她挥了挥手，然后消失在视线之外。

"Damn that bastard! I don't think he actually minded spending all night in jail" Misato said to herself.  
“该死的混蛋！我想他并不介意在监狱里度过一整夜。”美里自言自语道。

Sighing, the Major turned around and headed back to the elevator. Traversing the dark halls of NERV always seemed depressing. _'You know it would help lift the mood if they actually bothered to put proper lighting down here. I mean seriously, we're not rats. I think Ikari is way too much into the whole dark, ominous aura.'_ Relieved at finally reaching the elevator, the woman entered it and pressed the floor number for the car pool. The elevator doors closed and it began lumbering again to its destination.  
少校叹了口气，转身走回电梯。穿过 NERV 黑暗的大厅总是让人感到压抑。 “你知道，如果他们真的费心在这里安装适当的照明，这将有助于振奋气氛。我说真的，我们不是老鼠。我认为碇太过于陷入黑暗、不祥的氛围中。”终于到达电梯后，女子松了口气，走进电梯，按下了拼车的楼层号码。电梯门关上了，它又开始缓慢地前往目的地。

_'And what's with these ridiculously slow elevators? Is NERV's budget too small to afford better elevators? Honestly in times of emergency, this is just a nuisance'_ she thought, irritated.  
“这些慢得离谱的电梯是怎么回事？” NERV 的预算是否太少，无法购买更好的电梯？老实说，在紧急情况下，这只是一种麻烦。”她恼怒地想。

Eventually, the elevator reached its floor and Misato gladly headed over to her car in the car pool. She opened the door and sat down in the driver's seat. The car started up as she turned the ignition and she quickly made her way to the car elevator. The elevator took her car up to the surface where she drove off towards her apartment. Recalling Kaji's comment, the Major began to think about her two charges left at her residence. _'Wait a second, did I just leave two hormone-filled teenagers who love each other all alone in my apartment? Damn, all I could think about was kicking Kaji's ass. Even though Asuka was going to punish him, I know that Asuka has desires and what she wants she usually gets, especially that in this case Shinji would desire it as well'_  
最终，电梯到达了楼层，美里高兴地走向停车场里她的车。她打开车门，坐到了驾驶座上。她打开点火开关，汽车启动了，她快步朝汽车电梯走去。电梯将她的车带到地面，然后她开往自己的公寓。回想起梶的评论，少校开始思考她留在住所的两项指控。 “等一下，我是不是把两个充满荷尔蒙、彼此相爱的青少年独自留在我的公寓里？该死，我脑子里满脑子都是踢加吉的屁股。尽管明日香打算惩罚他，但我知道明日香有欲望，而且她想要的东西通常都会得到，尤其是在这种情况下，真嗣也会渴望它。

With this in mind, Misato decided to drive just a little bit faster, ready to give them a lecture. She had allowed it before, but she still had to lecture them. Besides, she hadn't actually ever caught them in action before, which was a little strange. The Major knew for _sure_ they had done it the day after Shinji returned from prison; Asuka had been such a pleasant person that day, it was so jarring. Soon, Misato had arrived at her apartment and she parked her car. The woman got out of her car and entered the building, making her way up the stairs. Upon reaching her door, she unlocked it and opened it, finding it completely silent. Misato entered her residence and closed the door behind her.  
想到这里，美里决定把车开快一点，准备教训他们一顿。她以前允许过，但她还是要教训他们。而且，她之前并没有真正看到过他们的行动，这有点奇怪。真嗣从监狱回来的第二天，少校就确信他们已经干了这件事。那天明日香是一个非常令人愉快的人，但它却让人感到很不舒服。很快，美里就到了她的公寓，她把车停了下来。这名女子下了车，进入大楼，走上楼梯。到了门口，她打开门锁，打开门，发现里面一片寂静。美里走进她的住处，关上了身后的门。

The two children were comfortably lying down together in a peaceful slumber. Shinji had moved one leg over the redhead and one of his hands had moved up from her waist to her chest. Despite their position, the girl did not protest, in fact it seemed she enjoyed the intimacy. However, this was probably due to the fact she had fallen asleep before Shinji had shifted his limbs and thus was completely unaware of her arrangement. Unfortunately for Shinji, Asuka was the first to wake.  
两个孩子舒服地躺在一起，睡得很安稳。真嗣把一条腿移到了红发女人身上，一只手从她的腰部移到了她的胸前。尽管他们的立场不同，女孩并没有抗议，事实上她似乎很享受这种亲密关系。不过，这大概是因为在真嗣移动肢体之前她已经睡着了，所以完全不知道自己的安排。对真嗣来说不幸的是，明日香是第一个醒来的。

The redhead slowly opened her eyes as she woke. She was momentarily confused as to why she felt warmth coming from behind her, but then remembered that she had gone to sleep with Shinji. Asuka smiled happily, the night had been peaceful and without nightmares. Furthermore, she felt a pleasant sensation across her chest. The girl yawned and tried to sit up, but found herself bound by two arms and a leg. At Asuka's movement, Shinji unconsciously fondled her breast softly. Sudden realisation hit the redhead as she understood what was causing the sensation on her chest. Before she could smack the poor boy, she heard someone enter their apartment. Knowing that it could only be Misato, a devious smile formed on her lips.  
红发少女缓缓睁开了眼睛。她一时不明白为什么背后传来温暖，但随即想起自己已经和真嗣一起睡了。明日香开心地笑了，这一夜很平静，没有做噩梦。不仅如此，她还感觉到胸口传来一股愉悦的感觉。女孩打了个哈欠，想要坐起来，却发现自己被两条胳膊和一条腿绑住了。听到明日香的动作，真嗣不自觉地轻轻抚摸着她的胸部。当红发女郎明白是什么导致了她胸口的感觉时，她突然意识到了这一点。在她打那个可怜的男孩之前，她听到有人走进了他们的公寓。知道只能是美里，她的嘴角浮现出一丝狡黠的笑容。

Asuka grabbed Shinji's hand on her chest and lightly pinched him. The boy shifted a little, waking up slightly. The redhead quickly turned her head and whispered to the boy as she heard footsteps approaching their door.  
明日香抓住真嗣放在自己胸口的手，轻轻地捏了捏他。少年身子动了动，稍微醒了过来。听到门口有脚步声，红发女郎迅速转过头，对男孩低声说道。

"Shinji… say Misato's name three times, the first soft, the next one louder and the last one shouting. Say it when you hear the door open" she directed quietly.  
“真嗣……念三遍美里的名字，第一次小声，第二次大声，最后一个大声喊叫。当你听到门打开的时候就说。”她轻声指示道。

"Why?" Shinji replied, still half asleep.  
“为什么？”真嗣半睡半醒地回答道。

"Because I said so!" she shot back slightly louder, digging her nails into his hand.  
“因为我说过！”她稍微大声地回击，指甲深深地嵌进他的手里。

"Alright, alright" he agreed.  
“好吧，好吧”他同意了。

The girl turned her head back just as the door opened and Misato took in the sight. The Major saw the two teens in bed with each other, with one of Shinji's hands resting on Asuka's breast.  
门一打开，美里看到了眼前的景象，少女就转过头来。少校看到两个青少年躺在床上，真嗣的一只手放在明日香的胸前。

"Misato" Shinji said softly.  
“美里”真嗣轻声说道。

The Major looked at the boy curiously, wondering if he was awake, but noticed his eyes were closed. _'Am I hearing things?'_ she thought. The redhead let out a moan and pressed Shinji's hand into her breast.  
少校好奇地看着男孩，想知道他是否醒了，却发现他的眼睛闭着。 “我听到了什么声音吗？”她想。红发发出一声呻吟，将真嗣的手按进了自己的胸口。

"Misato!" Shinji said louder.  
“美里！”慎二大声说道。

The older woman looked utterly confused at what was going on, especially with the redhead increasing her moans.  
年长的女人看上去对发生的事情感到完全困惑，尤其是红发女人的呻吟声越来越大。

"MISATO!" Shinji shouted, followed by a grunt caused by Asuka elbowing him in the stomach, which sounded strangely like a relieved sigh.  
“美里！”真嗣大喊一声，紧接着是明日香用肘击中他的腹部，发出一声咕哝声，听起来奇怪地像是松了一口气。

A loud thud was heard as Misato dropped to the floor as if she were made of lead. Asuka could not contain herself and burst out laughing, making her cry from mirth. Shinji finally woke up, outright confused at the redhead's actions. First, she had wanted him to say "Misato" three times, then she elbowed him and now she was in hysterics. The boy moved his leg off the redhead.  
一声巨响，美里像铅铸成的一样倒在了地上。明日香无法抑制地大笑起来，笑得她哭了。真嗣终于醒了，对红发的举动感到十分困惑。首先，她想让他说三遍“美里”，然后她用胳膊肘撞了他，现在她陷入了歇斯底里。男孩把腿从红发女郎身上移开。

"Asuka, why are you laughing?" he asked, bewildered.  
“明日香，你为什么笑？”他困惑地问道。

Asuka stopped laughing and wiped the tears from her eyes. She removed Shinji's arm and sat up, pointing at the purple-haired mass on the floor.  
明日香停止了笑，擦掉眼角的泪水。她松开真嗣的手臂，坐起身来，指着地板上的一团紫色头发。

"I made Misato think you had an orgasm over her" she declared, pissing herself once again.  
“我让美里以为你在她身上达到了高潮”她宣称，再次惹恼了自己。

"What?" Shinji replied, alarmed.  
“什么？”慎二惊慌地回答道。

"She walks in to find you fondling my breast with me moaning and you call out her name three times, it must have looked like you were having a wet dream or something" she explained, still laughing.  
“她走进来，发现你抚摸着我的胸部，我在呻吟，你喊了三遍她的名字，看起来一定像是在做梦遗什么的，”她解释道，仍然笑着。

"Asuka, how in the world are we going to explain this to Misato? I wasn't even in on this plan, that was kinda cruel" he protested.  
“明日香，我们究竟要如何向美里解释这件事？我什至没有参与这个计划，这有点残忍”他抗议道。

"She'll probably just think it was a bad dream or something, besides there wasn't enough time to explain the plan to you and you likely would have refused. Why are you complaining anyway? You got to cop a free feel" Asuka retorted.  
“她可能只是认为这是一个噩梦之类的，而且没有足够的时间向你解释这个计划，你可能会拒绝。你为什么还要抱怨呢？你必须有一种自由的感觉”明日香反驳道。

The boy just sighed, there wasn't anything he could do anyway; Misato was already lying unconscious on the floor. Shinji found that his other arm felt numb from having had its circulation cut off. He flexed it, trying to get the feeling back into his arm. Asuka flung her hair back before getting out of Shinji's bed. However, the boy would not allow her to escape so easily. He quickly moved his legs off the bed and grabbed Asuka, placing her on his lap.  
男孩只是叹了口气，反正他也无能为力。美里已经昏迷不醒地躺在地板上。真嗣发现他的另一只手臂因血液循环被切断而感到麻木。他弯曲它，试图让手臂恢复知觉。明日香把头发往后一甩，从真嗣的床上起身。然而，男孩却不会轻易让她逃脱。他迅速将腿从床上移开，抓住明日香，将她放在腿上。

"What in the world are you doing Ikari?" she asked, irritated.  
“碇你到底在做什么？”她恼怒地问道。

The boy moved his mouth down to her neck and began to plant wet kisses on her. He had both arms wrapped around the redhead's waist as he continued to kiss her neck and shoulders. He boldly moved one of his hands up the redhead's thigh. Asuka responded by closing her legs, closing off any access to the boy's hand. Shinji just chuckled and removed his hand.  
男孩把嘴移到她的脖子上，开始在她身上印上湿吻。他双臂搂住红发的腰，继续亲吻她的脖子和肩膀。他大胆地将一只手移到红发的大腿上。明日香的回应是并拢双腿，堵住了男孩的手。真嗣只是笑了笑，松开了手。

"Are you so desperate to take my virginity, third child?" she asked incredulously.  
“老三，你就这么急着想要夺走我的童贞吗？”她难以置信地问道。

"What are you talking about Asuka? You have-haven't had sex?" he said, catching himself. He had been so close to letting slip that she had lost her virginity.  
“你在说什么明日香？你还没做过爱吗？”他控制住自己说道。他差一点就失言了，以至于她失去了童贞。

"What do you take me for Shinji? I'm only fourteen, of course I haven't had sex. Are you implying I'm a slut?" Asuka rebuked.  
“你把我当什么真嗣了？我才十四岁，当然没上过床。你是在暗示我是个荡妇吗？”明日香斥责道。

"No, no. Nothing of the sort" Shinji replied quickly.  
“不，不。没有那样的事”真嗣很快回答道。

"Have YOU ever had sex Ikari?" she asked him.  
“碇，你有过性经历吗？”她问他。

"Err no" he lied. “呃，不”他撒了谎。

"Precisely, now let go of me you pervert" she ordered, elbowing him in the chest.  
“对了，现在放开我，你这个变态。”她命令道，肘击着他的胸口。

The male eva pilot released Asuka from his grasp, allowing her to stand up. The girl turned around to face the boy, placing her hands on her hips. Shinji eyed her warily as she put on a sweet smile.  
男性EVA飞行员松开了明日香的手，让她站了起来。女孩转过身面对男孩，双手叉腰。真嗣警惕地看着她，她露出了甜美的笑容。

"You better start making breakfast and our lunches, I don't want to be late to school. No more hanky panky alright? Oh… and don't forget what you have to do today" she remarked, grinning devilishly.  
“你最好开始做早餐和我们的午餐，我不想上学迟到。别再胡闹了好吗？哦……别忘了你今天要做的事情”她说道，咧嘴一笑。

The boy could not help wondering how he had fallen in love with Asuka. He took in her beautiful figure as she stood there facing him. As always, he thought there wasn't a more gorgeous creature on the planet. He loved her impish grin and wicked eyes; it was almost like she was having fun tormenting him. But when he thought about it, she probably was. Shinji looked down to her slim waist, then to her hips and then down to her legs. _'She really does have great legs'_ he thought.  
男孩不禁想知道他是如何爱上明日香的。当她站在他对面时，他看到了她美丽的身影。一如既往，他认为这个星球上没有比这更华丽的生物了。他喜欢她顽皮的笑容和邪恶的眼睛。就好像她正在以折磨他为乐。但他转念一想，她大概就是这样。真嗣低头看了看她纤细的腰肢，然后看了看她的臀部，然后低头看了看她的双腿。 “她确实有一双很棒的腿”他想。

Asuka raised her eyebrow at the boy checking her out. _'I know I'm beautiful, but seriously I'm going to smack him soon if he doesn't stop just staring at me like an idiot'_ she thought. The redhead went over to him and flicked on the forehead.  
明日香对男孩打量她的动作扬起了眉毛。 “我知道我很漂亮，但说实话，如果他不停止像个白痴一样盯着我看，我很快就会打他。”她想。红发女郎走到他身边，轻轻弹了一下他的额头。

"Just because you now have permission to look at me, doesn't mean you have to gawk me. I swear birds could come in and make a nest on your head and you wouldn't notice. Not to mention I asked you to do something, so hop to it!" she commanded.  
“你现在有权看我，并不意味着你必须盯着我看。我发誓鸟儿可以飞进来，在你头上筑巢，而你不会注意到。更不用说我要求你这么做了。”有什么东西，所以跳起来吧！”她命令道。

"Yes Asuka" he said resignedly. "Let me dress up first"  
“是的，明日香”他无奈地说。 “我先打扮一下”

The girl stood up and walked towards the door, exiting his room. Shinji then proceeded to change into his school uniform, before exiting the room himself. The boy moved over to the kitchen to make breakfast, while Asuka had gone to the bathroom to have a shower. As Shinji began preparing their morning meal, he remembered that he had left Misato unconscious in his room. Despite his concern for his guardian, he really didn't want to confront her after this morning's incident and decided he would just let her wake up by herself.  
女孩站起身来，朝门口走去，出了房间。真嗣随后换上校服，然后自己退出了房间。男孩去厨房做早餐，而明日香则去浴室洗澡。当真嗣开始准备早餐时，他想起自己把美里留在了自己的房间里，失去了知觉。尽管他很关心他的监护人，但在今天早上的事件之后，他真的不想面对她，并决定让她自己醒来。

There was another problem now though. He had almost forgotten Asuka wouldn't remember that she was no longer a virgin. Truthfully, he hadn't thought about it at all but it created a small issue. How was he to make love to her without her discovering she isn't a virgin? He very quickly dismissed the idea of getting her drunk, chances were she was more alcohol tolerant than he was. But what could he do? He doubted she wouldn't notice the lack of pain upon having intercourse. _'Great… after finally getting back together with her, I have to deal with another problem'_ he thought.  
但现在还有另一个问题。他几乎忘记了明日香不会记得她不再是处女了。说实话，他根本没想过这个问题，但这造成了一个小问题。他如何与她做爱而不让她发现她不是处女？他很快就打消了让她喝醉的想法，很可能她比他更能忍受酒精。但他能做什么呢？他怀疑她不会注意到性交时没有疼痛。 “太好了……终于和她复合之后，我必须处理另一个问题”他想。

The girl in question had finished her shower and exited the bathroom. The boy had the almost irresistible urge to look back at her, clad only in a towel, but forced himself to concentrate on making breakfast. Asuka entered her room and changed into her school uniform. She pondered how she should behave at school now that she was together, even engaged, with Shinji. The redhead didn't care what others thought of her; if she wanted to be with Shinji, she couldn't care less if others questioned it. Asuka knew that a few girls liked Shinji and announcing their relationship could have some of the female population against her. Some of the boys might get jealous too, but there was one good thing; it would stop those perverted boys asking her out.  
女孩洗完澡，走出浴室。男孩几乎无法抗拒地想回头看看只裹着毛巾的她，但他强迫自己专心做早餐。明日香走进自己的房间，换上校服。她思考既然她和真嗣在一起了，甚至订婚了，她在学校应该如何表现。红发女郎不在乎别人怎么看她；她不在乎。如果她想和真嗣在一起，她就不在乎别人的质疑。明日香知道有几个女孩喜欢真嗣，宣布她们的关系可能会引起一些女性的反对。有些男孩可能也会嫉妒，但有一件好事：这样就可以阻止那些变态男孩约她出去了。

_'I know what Hikari will say, she'll say she knew we liked each other all along and that we are so sweet together or some rubbish. The two stooges will probably say I cast an evil spell on him; bloody morons, who could resist me anyway? Well either way, after Shinji's performance today I think it'll be pretty obvious he's mine anyway'_ she thought, snickering.  
“我知道光会说什么，她会说她知道我们一直喜欢对方，我们在一起很甜蜜，或者是一些废话。这两个走狗可能会说我对他施了邪恶的咒语；该死的白痴，谁能抗拒我呢？不管怎样，在真嗣今天的表现之后，我想很明显他是我的了。”她笑着想。

The girl exited her room and proceeded to the kitchen to check on Shinji. She could see he was still at work preparing their breakfast, but it looked like he was almost finished. Asuka snuck up behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist as he had done last week. The boy was a little surprised at the contact at first, though soon found his movement restricted with the girl's arms around him. Shinji sighed, but then a small smile crept upon his face.  
少女走出房间，前往厨房查看真嗣的情况。她看得出他还在忙着准备早餐，但看起来已经快吃完了。明日香悄悄走到他身后，用双臂搂住他的腰，就像他上周所做的那样。男孩一开始对这种接触感到有点惊讶，但很快就发现他的行动因女孩的手臂而受到限制。真嗣叹了口气，但随后他的脸上浮现出一丝微笑。

"You know Asuka, you're giving me an erection" he joked.  
“你知道明日香，你让我勃起”他开玩笑说。

"WHAT?" she let out, instantly moving off of him.  
“什么？”她松了口气，立即从他身上移开。

Shinji chuckled at her reaction; he didn't think he'd be so successful in removing her. The redhead just scowled at him.  
真嗣对她的反应笑了起来。他没想到自己能如此成功地除掉她。红头发的人只是皱着眉头看着他。

"To think I believed you wanted my affection, guess I was wrong" she scoffed, walking off.  
“没想到我相信你想要我的爱，我猜我错了”她嘲笑道，走开了。

"Oh come on Asuka! I'm cooking. Breakfast is almost ready, please sit down at the table" he replied, sighing.  
“哦，来吧明日香！我正在做饭。早餐快准备好了，请坐在桌边。”他叹了口气回答道。

"No, I'm going to sit on the stove" she said sarcastically. "You don't need to tell me you baka" she finished, sitting down at the dining table.  
“不，我要坐在炉子上，”她讽刺地说。 “你不需要告诉我你是笨蛋，”她说完，坐在餐桌旁。

Shinji couldn't help grinning; Asuka was so cute sometimes. The boy soon finished making the breakfast and placed the meals down on the table. After sitting down to start eating, the redhead began wolfing down her meal as fast as she could. Shinji was still eating when Asuka had finished her meal. She looked up at him, waiting for him to finish before leaving the table.  
真嗣忍不住笑了。明日香有时候真的很可爱。很快，男孩就做好了早餐，将饭菜放在了桌子上。坐下来开始吃饭后，红发女郎开始以最快的速度狼吞虎咽。明日香吃完饭后，真嗣还在吃东西。她抬头看着他，等他说完，才离开餐桌。

"You remember yesterday when I was dancing?" she asked him.  
“你还记得昨天我跳舞的时候吗？”她问他。

"Mmm" Shinji confirmed. “嗯”真嗣确认道。

"I remembered more of the past" Asuka stated.  
“我记得更多过去的事”明日香说道。

"Really?" he prompted. “真的吗？”他提示道。

"I remember going to a school dance with you as a partner and I was wearing one of my favourite dresses, that black one" she recounted.  
“我记得和你一起参加学校舞会，我穿着我最喜欢的一件衣服，那件黑色的”她回忆道。

Shinji nodded, remembering how good she looked in that dress. The redhead looked at him questioningly as if expecting an explanation. Shinji stopped eating for the moment to address her.  
真嗣点点头，想起她穿那件衣服的样子有多好看。红发疑惑地看着他，似乎在等待他的解释。真嗣暂时停止进食，对她说话。

"Well you see, Hikari was going to the dance with Touji and she wanted you to come as well, but you needed to have a partner. Hikari suggested you bring me and so you did, I guess you wanted to show off your dress too" he detailed.  
“好吧，你看，Hikari 要去和 Touji 一起参加舞会，她想让你也来，但你需要有一个舞伴。Hikari 建议你带我来，所以你就这么做了，我猜你也想炫耀你的衣服“他详细说明。

"But I actually danced with you Shinji" the redhead remarked.  
“但我实际上和你跳舞了，真嗣”红发说道。

"There was no one else you would dance with and I was your partner after all. Besides, you didn't see any problem with it. It was only a dance, just like the one during our synchronisation training" he elaborated.  
“没有其他人可以和你一起跳舞，我毕竟是你的舞伴。而且，你也看不出有什么问题。这只是一场舞蹈，就像我们同步训练时的那样。”他解释道。

The girl looked at him suspiciously. "You know Shinji, I'm starting to think you're just a very good liar"  
女孩疑惑地看着他。 “你知道真嗣，我开始认为你只是一个非常好的骗子”

"Nonsense, how could you say that? Even ask Hikari about the dance" he retorted, hoping she wouldn't call his bluff; he mostly told the truth anyway, he just made up her justification for dancing with him.  
“胡说，你怎么能这么说？甚至向Hikari询问舞蹈的事情。”他反驳道，希望她不要揭穿他的虚张声势；无论如何，他大多说的是实话，他只是编造了她和他跳舞的理由。

"Well… you did say we became better friends, I guess I can believe it. But you know… it seems you have a perfectly innocent explanation every time. If it wasn't for your lack of hesitance, I would say you make it up on the spot" she replied.  
“嗯……你确实说我们成为了更好的朋友，我想我可以相信。但是你知道……似乎你每次都有一个完全无辜的解释。如果不是你毫不犹豫，我会说你做到了。当场”她回答道。

Shinji sweat dropped; he did make it up on the spot every time. It was only luck each time that he was able to say it as it came to mind. The boy really wanted to steer the conversation away from this topic.  
真嗣的汗水流了下来；他每次都当场补上。每次他都能想到什么就说出来，这只是运气。男孩真想把话题从这个话题上转移开。

"So Asuka… does it really hurt the first time for a woman?" he asked her.  
“那么明日香……女人的第一次真的会痛吗？”他问她。

"Very subtle Ikari" she said sarcastically. "Yes, it does hurt the first time for a woman, that's pretty common knowledge. However, how much it hurts and how long it hurts depends on the person, it's not going to be the same experience for everyone. Are you worrying about me Shinji by any chance?"  
“非常微妙的碇”她讽刺地说。 “是的，女人第一次确实会痛，这是常识。不过，痛的程度、痛的时间是因人而异的，每个人的经历都不一样，你是在担心我吗？”真嗣有可能吗？”

"Well, yeah a little" he answered.  
“嗯，是的，有一点”他回答道。

She laughed at the boy. "The Great Asuka can handle anything, what's a little momentary pain going to do?" she remarked.  
她嘲笑男孩。 “明日香大人什么都能应付，一时的小痛又算什么？”她说。

"That's good to hear!" he replied, pretending to sound relieved.  
“听起来还不错！”他假装松了口气回答道。

"It's just like you to worry about something so stupid" she commented, having already forgotten about the previous topic of discussion.  
“你就是在担心这么愚蠢的事情。”她评论道，已经忘记了之前讨论的话题。

Though after hearing what she had said, the male eva pilot suddenly got an idea of how to make her think she loses her virginity the next time; maybe things wouldn't be so bad after all. Shinji resumed eating his breakfast, while Asuka began watching him eat. The boy noticed this of course.  
不过听到她的话后，男EVA飞行员突然想到了如何让她认为自己下次失去了童贞；也许事情终究不会那么糟糕。真嗣继续吃早餐，而明日香则开始看着他吃。男孩当然注意到了这一点。

"Now who's the one staring?" he teased.  
“现在那个在盯着看的人是谁？”他取笑道。

"You should feel honoured that I'm even bothering to look at you baka. Hurry up and finish eating and make our lunches already" she rebuked.  
“你应该感到荣幸，我都懒得看你了，赶紧吃完饭，准备我们的午餐了。”她斥道。

"Hai, hai" he replied. Shinji soon finished his meal and stood up. He took his and Asuka's dishes and placed them in the sink. He then started making their bentos.  
“嘿，嘿”他回答道。真嗣很快吃完饭，站了起来。他拿起自己和明日香的盘子，把它们放进水槽里。然后他开始做便当。

"If you even so much as arrange anything in the shape of a heart or something, you are seriously going to get kicked up the ass" Asuka warned menacingly.  
“如果你把任何东西布置成心形或其他什么形状，你真的会被踢屁股”明日香威胁性地警告道。

Shinji chuckled nervously, knowing that she meant it. The boy used careful precision to make sure the lunch was presented as it usually was. He sweated profusely as he thought Asuka was breathing down his neck, watching his every move. In actual fact, she wasn't even in the kitchen anymore. The redhead had moved over to the front door and was waiting patiently for Shinji to finish preparing their lunches. When he finished, he carefully looked it over and then turned his head slowly to face Asuka only to find that she wasn't there.  
辛吉知道她是这么想的，紧张地笑了笑。男孩小心翼翼地确保午餐按平常的方式呈现。他满头大汗，他觉得明日香正注视着他的脖子，注视着他的一举一动。事实上，她根本就不在厨房里了。红发已经走到前门，耐心地等待着真嗣准备好午餐。说完，他仔细看了一遍，然后缓缓转头看向明日香，却发现她已经不在了。

"Hurry up already you baka!" was heard from the front door.  
“你巴卡快点吧！”从前门传来。

"Just finished!" he called out.  
“刚刚完成！”他喊道。

The male eva pilot took both bentos and went to his room to pack them both into his bag. He then continued on to the front door to where Asuka was waiting for him. She turned to look at him with mock anger.  
男EVA飞行员拿了两份便当，去自己的房间把它们装进包里。然后他继续走到前门，明日香在那里等他。她转过头来，假装生气地看着他。

"About time" she remarked, irritated.  
“是时候了，”她恼怒地说道。

"Sorry Asuka" he replied, scratching his head. "I've packed both lunches into my bag, we can go now"  
“对不起，明日香”他挠着头回答道。 “我已经把两份午餐都装进包里了，我们可以走了”

"And here I thought I taught you to stop saying sorry" she shot back, poking his forehead.  
“我以为我教你不要再说对不起了”她回击道，戳了戳他的额头。

The girl then grabbed his hand and pulled him out of their residence. After closing and locking the door, the two eva pilots made their way into the elevator. Asuka pressed the number for the ground floor and the elevator doors closed. As the elevator began its descent, the redhead leant back against the wall and looked off into space. Shinji locked his eyes onto Asuka, looking at her curiously. She was tapping her fingers on the elevator wall while idly playing with her hair. _'She's not in her usual rush to get to school this time'_ he thought.  
女孩随后抓住他的手，将他带出了住所。关上并锁上门后，两名逃生飞行员进入了电梯。明日香按下一楼的号码，电梯门关上了。当电梯开始下降时，红发女郎靠在墙上，望向太空。真嗣的目光锁定了明日香，好奇地看着她。她一边用手指敲着电梯的墙壁，一边懒洋洋地玩弄着自己的头发。 “这次她不像往常那样急着去学校，”他想。

As the elevator reached the ground floor, the doors opened causing Asuka to shift her gaze towards the opening. She momentarily glanced at the male eva pilot before exiting the elevator. Shinji soon followed suit, noticing how the sun reflected off of the girl's hair when she stepped out of the building. As always, the redhead looked as radiant as ever, even more so now that she had just taken a shower. Asuka began walking towards the school and Shinji walked alongside her, taking her hand. He was grateful that today she only wanted to walk; he wasn't really in the mood for jumping over cars and such. Besides, he got to enjoy her company more.  
当电梯到达一楼时，门打开了，明日香将目光转向了门口。在退出电梯之前，她瞥了一眼男性逃生飞行员。真嗣很快也跟着做了，注意到当女孩走出大楼时阳光从她的头发上反射出来。红发女郎一如既往地容光焕发，尤其是刚洗完澡后，显得更加容光焕发。明日香开始朝学校走去，真嗣拉着她的手并肩走着。他庆幸她今天只想走路；他实在没心情跳过汽车之类的。此外，他更享受她的陪伴。

"So, what's going to happen at school?" Shinji asked her randomly.  
“那么，学校里会发生什么事情呢？”真嗣随意地问她。

The redhead couldn't help smirking. "You're going to get out to the front of school and sing-"  
红发忍不住笑了。 “你要到学校前面去唱歌——”

"No, not that Asuka" he said, interrupting her. "How are we going to behave at school?"  
“不，不是那个明日香，”他打断了她的话。 “我们在学校要怎样表现？”

"However we want to, I couldn't care less what others think. But that doesn't mean that you have to get carried away either mind you" she answered.  
“无论我们想怎么做，我都不在乎别人怎么想。但这并不意味着你必须得意忘形，”她回答道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes at her comment. Although the boy was very happy to hear her response, it was the complete opposite of their last relationship where she was insisting to keep it a secret; he was appreciating more and more forming a relationship properly this time, well properly for Asuka anyway, you didn't usually have to fake your death after all. As they walked, there were very few people about the city and their journey towards school was unhindered by crowds and people. The two teens supposed that after all the angel attacks the city had suffered, the damage the city had received and the lack of a public transport system, many people had decided to leave. Perhaps it was for the better after all, with the imminent attack from Seele maybe all of the civilians should be evacuated from the city. Perhaps the government was trying to prevent panic by not announcing the attack.  
真嗣对她的评论只是翻了个白眼。虽然男孩很高兴听到她的回答，但这和他们上一次恋爱时她坚持保守秘密完全相反；他越来越欣赏这次正确地建立关系，无论如何，对明日香来说是正确的，毕竟你通常不需要假死。他们走着走着，城里人很少，上学的路上也没有人群和人群的阻碍。这两个青少年推测，在这座城市遭受了所有的天使袭击、城市遭受的破坏以及公共交通系统的缺乏之后，许多人决定离开。也许这毕竟是为了更好，随着希勒即将发动的袭击，也许所有的平民都应该从这座城市撤离。也许政府试图通过不宣布袭击事件来防止恐慌。

The two eva pilots had no trouble when crossing the roads as there were very few motor cars about, in fact more people seemed to be riding bicycles instead. Soon, the couple had reached the front gates of the school. Despite their leisurely pace, the two had still arrived early at school. Taking into consideration that their walk was almost completely unhindered, it wasn't that much of a surprise. The two had completely forgotten that they were holding hands and were totally oblivious to the stares and glances they were receiving. The school was also not as crowded with students as it usually was, so there wasn't any commotion caused.  
两名EVA飞行员过马路时没有遇到任何麻烦，因为周围的汽车很少，事实上更多的人似乎是骑自行车的。很快，夫妻俩就到了学校门口。尽管步伐不紧不慢，两人还是早早到了学校。考虑到他们的行走几乎完全不受阻碍，这并不奇怪。两人完全忘记了自己是牵着手的，也完全没有注意到对方的目光和目光。学校里也没有平时那么拥挤，所以并没有引起什么骚动。

The two teens soon made it to their classroom and Asuka let go of Shinji's hand to walk through the doorway. Shinji followed Asuka through and both were surprised to see very few students in class; Hikari, Touji and Kensuke were in the classroom though. Upon noticing the arrival of the two eva pilots, all three walked over to them.  
两个青少年很快就到了教室，明日香放开了真嗣的手，走进了门口。真嗣跟着明日香走过，两人都惊讶地发现课堂上的学生很少。光、东次和健介都在教室里。当注意到两名EVA飞行员到来后，三人都向他们走去。

"What was the angel like?" Kensuke asked immediately.  
“天使是什么样的？”健介立即问道。

"Hey man relax" Touji said, telling Kensuke off. "Is that really the first thing you should say to them?"  
“嘿，放松点，”东治对健介说道。 “这真的是你应该对他们说的第一句话吗？”

"But I never saw the angel, it must have been inside NERV or something!" Kensuke replied.  
“但我从来没有见过天使，它一定是在NERV里面什么的！”健介回答道。

"Are you two alright?" Hikari asked, concerned.  
“你们两个还好吗？”光关切地问道。

"Yeah" the eva pilots both answered.  
“是的”，EVA 飞行员都回答道。

"So Shinji, tell me about the angel" Kensuke continued eagerly.  
“那么，真嗣，告诉我关于天使的事情吧。”健介急切地继续说道。

"I'd rather not" Shinji replied.  
“我宁愿不。”真嗣回答道。

"But-" he started. “但是——”他开口说道。

"Stop bothering him you stooge" Asuka snapped, interrupting him.  
“别再打扰他了，你这个走狗。”明日香厉声打断他。

"Look man, Asuka's right this time. Can't you see how down he looks when you mention the angel?" Touji remarked.  
“听着，伙计，这次明日香是对的。你没看到当你提到天使时他看起来有多沮丧吗？”东二说道。

At this, Kensuke just stayed silent.  
对此，健介只是沉默不语。

"Moving on, where's Aria? She usually comes early, but she ain't here. She's your girlfriend Shinji, you have any idea?" Touji asked.  
“说吧，Aria在哪儿？她通常来得很早，但她不在这里。她是你的女朋友真嗣，你知道吗？”东二问道。

A pained expression crossed Shinji's face and Asuka decided she would tell them. The redhead knew the boy was still hurting over her death.  
真嗣脸上闪过痛苦的表情，明日香决定告诉他们。红发女郎知道男孩仍在为她的死而痛苦。

"Well, you see Aria was-" Asuka started.  
“好吧，你看阿丽亚是——”明日香开口说道。

"-very upset when I broke up with her. She left Japan, so I suppose I'll never see her again" Shinji interrupted; he didn't want her to be remembered as an angel, but as a person.  
“——当我和她分手时，我非常难过。她离开了日本，所以我想我再也见不到她了。”真嗣打断道；他不想让她被人们记住是一个天使，而是一个人。

Asuka's forehead creased slightly, but she didn't see the harm in it. At this revelation, Touji looked at Shinji surprised; HE had broken up with her?  
明日香的额头微微皱起，但她并没有看出其中有什么坏处。听到这个消息，东次惊讶地看着真嗣。他已经和她分手了？

"Why in the world would you break up with Aria?" Touji asked, completely puzzled.  
“你到底为什么要和阿丽亚分手？”东二完全不解地问道。

Shinji paused for a moment, pondering how to announce their relationship.  
真嗣停顿了一下，思考着如何宣布他们的关系。

"Asuka, why have you got a ring on your finger? Are you engaged?" Hikari asked, noticing the ring on Asuka's finger.  
“明日香，你手指上为什么戴着戒指？你订婚了吗？”光注意到明日香手指上的戒指，问道。

"Yes I am" Asuka admitted.  
“是的，我是”明日香承认。

"The red devil's engaged?" Touji asked astounded, so many strange things were happening today. "Who in God's name could tame such a beast?"  
“红魔订婚了？”东二惊讶地问道，今天发生了这么多奇怪的事情。 “天哪，谁能驯服这样的野兽？”

"Shut up you moron!" Asuka retorted.  
“你这个白痴给我闭嘴！”明日香反驳道。

"So… who are you engaged to Asuka?" Hikari asked, unable to contain herself.  
“那么……你和明日香订婚的是谁？”光忍不住问道。

Asuka smiled impishly and turned to kiss Shinji on the lips in front of the whole class. Touji's jaw dropped as well as a few others. Time froze as everyone stared in shock at the spectacle before them. Soon after, the couple parted and blushed at the stares being given to them. Touji's mind, unable to register what had just happened, kept his whole body motionless. It wasn't until a fly flew into his open mouth and he started choking that he became unfrozen.  
明日香顽皮地笑了笑，转身在全班同学面前亲吻了真嗣的嘴唇。东治和其他几个人一样，下巴都惊掉了。时间凝固了，所有人都震惊地看着眼前的一幕。不久之后，这对夫妇分开了，并因别人的目光而脸红。东次的大脑无法记住刚刚发生的事情，整个身体一动不动。直到一只苍蝇飞进他张开的嘴里，他开始窒息，他才解冻。

"What the hell?! You broke up with Aria, so you could be with _her_?!" Touji yelled at Shinji.  
“搞什么鬼？！你和Aria分手了，你就可以和她在一起？！”东二对真嗣大喊。

Somehow Kensuke had suspected something like this. He didn't think Shinji could just give up on Asuka and go out with Aria. Touji on the other hand had a vein pulsing on his head.  
不知怎的，健介已经怀疑到了这样的事情。他不认为真嗣会放弃明日香而与亚莉亚约会。而东治的头上却有青筋在跳动。

"You betrayed us!" Touji shouted.  
“你背叛了我们！”东二喊道。

"Hey man relax" Kensuke said, repeating Touji's words.  
“嘿，放松点。”健介重复着东次的话说道。

"How can you be so calm? Shinji is going out with our enemy!" Touji shot back, hysterical.  
“你怎么能这么冷静？真嗣要跟敌人出去了！”东司歇斯底里地反击。

"Touji, stop this now!" Hikari snapped, grabbing his ear. "I for one am happy that these two finally got together"  
“东二，你别这样了！”希卡里抓住了他的耳朵，厉声说道。 “我很高兴这两个人终于在一起了”

"But Hikari" Touji began, in pain from his ear being pulled.  
“但是Hikari，”Touji开始说道，他的耳朵被拉扯着，感到很痛苦。

"Look if Shinji likes her, then that's how it is" Kensuke started. "Would you want Shinji to complain about you going out with Hikari? He's our friend before she's our enemy. Surely, we can respect his wishes"  
“看看真嗣是否喜欢她，那就是这样。”健介开始说道。 “你想让真嗣抱怨你和光出去吗？在她成为我们的敌人之前，他是我们的朋友。当然，我们可以尊重他的意愿”

Touji calmed down and Hikari released her hold. The jock looked at Shinji with disbelief. "So you're really with her Shinji? She hasn't put you under a spell?" he asked.  
东司平静下来，光松开了手。运动员不可置信地看着真嗣。 “这么说你真的和她的真嗣在一起了？她没有对你施咒？”他问。

"Yes I'm really with her. She hasn't put me under a spell" Shinji replied, chuckling.  
“是的，我真的和她在一起。她没有让我着迷。”真嗣笑着回答道。

"Jeez if anyone's under a spell, it would be me. Shinji should be thanking his lucky stars everyday he's got someone like me as a girlfriend" Asuka retorted arrogantly.  
“天哪，如果有人中了魔，那就是我了。真嗣每天都应该感谢他的幸运星，他有我这样的女朋友。”明日香傲慢地反驳道。

"No way! _You_ should be thanking _your_ lucky stars that there's someone in this world that can stand you!" Touji rebuked.  
“不可能！你应该感谢你的幸运星，这个世界上还有一个人可以忍受你！”东二斥责道。

"Don't even get me started on you, you stupid jock!" Asuka refuted.  
“别让我对你动手，你这个愚蠢的运动员！”明日香反驳道。

"At least I'm not an uber-bitch who goes out with the boy she insults every day!" Touji shot back.  
“至少我不是一个天天和她侮辱的男孩出去玩的超级贱人！”东二回击。

Asuka raised her fist, which was mirrored by Touji. However, both combatants found themselves unable to strike as Shinji held back his girlfriend and Hikari held back her boyfriend by the ear.  
明日香举起了拳头，东次也反应过来。然而，两名战斗人员发现自己无法攻击，因为真嗣拉住了他的女朋友，而光则抓住了她男朋友的耳朵。

"Cmon Asuka, there's no need to fight. Even you were slightly angry when Hikari went out with Touji" Shinji persuaded.  
“明日香啊，没必要吵架吧。光和东二出去的时候，连你都有点生气了。”真嗣劝道。

"Oh fine" Asuka conceded, stepping back.  
“哦，好吧。”明日香承认道，向后退了一步。

When Touji dropped his fist, Hikari once again let go of his swollen ear. Touji then turned his face away. "Ok then Asuka, I'll accept this for now. But if you betray Shinji in _any_ way, you'll have to deal with ME"  
当东次放下拳头时，光再次放开了肿胀的耳朵。东二随即把脸别开。 “好吧，那么明日香，我现在就接受这个。但是如果你以任何方式背叛真嗣，你就必须对付我”

With that, the jock went over and sat down at his desk. Kensuke moved away and went over to Touji and Hikari looked at him a little worried.  
说完，运动员走过去，在自己的办公桌前坐下。健介走开，走到东次身边，光有些担心地看着他。

Shinji placed a hand on the class rep's shoulder. "Don't worry about it Hikari, he'll get over it" he reassured her.  
真嗣将一只手放在班代表的肩膀上。 “别担心，Hikari，他会克服的。”他向她保证。

"Thanks Shinji, you're right" Hikari replied, smiling.  
“谢谢真嗣，你说得对”光微笑着回答。

Hikari then turned to face Asuka, "I'm so happy for you Asuka! You have to tell me all the details. What have you done with him so far? Have you-" she started conversing with the redhead, her voice trailing off as the two girls moved away from Shinji.  
光然后转向明日香，“我为你明日香感到高兴！你必须告诉我所有的细节。到目前为止你对他做了什么？你有没有——”她开始与红发女郎交谈，她的声音逐渐减弱当两个女孩远离真嗣时。

The male eva pilot walked over to Kensuke and Touji, before Shinji gave Touji a pat on the back. Despite his behaviour, Touji was being a loyal friend. The jock looked up at the eva pilot, looking just about ready to explode.  
男EVA飞行员走到健介和东二身边，真嗣拍了拍东二的背。尽管他的行为如此，东治仍然是一个忠实的朋友。运动员抬头看着EVA飞行员，看上去快要爆炸了。

"I _can_ admit Asuka's more attractive than Aria. But still, Aria was so nice. I don't see the logic at all! _And_ you're ENGAGED?" Touji complained.  
“我承认明日香比阿丽亚更有魅力。但是，阿丽亚还是那么好。我根本不明白其中的逻辑！你订婚了？”东吉抱怨道。

"It's… complicated" Shinji replied.  
“这……很复杂”真嗣回答道。

"And you Kensuke, this news didn't seem like a surprise to you at all" Touji remarked.  
“而你健介，这个消息对你来说一点也不意外。”冬治说道。

"Well… if you paid attention, I think you would find it pretty obvious that Shinji has liked Asuka for a while. You know sometimes you are a dumb jock" Kensuke retorted.  
“好吧……如果你注意的话，我想你会发现很明显真嗣已经喜欢明日香有一段时间了。你知道有时候你是个愚蠢的运动员”健介反驳道。

"Shut up! At least I don't spend hours playing Dating Simulators because I can't get a real girl" Touji refuted.  
“闭嘴！至少我不会花几个小时玩约会模拟器，因为我找不到真正的女孩”Touji 反驳道。

"Kensuke, I thought you swore off those things when the cyber-girl in 'CyberWhores, The Easy Streets' said she 'just wanted to be friends,' ran the uninstall program and permanently deleted itself off of the computer" Shinji recounted.  
“健介，当‘网络妓女，轻松街道’中的网络女孩说她‘只是想成为朋友’，运行卸载程序并将其自身从计算机中永久删除时，我以为你已经发誓不再做这些事情了，”真嗣回忆道。

"Well, you see… ah just shut up" Kensuke replied, blushing.  
“好吧，你看……啊，闭嘴”健介红着脸回答道。

Touji couldn't help laughing at the military otaku.  
东次忍不住嘲笑军人宅男。

At this moment, Shinji placed his hand on Touji's shoulder and smiled at him reassuringly. "If you were scared that I would forget you guys or stop being your friend, don't worry. I'll always be your friend guys" Shinji assured.  
这时，真嗣把手搭在东次的肩膀上，对他露出安心的微笑。 “如果你害怕我会忘记你们或者不再是你们的朋友，别担心。我永远是你们的朋友。”真嗣保证道。

Touji looked up at Shinji with a tear in his eye. The jock went over and hugged the eva pilot. "God damn you're the best Shinji. Group hug!" Touji announced.  
东次抬头看着真嗣，眼里含着泪水。运动员走过去拥抱了逃亡飞行员。 “该死的，你是最棒的真嗣。集体拥抱！”东二宣布。

Shinji, Touji and Kensuke all shared a group hug. Asuka looked over at the group and just let out a sigh. Well, she supposed three idiots together would always behave like idiots. The female eva pilot turned back to Hikari.  
真嗣、东次和健介集体拥抱。明日香看了一眼一行人，只是叹了口气。好吧，她认为三个白痴在一起总是会表现得像个白痴。女EVA飞行员转向Hikari。

"The three stooges are at it again" Asuka said to Hikari.  
“三个傀儡又来了。”明日香对光说道。

"I think their friendship is a nice thing Asuka, besides boys will be boys" Hikari replied.  
“我认为他们的友谊是一件好事，明日香，而且男孩就是男孩”光回答道。

"I suppose…" the redhead responded.  
“我想……”红发女郎回答道。

"So, have you done anything with Shinji yet?" Hikari asked timidly.  
“那么，你和真嗣做过什么事情了吗？”光胆怯地问道。

"We've kissed and gotten engaged, the end" Asuka answered.  
“我们接吻并订婚了，结束了”明日香回答道。

"So, you two haven't err…?" the class rep started, trailing off, her cheeks going slightly pink.  
“这么说，你们两个没有搞错……？”班代表吃了一惊，声音逐渐减弱，脸颊微微泛红。

"No, we haven't had sexual intercourse Hikari. Why? Have you?" Asuka said bluntly.  
“不，我们没有发生过性行为，Hikari。为什么？你有吗？”明日香直言不讳地说。

"No, no! It's just that you seem so mature and I thought maybe you might have done something further than just kiss" Hikari defended, blushing harder.  
“不，不！只是你看起来太成熟了，我想也许你可能做了比接吻更进一步的事情”Hikari 辩解道，脸红得更厉害了。

"We only did get together on Sunday and in the afternoon too" the redhead explained.  
“我们只在周日和下午才聚在一起，”红发解释道。

"You've only been dating one day and you're already engaged Asuka?" Hikari asked, astonished.  
“你们才交往一天，就已经和明日香订婚了？”光惊讶地问道。

"Think of it as an insurance" Asuka remarked, smirking.  
“把它当作一种保险吧。”明日香笑着说道。

"Honestly Asuka, you should take something like marriage seriously! But you know when I think about this, I always thought you would get-" Hikari began  
“老实说，明日香，你应该认真对待婚姻这样的事情！但你知道，当我想到这一点时，我一直以为你会得到——”Hikari 开始说道

"Oh don't go saying you've always known we were for each other. I mean Shinji seems to have liked me for some time but truthfully, it was only yesterday _I_ discovered my feelings for that baka" the redhead interrupted.  
“哦，别说你一直都知道我们彼此相爱。我的意思是真嗣似乎喜欢我有一段时间了，但说实话，直到昨天我才发现我对那个笨蛋的感情。”红发打断道。

"Oh? What happened?" Hikari asked, curious.  
“哦！发生了什么？”光好奇地问道。

"Well, let's just say he proved to me that he would never leave me. For all his stupidity, it actually gave him the hope not to give up on me. In the end he's not as bad as I thought. But of course, don't tell anyone I said that" Asuka remarked.  
“好吧，这么说吧，他向我证明了他永远不会离开我。尽管他很愚蠢，但这实际上给了他不要放弃我的希望。最后他并没有我想象的那么糟糕。但是当然，不要告诉任何人我说过这样的话。”明日香说道。

"My lips are sealed" the class rep replied.  
“我的嘴唇被封住了”，班代表回答道。

Just then the bell rang, signifying the beginning of class. The progression of time had not increased the number of students in the class; it was unusually small today. Rei was absent too. The few students that were there went to their desks and Hikari said her customary "Rise! Bow! Sit!" The class began with yet again another second impact lecture from the old teacher.  
就在这时，下课铃响了，预示着上课了。时间的推移，班级里的学生人数并没有增加；今天它异常小。雷伊也缺席。那里的几个学生走到了自己的课桌前，光按照惯例说：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”课程又在老老师的第二次冲击讲座中开始了。

Since there were very few students, it was almost impossible to do anything without the teacher noticing. As such, all children in the class were forced to really pretend that they were paying attention. Shinji was finding it very difficult to even try to keep his attention on the teacher. The boy desperately tried to think of an idea to get out of the class or at least pass the time. He looked up at Touji to see him constantly glancing at Hikari, obviously wary of falling asleep in class. Shinji then looked over at Asuka, to see her staring ahead with her eyes glazed. It almost looked like she was asleep with her eyes open, but the occasional blink showed she was awake.  
由于学生很少，几乎不可能在老师不注意的情况下做任何事情。因此，班上所有的孩子都被迫假装他们正在专心听讲。真嗣发现自己很难将注意力集中在老师身上。男孩拼命地想办法离开教室，或者至少打发时间。他抬头看着东治，发现他不断地看光，显然是担心在课堂上睡着。真嗣随后看向明日香，发现她目光呆滞地盯着前方。她睁着眼睛，看上去几乎像是睡着了，但偶尔眨一下眼睛，就表明她是醒着的。

"Mr. Ikari, would you mind explaining what relation Miss Langley has to this discussion?" the teacher asked.  
“碇先生，您介意解释一下兰利小姐与这次讨论有什么关系吗？”老师问道。

Shinji blushed as all eyes in the room turned upon him. A few girls giggled at him. He noticed Asuka was smiling smugly; it was almost as if she was saying "I told you so."  
当房间里所有人的目光都转向他时，真嗣脸红了。几个女孩对着他咯咯地笑。他注意到明日香正得意地微笑着。她几乎就像是在说“我早就告诉过你了”。

"Err… there is none sir" Shinji replied.  
“呃……没有，先生”真嗣回答道。

"Good, then pay attention" the teacher requested as he continued his discussion.  
“好，那你注意了。”老师继续讨论着。

Shinji held his head in his hands. _'Damn that was embarrassing.'_ Not wanting to be caught again, the male eva pilot paid extra attention to the old teacher. _'Man, how much more boring is class without messaging other people.'_ However now that the boy was listening, he noticed that the teacher would actually teach proper things but constantly deviate off topic. It just so happened he was trying to teach Mathematics today. Shinji wondered what other vital academic information he had missed out on all this time because he always tuned the teacher out.  
真嗣双手抱住头。 “该死，这太尴尬了。”不想再次被抓，男逃逸飞行员对老老师格外关注。 “伙计，如果不给其他人发消息，上课该多无聊啊。”可是现在男孩听了，却发现老师其实会教一些正经的东西，但总是偏离主题。碰巧他今天要教数学。真嗣想知道他一直错过了什么其他重要的学术信息，因为他总是不理睬老师。

_'So that's how a derivative works. I was always having problems factorising quadratics too, wow it's really simple if someone explains it to you'_ he thought.  
“这就是衍生品的运作方式。我在二次因式分解时也总是遇到问题，哇，如果有人向你解释的话，这真的很简单。”他想。

Shinji's academic revelations were short-lived, however, as the bell rang, signalling the beginning of lunch. Slightly reluctant, but only slightly, the boy got up from his desk and began to head over to the exit. Since there were fewer students than usual, there wasn't a massive pileup of people against the doorway as there usually was. Asuka walked up to Shinji and tapped him on the shoulder. The male eva pilot grunted as an acknowledgement of her presence.  
然而，真嗣的学术启示是短暂的，随着铃声响起，标志着午餐的开始。男孩有点不情愿，但只是轻微的，从办公桌上站起来，开始朝出口走去。由于学生比平常少，所以门口并没有像往常那样挤满人。明日香走到真嗣面前，拍了拍他的肩膀。男EVA飞行员咕哝了一声，表示承认她的存在。

"Well I guess I'm not the only one who thinks you should stop staring at me" Asuka remarked smugly.  
“好吧，我想我不是唯一一个认为你不应该再盯着我看的人。”明日香得意地说。

"Like you don't enjoy the attention" he shot back.  
“就像你不喜欢受到关注一样，”他反驳道。

"Well, someone else is going to get a lot of attention soon" she replied, grinning evilly.  
“好吧，很快就会有其他人受到很多关注。”她回答道，邪恶地笑着。

Shinji groaned as he recalled he had to live up to his end of the deal. The boy turned to face his fiancé with a look of desperation. "You know Asuka, I really _really_ don't want to do this"  
当真嗣想起自己必须履行协议时，他呻吟了一声。男孩转身面对他的未婚夫，一脸绝望。 “你知道明日香，我真的真的不想这样做”

"Well, you should have thought about it before you opened your mouth" the redhead retorted.  
“好吧，你在开口之前就应该考虑一下。”红发反驳道。

"Don't you have _any_ mercy? Even more so that you're engaged to me" the boy pleaded.  
“你就没有怜悯之心吗？更何况你已经和我订婚了。”男孩恳求道。

"Doesn't make a difference to me. Besides, you're a man of your word aren't you?" she countered.  
“对我来说没有什么区别。而且，你是一个守信用的人，不是吗？”她反驳道。

"I will get you back for this Asuka, I swear to God" Shinji remarked.  
“我会为了这个明日香把你找回来，我向上帝发誓”真嗣说道。

The girl just grinned at him in response. She urged Shinji on, in case he tried to run away, as they made their way to the front of the school. The two teens emerged out the front doors and walked down the steps. Asuka turned to face Shinji.  
女孩只是对他微笑回应。当他们走向学校前面时，她催促真嗣前进，以防他试图逃跑。两个青少年从前门出来，走下台阶。明日香转身面对真嗣。

"Pants to the floor boy" she ordered.  
“男孩，把裤子放到地板上，”她命令道。

"Could you at least exempt that part?" he asked hopelessly.  
“至少可以免除那部分吗？”他绝望地问道。

"No way! Anyone can sing in front of people. That part MUST be done" she demanded.  
“不可能！任何人都可以在人们面前唱歌。这部分必须完成”她要求道。

Shinji blushed embarrassed as he unbuckled his belt and let his pants fall to the floor. Thank God there weren't many students here, it didn't seem like anyone had noticed what he was doing yet.  
真嗣尴尬地脸红了，解开皮带，裤子掉到了地板上。谢天谢地，这里的学生不多，似乎还没有人注意到他在做什么。

"Attention! Attention! I have an announcement to make!" Asuka shouted.  
“注意！注意！我有件事要宣布！”明日香喊道。

_'Oh great, go ahead and invite the whole of Tokyo-3… well I shouldn't have expected any less from Asuka'_ he thought.  
“哦，太好了，继续邀请整个第三东京……好吧，我不应该对明日香抱有任何期望”他想。

Many students turned their heads towards the redhead, wondering what was happening. Few curious glances were cast at Shinji when they noticed he had his pants down. Shinji could not look at anyone he was so embarrassed.  
不少学生纷纷扭头看向红发男子，不知道发生了什么事。当他们注意到真嗣脱下了裤子时，很少有好奇的目光投向他。真嗣不敢看任何人，他感到很尴尬。

"My friend here wants to share something with all of you. Make sure you get everyone you can here to watch, I don't think anyone wants to miss this" Asuka announced to the crowd that had gathered. She then turned to face Shinji. "Go ahead third child" she said, smiling mischievously.  
“我的朋友想和大家分享一些东西。确保让所有人都来观看，我想没有人想错过这个”明日香向聚集的人群宣布。然后她转身面对真嗣。 “来吧，老三。”她顽皮地微笑着说道。

Shinji gave her the worst glare he could muster before looking down at the ground. He opened his mouth, ready to start singing. Very quietly, he sang "I'm Asuka's bitch." Only Asuka could hear him however.  
真嗣用尽全力瞪了她一眼，然后低头看着地面。他张开嘴，准备开始唱歌。他非常安静地唱着“我是明日香的婊子”。然而只有明日香能听到他的声音。

"Louder Shinji, the crowd must be able to hear you" Asuka directed, "encouraging" him.  
“真嗣大声一点，人群一定能听到你的声音，”明日香指导道，“鼓励”他。

"I'm Asuka's bitch" he sang a little louder.  
“我是明日香的婊子”他唱得更大声了。

A few girls started giggling as they heard this. However, Asuka was not satisfied.  
几个女生听到这话，都笑了起来。然而，明日香并不满足。

"Louder boy! Hold your head up so you're not singing to the ground" Asuka ordered.  
“大声一点！孩子，抬起头，这样你就不会在地上唱歌了。”明日香命令道。

_'Oh, what the hell'_ Shinji thought.  
“哦，到底是什么？”真嗣想。

The male eva pilot lifted his head up. "I'm Asuka's bitch, yeah I'm Asuka's bitch. Man am I Asuka's bitch. Whose bitch am I? Asuka's! Oh yeah. I am the bitch of Asuka. The person I am the bitch of is Asuka. Asuka's bitch is me" he sang loudly.  
男性EVA飞行员抬起头。 “我是明日香的贱人，是的，我是明日香的贱人。我是明日香的贱人。我是谁的贱人？明日香的！哦，是的。我是明日香的贱人。我是明日香的贱人。明日香的贱人是我”他大声唱道。

Now way past the stage of embarrassment Shinji kept singing, even dancing a little. Many people in the crowd burst out laughing, a few others could not stand the embarrassing sight and walked off. Touji and Kensuke started weeping as they saw what their dear friend was forced to endure. To Shinji's surprise, a few other boys joined in, pulled their pants down and starting singing along with him. Asuka could not contain her laughter anymore. A few of the teachers at the school had come out to see what all the commotion was about and were _very_ surprised to take in the sight of several boys singing without their pants on. The boys sang in harmony and had Shinji finishing off with a very loud "I am Asuka's bitch!"  
现在，真嗣已经摆脱了尴尬的阶段，继续唱歌，甚至还跳了一点舞。人群中不少人哈哈大笑，还有几个人受不了这尴尬的场面，走开了。当东司和健介看到他们亲爱的朋友被迫忍受的一切时，他们开始哭泣。令真嗣惊讶的是，其他几个男孩也加入了进来，脱下裤子开始和他一起唱歌。明日香再也无法抑制自己的笑声。学校的几个老师出来看看发生了什么事，看到几个男孩不穿裤子唱歌，感到非常惊讶。男孩们和谐地唱着歌，最后真嗣大声喊道“我是明日香的婊子！”

The entire crowd began clapping and cheering and Shinji bowed down to the crowd, as did the other boys. A devious idea came to Shinji's head and he walked over to Asuka. She looked at him curiously before he forced his lips onto hers, kissing her in front of everyone in his underwear. The redhead tried to push him off of her, but he held her in place. _'She deserves the embarrassment after what I just had to do'_ he thought. Eventually, he parted and earned a slap from the redhead, but he thought it was definitely worth it. Two teenage boys plowed their way through to Shinji.  
整个人群开始鼓掌欢呼，真嗣向人群鞠躬，其他男孩也一样。真嗣的脑海中浮现出一个狡猾的想法，他走向明日香。她好奇地看着他，然后他将嘴唇压在她的嘴唇上，穿着内衣当着所有人的面亲吻她。红发女郎试图将他从她身上推开，但他将她固定在原地。 “在我刚刚不得不做的事情之后，她活该感到尴尬，”他想。最终，他还是分手了，还被红发打了一巴掌，但他觉得这绝对是值得的。两个十几岁的男孩艰难地走到真嗣面前。

"You know Shinji, I think you should put your pants back on" Kensuke advised.  
“你了解真嗣，我认为你应该穿上裤子。”健介建议道。

"Thanks" Shinji replied, blushing, pulling his pants back up and buckling his belt.  
“谢谢。”真嗣脸红了，拉起裤子，扣上腰带。

"What is this demon? I'm no expert, but I don't think this is what couples do to each other" Touji remarked to Asuka.  
“这是什么恶魔？我不是专家，但我不认为这是情侣之间会对彼此做的事情。”冬治对明日香说道。

"Shinji lost a bet fair and square. He agreed to the terms completely and therefore had to present this performance" she refuted nonchalantly.  
“真嗣公平地打赌输了，他完全同意了条款，所以才不得不表演这个表演。”她淡淡地反驳道。

"She isn't lying Shin-man?" Touji asked Shinji disbelievingly.  
“辛曼她没有说谎吧？”东次不可置信地向真嗣问道。

"No, she's telling the truth" Shinji answered.  
“不，她说的是实话。”真嗣回答道。

The jock eyed the female eva pilot warily, but before anything could happen, the principal of the school came up to Shinji and Asuka. The expression he had on his face suggested that the two teens were in deep trouble.  
运动员警惕地看着女EVA飞行员，但在事情发生之前，学校的校长走到了真嗣和明日香面前。他脸上的表情表明这两个青少年陷入了大麻烦。

The woman opened her eyes slowly. She found herself looking at a bedpost. Utterly confused, she attempted to get up only to find that her mouth was glued to the floor by a long line of drool. Lifting her head up, she wiped off the offending saliva from her mouth with her hand. The purple-haired woman looked around the room, puzzled momentarily, until she recognised it as Shinji's room.  
女人缓缓睁开眼睛。她发现自己正在看一根床柱。她完全困惑了，试图站起来，却发现自己的嘴被一长串口水粘在了地板上。她抬起头，用手擦掉嘴角的口水。紫发女子疑惑地环顾四周，最终认出这是真嗣的房间。

_'What am I doing on the floor, unconscious, in Shinji's room?'_ Misato thought to herself.  
“我在真嗣房间的地板上昏迷不醒地做什么？”美里心里想着。

Suddenly, a flood of memories flashed through her mind as she recalled bits and pieces of what had happened this morning. Her face turned into a scowl. _'I just know this is Asuka's fault somehow'_ she thought bitterly. As the Major stood up, she did a couple of stretches to remove the stiffness she felt from her body. After stretching, Misato exited Shinji's room wondering what time it was. She noticed that the residence was empty so she concluded school must have started already. The Major looked up at the clock and swore, which sounded more like a croak, as she saw it was in the afternoon already.  
突然，她的脑海中闪过了许多记忆，回忆起了今天早上发生的点点滴滴。她的脸变成了愁容。 “我只知道这都是明日香的错”她痛苦地想。少校站起来时，她做了几次伸展运动，以消除身体的僵硬感。伸伸懒腰后，美里走出了真嗣的房间，心里想着现在几点了。她注意到家里空无一人，所以她推断学校一定已经开始了。少校抬头看了看时钟，咒骂了一声，听起来更像是嘎嘎声，因为她发现已经是下午了。

Misato's throat felt as if she had swallowed a mouthful of sawdust. The Major went over to the kitchen, opened the fridge and took out a beer to quench her parched throat. Gulping it down in record speed, she found herself now able to form intelligible sounds. She threw the empty beer can into the trash.  
美里的喉咙感觉好像吞了一口锯末。少校走到厨房，打开冰箱，拿出一瓶啤酒来解解干渴的喉咙。她以创纪录的速度吞下它，发现自己现在能够发出可理解的声音。她把空啤酒罐扔进了垃圾桶。

"I will get you for this Asuka" she declared, raising her fist in the air.  
“我会为了这个明日香找到你的。”她宣布，举起拳头。

As if on cue, the phone rang distracting her from her thoughts. The sharp ring tone cut through the silence of the apartment as Misato went over to pick up the receiver.  
就在这时，电话铃声响起，打断了她的思绪。尖锐的铃声划破了公寓的寂静，美里走过去拿起听筒。

"Misato Katsuragi speaking" she stated.  
“我是葛城美里”，她说道。

"Greetings Miss Katsuragi. I am Tamako Yuji, principal of Tokyo-3 high school. You are the guardian of Mr. Ikari and Miss Sohryu, correct?" the principal asked.  
「葛城小姐，您好。我是东京第三高中的校长玉子雄二。您是碇先生和苍龙小姐的监护人，对吧？」校长问道。

"Hai" Misato confirmed. “有”美里确认道。

"I have called them both to my office for disrespectful behaviour at school and wished to inform you of their detainment. If you were able to come by the school to see them it would be helpful, of course, only if it doesn't cause any inconvenience" he explained.  
“我已因他们在学校的不尊重行为而将他们叫到我的办公室，并希望通知您他们被拘留的情况。当然，如果您能够来学校看望他们，那会有所帮助，前提是不会造成任何后果。”任何不便”他解释道。

"No, no it's fine. I'll come by right away" the Major accepted.  
“不，不，没关系。我马上就过去。”少校接受道。

"Thank you, goodbye Miss Katsuragi" he finished.  
“谢谢你，再见葛城小姐。”他最后说道。

"Goodbye" she replied. “再见”她回答道。

The phone hung up and Misato placed the receiver back down. To say she was utterly confused was an understatement as was shown by her facial expression. _'Disrespectful behaviour? Asuka makes sense, but Shinji too? Don't tell me they made love in school…'_ she thought shaking her head. _'Well only one way to find out'_  
电话挂断，美里放回听筒。从她的面部表情可以看出，说她完全困惑是轻描淡写的。 ‘不尊重的行为？明日香说得有道理，那么真嗣也有道理吗？别告诉我他们在学校做爱……”她摇摇头想道。 “好吧，只有一种方法可以找到答案”

The purple-haired woman moved over to the front door and opened it. After closing it behind her, she locked the door and continued on down the stairs. After exiting the building, Misato went over to her parked car and unlocked it. She entered the driver's seat and put her seatbelt on. After turning the ignition, taking off the handbrake and putting the car into gear, the Major stepped on the accelerator and began to drive off towards the school. There was much less traffic than usual, which only allowed Misato to pull off crazier stunts as she drove. Misato was very curious as to why her two charges got into trouble.  
紫发女子走到前门，打开了门。她关上门后，锁上门，继续下楼梯。出了大楼后，美里走到她停着的车旁，打开了车锁。她坐进驾驶座，系好安全带。打开点火开关，松开手刹，挂入档后，少校踩下油门，开始向学校驶去。车流比平时少了很多，这使得美里在开车时能够做出更疯狂的特技。美里很好奇她的两个手下为何会陷入困境。

---

"Your guardian is coming here to see you two" the principal announced to the two eva pilots.  
“你们的监护人要来看你们两个”校长向两名逃生飞行员宣布。

Both teens had curious expressions on their faces; Misato was actually bothering to come over for disciplinary matters. After the principal had come up to them, he had asked them both to come to his office. As the other boys who had joined the dance had run off, the staff did not know who the other perpetrators were. However, they knew the two eva pilots had started the whole commotion and so were not really interested in them anyway. Asuka fought desperately to hold in her laughter as the principal told them off for "disrespectful behaviour," "indecent exposure" and "shouting profanities," while poor Shinji was blushing madly.  
两个少年脸上都带着好奇的表情。美里其实是因为纪律问题才特意过来的。校长找到他们后，请他们俩到他的办公室来。由于其他参加舞会的男孩都逃跑了，工作人员不知道其他肇事者是谁。然而，他们知道整个骚乱是由两名逃亡飞行员引发的，所以无论如何对他们并不真正感兴趣。当校长斥责他们“不尊重行为”、“不雅暴露”和“大喊脏话”时，明日香拼命忍住笑声，而可怜的真嗣则脸红得厉害。

The two eva pilots hadn't bothered arguing with him, since half the school saw them anyway, and just nodded at everything he had said. This annoyed the principal to no end as it looked like they weren't even listening to him. The principal also mentioned how he was disappointed with Asuka; after she had shown good community service, to ruin it with this offensive display. After the lecture, the principal had decided to call Misato as it seemed to him he was having no effect on the two teens.  
两名逃生飞行员懒得与他争论，因为学校里有一半的人都看到了他们，只是对他所说的一切点了点头。这让校长很恼火，因为看起来他们根本没有在听他的话。校长还提到他对明日香感到多么失望；在她表现出良好的社区服务之后，却用这种无礼的表现毁掉了它。讲座结束后，校长决定给美里打电话，因为他觉得美里对这两个青少年没有任何影响。

The man looked down at them smiling, as if he had finally created the desired effect. The two teens decided to remain silent however, even though they were bursting to talk to each other. Shinji laid back and looked up at the ceiling. Above them, a lone fan spun slowly. It did little to relieve them of the hot temperature in the room though. The window in the office was closed, though one could still see the view of the outside play area. A few certificates and such were posted on the walls, showing the "excellence" of the principal.  
男人低头微笑地看着他们，似乎终于达到了他想要的效果。然而，这两个青少年决定保持沉默，尽管他们急于互相交谈。真嗣躺下来，抬头看着天花板。在他们的头顶上，一把孤零零的风扇在缓慢地旋转。但这并没有让他们缓解房间里的高温。办公室的窗户关着，但仍能看到外面游乐区的景色。墙上贴着几张证书之类的，可见校长的“优秀”。

The desk, which the head of the school sat at, looked quite similar to Gendo's. On the desk were some stationery, paper, a fax machine with a phone and a computer. The principal's chair was quite large and set with cushions, even on the arms. It had the ability to rotate and to roll across the floor. The three people sat and waited in silence until the Major decided to arrive. Fortunately, this didn't take long as the door to the principal's office opened, breaking the awkward silence. Misato entered through the doorway and closed the door behind her. She turned to face the principal with her typical professional expression as the principal stood up.  
校长所坐的桌子与源堂的桌子很相似。桌子上有一些文具、纸张、一台传真机、一部电话和一台电脑。校长的椅子相当大，连扶手上都设有软垫。它具有旋转和在地板上滚动的能力。三人静静地坐着，等待少校决定到来。幸好，没过多久，校长办公室的门就打开了，打破了尴尬的沉默。美里从门口进来，关上了身后的门。当校长站起来时，她以典型的职业表情转向校长。

"What seems to be the problem sir?" Misato asked.  
“先生，看来有什么问题吗？”美里问道。

"Please have a seat Miss Katsuragi" the principal offered, directing her to a seat next to the two eva pilots.  
“葛城小姐请坐。”校长示意她坐在两名EVA飞行员旁边的座位上。

The Major sat down and the principal followed suit, before he turned to face Misato.  
少校坐下，校长也跟着坐下，然后转身面向美里。

"These two children were caught in the act-" the principal started.  
“这两个孩子当场被捕——”校长开口说道。

"Of sexual intercourse?" Misato asked, interrupting him, betraying no emotion.  
“性交？”美里问道，打断了他的话，面无表情。

Both eva pilots fell off their chairs, while the principal looked at her shocked.  
两名伊娃飞行员都从椅子上摔了下来，而校长则震惊地看着她。

"No, nothing of that sort" the principal quickly replied. "Mr. Ikari was singing profanities in the middle of the courtyard out the front of the school at lunch and was wearing his school uniform incorrectly"  
“不，没有那样的事”校长很快回答道。 “午餐时，碇先生在学校前面的庭院中央唱着脏话，而且校服的穿着不正确”

"And Asuka?" Misato asked, face unchanging.  
“那明日香呢？”美里面无表情地问道。

"She was informing the whole school of the event, gathering people to watch and causing an unnecessary commotion. The girl acted as his accomplice and so is also responsible" the older man answered.  
“她正在向全校通报此事，聚集众人围观，引起不必要的骚动。女孩是他的同谋，也有责任。”老人回答道。

"Specifically, what exactly was Mr. Ikari shouting and how was his wearing of his uniform incorrect?" Misato inquired, still emotionless.  
「具体来说，碇先生到底在喊什么？他的制服穿着有什么不正确的地方吗？」美里依然面无表情地问道。

"He was not wearing his pants and I personally heard him shout out something along the lines of 'I am Asuka's bitch'," the principal replied quietly.  
“他没有穿裤子，我亲耳听到他喊出了类似‘我是明日香的婊子’之类的话，”校长平静地回答道。

Misato's eyebrow twitched momentarily. "Excuse me for a moment" the Major requested, standing up and walking out of the room. A few seconds after the door was closed, laughter could be heard in the hallway. Asuka couldn't help snickering quietly, but soon stopped with the look the principal gave her. Shinji just wanted to bury himself under the floor he was so humiliated. He had been forced to do this by Asuka and then she even made it look like he was the main perpetrator.  
美里的眉毛瞬间抽动了一下。 “对不起，”少校请求道，站起身来走出房间。门关上几秒钟后，走廊里传来笑声。明日香忍不住轻笑，但很快就被校长看她的眼神止住了。真嗣简直想把自己埋在地板下，他太羞辱了。他是被明日香强迫这么做的，而且她还让他看起来像是主犯。

Misato came back into the room with the same expressionless face as before and sat back down. "I apologise for the delay" she declared.  
美里回到房间，和之前一样面无表情，坐回座位。 “我对延误表示歉意”，她宣称。

"No problem" the principal replied.  
“没问题”校长回答道。

"I will deal with my two charges from here on, you can give them any punishment for school as you see fit. If you don't mind, I would like to take these two home for some disciplinary action" Misato requested.  
“接下来我会处理我的两项指控，你们可以按照你们认为合适的方式对他们进行学校处罚。如果你们不介意的话，我想把这两个人带回家接受一些纪律处分。”美里请求道。

"By all means" the principal said, standing up.  
“无论如何，”校长站起来说道。

The trio exited the office after bowing to the principal and closed the door behind them. Immediately, Misato and Asuka burst out laughing. Asuka was laughing so hard she was crying. Shinji just hung his head down and tuned them out, sick of the embarrassment. After the two girls had calmed down, Misato looked over at Asuka.  
三人向校长鞠了一躬后退出了办公室，并关上了门。美里和明日香立刻放声大笑。明日香笑得很厉害，她哭了。真嗣只是低着头，不理睬他们，厌倦了这种尴尬。等两个女孩平静下来后，美里看向明日香。

"Accomplice my ass. I know you're the mastermind behind this Asuka, there's no way Shinji would do that to himself" Misato said to Asuka.  
“帮我的屁股。我知道你是这个明日香的幕后黑手，真嗣不可能对自己做这种事。”美里对明日香说道。

"And if I am?" Asuka asked.  
“那如果我是呢？”明日香问道。

"You're in a whole lot of trouble. Though I am wondering how you got Shinji to do his err… performance" Misato remarked.  
“你遇到了很多麻烦。不过我想知道你是如何让真嗣做出他的错误……表演的”美里说道。

"Let's just say he lost a bet" the redhead answered.  
“就说他打赌输了吧。”红发回答道。

"You can't even lay off him when you're together?" Misato asked.  
“你们在一起的时候，你连他也放不下吗？”美里问道。

"I don't know what you mean, even just by letting him kiss me I am already treating him better" the young girl said smugly.  
“我不明白你的意思，只是让他亲我，我就已经对他好一些了。”少女得意道。

Misato just shook her head in disbelief and looked over at the sullen boy. "You wanna say anything Shinji?" she asked.  
美里只是难以置信地摇摇头，看向阴沉的男孩。 “你有什么想说的吗？”她问。

"I want to forget about this forever" he replied.  
“我想永远忘记这件事，”他回答道。

"Cheer up Shinji, I'm sure it wasn't _that_ bad. Besides, you'll have a story to tell your children" Misato consoled.  
“真嗣振作起来，我相信事情没那么糟糕。而且，你还有故事可以讲给你的孩子们。”美里安慰道。

"Children?" Asuka questioned, confused.  
“孩子们？”明日香疑惑地问道。

"You're not barren Asuka, in fact you're quite fertile" Misato explained.  
“你不是不育的明日香，事实上你很有生育能力。”美里解释道。

"I don't want to have children!" the redhead retorted.  
“我不想生孩子！”红发反驳道。

"And Shinji agrees to that?" the Major asked.  
“真嗣也同意吗？”少校问道。

"Of course! Shinji wouldn't want-" Asuka started.  
“当然！真嗣不会想要——”明日香开口说道。

"You've never discussed it with me Asuka!" Shinji interrupted, cutting her off. "As a matter of fact, I actually want to have children. Of course I know it's still early to have that discussion, but don't assume anything!" he said angrily.  
“你从来没有和我讨论过这个问题，明日香！”真嗣打断了她的话。 “事实上，我真的很想要孩子。当然我知道现在讨论还为时过早，但不要假设任何事情！”他愤怒地说。

Asuka was a little startled at his outburst and felt a little guilty. A short silence followed until Misato broke it. "By the way Asuka, don't think I forgot about this morning's incident"  
明日香被他的爆发吓了一跳，心里也有些愧疚。一阵短暂的沉默，直到美里打破了沉默。 “顺便说一句，明日香，我别以为我忘记了今天早上的事情”

"What are you talking about?" Asuka replied innocently.  
“你在说什么？”明日香无辜地回答道。

"The whole scene in the bedroom. What the hell were you two doing in bed together anyway?" Misato asked.  
“卧室里的整个场景。你们两个到底在床上做什么？”美里问道。

"Is that why you thought we had sex in school?" Asuka questioned back.  
“这就是你认为我们在学校发生性关系的原因？”明日香反问道。

"Stop evading the question Asuka and don't you dare blame Shinji, I _know_ this is your doing" Misato shot back, starting to grow annoyed.  
“别再回避明日香的问题了，你别怪真嗣，我知道这是你干的。”美里反驳道，开始变得恼火。

"I lost a bet and had to sleep with him in the same bed" Asuka stated.  
“我打赌输了，不得不和他睡在同一张床上。”明日香说道。

"I thought you said Shinji lost the bet?" Misato asked, confused.  
“我以为你说真嗣打赌输了？”美里疑惑地问道。

"We both lost" Asuka answered.  
“我们都输了”明日香回答道。

Misato was a little puzzled, but decided not to pursue it; it was obvious the two teens did not have sex last night. However, the Major was still annoyed at the morning's incident.  
美里有些疑惑，但决定不再追究；很明显，这两个青少年昨晚没有发生性行为。然而，少校仍然对早上的事情感到恼火。

"What about this morning? I clearly saw Shinji fondling your breast" Misato continued.  
“今天早上呢？我清楚地看到真嗣抚摸着你的胸部。”美里继续说道。

"Misato, it's obvious you came home drunk and collapsed on the floor. Whatever you imagined happening in the morning was just a fantasy" Asuka refuted.  
“美里，很明显你喝醉了回家，倒在了地板上。无论你想象早上发生什么，都只是幻想。”明日香反驳道。

"Then how did I know you two were both sleeping in Shinji's room?" the Major retorted.  
“那我怎么知道你们两个都睡在真嗣的房间里？”少校反驳道。

"Well perhaps your inebriation just warped your perception" the redhead suggested.  
“好吧，也许你的醉酒扭曲了你的感知，”红发建议道。

"I didn't go drinking last night anyway! Honest to God Asuka, I'm really getting sick of this. Not to mention how you're taking advantage of poor Shinji and… and…" she trailed off, noticing said person was missing.  
“反正我昨晚没去喝酒！说实话，明日香，我真的厌倦了这个。更不用说你如何利用可怜的真嗣了，而且……还有……”她的声音逐渐减弱，注意到那个人正在丢失的。

Both girls stopped and looked around and indeed noticed the boy was nowhere near them. A scowl formed on Asuka's face but inside she was actually worried about the boy, especially considering his state of mind.  
两个女孩都停下来环顾四周，确实注意到男孩离她们很远。明日香脸上浮现出愁容，但内心其实很担心这个男孩，尤其是考虑到他的精神状态。

"Look what you've done Misato, you distracted me so much I didn't notice him go" Asuka said, irritated.  
“看看你做了什么，美里，你太让我分心了，我都没注意到他走了。”明日香生气地说。

"You are so ridiculous Asuka!" Misato shouted, before sighing and calming herself. "Look, let's just go to the apartment. He probably just went on ahead"  
“明日香你真是太可笑了！”美里大喊一声，然后叹了口气，让自己平静下来。 “你看，我们去公寓吧。他可能就在前面走了”

The redhead nodded, not saying a word.  
红发点了点头，没有说话。

"You know Asuka, it's not really my place to say but, maybe you could be a fraction nicer to him. At least show him you are his" Misato advised.  
“你知道明日香，这不是我该说的，但是，也许你可以对他好一点。至少让他知道你是他的”美里建议道。

"Shut up Misato" Asuka rebuked, annoyed.  
“美里闭嘴。”明日香恼怒地斥责道。

The two girls continued on in silence to their apartment. The two females grew anxious as they approached their residence. Despite her external behaviour, the redhead was really hoping that he had just gone on ahead. Taking the stairs, the two girls rushed to their door, unlocked it and opened it. Upon opening the door, a nice aroma wafted to them from the kitchen. Asuka walked on ahead of Misato to the kitchen to see Shinji happily making dinner. The redhead couldn't help a smile forming on her face as she saw him. Their guardian went to sit down at the dining table, deciding that the two should sort things out with each other.  
两个女孩继续沉默地回到她们的公寓。快到住处的时候，两名女子变得焦急起来。尽管她表面上表现得如此，红发女郎实际上还是希望他能继续前进。两个女孩走上楼梯，冲到门口，打开门锁，打开门。打开门，厨房里就飘来一股淡淡的香味。明日香走在美里的前面，来到厨房，看到真嗣正在开心地做晚饭。红发女子看到他，脸上忍不住浮现出笑容。监护人走到餐桌前坐下，决定两人先商量一下。

The young girl snuck up behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist. The boy almost jumped from the surprise. Shinji shivered as she moved her mouth down to nuzzle his neck. She bit down softly on his shoulder and moved her hand under his shirt to tickle his stomach. The male eva pilot sighed, slightly annoyed that she was doing it while he was trying to cook. _'Trust Asuka to be willing when I'm not'_ he thought. Shinji stopped what he was doing and turned to face her.  
少女悄悄走到他身后，伸手搂住他的腰。男孩惊讶得几乎跳了起来。真嗣颤抖着，她低下头，用鼻子蹭着他的脖子。她轻轻地咬住他的肩膀，把手伸进他的衬衫下面，挠他的肚子。男EVA飞行员叹了口气，有点恼火她在他做饭的时候这么做。 “相信明日香会愿意，而我却不愿意”他想。真嗣停下手中的动作，转过身来面对她。

"Why did you go ahead without telling us you baka?" Asuka asked, irritated.  
“你为什么不告诉我们你baka就继续走下去？”明日香恼怒地问道。

"You two were so involved with your conversation and I was getting embarrassed, I decided to go ahead and make dinner" Shinji replied.  
“你们两个聊得太投入了，我有点尴尬，我决定先去做饭。”真嗣回答道。

"You retard, what are we supposed to think? Next time just say you're going on ahead honestly" the redhead huffed, turning around and walking away.  
“你这个弱智，我们该怎么想？下次就老老实实的说你先走吧。”红发哼了一声，转身就走。

"Were you serious about not wanting children?" Shinji asked.  
“你真的不想要孩子吗？”真嗣问道。

The redhead halted, but refused to turn around and look at him. "Yes, I was" she answered.  
红发停了下来，但拒绝转身看他。 “是的，我是”她回答。

"Why?" was all he asked.  
“为什么？”他只问了这一点。

"Because I don't want to be fat for nine months and then have to push a baby out of my vagina" Asuka shot back.  
“因为我不想胖九个月，然后不得不把婴儿从我的阴道里推出来”明日香反驳道。

"Come on Asuka, I'll still think you're beautiful no matter how fat you are and you aren't fat for the whole nine months anyway. Besides, wouldn't giving birth to a child be the ultimate challenge for a woman, the ultimate challenge for the Great Asuka?" Shinji countered.  
“来吧，明日香，不管你多胖，我仍然会认为你很漂亮，而且你整整九个月都不胖。再说了，生孩子不是一个女人的终极挑战吗？” ，对伟大飞鸟的终极挑战？”慎二反驳道。

Asuka smiled a little, he knew her so well. "I don't want my children to go through what we went through" she answered honestly this time.  
明日香微微一笑，他很了解她。 “我不想让我的孩子经历我们所经历的事情”，她这次诚实地回答。

Shinji placed a hand on her shoulder. "I promised that I would never leave you, our children will always have a mother and father. We know the mistakes our parents made and the ones that we made as well. We can learn to be good parents"  
真嗣把手搭在她的肩膀上。 “我答应过我永远不会离开你，我们的孩子永远有父母。我们知道父母所犯的错误，也知道我们所犯的错误。我们可以学习做个好父母。”

Asuka resisted the urge to cry. She couldn't believe how he was always able to penetrate her defences, how he always sounded so sincere.  
明日香强忍着哭泣的冲动。她不敢相信他总是能够突破她的防线，他的声音总是那么真诚。

"Ok enough with the sappy crap, I'll consider it alright?" she compromised.  
“好吧，这些废话已经够了，我考虑一下可以吗？”她妥协了。

"That's all I ask" Shinji replied happily, before returning to his cooking.  
“这就是我的要求。”真嗣高兴地回答道，然后继续做饭。

The young girl returned to the dining room and sat down at the table where Misato was still sitting. The Major looked up at the redhead questioningly. "Is he ok?" she asked.  
少女回到餐厅，在美里还​​坐的桌子旁坐下。少校抬起头，疑惑地看着红发。 “他还好吗？”她问。

The redhead just nodded. The two females then returned to silence as they sat, patiently waiting for their meal to be ready. Their wait didn't last long as Shinji soon entered the dining room and placed their meals down on the table before sitting down himself. The three then happily dug into their meals. Shinji and Asuka constantly looked up to steal a glance at the other; funnily enough the other was always looking down when the other looked up. Misato followed her charge's actions with a little amusement; it looked like a scene from a movie.  
红发只点了点头。两名女子随后又安静地坐着，耐心地等待着饭菜准备好。没等多久，真嗣很快就走进了餐厅，把饭菜放在桌子上，自己也坐下了。然后三人就开开心心地吃起了饭。真嗣和明日香不断抬头偷看对方。有趣的是，当对方抬头时，对方总是低着头。美里带着一丝有趣地注视着她负责人的举动。这看起来就像电影中的场景。

The older woman finished her meal first and stood up. She went over to the kitchen and opened the fridge to take out a beer. Looking at the clock, she noticed it was already getting late in the afternoon. Since lunch at their school started after midday and she picked them up after lunch, it wasn't much of a surprise. Misato would have to go back to NERV soon and she was quite annoyed that she had spent much of her free time unconscious on the floor. However, there wasn't anything she could do about it and she couldn't really punish either of her charges, for all she knew perhaps she was just daydreaming.  
老妇人先吃完饭，站了起来。她走到厨房，打开冰箱，拿出一瓶啤酒。她看了看时钟，发现时间已经是下午了。因为他们学校的午餐是在中午之后开始的，而且她吃完午饭后就去接他们，所以这并不奇怪。美里很快就要回到 NERV，她对自己大部分空闲时间都在地板上昏迷不醒感到非常恼火。然而，她对此无能为力，也无法真正惩罚她的任何指控，因为她知道也许她只是在做白日梦。

Returning to the dining room, Misato caught Asuka taking some of Shinji's food off his plate. Evidently, the redhead had finished before the boy and was helping herself to a portion of his meal. The male eva pilot pulled his plate away as she begun taking more than he agreed to and a scowl formed on the young girl's face.  
回到餐厅后，美里发现明日香正在从真嗣的盘子里拿走一些食物。显然，红发女郎比男孩先吃完，正在吃他的一份饭菜。当她开始拿走比他同意的更多的东西时，男性EVA飞行员拉开了他的盘子，年轻女孩的脸上露出了愁容。

"If I let you take anymore, you'll eat all of it" he remarked.  
“如果我再让你吃，你就会把它全部吃掉，”他说。

"But I'm hungry and you eat so slow" Asuka retorted.  
“可是我饿了，而你吃得这么慢。”明日香反驳道。

"Deal with it" he shot back, sticking his tongue out at her.  
“解决这个问题。”他回击道，向她伸出舌头。

The female eva pilot mumbled something under her breath and then stood up. Misato decided to stay back and see what would happen. The redhead made her way over to Shinji and sat down on his lap. The boy looked up at her curiously. Asuka smiled cheekily and leaned forward, giving him a generous view of her cleavage. Shinji couldn't help his eyes looking down at her ample bosom. The young girl took advantage of his attention change and placed more of Shinji's food onto her plate. Misato just shook her head at the sight.  
女EVA飞行员低声嘟哝了一句什么，然后站了起来。美里决定留下来看看会发生什么。红发女郎走到真嗣身边，坐在他的腿上。男孩抬起头，好奇地看着她。明日香厚颜无耻地微笑着，身体向前倾，让他看到了她的乳沟。真嗣忍不住低头看着她丰满的胸脯。少女趁着他注意力的转变，把真嗣的食物又塞到了自己的盘子里。美里见状只是摇了摇头。

Asuka then turned her head back to look down at him when Shinji looked up again. She leaned her head forward towards his, her eyes locked onto his. Then mischievously, the redhead pulled back and got off Shinji's lap, leaving the boy utterly confused. She returned to her seat and resumed her meal. The boy looked down and sighed as he noticed she had "borrowed" more of his meal. Shinji continued to eat his now very small meal and still only just managed to beat Asuka. Of course, both teens had forgotten they still had their uneaten lunches in Shinji's bag.  
当真嗣再次抬起头时，明日香转过头来俯视他。她把头向前倾向他，目光锁定了他。然后，红发女郎调皮地退开，从真嗣的腿上下来，让男孩完全困惑了。她回到座位上，继续吃饭。当男孩注意到她“借”了更多他的饭菜时，男孩低下头叹了口气。真嗣继续吃着他现在已经很少的饭菜，但仍然只是勉强击败了明日香。当然，两个青少年都忘记了真嗣的包里还有未吃的午餐。

The two teens then stood up. Instead of Shinji gathering the dishes as he usually did, he walked over to the young girl. Asuka began to move away as she wanted to toy with him. Misato soon stepped in with a devious grin on her face. _'Oh no you don't'_ she thought. Placing her foot out, the redhead tripped over the Major while she was walking backwards and instinctively grabbed onto Shinji and pulled him down with her. Misato suppressed the urge to snicker and walked off whistling innocently. Asuka scowled at Misato as she walked off.  
随后，两个少年站了起来。真嗣没有像往常那样收拾盘子，而是走到少女身边。明日香开始走开，因为她想玩弄他。美里很快就走了进来，脸上挂着狡猾的笑容。 “哦，不，你不知道，”她想。红发女郎一脚伸出，在倒退的过程中被少校绊倒，本能地抓住了真嗣，把他也拉倒了。美里强忍着想笑的冲动，天真地吹着口哨走开了。明日香对美里皱起眉头，走开。

"Hey guess what Asuka?" Shinji said, grinning.  
“嘿，猜猜明日香是什么？”慎二笑着说道。

"What?" she replied grumpily.  
“什么？”她没好气地回答。

"I'm your derivative, because I'm the tangent to your curves!" he joked.  
“我是你的导数，因为我是你曲线的切线！”他开玩笑说。

There was total silence for a moment before a loud smack resonated throughout the whole house.  
一时间鸦雀无声，随后一声巨响响彻整个屋子。

"I'll _never_ let you be the tangent to my curves _ever_ again if you say something so stupid again!" she snapped.  
“如果你再说这么蠢的话，我再也不会让你成为我曲线的切线了！”她厉声说道。

The boy smiled sheepishly as he rubbed his cheek.  
男孩揉着脸颊，不好意思地笑了笑。

"Since when did you know anything about maths?" Asuka asked harshly.  
“你从什么时候开始懂数学的？”明日香严厉地问道。

"Hey! I know a bit about maths! But yeah, I listened to the teacher today. Surprisingly, he doesn't just talk about second impact all the time" Shinji explained.  
“嘿！我懂一点数学！但是，是的，我今天听了老师的课。令人惊讶的是，他并不总是只谈论第二次撞击。”真嗣解释道。

"Who would have thought?" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“谁曾想到？”明日香讽刺地说。

It was at this moment that the Major had to return to work and so she made her way to the exit.  
此时少校要回去工作，她就往出口走去。

"I have to go to NERV now!" Misato called out. "Please behave yourselves and don't make a mess" she teased.  
“我现在得去NERV了！”美里叫道。她调侃道：“请你们注意点，别把事情弄得一团糟。”

The door closed before Asuka could shout out a retort. "Get off me already!" she yelled at the boy still on top of her, attempting to push him off.  
明日香还没来得及反驳，门就关上了。 “快从我身上下来吧！”她对仍在她身上的男孩大喊，试图把他推开。

The boy did not budge and closed the distance between their lips instead, finishing what she had started. The redhead gave in and wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him back. Shinji's tongue probed around Asuka's lips asking for entry, which was soon granted as he slipped his tongue into her mouth. The girl moaned as his tongue explored her mouth and played with her tongue. They could both taste remnants of their meal in each other's mouths.  
男孩没有动，而是拉近了两人嘴唇的距离，完成了她已经开始的事情。红发女郎屈服了，用双臂搂住他的脖子，回吻了他。真嗣的舌头探寻着明日香的嘴唇，请求进入，当他将舌头滑进她的嘴里时，很快就得到了允许。当他的舌头探索她的嘴并玩弄她的舌头时，女孩呻吟着。他们都能在对方的嘴里尝到食物残渣的味道。

After a long passionate exchange, the two parted. A trail of saliva formed between them, soon acted upon by gravity as it dropped onto Asuka's face. She wiped it off with her hand and Shinji moved his mouth down to her neck as he began to nuzzle her. The redhead jolted in surprise as she felt Shinji's finger make contact with her most sensitive region through her panties.  
经过长时间的热烈交流后，两人分手了。他们之间形成了一道唾液痕迹，很快就在重力的作用下滴到了明日香的脸上。她用手把它擦掉，真嗣把嘴移到她的脖子上，开始用鼻子蹭她。当她感觉到真嗣的手指隔着内裤接触到她最敏感的部位时，红发惊讶地颤抖起来。

"What are you doing Shinji?" she inquired.  
“慎二你在做什么？”她询问道。

"Come on Asuka we're all alone now, I really want to do this" he implored.  
“来吧，明日香，我们现在只剩下一个人了，我真的很想这么做，”他恳求道。

"What if _I_ don't want to?" she countered.  
“如果我不愿意怎么办？”她反驳道。

"I know you want to. Stop resisting just because _I_ want to" Shinji retorted.  
“我知道你想。别因为我想就抵抗。”真嗣反驳道。

"It doesn't matter what you think, if I say no it means no" Asuka replied firmly.  
“不管你怎么想，我说不就是不。”明日香坚定地回答。

"Can't you do something for me for once?" he asked.  
“你就不能为我做一次事吗？”他问。


**"…**_**At least show him you are his"**_  
“……至少让他知道你是他的”


Sex, the sign of ultimate trust between two lovers. Where you give yourself completely to the other and vice versa. It was very similar to submission and thus difficult for Asuka to do. But Asuka trusted Shinji completely; he had always shown loyalty to her, had always come back to her and had never loved another. She was his as much as he was hers and besides, Asuka herself too had growing desires from all the sexual tension that had been building up for a while. _'Misato's right in a way, I really should show him that I love him'_ she thought.  
性，是两个恋人之间最终信任的标志。你将自己完全奉献给对方，反之亦然。这和屈服很相似，所以明日香很难做到。但明日香完全信任真嗣；他总是对她表现出忠诚，总是回到她身边，从未爱过别人。她是他的，就像他是她的一样，此外，明日香自己也因为一段时间以来积累的性紧张而产生了越来越大的欲望。 “美里在某种程度上是对的，我真的应该向他表明我爱他”她想。

Her thoughts were interrupted as she felt Shinji's finger continue its work. The girl pushed off the boy and stood up. Shinji followed suit and looked at her questioningly.  
当她感觉到真嗣的手指继续工作时，她的思绪被打断了。女孩推开男孩，站了起来。真嗣也跟着，疑惑地看着她。

"This doesn't entitle you to any special treatment from me, furthermore you are not to brag about it to anyone. If I hear _anything_ along the lines of 'Shinji tamed the red demon in bed,' you won't breathe another second got it?" she warned.  
“这并不能让你享受到我的任何特殊待遇，而且你也不能向任何人吹嘘。如果我听到‘真嗣在床上驯服了红色恶魔’之类的话，你就不会再呼吸了。知道了？”她警告说。

"I get it" Shinji replied, rolling his eyes.  
“我明白了。”真嗣翻了个白眼回答道。

The girl looked at the boy full of passion, having now agreed to it she could release all the pent-up tension inside her. She grabbed Shinji, quickly pushing him up against a wall and kissing him fiercely. The redhead hastily moved her hands down to the buckle of Shinji's belt and began undoing it.  
女孩充满激情地看着男孩，既然答应了，她内心压抑的紧张就可以释放了。她抓住真嗣，迅速将他推到墙上，狠狠地吻着他。红发女郎急忙把手移到真嗣的皮带扣上，开始解开它。

_'She's taking control fast! This is not good, I can't get her aroused or my plan won't work'_ Shinji thought.  
“她控制得很快！”这不好，我不能让她兴奋，否则我的计划就不会成功。”真嗣想。

Under the passionate onslaught, the boy managed to reach under the girl's skirt and pull her panties down, exposing her most sensitive region to attack. Asuka moaned in approval of Shinji's actions. The redhead had already undone Shinji's belt and pants and was pulling them down, well more like wrenching them down. The boy was amazed at the fiery redhead's fervor. _'She's acting like she's never had sex before, well actually that makes sense because she believes she hasn't'_ he thought.  
在激烈的攻击下，男孩成功地将手伸到女孩的裙底下，将她的内裤拉了下来，暴露了她最敏感的部位。明日香呻吟着，对真嗣的举动表示认可。红发女郎已经解开真嗣的腰带和裤子，并将它们拉下来，更像是把它们拉下来。男孩对红发火红的热情感到惊讶。 “她表现得好像她以前从未发生过性行为，事实上这是有道理的，因为她相信自己没有发生过性行为，”他想。

Asuka had now stopped kissing the boy on the lips and moved down to his neck. She then pulled down his boxers, revealing his already erect cock. The girl paused to look down at it and smirked.  
明日香现在不再亲吻男孩的嘴唇，而是吻到了他的脖子上。然后她脱下了他的内裤，露出了他已经勃起的阴茎。女孩停下来低头看了一眼，笑了。

_'Ok, I better take control now before I lose it'_ Shinji thought.  
“好吧，我现在最好控制住自己，以免失去控制”真嗣想。

The boy managed to push the girl off him, stopping her actions. The redhead looked at him fairly confused. Finally relieved of the assault, Shinji was able to calm himself down and think clearly. It was time to use his plan; there was no other chance. He took advantage of Asuka's confusion and grabbed her, turning her around and pinning her against the wall just as he had been. The girl just looked at him curiously.  
男孩成功地将女孩推开，阻止了她的动作。红发一脸疑惑地看着他。终于从攻击中解脱出来，真嗣能够冷静下来，清晰地思考。是时候使用他的计划了；没有其他机会了。他利用明日香的困惑，抓住了她，将她转过身来，将她按在墙上，就像以前一样。女孩只是好奇地看着他。

"What's the big deal?" she asked.  
“有什么大不了的？”她问。

The male eva pilot just smiled and hastily moved his cock into position under her vagina. Asuka realised what he was doing and her eyes grew wide.  
男太空飞行员只是微笑着，急忙将他的阴茎移到她阴道下的位置。明日香意识到他在做什么，她的眼睛睁大了。

"Wait! Aahhhhhh!" she cried out as he pushed his cock up her tight canal as hard as he could.  
“等等！啊啊啊啊！”当他用尽全身力气将阴茎推入她紧致的阴道时，她叫喊起来。

_'Success!'_ Shinji thought.  
'成功！'真嗣想道。

_'Damn that hurt!'_ Asuka thought.  
“真他妈疼！”明日香心想。

"Are you ok Asuka?" Shinji asked, concerned.  
“明日香你还好吗？”慎二关切地问道。

"What the hell was that? I knew you'd be inexperienced but that was completely stupid! I had almost no lubrication whatsoever, you made that hurt way more than it should have!" she replied angrily.  
“那是什么鬼？我知道你缺乏经验，但这完全是愚蠢的！我几乎没有任何润滑，你让这比应有的伤害更严重！”她愤怒地回答。

"The Great Asuka can handle anything, what's a little momentary pain going to do?" he shot back mockingly.  
“明日香大人什么都能应付，一时的小痛又算什么？”他嘲讽地回击道。

"Oh ha, very funny third child. You get that cock out of me right now before I rip it off myself!" she shouted at him.  
“哦哈，非常有趣的第三个孩子。在我亲手把它撕下来之前，你现在就把我的鸡巴从我身上拿走！”她对他喊道。

Shinji complied almost instantaneously, removing his member from her lovely warm and tight pussy. The redhead looked up at him glaring and the boy just looked back at her sheepishly.  
真嗣几乎立刻就答应了，把他的阴茎从她可爱又温暖又紧绷的阴户里移开。红发女郎抬头怒目地看着他，而男孩只是羞涩地回头看着她。

"Not the most graceful way to lose my virginity, but it doesn't matter it's already done. Luckily for you, the pain has already subsided. If you try something like that again it will be _years_ before we have sex again" she threatened.  
“这不是失去童贞的最优雅的方式，但已经没有关系了。幸运的是，对你来说，疼痛已经消退了。如果你再次尝试类似的事情，我们将需要数年时间才能再次发生性行为。”她威胁道。

"Understood" he affirmed, relieved.  
“明白了。”他肯定地说，松了口气。

Now that Asuka believed she had lost her virginity, there was nothing holding the boy back anymore. Grinning at her, Shinji began his assault on the one he loved. First off, he quickly began to pull off her shirt. Taking off her shirt revealed her bare skin, which was nice and smooth. The boy kissed her passionately and roved his hands all over her. Running his hands up and down her back was making her shiver. Shinji would tickle her belly button and fondle her breasts through the soft fabric of her bra, making her moan impatiently.  
现在明日香相信她已经失去了童贞，没有什么能再阻止这个男孩了。真嗣对她一笑，开始攻击他所爱的人。首先，他迅速开始脱掉她的衬衫。脱掉衬衫，露出裸露的肌肤，光滑细腻。男孩热情地吻着她，双手在她身上游来游去。他的双手在她的背上来回抚摸，让她浑身发抖。真嗣会挠她的肚脐，隔着胸罩柔软的布料抚摸她的乳房，让她不耐烦地呻吟出声。

The redhead was surprised at the sudden change in Shinji's behaviour, he had changed from submissive to aggressive so fast. It was almost like he was pretending to be inexperienced. Asuka wanted to be the dominant one, but found herself unable to move from her restrained position against the wall. She struggled, but Shinji was in a better position and she was slowly losing her strength with all his physical affection; the constant rubbing of his erect cock against her thigh wasn't helping.  
红发惊讶于真嗣的行为突然转变，他从顺从到攻击性的转变速度如此之快。这几乎就像他在假装没有经验一样。明日香想要占据主导地位，但发现自己无法摆脱靠在墙上的束缚。她挣扎着，但真嗣处于更好的位置，她在他所有的身体爱抚下慢慢失去了力量；他勃起的阴茎不断地摩擦她的大腿并没有什么帮助。

Shinji soon moved his hands behind her back to unhook her bra. Letting the bra fall to the ground exposed her breasts. Asuka blushed, a little self-conscious at exposing herself to him. The boy turned the attention of his mouth onto her newly exposed bosom and the redhead gasped as she felt his mouth enclose onto her erect nipple. Shinji didn't forget to give her other breast attention as he moved one hand over and pinched her other nipple gently. The girl was deeply aroused, having "never" experienced anything like this. She moaned erratically as his tongue slid around her sensitive bud and his hand fondled her other breast softly, whilst occasionally flicking her nipple.  
真嗣很快把手移到背后，解开了她的胸罩。让胸罩掉到地上，露出了她的胸部。明日香脸红了，在他面前暴露自己有点不自在。男孩把他的嘴的注意力转向了她新裸露的胸部，当她感觉到他的嘴贴近了她勃起的乳头时，红发女郎喘着粗气。真嗣并没有忘记关注她的另一侧乳房，他将一只手移过去，轻轻捏住她的另一侧乳头。女孩深深地兴奋起来，她“从未”经历过这样的事情。当他的舌头在她敏感的花蕾上滑动，他的手轻轻地抚摸着她的另一侧乳房，同时偶尔轻弹她的乳头时，她不规则地呻吟着。

Shinji's remaining hand was resting on her buttocks, fondling her cheeks softly. Asuka was still struggling against the boy's ministrations, but was also participating in the exchange. The redhead was slowly unbuttoning his shirt with one hand and running her other hand through his hair. The boy then moved his mouth onto her other breast and resumed his previous actions. Asuka could feel herself getting wet; she was so aroused, she just wanted to throw herself onto his cock. The girl couldn't understand how Shinji kept so calm and in control of himself. He was taking his time with everything and teasing her as much as he could.  
真嗣剩下的那只手放在她的臀部上，温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊。明日香仍在与男孩的服务作斗争，但也在参与交流。红发女郎一只手慢慢地解开衬衫的扣子，另一只手梳理着他的头发。然后男孩将嘴移到了她的另一侧乳房上，并恢复了之前的动作。明日香能感觉到自己被淋湿了。她太兴奋了，只想投入到他的鸡巴上。女孩不明白真嗣是如何保持如此冷静和控制自己的。他对每件事都从容不迫，并尽可能地逗弄她。

"Come on Shinji! I just want to fuck already, mmmm!" she cried out impatiently.  
「来吧真嗣！我已经想操了，嗯！」她不耐烦地喊道。

The boy bit down on her nipple, making her squeal and then looked up at her smirking. "Haven't you ever heard of foreplay?" he asked.  
男孩咬住她的乳头，让她尖叫起来，然后抬头看着她傻笑。 “你没听说过前戏吗？”他问。

"You're taking it to the extreme! For God's sake I don't care if it's gonna hurt or if you'll cum before me, I just want your cock inside me!" she snapped.  
「你把它发挥到了极致！看在上帝的份上，我不在乎它是否会痛，或者你是否会在我面前射精，我只想让你的鸡巴进入我的体内！」她厉声说道。

Shinji chuckled at her behaviour; her impatience together with always getting what she wanted was making her unable to restrain herself. The boy decided maybe he should speed things up a little for her sake. Moving off her, he found his shirt was unbuttoned and took it off easily, leaving him completely naked. The redhead eyed him, checking out his naked body. He looked pretty scrawny to her, though his cock was definitely a generous size.  
真嗣对她的行为咯咯地笑起来。她的急躁加上总是能得到她想要的东西让她无法克制自己。男孩决定也许为了她，他应该加快速度。从她身上走开，他发现自己的衬衫没有扣子，于是轻松地把它脱了下来，让他赤身裸体。红头发的人看着他，审视着他赤裸的身体。在她看来，他看起来骨瘦如柴，尽管他的鸡巴确实很大。

Shinji then proceeded to take off Asuka's skirt, it being the last article of clothing still on her. Removing her skirt exposed her body fully. The boy then looked at Asuka's naked body, finally being able to have a good long look at her. Again, Asuka blushed at her exposure and found it strange that Shinji hadn't minded at all when he was exposed. Though she decided she would allow him a look anyway. Her breasts were covered with some saliva making them glisten a little. Her vagina was quite moist and her clit was poking out, clearly showing her excitement.  
然后真嗣开始脱下明日香的裙子，这是她身上的最后一件衣服。脱掉裙子，将她的身材完全暴露出来。男孩然后看着明日香赤裸的身体，终于能够好好地看她一眼了。明日香再次因为自己的暴露而脸红，并发现真嗣对自己暴露时竟然一点也不介意感到奇怪。尽管她决定无论如何都要让他看一眼。她的乳房沾满了唾液，显得有些闪闪发光。她的阴道非常湿润，阴蒂也露出来，清楚地显示出她的兴奋。

Shinji then moved towards Asuka and placed his lips on hers once again. Wrapping his arms around her, he pulled her closer, her breasts pressing up against him nicely. Kissing each other, he moved them towards his room. Not surprisingly, Asuka kept turning them around as they came nearer to his room; she wanted to be on top when they got to the bed. Shinji joined in the game and soon an interesting sight of a naked girl and boy twirling around was seen.  
然后真嗣走向明日香，再次将嘴唇放在她的嘴唇上。他用双臂环住她，将她拉得更近，她的乳房很好地贴着他。两人互相亲吻，他带着他们朝自己的房间走去。毫不奇怪，当他们靠近他的房间时，明日香不断地把他们转过来。当他们上床时，她想站在上面。真嗣也加入了游戏，很快就看到了一个有趣的景象，一个裸体的女孩和男孩在旋转。

Approaching the bed, both refused to be the one on the bottom as they continuously fought to get the other onto the bed first. Seeing no other solution, Shinji picked up the struggling girl and got onto the bed. Throwing her down onto the bed, he quickly got on top of her, making her unable to get up again. The redhead scowled at him; Asuka thought that Shinji would be submissive in bed as he was usually, but she was wrong. It would be difficult to satisfy two dominant people in bed unless one submit to the other. The redhead really wanted to make love and decided to give in this time; it's not like anyone else would know, just her and Shinji.  
到了床边，两人都不肯做下面的那个，不断地争着让对方先上床。真嗣别无他法，只好抱起挣扎的女孩，坐到床上。将她扔到床上，他很快就压在了她的身上，让她再也爬不起来。红头发的人皱起眉头看着他。明日香以为真嗣在床上会像平常一样顺从，但她错了。除非一个人屈服于另一个人，否则很难在床上满足两个占主导地位的人。红发女郎真的很想做爱，这次决定屈服；这不是其他人知道的，只有她和真嗣知道。

The boy then moved his face down towards hers and resumed their kissing. Asuka put her arms around his neck, keeping him there. Shinji slowly moved one hand down her body, starting from her breast. He moved painfully slow, approaching her stomach next. Tickling her stomach, the redhead soon grew tired of his games and grunted in irritation. Shinji resumed the movement of his hand down her body, soon arriving at the mound of red hair above her vagina. Finally, he reached her moist slit and ran his finger up and down it, making the redhead quiver.  
然后男孩把脸转向她的脸，继续接吻。明日香用双臂搂住他的脖子，让他呆在那里。真嗣慢慢地将一只手移向身体，从胸部开始。他的动作缓慢得令人痛苦，接下来靠近她的肚子。红发女郎挠着肚子，很快就厌倦了他的游戏，恼怒地哼了一声。真嗣继续把手沿着她的身体移动，很快就到达了她阴道上方的一团红毛。最后，他到达了她湿润的私处，用手指上下抚摸，让红发女郎颤抖起来。

The redhead jumped as his finger just brushed her clitoris. Asuka was growing tired of his teasing and parted. She moved her hand down to his chest and pinched his nipple, hard.  
当他的手指刚刚擦过她的阴蒂时，红发女郎跳了起来。明日香厌倦了他的戏弄，于是分手了。她把手移到他的胸前，用力捏住他的乳头。

"Oow!" Shinji cried. “哎哟！”慎二哭了。

"Serves you right you bastard! Here you have the most gorgeous girl naked in bed with you and you keep her waiting. I would have preferred you continued the intercourse earlier than this slow torture!" she shouted, aggravated.  
“你活该，你这个混蛋！这里有一个最漂亮的女孩赤身裸体和你躺在床上，你让她等着。我宁愿你继续性交，而不是这种缓慢的折磨！”她愤怒地喊道。

"If I can manage, surely the Great Asuka can-" he began.  
“如果我能做到，伟大的飞鸟也一定能——”他开始说道。

"Don't even start that! I don't care if I can handle it, I want it now so you'll give it to-Mmm! Oh God!" she moaned as he inserted a finger into her wet pussy.  
“甚至不要开始！我不在乎我是否能处理它，我现在就想要它，所以你要把它给——嗯！哦上帝！”当他将一根手指插入她湿漉漉的阴户时，她呻吟着。

She was soaking wet and she wasn't actually a virgin, so his finger slipped in quite easily. He began to move his finger in and out, probing around and touching her most sensitive spots. The boy was amazed he still remembered her completely. At this stage, Asuka was completely under his control; of course he had the unfair advantage of knowing exactly what she liked and where she liked it. Shinji withdrew his finger and began to stimulate her erect clit. The redhead cried out in pleasure as he gently rubbed her little nub, increasing the friction slowly.  
她浑身湿透，又不是处女，他的手指很容易就滑了进去。他的手指开始进出，试探着，触碰着她最敏感的地方。男孩很惊讶他竟然还记得她。这个阶段，明日香已经完全在他的掌控之中了。当然，他拥有不公平的优势，因为他确切地知道她喜欢什么以及喜欢哪里。真嗣收回手指，开始刺激她勃起的阴蒂。红发高兴得叫了起来，他轻轻地揉着她的小疙瘩，摩擦力慢慢加大。

Asuka was squirming in pleasure as he began to gently pinch her button. He returned his finger inside her warm, wet and sticky pussy adding another one. Shinji then rubbed her clitoris with his thumb whilst thrusting his fingers inside her vagina. He added a third finger to her pussy and increased his attack viciously. Asuka could not hold herself back anymore and let out a scream of pleasure as she climaxed. Her vagina drenched Shinji's hand in her juices. After the boy removed his hand, the girl had come down from her orgasm and was breathing heavily, sweat covering her entire body.  
当他开始轻轻地捏她的纽扣时，明日香高兴地蠕动着。他将手指放回她温暖、湿润、粘稠的阴户内，又插入了一根。然后真嗣用拇指摩擦她的阴蒂，同时将手指插入她的阴道。他在她的阴户上加了第三根手指，恶毒地加大了攻击力度。明日香再也无法抑制自己的高潮，发出一声愉悦的尖叫。她的阴道让真嗣的手沾满了她的汁液。男孩松开手后，女孩已经从高潮中下来，呼吸粗重，浑身都是汗。

Shinji didn't give her a chance to recover and soon moved his mouth down onto her sopping pussy. Unable to believe what she was feeling, the redhead looked down with wide eyes and saw Shinji's head in between her legs. She moaned loudly as his tongue delved inside her lower lips. Asuka bucked her hips, trying to get him in deeper, practically shoving her cunt into his face. The boy held her legs in place with his arms as he continued to lick and drink her delicious juices, inserting his tongue inside her and exploring her.  
真嗣没有给她恢复的机会，很快他的嘴就移到了她湿透的阴户上。红发女郎不敢相信自己的感受，睁大眼睛低下头，看到真嗣的头埋在她的双腿之间。当他的舌头深入她的下唇时，她大声呻吟。明日香挺起她的臀部，试图让他陷得更深，几乎把她的阴户推到了他的脸上。男孩用手臂固定住她的双腿，继续舔舐和喝她美味的汁液，将舌头插入她体内并探索她。

Deciding he had built her up enough, Shinji moved away from her pussy and Asuka moaned in protest.  
真嗣认定自己已经足够让她成熟了，他离开了她的阴户，明日香呻吟着抗议。

"Relax Asuka, I want my pleasure as well" he replied, positioning his cock at the entrance to her vagina.  
“放松明日香，我也想要我的快乐，”他回答道，将他的阴茎放在她阴道的入口处。

Asuka stuck her tongue out at him and Shinji began to tease her by moving his cock up and down her slit, driving her mad. Adrenalin pumped full throughout Asuka's body as she anxiously awaited the penetration in anticipation. The girl was slightly nervous; her body was shaking slightly and her heart beating fast. It seemed like one of the longest waits Asuka ever had before Shinji plunged his cock into her hot, wet pussy. It was so lubricated, his cock slipped inside quite easily. The redhead let out a loud cry of pleasure at the penetration; she was finally getting what she wanted. She wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his back, pulling him as close to her as possible.  
明日香向他伸出舌头，真嗣开始用他的阴茎在她的阴户上下移动来挑逗她，让她发疯。当她焦急地等待着渗透时，肾上腺素充满了明日香的身体。女孩有些紧张；她的身体在微微颤抖，心跳加速。这似乎是真嗣将他的鸡巴插入她火热潮湿的阴户之前，明日香经历过的最漫长的等待之一。它是如此润滑，他的阴茎很容易就滑进去了。红发女郎因插入而发出一声愉悦的叫喊。她终于得到了她想要的东西。她用双腿搂住他的腰，用手臂搂住他的背，把他拉得尽可能靠近她。

Shinji had forgotten how good her tight pussy felt and groaned in pleasure at the warm embrace his cock was feeling. The boy increased his pace as Asuka moaned and cried out in time with his thrusts, having "never" experienced such an intense pleasure like this before. The redhead would buck her hips when he thrust into her, trying to get him in as deep as possible. The expression on Asuka's face, that of mad passion, aroused Shinji greatly as she was giving herself to him fully.  
真嗣已经忘记了她紧致的阴户的感觉有多好，并因他的阴茎所感受到的温暖拥抱而高兴地呻吟着。当明日香随着他的抽插而呻吟和叫喊时，男孩加快了步伐，他“从未”经历过如此强烈的快感。当他插入她时，红发女郎会抬起她的臀部，试图让他尽可能深入。明日香脸上的表情，疯狂的热情，极大地刺激了真嗣，因为她把自己完全奉献给了他。

Perspiration covered the two teens as they made love. Shinji was grunting in exertion while Asuka moaned with every thrust. The boy was fucking her so hard she was left breathless and unable to speak. Shinji could not hold himself back any longer, everything she did was so erotic and he found himself cumming much sooner than usual. Plunging his cock in as hard and deep as possible, he released his seed inside her. Semen coated her inner walls and this brought Asuka over the edge as she screamed out Shinji's name in orgasm.  
两个青少年做爱时浑身是汗。真嗣在用力地咕哝着，而明日香则随着每一次的刺入而呻吟。男孩用力操弄她，让她气喘吁吁，说不出话来。真嗣再也无法克制住自己了，她所做的一切都是如此色情，他发现自己比平时射精得更快。他把他的阴茎尽可能用力地插进她体内，将精液释放到她体内。精液覆盖了她的内壁，这让明日香兴奋不已，她在高潮中尖叫着真嗣的名字。

Asuka's vaginal walls clamped down on his cock, milking him of all he was worth. The redhead dug her nails into his back as she felt wave after wave of pleasure released as she orgasmed fiercely. After their orgasms died down, Shinji collapsed on top of Asuka, both of them were panting heavily. The boy could go on but he knew since it was Asuka's "first" time, she probably couldn't handle much more. Thus, he rolled off her and laid down on the bed. When their breathing returned to normal, the redhead spoke up.  
明日香的阴道壁紧紧地压住他的阴茎，榨干他的一切价值。红发女郎将指甲深深地插入他的后背，剧烈的高潮让她感觉一波又一波的快感释放出来。当他们的高潮平息后，真嗣倒在明日香身上，两人都喘着粗气。男孩还可以继续说下去，但他知道，既然这是明日香的“第一次”，她可能无法承受更多。于是，他从她身上滚了下来，躺到了床上。等呼吸恢复正常后，红发男子开口说道。

"You know I have admit, you weren't half bad Shinji. You caught me by surprise, since I thought you'd be inexperienced especially with the first thing you did. But you must have borrowed a few movies from Kensuke or something, because that was too good for your first time. That felt… incredible" Asuka remarked, a pleased smile on her face.  
“你知道我已经承认了，真嗣你还不错。你让我大吃一惊，因为我以为你缺乏经验，尤其是你做的第一件事。但你一定是从健介那里借了一些电影什么的，因为这对你的第一次来说太棒了。”明日香说道，脸上挂着满意的微笑。

"I may have learnt a few tips from them over the course of our friendship" Shinji said in response.  
“在我们的友谊过程中，我可能从他们那里学到了一些技巧”真嗣回应道。

"Uh-huh" Asuka replied. The redhead then moved on top of the boy. "I let you be in control this time, just consider this session as a gift. Next time I'll be in charge. And don't even think about trying to use cheap methods like picking me up and restraining me, because I will stop it right there"  
“嗯嗯”明日香回答道。然后红发女郎移到了男孩身上。 “这次我让你掌控，就当是一份礼物吧，下次就由我来掌控了。而且别想用什么廉价的手段，比如抱起我、束缚我，因为我会就在那里停下来”

"Come on Asuka, you obviously enjoyed it. What's the harm in letting me be control in bed? You're in charge all day long as well, so what's the big deal?" he asked.  
“来吧，明日香，你显然很喜欢这样。让我在床上控制有什么坏处？你也整天负责，有什么大不了的？”他问。

"It's a massive deal, I bow down to no one!" she declared, grinning.  
“这是一件大事，我不向任何人低头！”她笑着宣称。

Shinji just rolled his eyes at her and laid his head back. Asuka planted a deep kiss on his lips and began tracing circles on his chest. The redhead parted and yawned tiredly.  
真嗣只是对她翻了个白眼，然后把头靠了回去。明日香在他的嘴唇上深深地吻了一下，并开始在他的胸口上画圈。红发女郎分开，疲倦地打了个哈欠。

"You wanna go to sleep now?" the boy asked.  
“你现在想睡觉吗？”男孩问道。

"I guess so, you look so tired after all Shinji" she answered, smirking.  
“我想是的，真嗣，你看起来很累。”她笑着回答。

The boy sighed and Asuka got off him. The two teens got under the covers and Shinji wrapped his arms around the girl's waist. Both eva pilots were finally satisfied of their sexual desires for the moment and were both content with each other's presence. Asuka smiled a genuine smile of joy, as they lay there together, completely naked, skin-to-skin, in each other's warmth.  
男孩叹了口气，明日香从他身上下来。两个青少年钻进被子里，真嗣用双臂搂住女孩的腰。两名EVA飞行员终于满足了自己此刻的性欲，并且都对彼此的存在感到满意。当他们躺在一起时，明日香露出了真诚而喜悦的微笑，他们完全赤裸，肌肤相触，彼此温暖。

"What if Misato finds us like this?" Shinji asked, not particularly caring though.  
“如果美里发现我们这样怎么办？”真嗣问道，但并没有特别在意。

"So what if she does? I couldn't care less if she didn't approve, it would be like listening to a murderer say not to kill people" Asuka retorted.  
“就算她同意又怎样？她不同意我也无所谓，就像是听一个杀人犯说不要杀人一样。”明日香反驳道。

"But we shouldn't have sex before marriage" Shinji joked.  
“但我们不应该在婚前发生性行为”真嗣开玩笑说。

"I'm probably too impatient to be able to discipline myself like that… but well… I suppose I understand the intention behind not having sex before marriage. All that rubbish about marrying someone and then finding out they aren't good in bed is so stupid, you have plenty of time to learn what the other likes. Clearly, the more important thing in a relationship is whether you love that person or not. If you have sex before marriage, you can easily end up liking them because of the sex and attraction, which are important things don't get me wrong, rather than because of them as a person. I suppose it also shows you can love the person, even without having sex" Asuka commented.  
“我可能太不耐烦了，无法这样约束自己……但是……我想我明白婚前不发生性行为的意图。所有那些关于嫁给某人然后发现他们床上功夫不好的废话都是很愚蠢，你有足够的时间去了解对方喜欢什么，显然，在一段关系中，更重要的是你是否爱那个人，如果你在婚前发生性行为，你很容易就会因为对方而喜欢他。性和吸引力，这些都很重要，不要误会我的意思，而不是因为它们作为一个人，我想这也表明你可以爱这个人，即使没有发生性行为。”明日香评论道。

"Mmm but Asuka, we aren't married yet" Shinji replied.  
“嗯，但是明日香，我们还没有结婚。”真嗣回答道。

"Yeah well, we are engaged though and I already know that you genuinely love me. Like I said before… I'm too impatient to wait till marriage to have sex" she countered.  
“是的，好吧，我们订婚了，我已经知道你是真心爱我。就像我之前说的……我太不耐烦了，不能等到结婚才发生性行为”她反驳道。

"So, if I got castrated you would stay with me?" Shinji teased.  
“那么，如果我被阉割了，你会和我在一起吗？”慎二打趣道。

"Of course. And would you stay with me if I got saggy tits, went bald and lost one eye?" she asked, chuckling.  
“当然。如果我的乳房下垂、秃头、失去一只眼睛，你会留在我身边吗？”她笑着问道。

"Well… that would certainly be interesting, but I would" he answered.  
“嗯……那肯定很有趣，但我会的，”他回答道。

"And that's what sex before marriage can undermine, the ability to love no matter what. Well, that's just my opinion anyway" the girl finished.  
“这就是婚前性行为可能破坏的东西，无论怎样，爱的能力。好吧，这只是我的观点，”女孩最后说道。

"Does that mean we won't have any more sex till we're married?" Shinji asked, a little worried.  
“这是否意味着我们在结婚之前不会再有性行为？”慎二有些担心地问道。

"Haha, you prove my point exactly" Asuka replied, rolling her eyes.  
“哈哈，你完全证明了我的观点。”明日香翻白眼回答道。

A silence followed and Shinji yawned. The boy felt satisfied and was more than ready to nod off. "Well then, goodnight Asuka" he said, kissing her on the head.  
接下来是一阵沉默，真嗣打了个哈欠。男孩感到很满意，准备睡觉了。 “那么，晚安明日香”他说道，亲吻了她的头。

"Goodnight Shinji" she replied.  
“晚安，真嗣。”她回答道。

The two lovers drifted off to sleep, content and happy. Whatever troubles would happen in the future, they would face them together…  
两个恋人心满意足、幸福地睡着了。以后有什么困难，他们都会一起面对……

End Notes: Yay Shinji and Asuka finally had sex and without having to reveal the past, isn't Shinji just lucky? Well not really when you consider what he had to do at school lol.

Author's Notes: 作者注：

Again, the original Notes had a whole bunch of answers to reviewer's questions and… you guessed it, are no longer relevant :D. I suppose the only thing still relevant was a comment from me explaining that I wanted to keep the anime feel in this fanfic, hence the ridiculous amount of times Shinji gets slapped by Asuka.  
再说一次，原来的注释有一大堆对审稿人问题的答案……你猜对了，不再相关了：D。我想唯一仍然相关的是我的一条评论，解释说我想在这部同人小说中保留动漫的感觉，因此真嗣被明日香打了很多次。

This chapter is short, but it's only the first part so it's meant to be, read and find out what happens this time.  
本章很短，但这只是第一部分，因此请阅读并了解这次会发生什么。

A note to say this is the rewritten chapter 21 (First rewrite – practically identical to the original version).  
需要注意的是，这是重写的第 21 章（第一次重写 - 几乎与原始版本相同）。

_**Important Note: If you're reading this, you're reading the up to date version of the story. If you didn't see this note last chapter, you were unlucky enough to have started reading this just before I updated all the chapters. It is recommended you re-read the previous chapters as some details of the story would have changed as well as the formatting, which will cause some confusion in further reading.  
重要提示：如果您正在阅读本文，那么您正在阅读该故事的最新版本。如果您在上一章没有看到此注释，那么您很不幸在我更新所有章节之前开始阅读本文。建议您重新阅读前面的章节，因为故事的一些细节以及格式都会发生变化，这会在进一步阅读时造成一些混乱。**_

### Chapter 21: Is This the End?  
第21章：就这样结束了吗？
It was in the dead of the night. The sky was completely dark, save for the bright light shining off the moon. There were no clouds in the sky and all seemed quiet. Tokyo-3 was currently still, the usually busy city seemingly taking a far delayed rest. However, inside NERV Headquarters it was bustling with activity. NERV was currently preparing as best it could for the oncoming invasion.  
那是在夜深人静的时候。天空一片漆黑，只有月亮发出明亮的光芒。天空万里无云，一切似乎都很安静。第三东京目前一片寂静，这座平时繁忙的城市似乎得到了延迟的休息。然而，NERV总部内部却热闹非凡。 NERV目前正在尽最大努力为即将到来的入侵做准备。

Just a few hours previously, a remote NERV outpost, whose communication system was still under repair, sent out a distress signal and was promptly cut off after 1.87 seconds. The Magi predicted there was a 90 percent chance of an error occurring, but Commander Ikari and Major Katsuragi did not want to take that chance. The pilots were needed at the eva cages, but the elevator system had "coincidentally" collapsed. They didn't have enough time to check if there was a traitor amongst NERV staff and continued making preparations. The pilots weren't picking up their cell phones and Misato hoped that it wasn't because something had happened to them. The woman in question was currently making her way up to the surface on foot.  
就在几个小时前，一个远程NERV前哨站的通信系统仍在维修中，发出求救信号，并在1.87秒后立即被切断。贤士们预测有百分之九十的可能性会发生错误，但碇司令和葛城少校不想冒这个险。逃生笼需要飞行员，但电梯系统“巧合”崩溃了。他们没有足够的时间去检查NERV人员中是否有叛徒，继续进行准备。飞行员们没有拿起手机，美里希望这不是因为他们出了什么事。这名女子目前正在步行到达地面。

It was very lucky that Commander Ikari had issued a citywide order for all civilians to evacuate Tokyo-3 just a few hours earlier. It was unlucky that all Section 2 agents watching her two children were "called off duty" as the Major wished to give them some privacy. It was even unluckier that all NERV personnel were currently stuck inside the base due to the entire elevator and car elevator system collapsing, making the only way possible to reach the surface being by ladder. Some NERV technicians were at work on the only salvageable elevator left, however, it would take some time before it was operational again. Ritsuko and the bridge bunnies were at their posts, ready for an attack on their computer system and everyone had been given a firearm. Everyone was tense and paranoid, expecting an attack at any time. The main fear fueling their paranoia was being taken by surprise.  
非常幸运的是，碇指挥官就在几个小时前发布了全市范围内的命令，要求所有平民撤离第三东京。不幸的是，所有看护她两个孩子的第二部分特工都被“停班”，因为少校希望给他们一些隐私。更不幸的是，由于整个电梯和汽车电梯系统崩溃，所有NERV人员目前都被困在基地内，使得到达地面的唯一方法是通过梯子。一些 NERV 技术人员正在对唯一剩下的可抢救电梯进行工作，但是，它需要一段时间才能再次运行。律子和桥兔们都在各自的岗位上，准备攻击他们的计算机系统，每个人都拿到了枪支。所有人都紧张又偏执，生怕随时会遭到袭击。加剧他们偏执的主要恐惧是出其不意。

Of course the main worry was that if Seele were launching an attack, they would have gotten to the children by now. With this in mind, the Major only quickened her pace.  
当然，主要担心的是，如果希儿发动攻击，他们现在就已经到了孩子们的身边了。想到这里，少校只是加快了脚步。

The two eva pilots were sleeping soundlessly in Shinji's bed. Shinji had his arms around the redhead and his head was resting just above her shoulder. The blanket had been pulled up such that the pilot's legs could be seen splayed across the bed. Both were completely unaware as to what was happening at the moment. The JSSDF had indeed dispatched troops to finish off NERV, using the cover of night to stealthily make their way through Tokyo-3. They had been given orders to kill the pilots on sight and as such, several troops had head over to their apartment to check if they were there.  
两名EVA飞行员在真嗣的床上无声地睡着。真嗣用双臂搂住红发女郎，头靠在她的肩膀上方。毯子被拉了起来，可以看到飞行员的双腿张开在床上。两人都完全不知道此刻发生了什么。日本自卫队确实派出了部队来消灭NERV，利用夜色的掩护悄悄地穿过第三东京。他们接到命令，一见到飞行员就杀死他们，因此，几名士兵前往他们的公寓检查他们是否在那里。

The balcony door in Shinji's room was wide open, allowing a cool breeze in. By now, the soldiers had arrived at the pilot's apartment. The soldiers approached the house and, fortunately for the pilots, one of them tripped on a piece of debris. The boy stirred, being interrupted from his sleep by the noise. Shinji let out a sigh and then gently removed his arms from the redhead. He sat up and wiped his eyes as he looked around the room groggily, wondering what had woken him up at this time of the night. Shinji looked down at the sleeping form of the female eva pilot, who was smiling serenely. Though with the cool breeze blowing across her now unprotected bare back, she began to shiver a little. The redhead unconsciously moved her arm across to try and grab her lost heat source. Shinji couldn't help smiling at the girl's actions; she seemed so innocent when she was asleep.  
真嗣房间的阳台门敞开着，凉风吹了进来。此时，士兵们已经来到了飞行员的公寓。士兵们走近了房子，幸运的是，飞行员中的一名士兵被一块碎片绊倒了。男孩动了动，被噪音打断了睡梦。真嗣叹了口气，然后轻轻地将手臂从红发上移开。他坐起来，擦了擦眼睛，昏昏沉沉地环视着房间，不知道在这个时候是什么把他吵醒的。真嗣低头看着睡着的女EVA飞行员，她面带安详的微笑。虽然凉风吹过她赤裸的后背，但她还是开始微微颤抖。红发无意识地移开手臂，试图抓住失去的热源。真嗣看到女孩的举动，忍不住笑了。她睡着的时候显得那么天真无邪。

The boy got out of bed, deciding he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep and covered Asuka up with the blanket. The girl sighed contentedly and Shinji bent down and kissed her on the forehead. The room was almost completely dark with the only light coming from the balcony which shone down on his bed, giving an almost angelic glow to the female eva pilot. Shinji walked over to his balcony to look out into the night. The sky was completely bare, save for the moon and some stars, but most strangely the night was extremely quiet, he couldn't even hear the sounds of cars driving past. The wind was chilly and the boy was completely naked, so he couldn't help shaking a little.  
男孩下了床，觉得自己再也睡不着了，于是用毯子给明日香盖上。女孩满足地叹了口气，真嗣弯下腰在她的额头上亲了一下。房间里几乎一片漆黑，唯一的灯光从阳台射进来，照在他的床上，给女伊娃飞行员带来了近乎天使般的光芒。真嗣走到阳台上眺望夜色。天空一片空旷，除了月亮和一些星星，但最奇怪的是，夜晚却极其安静，连汽车驶过的声音都听不到。风很冷，男孩赤身裸体，不由得有些颤抖。

Wondering about the lack of any noise, Shinji looked down at the streets and could just make out the outlines of people standing out the front of their apartment in the dark. One of them shifted position and the moon reflected off one of their guns. Instantly, Shinji felt that something was wrong. The men didn't look like Section 2 and also if Section 2 were guarding them, they usually kept out of sight.  
真嗣想知道没有任何噪音，他低头看着街道，只能在黑暗中辨认出公寓前面站着的人的轮廓。其中一人改变了位置，月亮从他们的一把枪上反射出来。顿时，真嗣就觉得有些不对劲了。这些人看起来不像第二分队，而且如果第二分队看守他们，他们通常会躲在看不见的地方。

Fear coursed through his body as he suspected something was happening. Adrenalin rushed through him as he quietly and swiftly made it back inside his room. He quickly shook Asuka awake, covering her mouth so she wouldn't speak. The girl stirred a little and made a few annoyed noises that were muffled by Shinji's hand. Finally, she opened her eyes and looked up at him questioningly.  
恐惧席卷了他的全身，他怀疑有什么事情发生了。当他安静而迅速地回到自己的房间时，肾上腺素激增。他赶紧把明日香摇醒，捂住她的嘴不让她说话。女孩动了动身子，发出几声恼怒的声音，但被真嗣的手捂住了。终于，她睁开了眼睛，疑惑地看着他。

"Don't make any noise Asuka, just get out of bed and fix up the sheets and blankets" Shinji whispered, removing his hand from her mouth.  
“别出声，明日香，起床把床单和毯子收拾好。”真嗣低声说道，把手从她嘴上拿开。

"What? But why?" she whispered back.  
“什么？但是为什么呢？”她低声回应道。

"Just do it" he whispered sternly.  
“就这么做吧”他严厉地低声说道。

A little confused, the redhead got out of bed and began to make it. She had no idea as to what was happening but Shinji's face was quite serious and she decided it would be better not to ask him questions now. Shinji quickly exited his room and made his way to the living room. The boy decided the best approach was to somehow make contact with Misato and remembered he had his cell phone in his bag. Not wanting to waste time, as the men from outside could already be outside their door, he just grabbed his bag, hurried back to his room and closed the door, finding Asuka having already finished making his bed.  
红发女郎有点困惑，下了床开始做起来。她不知道发生了什么事，但真嗣的表情相当严肃，她决定现在最好不要问他问题。真嗣很快就出了房间，往客厅走去。男孩决定最好的办法是以某种方式与美里取得联系，并记得他的手机放在包里。不想浪费时间，外面的人可能已经在门外了，他就抓起包，匆匆跑回自己的房间，关上门，发现明日香已经把床铺好了。

The redhead looked over at him and was about to say something when they heard an exceedingly quiet noise come from the front of their residence; it was almost inaudible, but the fact that the night was so quiet and the two eva pilot's senses were heightened, they were able to determine it was definitely the sound of their front door opening. Asuka's eyes grew wide, wondering what was happening. The boy began to panic, there was nowhere they could run, there was no escape. Shinji sweated heavily as he tried to think of something, any minute now the intruder could walk through the door.  
红发回头看了他一眼，正要说什么，就听见宅子门前传来一阵极其安静的响动。几乎听不见，但夜色如此静谧，两名EVA飞行员的感官敏锐，他们能够确定这绝对是前门打开的声音。明日香睁大了眼睛，想知道发生了什么。男孩开始惊慌，他们无处可逃，无处可逃。真嗣满头大汗地努力思考着什么，入侵者随时都可能破门而入。

Asuka watched as the boy began to panic and she grew worried. Despite not knowing what was happening, she could guess that they needed to leave now. The girl grabbed the boy by the arm and pulled him along. Not having any ideas, the boy let himself be pulled along by Asuka.  
明日香看着男孩开始惊慌，她开始担心起来。尽管不知道发生了什么，但她猜得出他们现在需要离开。女孩抓住男孩的手臂，把他拉着走。男孩没有任何想法，任由明日香拉着走。

The stranger entered Shinji's room silently, holding his gun out in front. He scanned the room for any signs of life and found the room completely empty. The bed was made and it looked like no one had stayed in this room. However, the man quickly spotted the open balcony door and moved towards it quietly. Holding his gun forward, ready to fire, he moved outside, aiming his gun left and right but found no target. Looking around, he saw no one and re-entered Shinji's room to go and check out Asuka's room next.  
陌生人默默地走进真嗣的房间，把枪举在前面。他扫视房间里是否有任何生命迹象，发现房间里空无一人。床已经铺好了，看起来这个房间里没有人住过。不过，男人很快就发现了敞开的阳台门，悄悄朝阳台门走去。他把枪举在前面，准备开火，然后走到外面，用枪左右瞄准，但没有找到目标。他环顾四周，没有看到任何人，便重新进入真嗣的房间，准备下一步去看看明日香的房间。

Both teens let out a sigh of relief as they heard the man move off. Only having a few minutes to hide, Asuka had taken Shinji outside and began to climb down the edge of the balcony. There were no footholds and so they had to climb down the diagonal edge using purely their upper body strength. Upon making it to the lower balcony, they pressed their backs flat against the lower balcony door hoping that the man would not look down. With all the adrenalin pumping through them, their hearts racing and their heavy sweating, they couldn't feel the cold, despite being utterly naked. Shinji was impressed at Asuka's quick thinking and was amazed they were able to climb down to the lower balcony without making any noise, even while carrying Shinji's bag.  
听到男人离开的声音，两个少年都松了口气。明日香只有几分钟的时间来躲藏，他把真嗣带到外面，开始沿着阳台的边缘爬下去。没有立足点，他们只能依靠上半身的力量从斜边爬下去。到达下层阳台后，她们将后背平贴在下层阳台的门上，希望该男子不会往下看。肾上腺素激增，心跳加快，大汗淋漓，尽管他们赤身裸体，却感觉不到寒冷。真嗣对明日香的敏捷思维印象深刻，并惊讶于他们能够在不发出任何噪音的情况下爬到较低的阳台上，即使是在提着真嗣的包的情况下。

The two eva pilots then turned around and opened the balcony door, fortunately finding it unlocked. The two were safe at the moment, however they now had another problem and that was the fact that there were still men outside guarding the exit to their apartment. Added to that, both were completely naked and needed to find some clothes. Asuka closed the balcony door behind her while Shinji opened the front pocket of his bag and took out his cell phone, before quickly putting the phone on silent. Deciding that the man wouldn't be able to hear them in here, he scrolled through his contact numbers for Misato's and hit call.  
两名逃生飞行员随后转身打开阳台门，幸运的是发现门没有锁。两人目前是安全的，但是现在又有一个问题了，那就是外面还有人把守着他们公寓的出口。除此之外，两人都赤身裸体，需要找一些衣服。明日香关上了身后的阳台门，真嗣则打开包的前袋，拿出手机，然后迅速将手机调为静音。确定该男子在这里听不到他们的声音，他滚动​​浏览自己的联系电话号码，找到美里的电话号码，然后拨打电话。

Unable to locate the second and third children, the man spoke into his radio microphone.  
由于找不到第二个和第三个孩子，该男子对着无线电麦克风讲话。

"The pilots aren't here sir, I've searched all the rooms" the man declared.  
“飞行员不在这里，先生，我已经搜遍了所有房间”该男子宣称。

"How is that possible? We traced the second child's phone to that apartment; _she_ should at least be there" a voice answered in the man's headset.  
“这怎么可能？我们追踪到老二的手机就到了那间公寓，她至少应该在那儿。”男人的耳机里传来一个声音。

"What about the third child's cell phone sir?" the man asked.  
“先生，老三的手机呢？”男人问道。

"We were not able to trace it, perhaps it was turned off. Though it is strange that he would have his cell phone off" the voice on the radio replied.  
“我们没能追踪到它，也许它已经关机了。不过奇怪的是他的手机关机了。”收音机里的声音回答道。

Little did they know that Shinji's old mobile had been destroyed and that he had bought a new one. Of course with the tight security since Asuka's attempted assassination, how could they have found out?  
他们几乎不知道真嗣的旧手机已被毁坏，他又买了一部新手机。当然，自从明日香被刺杀以来，戒备森严，他们怎么可能发现呢？

"Damn it! And we thought we had gotten the better of NERV when they had called the pilots and gave us their location. They must be smarter than we thought sir" the man remarked.  
“该死！当 NERV 打电话给飞行员并告诉我们他们的位置时，我们以为我们已经战胜了他们。他们一定比我们想象的更聪明，先生”那人评论道。

"Continue searching their residence, they may be hiding" the voice directed.  
“继续搜查他们的住处，他们可能藏起来了。”那个声音说道。

"Affirmative sir" the man acknowledged.  
“是的，先生。”男人承认道。

Misato was currently still making her way to the surface by ladder when her cell phone had started ringing. The Major swore at having almost lost her bearings and fallen at the sound. Calming herself, she took out her phone and looked at the caller ID. She was shocked to see Shinji's name displayed on her screen. She quickly hit the receive button and placed the phone to her ear.  
当美里还在通过梯子到达地面时，她的手机响了。少校咒骂着，听到这个声音，她几乎失去了方向，摔倒了。她定了定神，拿出手机看了看来电显示。当她看到屏幕上显示真嗣的名字时，她震惊了。她快速按下接听键，将手机放在耳边。

"Shinji! Are you there? What happened to you? Are you ok? Is everything alright?" the Major spoke frantically.  
“真嗣！你在吗？你怎么了？你还好吗？一切都好吗？”少校疯狂地说道。

"Yes Misato, I'm alright for the moment. Asuka's here with me too. What's happening Misato? Some men arrived at our apartment and we had to hide. Though we're not out of the water yet, we're still trapped in the apartment building" Shinji answered.  
“是的，美里，我暂时没事。明日香也在我身边。美里发生了什么事？一些人来到了我们的公寓，我们不得不躲起来。虽然我们还没有脱离水面，但我们仍然被困住了。”在公寓楼里。”真嗣回答道。

"Seele is launching their attack now! They wish to get rid of you pilots first so that we don't stand any chance against the invasion. Thank God you two are still alive, I'll come over to the apartment as soon as I can and see what I can do. You two stay put and hide" Misato ordered.  
“Seele现在正在发起攻击！他们想先除掉你们这些飞行员​​，这样我们就没有任何机会抵御入侵了。谢天谢地，你们两个还活着，我一到公寓就赶过来。”看看我能做什么。你们两个留在原地躲起来。”美里命令道。

"Understood, please hurry Misato" the boy urged.  
“明白了，请美里快点。”少年催促道。

"I will. Call me if something happens and stay safe. Goodbye" she replied and hung up.  
“我会的。如果有事就给我打电话，注意安全。再见。”她回答道，然后挂断了电话。

The purple-haired woman turned her phone on silent so she wouldn't jump in surprise again. Pocketing her phone, she continued her journey. The dark and dank shaft seemed to stretch on endlessly as Misato cursed the Commander for being "unable" to send reinforcements with her. _'As if_ _**all**_ _the personnel are needed, at least_ _**one**_ _could have come with me'_ she thought. Shoving her thoughts aside, she focused on the task at hand.  
紫发女子将手机调成静音，以免自己再次惊跳起来。她把手机收进口袋，继续赶路。漆黑潮湿的竖井似乎无限延伸，美里咒骂着指挥官“无法”随她一起派遣援军。 “好像需要所有人员一样，至少有一个人可以和我一起去，”她想。她抛开了杂念，专注于手头的工作。

It would still be a while before she could reach the children, after all, she still needed to get to the surface. Afterwards, she would have to make her way to the apartment and taking into account there were probably soldiers about and reinforcements soon to arrive as well, it was imperative that the children be escorted to NERV swiftly.  
距离孩子们的到来还需要一段时间，毕竟她还需要到达地面。之后，她就必须前往公寓，考虑到周围可能有士兵，增援部队也很快就会到达，所以必须迅速护送孩子们去NERV。

"What the hell is going on?" Asuka whispered to Shinji after he hung up.  
“这到底是怎么回事？”挂断电话后，明日香对真嗣低声说道。

"Apparently Seele is launching their attack now, they sent some soldiers to deal with us first" Shinji answered.  
“看来希儿现在要进攻了，他们先派了一些士兵来对付我们。”真嗣回答道。

"But what about Section 2? Or NERV's military personnel? Surely, they would have come to our aid by now?" she asked, confused.  
“但是第二分部呢？或者NERV的军事人员？他们现在肯定会来援助我们吗？”她困惑地问道。

"I didn't think to ask Misato" he replied, sounding stupid.  
“我没想去问美里。”他回答道，听起来很愚蠢。

"Baka" she shot back, whacking him over the head quietly.  
“巴卡”她回击，轻轻地敲了他的头。

"Maybe something's holding them up, after all, Misato would have been here already by now if she knew we were in danger" he surmised.  
“也许有什么东西阻碍了他们，毕竟，如果美里知道我们处于危险之中，她现在就已经在这里了，”他推测道。

"So what are we gonna do? I for one do not want to just sit around completely naked, just waiting for them to find us" Asuka remarked, irritated.  
“那我们该怎么办？我不想光着身子坐在那儿，等着他们找到我们。”明日香恼怒地说。

"Well there's nothing we really can do. If we try to leave, we'll be spotted and killed. Also, Misato asked us to wait here" Shinji retorted, sighing.  
“好吧，我们真的无能为力。如果我们试图离开，我们就会被发现并被杀死。而且，美里让我们在这里等。”真嗣叹了口气反驳道。

The redhead just rolled her eyes in annoyance; waiting was one of the things she hated doing most.  
红发女郎只是恼怒地翻了个白眼。等待是她最讨厌做的事情之一。

"So how long is she gonna take anyway?" Asuka asked impatiently.  
“那么她还要花多长时间呢？”明日香不耐烦地问道。

"I didn't ask her that either" Shinji answered lamely.  
“我也没有问过她这个问题。”真嗣蹩脚地回答道。

"You're about as useful as a bucket full of holes I swear to God" she hissed angrily.  
“我向上帝发誓，你就像一个满是洞的水桶一样有用。”她愤怒地嘶嘶地说。

"It's my bad… but this situation is serious, it's hard to think calmly" the boy replied. "And… it's ok to be scared Asuka" he said sincerely.  
“是我不好……不过现在情况很严重，很难冷静思考。”男孩回答道。 “而且……害怕明日香也没关系。”他真诚地说。

"As if I'm scared, I am just pissed off at this extreme disadvantage. I mean they just _had_ to attack right after we had sex" she huffed.  
“好像我很害怕，我只是对这种极端的劣势感到愤怒。我的意思是，他们在我们做爱后就不得不发动攻击，”她气呼呼地说道。

Shinji couldn't help smiling a little, even in such a situation she was still able to cheer up the mood.  
真嗣不禁微微一笑，即便是在这种情况下，她的心情依然能够愉悦起来。

"What are you smiling at you baka? This is all your fault after all" she remarked, annoyed.  
“你对你的笨蛋笑什么？这毕竟都是你的错”她生气地说。

"My fault?" he asked, confused.  
“我的错？”他困惑地问道。

"Yeah, if you didn't beg me to sleep with you, we wouldn't be naked" the girl explained.  
“是啊，如果你不求我和你一起睡，我们就不会裸体。”女孩解释道。

"I didn't beg! And who knows, it might come in handy. The soldiers might hesitate in shooting a naked woman" the boy countered.  
“我没有乞求！谁知道呢，它可能会派上用场。士兵们可能会犹豫是否要射杀一个裸体女人，”男孩反驳道。

"Yeah right" she replied, snorting.  
“是的，没错，”她哼了一声，回答道。

The boy looked around the room, noticing that it was almost entirely empty. He would have thought that someone would live here, but apparently it wasn't so or maybe they had been evacuated. _'Well, it looks like we can't find any clothes here then. And it's starting to get really cold again'_ he thought, shivering.  
男孩环顾房间四周，发现房间里几乎空无一人。他本以为会有人住在这里，但显然事实并非如此，或者说他们已经被疏散了。 “嗯，看来我们在这里找不到衣服了。”天气又开始变冷了。”他颤抖着想。

"And I don't care how cold it gets, you are not feeling me up to get warm" Asuka said matter-of-factly.  
“而且我不管天气有多冷，你都感觉不到我要取暖。”明日香实事求是地说。

"I didn't even say anything!" Shinji said defensively.  
“我什么也没说啊！”慎二辩解道。

"But you were thinking it" she shot back, glaring at him.  
“但你就是这么想的。”她怒视着他，反驳道。

"Anyway Asuka, we probably shouldn't make so much noise, the soldiers might actually start to search the rest of the apartment" he advised.  
“无论如何，明日香，我们可能不应该发出这么大的噪音，士兵们可能会开始搜查公寓的其他地方”他建议道。

"What time is it anyway?" she asked.  
“现在都几点了？”她问。

Shinji looked down at his cell phone to check the time and saw that it read 3:17 a.m. "It's quarter past three" he answered.  
真嗣低头看了看手机时间，发现时间是凌晨三点十七分。“现在三点十五分了。”他回答道。

"Jeez I'm gonna have to catch up on some sleep after all this, not to mention I'm starving. They will pay for interrupting my comfortable sleep and depriving me of breakfast" Asuka complained.  
“哎呀，经历了这一切之后我得好好睡一觉了，更不用说我还饿着呢。他们会为打扰我舒适的睡眠和不让我吃早餐而付出代价。”明日香抱怨道。

"Is that all you can think about at a time like this?" he said incredulously.  
“这种时候你就只能想这些吗？”他难以置信地说。

"One of us has to be brave and it sure as hell isn't you" she retorted, smirking.  
“我们中的一个人必须勇敢，而你肯定不是”她笑着反驳道。

Shinji just rolled his eyes. Suddenly, Asuka's stomach growled in hunger.  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼。突然，明日香的肚子饿得咕咕叫了。

"Far out, my stomach is going to betray our position!" she said in disbelief.  
“再远一点，我的胃就要背叛我们的位置了！”她难以置信地说。

Fortunately for them, Shinji remembered something. The male eva pilot went back to his bag and rummaged through it to find two unopened bentos. That was unbelievably lucky of them to have forgotten to have lunch the day before. He took out the two bentos and handed one to Asuka. The girl just looked at him surprised.  
幸运的是，真嗣想起了一些事情。男EVA飞行员回到包里，翻箱倒柜，找到了两份未开封的便当。他们真是太幸运了，前一天忘记吃午饭了。他拿出两份便当，递给明日香一份。女孩只是惊讶地看着他。

"You made lunch before we escaped?" she asked.  
“我们逃跑前你做了午饭吗？”她问。

"I'm not that fast" he replied, chuckling, "No, we never had our lunches yesterday and they were just sitting in the bag the whole time"  
“我没那么快，”他笑着回答，“不，我们昨天没有吃午饭，它们一直都放在袋子里。”

"Well, what do you know. That stupid bet actually came in handy" she said, grinning.  
“好吧，你知道什么。那个愚蠢的赌注实际上派上了用场。”她笑着说道。

The boy just shook his head in response. The two teens then silently opened their bentos and began to eat as quietly as they could. At every noise, both would suddenly go still and both their heart rates would go up only for them to realise it was nothing and relax again. Despite her outward behaviour, Asuka understood the seriousness of their situation. Soon, they had finished their meals and were satisfied of hunger for the moment. Occasionally, they would hear some noises that sounded like someone moving about but whoever it was never came to their room. Both eva pilots thought it strange they didn't send more soldiers to investigate or help in the search.  
男孩只是摇摇头作为回应。然后两个少年默默地打开便当，开始尽可能安静地吃东西。每听到一声响动，两人都会突然安静下来，心率都会加快，直到他们意识到这没什么，然后又放松下来。尽管她的外表如此，明日香还是明白他们处境的严重性。很快，他们就吃完了饭，也暂时解开了饥饿感。偶尔，他们会听到一些声音，听起来像是有人在走动，但无论是谁，都没有来到他们的房间。两名紧急救援飞行员都觉得奇怪，他们没有派更多的士兵去调查或帮助搜索。

The night was starting to become brighter as it was getting closer to dawn. The temperature was still cold, and with no clothes, Shinji had no choice but to huddle with Asuka. She put up some resistance at first, accusing him of being weak and just trying to get a feel, but she soon relented and the two eva pilots shared their body warmth. The two teens were getting worried, wondering when Misato would come. Both knew that a soldier could come into the room at any moment and they really didn't stand a chance. Shinji thought it was best not to call their guardian, just in case it was at a bad time.  
随着黎明的临近，夜色也开始变得明亮起来。气温依然寒冷，又没穿衣服，真嗣只好和明日香挤在一起。起初她有些抵抗，指责他软弱，只是想感受一下，但她很快就软化了，两名逃生飞行员分享了他们的身体温暖。两个少年有些担心，不知道美里什么时候会来。两人都知道士兵随时可能进入房间，而他们确实没有机会。真嗣认为最好不要给他们的监护人打电话，以防时机不对。

---

The purple-haired woman had finally made it to the surface and was currently sneaking through Tokyo-3 towards her apartment. So far, she had not seen any soldiers about but still thought it was best to make sure she couldn't be seen just in case. The sun was rising and though it was still a little dark, it was definitely light enough for the Major to see clearly. It was so quiet and still, it was unnerving. The entire city was empty and it took a while to get used to the complete inactivity.  
紫发女子终于浮出水面，正偷偷穿过第三东京，朝自己的公寓走去。到目前为止，她还没有看到任何士兵，但仍然认为最好确保自己不被发现，以防万一。太阳已经升起，虽然天色还有些暗，但对于少校来说已经足够看得清楚了。周围是如此的安静和平静，令人不安。整个城市空无一人，需要一段时间才能适应完全的静止。

Stopping for a moment, Misato took in where she was to work out how close she was. It would seem she was undecided about where she should go; the second place she needed to go to was closer, but she also promised Shinji and Asuka she would come to them as soon as possible. She shook her head and went off in the direction of her and her children's apartment.  
美里停了一会儿，观察了她所在的位置，以确定距离有多近。她似乎还没有决定该去哪里；第二个要去的地方比较近，但她也向真嗣和明日香保证，她会尽快赶到他们那里。她摇摇头，朝她和孩子们的公寓方向走去。

Traversing the empty roads and streets, Misato soon came close to her apartment. It was then that she noticed several soldiers patrolling the area. _'Damn this will be difficult, how can I possibly take out all these guards and get to the children?'_ she thought. The Major slowly and quietly made her way through alleys and side streets to find herself with a view of the front of her apartment. Hiding behind a dumpster, she was able to see that there were two soldiers guarding the front entrance to the apartment and another two guards patrolling the building.  
穿过空荡荡的马路和街道，美里很快就来到了她的公寓附近。就在这时，她注意到有几个士兵在该地区巡逻。 “该死的，这太困难了，我怎么可能干掉所有这些守卫并找到孩子们呢？”她想。少校缓慢而安静地穿过小巷和小巷，发现自己可以看到公寓前面的景色。躲在垃圾箱后面，她看到有两名士兵守卫着公寓的正门，另外两名警卫正在大楼里巡逻。

_'Is this all they sent? Haven't they realised we know they are here by now? Maybe they still think we don't know what's happening…'_ she thought.  
“这就是他们送来的全部吗？难道他们没有意识到我们现在知道他们在这里吗？也许他们仍然认为我们不知道发生了什么……”她想。

After watching the soldiers for some time, Misato worked out the best time to strike. When the two patrolling guards were on the other side of the building they would come back after 25 seconds, this would probably turn into 10 seconds if they ran. So, she had 10 seconds to shoot the two guards guarding the entrance and run into the building for cover. Of course this was extremely risky because she didn't know who was inside the building, but she had no other choice.  
美里观察了士兵们一段时间后，计算出了最佳的出击时机。当两个巡逻的警卫在大楼另一边的时候，他们会在25秒后回来，如果他们跑的话，这可能会变成10秒。于是，她有10秒的时间射杀了守卫入口的两名警卫，然后跑进大楼寻找掩护。当然，这是极其危险的，因为她不知道大楼里的人是谁，但她也没有别的选择。

The purple-haired woman brought up her gun and put the safety off. She pressed her back up against the wall and waited. _'Now!'_  
紫发女人举起枪，关上了保险。她把背靠在墙上等待着。 '现在！'

She quickly jumped out of her hiding spot and shot the first guard straight in the head, the second guard brought up his gun in surprise at the attack and fired. The Major ran straight for the building, the bullets from the soldier's automatic rifle missing her by millimetres as she fired at him, trying to land a shot. Finally scoring a hit, the Major fired relentlessly at the man's chest and he went down. The purple-haired woman dived into the building just as machine gun fire broke out all around her; the two patrolling guards had returned.  
她迅速从藏身之处跳出来，直接射中了第一个守卫的头部，第二个守卫惊讶地举枪射击。少校径直跑向大楼，当她向他开枪，试图开枪时，士兵自动步枪的子弹与她相差几毫米。少校终于击中了这名男子的胸部，他倒地了。紫发女子冲进大楼，周围机枪扫射。两个巡逻的侍卫回来了。

Misato quickly got up and reloaded her handgun. She hid up against the wall, aiming her gun at the entrance waiting for the two guards to come in. Unfortunately, she had forgotten all about the possible soldiers _inside_ the building and was surprised when she felt a bullet go right through her shoulder as she cried out in pain. Fortunately, her reflexes saved her as she rolled under the staircase, momentarily providing her cover. Alas, it was to no avail as bullets could pierce wood and the soldier starting firing into the staircase, showering splinters of wood all over Misato.  
美里迅速站起来，给手枪重新装弹。她靠着墙躲起来，用枪瞄准入口，等待两名警卫进来。不幸的是，她完全忘记了大楼内可能有士兵，当她感到一颗子弹穿过她的肩膀时，她感到很惊讶。痛苦地叫喊着。幸运的是，当她滚到楼梯下时，她的反应救了她，暂时提供了掩护。唉，这并没有什么用，因为子弹可以穿透木头，士兵开始向楼梯开枪，木头碎片洒落在美里身上。

The other two guards were now standing at the entrance to the apartment, waiting to shoot her when she was forced to come out from under the staircase. The Major cried out again as a stray bullet just nicked her on her arm, she really had no way out of this situation. Just when she thought she was about to die, the firing from the soldier up above stopped and a loud thud followed by a few crashes could be heard. The two guards looked inside curiously to see an unconscious soldier rolling down the stairs.  
另外两名警卫现在站在公寓入口处，等待着当她被迫从楼梯下出来时向她开枪。少校又叫了一声，一颗流弹刚刚在她的手臂上划了一道口子，她实在是没有办法摆脱这种局面了。就在她以为自己快要死了的时候，上面士兵的枪声停止了，只听一声巨响，接着是几声撞击声。两名守卫好奇地朝里面看去，看到一名昏迷不醒的士兵从楼梯上滚了下来。

Misato took the opportunity to fire at the guards, earning a mortal blow on one of them, while wounding the other. The wounded soldier ran off and Misato got up quickly to chase after him. Exiting the building, she saw the soldier's figure and quickly chased after him firing.  
美里趁机向守卫开枪，其中一人受到致命一击，另一人受伤。受伤的士兵逃跑了，美里连忙起身去追。走出大楼，她看到了士兵的身影，连忙追了上去，开枪射击。

"All chance at stealth has been compromised!" the soldier shouted into his mouthpiece. "We are under attack, all chance at stealth has been compromised, send in all units! Send in all uni-" his voice was cut off as Misato landed a shot on the unfortunate soldier.  
“所有隐身的机会都被破坏了！”士兵对着话筒喊道。 “我们受到攻击，所有隐身机会都被破坏了，派出所有部队！派出所有部队——”当美里向不幸的士兵开枪时，他的声音被切断了。

The soldier fell to the ground dead, blood pouring out from the back of his head. The purple-haired woman sighed in relief and began to make her way back to the apartment. As the adrenalin wore off, the pain in her shoulder became more apparent and she collapsed to the floor from pain and blood loss. Blood stained her jacket as it trickled down from her wound. Clutching her injured shoulder, she quickly ripped off some of her skirt and wrapped it around her shoulder to stop the blood flowing. Willing herself to stand again, she got up and walked the rest of the way to the apartment. Entering the apartment, Misato saw the unconscious soldier still lying on the staircase. She aimed her gun down at him and shot him in the head, spraying some blood everywhere.  
士兵倒地身亡，鲜血从后脑勺流淌而出。紫发女子松了口气，开始朝公寓走去。随着肾上腺素的消退，她肩膀的疼痛变得更加明显，她因疼痛和失血而倒在地板上。血从她的伤口流下来，染红了她的夹克。她捂着受伤的肩膀，飞快地扯下一些裙子，裹在肩膀上止住血流。她鼓起勇气再次站起来，站起身来，走完剩下的路，向公寓走去。进入公寓后，美里看到昏迷不醒的士兵还躺在楼梯上。她用枪瞄准他，朝他的头部开了一枪，鲜血溅得到处都是。

"M-Misato?" Shinji let out, trembling from seeing his guardian's actions; she had killed him without any emotion.  
「美、美里？」真嗣因看到监护人的举动而浑身颤抖，大叫一声。她毫无感情地杀了他。

The Major looked up to see Shinji and Asuka, wearing their school uniform, standing behind the railing of the staircase with wide eyes. Misato sighed as she saw her two wards. She didn't like showing them this side of her, but she had to kill him. The older woman managed a smile as she looked up at them.  
少校抬头，看到身着校服的真嗣和明日香睁大眼睛站在楼梯栏杆后面。看到自己的两个病房，美里叹了口气。她不喜欢让他们看到自己的这一面，但她不得不杀了他。老妇人抬头看着他们，脸上露出了微笑。

"Glad you two are safe" Misato remarked.  
“很高兴你们两个安全”美里说道。

"It's about time Misato" Asuka shot back, trying to sound annoyed but failing miserably.  
“是时候了，美里。”明日香反驳道，试图让自己听起来很生气，但惨遭失败。

"Are you ok Misato?" Shinji asked, concerned, noticing the wound on her shoulder.  
“美里还好吗？”真嗣注意到她肩膀上的伤口，关切地问道。

"I'm ok, I just got shot in the shoulder, that's about it" Misato answered, pretending to be fine.  
“我没事，只是肩膀中枪，仅此而已。”美里假装没事的样子回答道。

Both eva pilots saw straight through her lie, the makeshift bandage on her shoulder was soaked crimson and Misato looked exhausted and in pain. But both were glad that she had come to save them.  
两名EVA飞行员都看穿了她的谎言，她肩膀上的临时绷带被浸透了深红色，美里看上去疲惫不堪，痛苦不堪。但两人都很高兴她来救他们。

"So, was it you two who stopped the man firing?" Misato asked.  
“所以，是你们两个阻止了那人开枪的？”美里问道。

Both teens nodded their head in confirmation.  
两个少年都点头确认。

"How? What happened? How did you survive?" Misato continued, curious.  
“怎么？发生了什么事？你是怎么活下来的？”美里好奇地继续说道。

Asuka went on to explain to her guardian what had happened.  
明日香继续向她的监护人解释发生了什么事。


**"**_**It's getting quite a lot lighter and Misato still hasn't come" Asuka commented, annoyed.**_  
“天已经亮了很多了，美里还没来。”明日香恼火地说道。

**"**_**We should trust in her, she has never let us down before" Shinji replied.**_  
“我们应该相信她，她从来没有让我们失望过。”真嗣回答道。

**"**_**I have a feeling our hiding spot won't last much-" she began, before being cut off by the sound of firing.**_  
“我有预感，我们的藏身之处不会持续太久——”她开口说道，然后就被枪声打断了。

_**Both eva pilots jumped a little, but then realised the sound was coming from outside. Asuka rushed out the balcony door to see two dead guards at the entrance to the apartment and another two soldiers running over. The firing started again, this time inside the apartment and both Shinji and Asuka ran to the front door and opened it quietly. Looking out they saw no one, so they snuck out and looked down the staircase where the noise was coming from. They both saw the soldier one level below them, firing down at the staircase.  
两名逃亡飞行员都吓了一跳，但随后意识到声音是从外面传来的。明日香冲出阳台门，看到公寓门口有两名死去的守卫，另外两名士兵也跑了过来。枪声再次响起，这次是在公寓内，真嗣和明日香都跑到前门，悄悄地打开了门。他们向外看去，没有发现任何人，于是他们偷偷溜了出去，顺着发出声音的楼梯往下看去。他们都看到士兵在他们下面一层，正在向楼梯开枪。**_

_**They were confused at the man's actions, but they heard a woman cry out and knew that it must be Misato.  
他们对男人的举动感到困惑，但听到女人的叫声，知道那一定是美里。**_

**"**_**We have to help her Shinji. I'll distract the soldier and you knock him out" Asuka urged.**_  
“我们必须帮助她真嗣。我会分散那个士兵的注意力，然后你把他击倒”明日香催促道。

**"**_**Are you crazy? You'll get killed" Shinji retorted.**_  
“你疯了吗？你会被杀的”真嗣反驳道。

**"**_**There's no way we can get up close to him without him noticing, so I have to distract him" the redhead explained.**_  
“我们不可能在他不注意的情况下靠近他，所以我必须分散他的注意力。”红发解释道。

**"**_**But-" he started, stopping as he saw the young girl begin to move and had no choice but to go through with the plan.**_  
“但是——”他开口说道，当他看到年轻女孩开始移动并别无选择，只能执行计划时停了下来。

_**Pressing his back flat against the wall, Shinji moved along it getting as close to the soldier as possible without him noticing. Asuka purposefully stubbed her toe on the railing of the staircase just opposite where the soldier was, crying out a little. The guard stopped firing down and looked up, bringing his gun up at Asuka, but hesitated at her state of undress. This moment of hesitation allowed Shinji to charge the soldier straight into the wall, his head whacking the brick wall with a loud thud. Shinji then pushed the unconscious soldier down the stairs.  
真嗣将背部平贴在墙上，沿着墙壁移动，尽可能靠近士兵，而他却没有注意到。明日香故意用脚趾撞到了士兵对面楼梯的栏杆上，小声地哭了起来。警卫停止向下射击，抬起头，举起枪瞄准明日香，但对她脱光衣服的样子犹豫不决。这一刻的犹豫让真嗣直接将士兵冲向墙壁，头重重地撞在砖墙上，发出一声巨响。真嗣随后将昏迷不醒的士兵推下了楼梯。**_

_**Both teens stayed where they were, wondering if they were too late, but a moment later shots rang out again and they heard a man cry out in pain. Both eva pilots looked down to see Misato run out of the apartment and two soldiers on the floor, one unconscious, one dead. The two teens then ran back up to their floor and opened their door, which they found unlocked. They went to their rooms to change into some clothes. More shots were heard, but they stopped soon and the two eva pilots exited their front door and went down the stairs.  
两个青少年都呆在原地，想知道自己是否太晚了，但过了一会儿，枪声再次响起，他们听到一名男子痛苦地喊叫。两名逃亡飞行员低头看到美里跑出公寓，两名士兵躺在地板上，一名昏迷不醒，一名死亡。然后，两名青少年跑回自己的楼层，打开门，发现门没有锁。他们回自己的房间换了一些衣服。听到更多的枪声，但他们很快就停了下来，两名逃生飞行员离开前门，走下楼梯。**_

_**When Misato emerged through the front entrance, the two teens stopped at the railing and peered down to see her shoot the unconscious soldier in the head.  
当美里从前门出现时，两个青少年停在栏杆旁，低头一看，发现她朝昏迷不醒的士兵的头部开枪。**_


"Wait a second, why was Asuka naked?" Misato asked. Of course she already knew from the report from Section 2 what had happened, but she just wanted to see the redhead squirm.  
“等一下，明日香为什么赤身裸体？”美里问道。当然，她已经从第二科的报告中知道发生了什么，但她只是想看看红发蠕动的样子。

"I had just had a shower" Asuka lied, interrupting Shinji before he could say anything.  
“我刚洗完澡。”明日香撒了谎，在真嗣说话之前打断了他。

"What, at three in the morning?" Misato questioned skeptically.  
“什么，凌晨三点？”美里疑惑地问道。

"How would you know when we were attacked?" Asuka retorted.  
“你怎么知道我们什么时候遭到袭击？”明日香反驳道。

"Shinji called me, remember?" Misato answered.  
“真嗣给我打过电话，记得吗？”美里回答道。

"Well… I got up early and couldn't go to sleep. After I got out of the shower, Shinji rushed me out the balcony and we climbed down to the lower balcony and the soldier never found us as we hid there" Asuka explained.  
“嗯……我起得很早，睡不着。洗完澡后，真嗣把我从阳台上赶了出去，我们爬到了下面的阳台上，士兵们从来没有发现我们，因为我们躲在那里。”明日香解释道。

"And your towel?" Misato asked.  
“你的毛巾呢？”美里问道。

"I put it back in our apartment" the young girl replied.  
“我把它放回我们的公寓了。”年轻女孩回答道。

Misato smiled cheekily at the redhead, just wanting to see her face when she revealed she already knew what happened. "I already know you two slept together last night, hell it's the reason there were no Section 2 soldiers guarding you. So Shinji, is she as good as she says?" she teased.  
美里对红发女郎厚颜无耻地笑了笑，只是想看看她的脸，这时她透露她已经知道发生了什么事。 “我已经知道你们两个昨晚睡在一起了，这就是为什么没有二科士兵看守你们的原因。所以真嗣，她真像她说的那么好吗？”她取笑道。

Asuka blushed slightly. "Don't say _anything_ Shinji" she warned.  
明日香微微脸红。 “真嗣，什么都别说。”她警告道。

The boy wisely kept his mouth shut as Misato giggled at Asuka's face. Deciding she had had enough fun, The Major stopped and focused back on the task at hand. "Well it's not important, you two need to get back to NERV immediately. Unfortunately, we don't have any means of transport so we will have to go by foot" Misato explained.  
当美里对着明日香咯咯地笑时，男孩明智地闭上了嘴。少校觉得自己已经玩够了，于是停下来，重新专注于手头的任务。 “好吧，这不重要，你们两个需要立即返回NERV。不幸的是，我们没有任何交通工具，所以我们只能步行去。”美里解释道。

"Are you sure you can make it Misato?" Shinji asked, worried.  
“美里，你确定你能做到吗？”慎二担心地问道。

"I'll be fine" the Major replied, smiling at the boy.  
“我会没事的”少校回答道，对男孩微笑。

"Let's go already" Asuka urged impatiently. The redhead had just about enough of waiting and was quite eager to get into her evangelion.  
“我们走吧。”明日香不耐烦地催促道。红发女郎已经等得够多了，她非常渴望进入她的新世纪福音战士。

The three hurriedly exited the apartment and began to move. The two eva pilots followed Misato as she led them. Making their way through the abandoned city, they were soon forced to stop as a certain redhead needed to go to the toilet.  
三人急忙出了公寓，开始行动。两名EVA飞行员跟随在美里的带领下。穿过这座废弃的城市，他们很快就被迫停下来，因为某个红头发的人要去厕所。

"Can't you just hold it in Asuka?" Misato remarked.  
“你就不能把它抱在明日香身上吗？”美里说道。

"I have been! I'm just about ready to burst, I have to go!" Asuka refuted, jumping up and down.  
“我去过了！我都快要爆炸了，我得走了！”明日香跳上跳下地反驳道。

"Just do it here, what if you get into trouble or we are suddenly attacked? It's just Misato and I" the boy advised.  
“就在这里做吧，万一遇到麻烦或者我们突然遭到袭击怎么办？只有我和美里。”男孩建议道。

"What, have you got some golden shower fetish? You are not watching me pee!" the redhead snapped, storming off.  
“什么，你有什么金色沐浴癖吗？你没有看我撒尿！”红头发的人怒气冲冲地走了。

"That's not what I meant…" Shinji replied, trailing off as he realised she was already gone.  
“我不是这个意思……”真嗣回答道，当他意识到她已经走了之后，声音逐渐减弱。

"So Shinji, how'd last night go?" Misato asked teasingly.  
“真嗣，昨晚过得怎么样？”美里戏谑地问道。

"Well, it was… good" he answered shyly, scratching his head.  
“嗯，这……很好，”他挠着头害羞地回答。

"Glad to hear it, I guess all your hard work did pay off" Misato remarked.  
“很高兴听到这个消息，我想你所有的努力都得到了回报”美里说道。

"It wasn't just my hard work, you and Kaji helped me and technically… Aria as well. I couldn't have done it alone" Shinji replied.  
“这不仅仅是我的努力，你和加持也帮助了我，技术上……还有阿莉亚。我一个人是做不到的。”真嗣回答道。

"Even so, anyone else would have given up. I personally saw how difficult Asuka was. How did you manage to keep going?" the older woman asked.  
“即便如此，别人也会放弃的。我亲眼目睹了明日香的艰难。你是怎么坚持下来的？”老妇人问道。

"Well, you know what they say. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone. But it takes a lifetime to forget someone" Shinji answered.  
“好吧，你知道他们说什么。迷恋一个人只需要一分钟，喜欢一个人需要一个小时，爱一个人需要一天。但忘记一个人却需要一生。”真嗣回答道。

"I know what you mean" Misato concurred.  
“我知道你的意思。”美里附和道。

The two stayed quiet until the redhead returned. Upon Asuka's return, the trio started moving with Misato in the lead again. At one point, they started to veer away from NERV and the two pilots were confused at Misato's directions; the two teens thought that perhaps maybe in her current state, the Major was confusing the way to NERV.  
两人一直沉默着，直到红发回来。明日香回来后，三人再次开始移动，美里再次领先。有一次，他们开始偏离 NERV，两名飞行员对美里的指示感到困惑；两个少年心想，也许以她现在的状态，少校正在混淆通往NERV的道路。

"Misato, we're going the wrong way" Asuka remarked disdainfully.  
“美里，我们走错路了。”明日香轻蔑地说道。

"No we're not, we still have to-" Misato began, but the two children were unable to hear the rest as jets flew over their heads.  
“不，我们不是，我们仍然必须——”美里开口说道，但是当喷气式飞机从他们头顶上飞过时，两个孩子听不到剩下的声音。

"Shit! They're sending in reinforcements!" Misato exclaimed in horror.  
“妈的！他们要派援军了！”美里惊恐地叫道。

Moments later, bombs were dropped all over the city and the trio had to dive for cover. Hiding under some debris, the explosions missed them by sheer inches. Thankfully, after a few minutes the bombing stopped and the trio got out from under the rubble to see what was going on. What they saw made all their stomachs sink. Hundreds of JSSDF soldiers were being deployed in Tokyo-3, ready to infiltrate NERV.  
片刻之后，炸弹遍布整个城市，三人不得不潜水寻找掩护。隐藏在一些碎片下，爆炸与他们仅差几英寸。值得庆幸的是，几分钟后爆炸停止了，三人从废墟下爬出来看看发生了什么事。看到的一幕，让他们的胃都沉了下去。数百名日本自卫队士兵被部署在第三东京，准备渗透到 NERV。

"Shit we don't have any time left, we must go straight to NERV now!" Misato shouted as she picked up the two teens and pushed them forward.  
“妈的，时间不多了，我们现在必须直奔NERV！”美里大喊一声，抱起两个少年，推着他们往前走。

The trio ran for their lives, adrenalin pumping through their veins and their breathing quick and panicked. Their hearts were pounding against their chests. There were soldiers coming from all directions and they narrowly avoided getting hit by a rain of bullets. It was only a matter of time though, the three roommates were tiring and the soldiers were getting a gain on them; there were only so many times they could lose the soldiers in the debris. The trio looked in dismay as they ran out onto a plaza with absolutely no cover. All three of them ran as hard as they could, trying to make it to the building on the other side of the clearing.  
三人拼命逃命，肾上腺素在血管中涌动，呼吸急促而惊慌。他们的心在胸口狂跳。士兵们从四面八方涌来，险些被枪林弹雨击中。但这只是时间问题，三个室友很累，而士兵们正在追赶他们；他们只有那么多次才能在废墟中失去士兵。三人一脸惊愕地跑到了一个完全没有掩体的广场上。三人拼命奔跑，试图跑到空地另一边的大楼。

Their hearts sank as they heard the soldiers shout an order to fire; they were done for and they had been so close too. The sound of several machine guns firing went off and a hail of bullets were shot in the direction of the three escapees. In the final milliseconds before the bullets reached them, Misato moved behind the two children making sure to give them cover. She prayed that Shinji and Asuka would be safe, just before she received several bullets in the back and fell to the ground lifeless, covered in bullet wounds. The two teens had run on and made it behind the building just in time before the next hail of bullets.  
当他们听到士兵们高喊开枪的命令时，他们的心沉了下去；他们完蛋了，而且他们也曾如此接近。几挺机枪开火的声音响起，弹雨向三名逃亡者的方向射来。在子弹到达他们之前的最后几毫秒，美里走到两个孩子身后，确保给他们提供掩护。她祈祷着真嗣和明日香能够平安，就在她背部中了几枪，浑身是枪伤倒在地上毫无生气的时候。两名青少年在下一场枪林弹雨之前及时跑到了大楼后面。

The moment the two eva pilots had heard the sickening sound of bullets hitting their guardian, they knew she had fallen. Losing any strength he had left, Shinji collapsed to the floor and began to cry. Misato was gone forever and he just couldn't cope with the shock; the people he cared about always got hurt. Sobs racked through his body as Asuka tried to get him up, but she couldn't find the strength anymore; Misato's death had impacted her just as heavily and besides, they really had no chance of running from the soldiers now anyway. They heard the soldier's footsteps coming closer and Asuka went down and embraced the boy, tears flowing down her cheeks, both teens ready to die.  
当两名EVA飞行员听到子弹击中他们的监护人发出的令人作呕的声音时，他们知道她已经倒下了。真嗣失去了所有的力气，倒在地上开始哭泣。美里已经永远消失了，他无法应对这种震惊。他关心的人总是受到伤害。当明日香试图把他扶起来时，抽泣声席卷了他的全身，但她再也找不到力气了。美里的死对她的打击同样沉重，而且，他们现在无论如何也没有机会逃离士兵们了。他们听到士兵的脚步声越来越近，明日香走下来拥抱了男孩，泪水从她的脸颊上流下来，两个孩子都做好了赴死的准备。

After a moment, the soldier's footsteps were right next to them and both teens closed their eyes, awaiting their death.  
过了一会儿，士兵的脚步声就在他们身边，两个少年都闭上了眼睛，等待着死亡。

"I'm coming mama" Asuka whispered quietly.  
“妈妈，我来了。”明日香低声说道。

The soldiers stopped, aimed their guns and fired.  
士兵们停下来，举枪瞄准并开火。

### Chapter 22: Survival
A man with a ponytail and unshaven beard entered the Commander's office. Despite the battle that had erupted, the head of NERV seemed extraordinarily calm. With almost nothing to counterattack with, the pilots not having been returned yet and the other alternative not even guaranteed to work, the younger man could not understand the Commander's lack of any emotion.  
一个扎着马尾辫、胡子拉碴的男人走进了指挥官办公室。尽管战斗已经爆发，NERV的团长却显得异常平静。由于几乎没有什么可以反击的东西，飞行员还没有回来，而另一种选择甚至不能保证起作用，年轻人无法理解指挥官没有任何情绪。

Approaching the desk, the spy was given the Commander's usual impassive stare. Kaji stood there apprehensively before addressing Commander Ikari.  
当间谍走近办公桌时，指挥官一如既往地冷漠地注视着他。加治忐忑不安地站在那里，对碇司令说道。

"Commander" Kaji announced, saluting.  
“指挥官”梶行礼宣布。

"For what purpose have you arrived here?" the Commander asked.  
“你来这里的目的是什么？”指挥官问道。

"The elevator has been repaired, I wish to go to the surface and help Major Misato Katsuragi in acquiring the pilots" the younger man explained.  
“电梯已经修好了，我想去地面帮助葛城美里少校招募飞行员。”年轻人解释道。

"Permission granted, provided that the task I appointed you is finished" the Commander stated.  
“允许，前提是完成我指派给你的任务。”指挥官说道。

"Of course sir" Kaji replied, bowing.  
“当然，先生。”梶鞠躬回答道。

The spy left the gloomy Commander's office in a hurry, wishing to help Misato as he had originally wanted to.  
间谍匆匆离开了阴沉的司令官办公室，想要如愿帮助美里。

In the rubble of the once proud Tokyo-3, the two eva pilots awaited their inevitable death. Both of them had tears flowing down their cheeks; their guardian had just sacrificed herself for them. Despite Asuka never giving up, she just couldn't find it within herself to leave the crying boy behind and instead chose to comfort him in their final moments.  
在曾经引以为豪的东京三号的废墟中，两名 eva 飞行员等待着不可避免的死亡。两人的脸上都流下了泪水。他们的守护者刚刚为他们牺牲了自己。尽管明日香从未放弃，但她就是无法摆脱哭泣的男孩，而是选择在最后时刻安慰他。

"I'm coming mama" Asuka whispered quietly.  
“妈妈，我来了。”明日香低声说道。

The soldiers stopped, aimed their guns and fired.  
士兵们停下来，举枪瞄准并开火。

The two teens waited for the impact, but it never came. Surprised, they opened their eyes to see the shocked faces of the soldiers. On the floor lay several hundred bullets, all smashed as if having hit some solid wall. The two pilots were utterly confused; those bullets should have passed through their flesh and killed them, what in the world had happened? The order was soon given to fire again and the two pilots watched in amazement as the bullets hit a series of octagons, bouncing off the forcefield harmlessly; it was an AT-Field.  
两个青少年等待着冲击，但它从未到来。他们惊讶地睁开眼睛，看到士兵们一脸震惊的表情。地板上躺着数百颗子弹，全部碎裂，仿佛击中了坚固的墙壁。两名飞行员完全困惑了。那些子弹应该穿过他们的肉，杀死他们，到底发生了什么？很快就下达了再次开火的命令，两名飞行员惊讶地看着子弹击中一系列八边形，从力场上弹回来，没有造成任何伤害；这是一个 AT-Field。

_'It can't be…?'_ Shinji thought, looking around.  
“这不可能是……？”慎二一边想着，一边环顾四周。

The boy soon spotted the albino blue-haired girl also known as Rei. It would seem she had erected her AT-Field to protect the two pilots.  
男孩很快就发现了那个白化病蓝发女孩，也叫丽。看来她建立了 AT-Field 来保护两名飞行员。

"Rei!" Shinji called out.  
“瑞！”真嗣叫道。

Hearing his shout, the redhead looked over to see the blue-haired girl standing close to them. Both wondered why they hadn't seen her before, but it didn't matter. Suddenly, they realised that when they thought Misato had veered off from NERV, they were heading in the direction of Rei's apartment.  
听到他的喊声，红发回头一看，就看到站在他们身边的蓝发少女。两人都奇怪为什么之前没有见过她，但这并不重要。突然，他们意识到，当他们以为美里已经偏离NERV时，他们正朝着丽公寓的方向前进。

"Shinji and Pilot Sohryu, we must leave immediately. We are required at NERV to pilot the evangelions" Rei declared.  
“真嗣和飞行员苍龙，我们必须立即离开。NERV要求我们驾驶新世纪福音战士。”丽宣布道。

Shinji was about to protest, but was pulled off the ground by Asuka.  
真嗣正要抗议，却被明日香拉离了地面。

"Now's not the time to get all depressed Shinji, don't make Misato's death be in vain" Asuka said sternly.  
“现在不是真嗣郁闷的时候，别让美里白白死了。”明日香严肃地说道。

The boy looked at Asuka and nodded his head in agreement. The confused soldiers started throwing grenades, wondering what on earth was preventing them from killing the pilots. The explosions could be felt even though it was blocked by the AT-Field.  
少年看着明日香，点点头表示同意。困惑的士兵开始投掷手榴弹，想知道到底是什么阻止了他们杀死飞行员。即使被AT力场挡住，也能感受到爆炸声。

"Hurry and take my hands to stay under my protection while we run, my barrier can only withstand a certain amount of punishment" Rei declared, whilst holding out her hands.  
“赶紧拉住我的手，保护好我的奔跑，我的结界只能承受一定的惩罚。”丽伸出双手说道。

Asuka pulled Shinji next to Rei and put his hand in Rei's and grabbed Rei's other hand. The three eva pilots started running off again to NERV. The soldiers started chasing them again, firing at them, but found they could not pierce the forcefield that protected the children. As the three children ran through ruins and debris, they noticed some aircraft flying through the air as well as tanks and battleships assaulting NERV.  
明日香把真嗣拉到丽身边，将他的手放在丽的手上，抓住丽的另一只手。三名 eva 飞行员再次开始飞往 NERV。士兵们又开始追赶他们，向他们开枪，但发现他们无法刺穿保护孩子们的力场。当三个孩子穿过废墟和瓦砾时，他们注意到空中飞过一些飞机，还有攻击NERV的坦克和战列舰。

"At this rate, NERV will be destroyed before we even get into our evangelions" Asuka remarked out loud.  
“照这样下去，在我们进入新世纪福音战士之前，NERV就会被摧毁”明日香大声说道。

"That is why we must hurry, it is most unfortunate that I was unable to arrive earlier to save the Major, but we must still try" Rei replied.  
“所以我们必须抓紧时间，很遗憾我没能早点到达救少校，但我们还是要努力。”雷回答道。

"…'Most unfortunate?' is that all it was?" Shinji shot back angry.  
“……‘最不幸？’就是这样吗？”真嗣愤怒地回击。

"Shinji I am truly sorry, I tried as best I could" Rei apologised, a little hurt at his words.  
“真嗣，真的很抱歉，我已经尽力了。”丽抱歉地说，他的话让他有点受伤。

"Well, what took you so long?" Asuka asked.  
“嗯，什么事花了这么长时间？”明日香问道。

"Some soldiers came to my apartment to kill me. Fortunately, I awoke before they got to my room. I quickly opened my window to try and escape and began to climb down. However, as I was climbing down, I accidentally slipped and fell, hitting my head as I landed in a dumpster" Rei explained.  
“一些士兵来到我的公寓要杀我。幸运的是，我在他们到达我的房间之前就醒了。我赶紧打开窗户试图逃跑，并开始往下爬。然而，当我往下爬时，我不小心滑倒了。” ，当我掉进垃圾箱时撞到了我的头”Rei 解释道。

Shinji and Asuka stayed quiet, they had both forgotten about Rei. She was a pilot too after all, so the soldiers would have gone after her as well. They knew they didn't have the right to put the blame of Misato's death on Rei, she was unconscious all that time. It was even lucky that she had just managed to save them. The three continued running on in silence, with soldiers hot on their tail.  
真嗣和明日香保持沉默，他们都忘记了丽。她毕竟也是一名飞行员，所以士兵们也会追捕她。他们知道他们没有权利将美里的死归咎于丽，她一直昏迷不醒。更庆幸的是，她刚刚才救了他们。三人继续默默地奔跑，士兵们紧追不舍。

A nearby explosion caused a shockwave to ripple through the ground and the three pilots lost their footing momentarily. Fortunately, the soldiers hadn't fared any better as many of them lay sprawled on the floor. As there was a whole bunch of soldiers chasing the pilots, if even one of them had tripped, many others would have fallen over too. The pursuers were having trouble getting up and the soldiers that got up, tripped over their comrades still on the ground. The three pilots easily managed to get back on track and continued on to NERV, which was very close now.  
附近的爆炸引起了地面的冲击波，三名飞行员瞬间失去了立足点。幸运的是，士兵们的情况也没有好转，他们中的许多人都躺在地板上。因为有一大群士兵在追赶飞行员，只要其中一个被绊倒，其他人就会摔倒。追赶者很难站起来，而站起来的士兵却被仍在地上的战友绊倒了。三名飞行员轻松地回到了轨道并继续前往 NERV，此时距离已经非常近了。

"Wait a second, we never asked Misato why it took her so long to get to us. There must have been something that held her up, what's to say we'll even be able to get into NERV?" Asuka announced, suddenly anxious.  
“等一下，我们从来没有问过美里为什么这么久才来找我们。一定是有什么东西阻碍了她，也就是说我们甚至能够进入NERV？”明日香突然焦急地说道。

"We'll just have to find out" Shinji remarked.  
“我们只需找出答案即可。”真嗣说道。

The three eva pilots soon made it to the entrance of NERV and ran inside, only to see Kaji running in the opposite direction and stop. The man instantly turned around to greet the children.  
三名eva飞行员很快就到了NERV的入口并跑了进去，却看到加持朝相反的方向跑并停了下来。男人立即转身向孩子们打招呼。

"Yo there you guys are. Where's Misato?" the older man asked.  
“哟，你们来了。美里在哪儿？”老者问道。

"No time to explain, we need to get into NERV before the soldiers come!" Asuka shouted at Kaji.  
“没时间解释了，我们得在士兵到来之前进入NERV！”明日香对加持喊道。

Kaji quickly went back and motioned with his arm to follow them. "There's only one remaining elevator that works, we managed to fix it just in time you see" he said, leading the three eva pilots back to where he came from.  
梶很快就回去了，并示意他跟上他们。 “只剩下一架电梯可以用，你看，我们及时修复了它，”他说，带着三名逃生飞行员回到了他来的地方。

"The elevators were broken?" Shinji asked.  
“电梯坏了？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah, the entire elevator system completely collapsed in the middle of the night. We suspect there was someone working for Seele here, but that's not relevant now anyway. Luckily, whoever it was did a shoddy job on one of the elevators and we were able to fix it. Misato however had to go by foot, it must have taken her a while to get to the surface" Kaji explained.  
“是啊，整个电梯系统在半夜彻底崩溃了。我们怀疑有人在这里为Seele工作，但现在已经不重要了。幸运的是，无论是谁在其中一部电梯上做了一些粗制滥造的工作，我们才被救了。”能够修复它，但是必须步行，她一定花了一段时间才能到达地面”Kaji 解释道。

The eva pilots now understood why Misato was so late. Soon they were greeted by the sight of the salvaged elevator and they charged into it. Kaji quickly pressed the floor number for the eva cages and pressed the close door button. Interestingly as the elevator doors closed, they didn't see any soldiers running in; the soldiers must have taken a long time to get back on track and lost the pilots.  
EVA 飞行员现在明白了美里为何迟到了。很快，他们就看到了被抢救的电梯，于是他们冲了进去。梶迅速按下了逃生笼的楼层号码，然后按下了关门按钮。有趣的是，当电梯门关闭时，他们并没有看到任何士兵跑进来；士兵们一定花了很长时间才回到正轨并失去了飞行员。

"So how come you didn't come with Misato?" Shinji asked.  
“那你怎么没和美里一起来？”真嗣问道。

"The Commander wanted me to do something for him, but that's not important right now. Where is Misato? She must have come and gotten you guys" Kaji questioned anxiously.  
“指挥官想让我帮他做点什么，不过现在这并不重要。美里在哪里？她肯定是来接你们的。”梶焦急地问道。

"Yeah, she did… she…" Shinji trailed off, his eyes watering again. He just couldn't bring himself to say it; it was too painful.  
“是的，她做到了……她……”真嗣的声音渐渐减弱，他的眼睛又流下了泪水。他只是无法让自己说出这句话；太痛苦了。

"What happened to her?" Kaji asked with a serious tone.  
“她怎么了？”梶用严肃的语气问道。

All was silent save for the sound of the elevator descending. Asuka averted her eyes, unable to meet his gaze. The redhead was about to speak when Rei spoke instead.  
周围一片寂静，只有电梯下降的声音。明日香转开视线，不敢正视他的目光。红发正要说话，雷却开口了。

"She is dead" Rei stated bluntly.  
“她死了。”雷直言不讳。

At once, Kaji's face fell at hearing Rei's words and Asuka punched the elevator wall. "She damn protected us from a volley of machine gun fire! She didn't have to go and be all heroic" Asuka snapped angrily, tears starting to form in her eyes.  
听到丽的话，梶的脸立刻沉了下来，明日香则一拳打在电梯壁上。 “她该死的保护我们免受机关枪的齐射！她不必表现得英勇”明日香愤怒地说道，泪水开始在她的眼中涌出。

"So, there's no chance? She's definitely gone?" the spy asked, his voice shaking a little.  
“这么说，就没有机会了？她肯定已经走了吗？”间谍问道，声音有些颤抖。

"We were… facing the other way when it happened because we were trying to run from the soldiers. After they fired… we heard the bullets hit her and her body hitting the ground" Asuka explained.  
“事情发生时，我们……面朝另一个方向，因为我们试图逃离士兵。他们开枪后……我们听到子弹击中了她，她的身体撞到了地面，”明日香解释道。

The older man's face hardened as he digested the news. The spy stood still and calm, but inside he was burning with anger and grief. _'It can't be… if only I had gone with her…'_ Kaji thought. The older man wanted nothing more than to get revenge on the men who killed Misato, but his legs felt extremely weak. He fought the urge to cry, surely it was just as hard on the children and they needed an adult figure to support them at the moment. Kaji was surprised to see both Shinji and Asuka come and embrace him tenderly. He couldn't hold in his emotions any longer and let the tears fall. Kaji held the two teens closer to him as he cried silently.  
消化完这个消息后，老者的脸色变得凝重起来。间谍静静地站着，冷静，但内心却燃烧着愤怒和悲伤。 “这不可能……要是我和她一起走就好了……”加持想。年长者一心只想向杀害美里的人报仇，但他的双腿却感觉极其无力。他忍住了想哭的冲动，当然这对孩子们来说同样很难受，他们现在需要一个成年人的陪伴。梶惊讶地看到真嗣和明日香都过来温柔地拥抱他。他再也无法抑制自己的情绪，泪水夺眶而出。加治将两个青少年抱得更近，默默地哭泣。

The elevator rocked as the bombing on NERV continued increasingly and Asuka moved off Kaji. "We really need something to hold them off, by the time we get to the eva cages and get our evas ready there will be no NERV! Not to mention the soldiers might have already infiltrated NERV and are making their way down an elevator shaft or something" Asuka remarked.  
随着 NERV 上的轰炸愈演愈烈，电梯开始摇晃，明日香离开了梶。 “我们真的需要一些东西来阻止他们，当我们到达 eva 笼子并准备好我们的 evas 时，就不会出现 NERV 了！更不用说这些士兵可能已经渗透到 NERV 中，并正在沿着电梯井或某事”明日香说道。

"Well luckily we have one thing up our sleeve, it should be ready soon" Kaji replied, wiping the tears from his eyes.  
“幸好我们还有一件事，应该很快就能准备好。”梶一边回答，一边擦掉眼角的泪水。

"What are you talking about?" Asuka asked, curious.  
“你在说什么？”明日香好奇地问道。

The elevator came to a stop and the doors opened to the eva cages.  
电梯停了下来，通向逃生笼的门打开了。

"You three get to your evas now! NERV needs your three evangelions fighting, we'll keep the soldiers at bay, you just protect NERV" the older man directed, running off to the command bridge.  
“你们三个现在就去你们的evas吧！NERV需要你们的三个新世纪福音战士战斗，我们会阻止士兵，你只需要保护NERV”年长者指示道，跑向指挥桥。

Shinji just slumped to the floor, it seemed he had lost all motivation to fight anymore. The redhead pulled Shinji up from the floor and whacked him on the head lightly.  
真嗣瘫倒在地，似乎已经失去了战斗的动力。红发将真嗣从地上拉起来，轻轻敲打他的头。

"Come on Shinji, you can't be crying at a time like this. We have to go pilot our evangelions, this is the final battle for humanity" Asuka said to the depressed boy.  
“来吧，真嗣，你不能在这种时候哭。我们必须去驾驶我们的新世纪福音战士，这是人类的最后一战。”明日香对沮丧​​的男孩说道。

"But Misato's gone and how can we win against nine other evas with just three?" he replied wearily.  
「可是美里走了，我们凭着三个人怎么能赢九个eva呢？」他疲倦地回答道。

"Come on Shinji, where's your perseverance? Surely the invincible Shinji can't lose" the redhead encouraged, slightly irritated.  
“加油真嗣，你的毅力呢？无敌的真嗣一定不会输的。”红发鼓励道，有些恼火。

"The Major died saving you Shinji, surely she wished for you to end this battle" Rei added.  
“少校为了救你真嗣而死，她当然希望你结束这场战斗。”丽补充道。

"I just don't have the strength anymore…" the boy said, trailing off.  
“我只是没有力气了……”男孩的声音渐渐减弱。

"Stop being such a whiny baby! How do you think I felt when I thought you were dead?" Asuka snapped angrily.  
“别再像个爱发牢骚的孩子了！你觉得当我以为你死了的时候我会有什么感觉？”明日香愤怒地吼道。

The boy simply remained silent. Asuka picked him up by the cuff off his shirt, but the boy looked away from her. Annoyed, Asuka pushed him away.  
男孩只是保持沉默。明日香抓住他衬衫的袖口将他抱起来，但男孩却把目光移开。明日香生气地推开了他。

"Fine, be that way. I can handle this myself anyway, I don't need anyone!" Asuka shouted, storming off.  
“好吧，就这样吧，反正我自己就能搞定，不需要任何人！”明日香大喊一声，转身就走。

The blue-haired girl looked at the retreating redhead worried, before turning to face back at Shinji.  
蓝发少女担忧地看着远去的红发，然后转头看向真嗣。

"Pilot Sohryu is right Shinji, don't let all your effort be for nothing" Rei said quietly, before moving off in the direction that Asuka had.  
“飞行员苍龙说得对，真嗣，别让你的努力白费了。”丽轻声说道，然后朝明日香所在的方向走去。

The young boy hugged his knees to his chest, sobbing quietly. _'Why Misato, why did you have to die… what am I supposed to do now…?'_ he thought.  
少年将膝盖抱在胸前，低声抽泣。 “为什么美里，为什么你必须死……我现在该怎么办……？”他以为。

Shinji couldn't stand it, his mother dead, Aria dead, Misato dead, all those people dying in this battle. He didn't want anyone else to die; he wanted this destruction to stop. But to fight he would have to kill more people. The boy couldn't stand his indecisiveness, he needed to do something now; he needed to make a choice. He thought about the past two weeks and how it had been spent trying to get Asuka to be his; he couldn't just let it all go to waste. Misato had died for him; everyone he cared about was depending on him.  
真嗣无法忍受，他的母亲死了，亚莉亚死了，美里死了，所有这些人都死在了这场战斗中。他不想让其他人死去；他希望这种破坏能够停止。但要战斗，他就必须杀死更多的人。男孩无法忍受自己的优柔寡断，他现在需要做点什么；他需要做出选择。他回想起过去的两周，以及他是如何努力让明日香成为他的人的；他不能让这一切白白浪费掉。美里为他而死；他关心的每个人都依赖他。

_'Asuka will die… two against nine isn't very good odds, what should I do…? I love Asuka, I should… no I must protect Asuka, she needs me, the others need me… I need to fight!'  
“明日香会死……二对九的赔率不太好，我该怎么办……？”我爱明日香，我应该……不，我必须保护明日香，她需要我，其他人也需要我……我需要战斗！_

Shinji got up, standing up unsteadily. Tears had dried up on his cheeks, his clothes were ragged and dirty and he looked like he was about to have a nervous breakdown. It seemed like such a cruel joke that the fate of the world rested on him. Finding the resolve within himself, the boy ran ahead as fast as he could; he needed to reach Asuka. Running ahead, he soon passed Rei who looked on after him in shock before smiling slightly. Reaching the redhead, he ran up to her and embraced her from behind, surprising her.  
慎二起身，摇摇晃晃地站了起来。他脸颊上的泪水已经干涸，衣服又破又脏，看起来精神快要崩溃了。这似乎是一个残酷的玩笑，世界的命运都落在了他的身上。男孩找到了自己的决心，以最快的速度向前奔跑。他需要联系明日香。跑在前面，很快就超越了雷，雷一脸震惊地看着他，然后微微一笑。他走到红发女郎身边，跑到她身边，从后面抱住她，让她大吃一惊。

Asuka turned her head slightly to see that Shinji was currently holding her, at that instant her heart warmed.  
明日香微微转过头，看到真嗣正抱着她，那一瞬间她的心一暖。

"Asuka, I know I'm stupid sometimes but I know that you'll die if I don't fight. I love you Asuka, I've always loved you… I can't just let you die…" he declared, fighting back the tears; he had already cried enough.  
“明日香，我知道我有时很愚蠢，但我知道如果我不战斗，你就会死。我爱你，明日香，我一直爱你……我不能让你死……”他宣称，忍住眼泪；他已经哭够了。

"Baka… I've always loved myself too" the redhead replied playfully.  
“巴卡……我也一直很爱自己。”红发俏皮地回答道。

Shinji couldn't help smiling at that comment. Turning around, the redhead looked into his eyes. "Who said I would die anyway? Surely us two can beat anything that hits us" she said, returning his embrace.  
听到这句话，真嗣忍不住笑了。红发转过身来，看着他的眼睛。 “谁说我无论如何都会死？我们两个当然可以打败任何袭击我们的东西，”她说，回应了他的拥抱。

The boy moved his face down to hers, kissing her gently. The girl returned his kiss, holding the boy tightly. After parting, the redhead smiled cheekily up at the boy.  
男孩把脸凑到她的面前，温柔地吻着她。女孩回应了他的吻，紧紧地抱住了男孩。告别后，红发女郎抬头对男孩露出厚颜无耻的微笑。

"If you survive this… I promise you I will give you a good time" she professed, blushing slightly, before flicking him on the forehead.  
“如果你能活下来……我向你保证，我会给你一个美好的时光。”她承认道，脸微微红了，然后拍了拍他的额头。

The boy just looked at her shocked as she averted her gaze. At that moment, Rei came up to them and took Shinji's arm.  
男孩只是震惊地看着她，而她却移开了视线。就在这时，丽走到他们面前，握住了真嗣的手臂。

"Let's go Shinji" the blue-haired girl remarked.  
蓝发少女说道：“真嗣，我们走吧。”

Asuka went and took Shinji's other arm and the three walked on to the eva cages together, temporarily forgetting their problems.  
明日香走过去，挽起真嗣的另一只手臂，三人一起走向逃生笼，暂时忘记了自己的问题。

"How's the situation?" Kaji asked the blonde scientist.  
“情况怎么样？”加治向金发科学家问道。

"Well, I managed to stop Seele hacking the Magi by installing a type-666 firewall. Unfortunately, all our arsenals on the surface have been completely wiped out, not to mention they have breached several armour layers. It would seem soldiers have already infiltrated NERV too" Ritsuko answered.  
“嗯，我安装了666型防火墙，成功阻止了希儿对魔法师的攻击。不幸的是，我们地表的武器库已经全部被消灭，更不用说还突破了好几层装甲，看来士兵已经渗透进来了。” NERV也是”律子回答道。

"Thankfully the children have arrived safely, they're already at the eva cages" Kaji replied, trying to give some hope.  
“值得庆幸的是，孩子们已经安全抵达，他们已经在逃生笼了。”卡吉回答道，试图给人们带来一些希望。

"Alas unfortunately someone has released the Bakelite, the evas are stuck in the solidified liquid, the children have no way of piloting them" Ritsuko revealed.  
“不幸的是，有人释放了电木，EVA 被困在凝固的液体中，孩子们无法驾驶它们”，Ritsuko 透露。

"You gotta be kidding! Misato died for nothing!" Kaji snapped angrily, slamming his fist against the wall.  
“你开玩笑吧！美里白白死了！”嘉吉愤怒地用拳头猛击墙壁。

"Misato's dead?" the doctor asked, shocked.  
“美里死了？”医生震惊地问道。

The spy nodded and Ritsuko hung her head, unable to believe that one of her best friends was now gone.  
间谍点点头，律子低下头，不敢相信她最好的朋友之一现在已经走了。

"What about U3?" he asked.  
“那U3呢？”他问。

"Luckily it was activated before the Bakelite was released, it is making its way up to the surface right now. At least he can destroy all the aircraft and artillery. We still have the problem of the nine mass production evas though, so it's only prolonging our defeat really" she remarked wearily.  
“幸好在电木被释放之前就被激活了，现在正在向地面移动。至少他可以摧毁所有的飞机和火炮。不过我们仍然面临着九架量产eva的问题，所以这只是确实延长了我们的失败”她疲倦地说道。

"God damn it! Was my protection even necessary then? I should have just gone with Misato…" he said, slumping down on a chair.  
“该死的！那时我的保护还有必要吗？我应该和美里一起走……”他说着，瘫倒在椅子上。

"Well, there is a small chance the nine mass production evas are that much worse than a real evangelion" Ritsuko suggested optimistically.  
“嗯，九个量产EVA比真正的新世纪福音战士差很多的可能性很小。”律子乐观地建议道。

"What kind of world is this where our wars have to be fought by children…?" Kaji replied, trailing off.  
“这是一个什么样的世界，我们的战争必须由孩子们来打……？”梶回答道，声音逐渐减弱。

---

The three children stared up at their evas in shock. The evangelions were all stuck in solid Bakelite; they had no way to enter their evas.  
三个孩子震惊地抬头看着他们的eva。新世纪福音战士都被困在坚固的酚醛塑料中；他们无法进入他们的eva。

"What is this, some kind of joke? What are we supposed to do now?" Asuka declared, annoyed.  
“这是什么玩笑？我们现在该怎么办？”明日香恼怒地宣称。

Ritsuko's voice came on over the P.A. "Someone released the Bakelite before you guys arrived"  
广播里传来律子的声音。 “在你们到达之前有人释放了电木”

"What are we supposed to do then?" the redhead shouted angrily.  
“那我们该怎么办？”红发人愤怒的喊道。

"There's nothing you can do at the moment except survive" Ritsuko replied.  
“现在除了活下去，你什么也做不了。”律子回答道。

"What? What about NERV? We will all die anyway if someone doesn't take out the JSSDF" the redhead shouted again.  
“什么？NERV怎么办？如果不干掉JSDF，我们都会死。”红发再次喊道。

"We have already sent up someone to deal with them" Ritsuko replied.  
“我们已经派人去对付他们了。”律子回答道。

"Who?" Asuka asked. “WHO？”明日香问道。

"Touji Suzuhara reporting, I have made it to the surface" Touji announced.  
“铃原东次报告，我已经到达地面了。”东次宣布。

"Proceed to destroy all JSSDF forces" Ritsuko ordered.  
“继续消灭所有自卫队部队”律子下令道。

"Hai" Touji replied. “嗨”东二回应道。

"What? That dumb jock? What's he doing in an eva?" Asuka asked, clearly confused.  
“什么？那个愚蠢的运动员？他穿着伊娃在做什么？”明日香显然很困惑地问道。

"We fixed Unit 03 and escorted the fourth child to NERV last night just before the elevators collapsed. Kaji was assigned to guard the fourth child, while we got Unit 03 ready. Since Unit 03 wasn't up at the eva cages where the other evangelions were and we had to configure the unit for Touji and make sure nothing would go wrong, it took a long time. We finally activated Unit 03 and sent the fourth child to the surface, knowing that the armour of an evangelion can easily withstand the JSSDF assault. He will destroy all their forces still above NERV" Ritsuko explained.  
“昨晚，就在电梯倒塌之前，我们修复了 03 号机组并护送第四个孩子前往 NERV。卡吉被指派看守第四个孩子，而我们则准备好 03 号机组。由于 03 号机组没有在逃生笼中，其他人在那里evangelions 是，我们必须为 Touji 配置该装置并确保不会出现任何问题，花了很长时间我们终于激活了 03 号装置并将第四个孩子送到了地面，因为我们知道 evangelions 的装甲可以轻松承受。 JSSDF的攻击。他将摧毁所有仍在NERV之上的部队”Ritsuko解释道。

"What about the nine mass production evas?" Asuka continued.  
“那九个量产eva呢？”明日香继续说道。

"That is the problem we face" Ristuko replied.  
“这就是我们面临的问题”，里斯图科回答道。

"Dammit, all that was for nothing!" Asuka let out, punching the wall.  
“可恶，这一切都是徒劳的！”明日香一拳打在墙上，发出一声怒吼。

In all this, Shinji just looked confused as he noticed something. "Hey Asuka, why isn't Unit 01 here?" he asked.  
这一切，真嗣只是一脸困惑，因为他注意到了什么。 “喂，明日香，01小队怎么没来？”他问。

"What do you mean it isn't here?" the redhead snapped at him.  
“你说它不在这里是什么意思？”红发女郎对他厉声说道。

"Just look" Shinji replied.  
“看看吧”真嗣回答道。

Asuka looked around and indeed noticed that Unit 01 was not in the eva cages. That was strange, where could it be?  
明日香环顾四周，果然注意到01号机并不在EVA笼子里。这就奇怪了，这会是哪里呢？

"Where the hell is Unit 01 Ritsuko?" Asuka demanded.  
“01号部队律子到底在哪里？”明日香问道。

"Unit 01 is in the eva cages is it not? Oh wait… it's still back where you fought the last angel" Ritsuko answered, suddenly remembering.  
“01号机在eva笼子里，不是吗？哦等等……它还在你和最后一个天使战斗的地方。”律子突然想起来，回答道。

"If that's the case, why is Rei's Unit 00 here?" the redhead questioned.  
「既然如此，为什么丽的00号部队会在这里？」红发问道。

"I retrieved the eva yesterday instead of going to school, whatever interference with our equipment the angel caused was gone and so the elevator was functioning this time and I was able to quickly move Unit 00 back up to the eva cages" Rei answered.  
“我昨天取回了 eva，而不是去学校，天使对我们设备造成的任何干扰都消失了，所以这次电梯正常工作，我能够快速将 00 号单元移回 eva 笼子”Rei 回答道。

At this, an idea formed in Asuka's mind. "Then all we need is for Shinji to go retrieve Unit 01 and come back up here and free our evas from the Bakelite" she suggested.  
说到这里，明日香的心中浮现出一个念头。 “那么我们所需要的就是让真嗣去取回 01 号机，然后回到这里并从胶木中救出我们的 eva，”她建议道。

"What?" Shinji replied, shocked.  
“什么？”真嗣震惊地回答道。

"Be sure to take the Lance of Longinus while you're down there as well" Ritsuko directed, having listened to Asuka's idea.  
“你们在下面的时候，一定要带上朗基努斯之枪。”听了明日香的想法后，律子吩咐道。

"Oh and I left your eva back at the access shaft we jumped down" Asuka added.  
“哦，我把你的伊娃留在了我们跳下去的通道处”明日香补充道。

Both Rei and Asuka looked at Shinji expectantly. Shinji realised he truly was the only who could save NERV at the moment.  
丽和明日香都满怀期待地看着真嗣。真嗣意识到他确实是目前唯一能够拯救NERV的人。

The redhead noticed the expression on Shinji's face and smiled slightly. "Yeah, I can't believe we have to rely on _you_ of all people Shinji" Asuka started teasingly, "But that's how it is so get to it, we'll wait here for you to come back"  
红发注意到真嗣脸上的表情，微微一笑。 “是啊，我不敢相信我们所有人都要依赖你，真嗣”明日香戏谑地说道，“但事情就是这样，所以就这样吧，我们会在这里等你回来”

"I have to go alone?" Shinji asked, scared.  
“我必须一个人去吗？”真嗣害怕地问道。

"I'll go with you" a voice announced, making the three children turn around.  
“我和你们一起去。”一个声音宣布，三个孩子转过身来。

The three eva pilots soon found the source of the voice as their eyes focused on Kaji.  
三名eva飞行员很快就找到了声音的来源，他们的目光集中在加持身上。

"It's the least I can do for Misato" Kaji remarked gravely.  
“这是我能为美里做的最起码的事了。”梶严肃地说。

Shinji nodded and went over to the older man. "Thanks Kaji" Shinji said appreciatively.  
真嗣点点头，走到了老人身边。 “谢谢加持。”真嗣感激地说。

"No problem kid" Kaji replied.  
“没问题，孩子。”梶回答道。

The two boys turned around and ran off towards the elevator.  
两个男孩转身朝电梯跑去。

"Good luck Shinji" Asuka whispered as the two figures disappeared from sight.  
“祝真嗣好运。”明日香低声说道，两道身影消失在视野中。

---

Meanwhile on the surface, Touji in his Unit 03 had begun decimating the enemy forces. The boy thought back to when he had been re-employed as a pilot. Kaji had approached him and offered the piloting position just yesterday. Touji had refused at first, wanting nothing to do with the evas ever again, but soon became interested as Kaji further explained the situation. It would seem that having defeated all the angels, NERV was then going to be assaulted by Seele and NERV needed all the help it could get. Touji knew how badly the evangelions affected Shinji and wanted to spare him some of the suffering, besides he wanted to protect the world as well, after all he now had Hikari.  
与此同时，在地表上，东二在他的 03 部队中已经开始消灭敌军。男孩回想起他重新被聘为飞行员的情景。就在昨天，梶才找到他并提出了驾驶职位。东次一开始拒绝了，因为不想再与EVA有任何关系，但随着加持进一步解释情况，很快就产生了兴趣。看来击败了所有的天使之后，NERV接下来就要遭到Seele的攻击，NERV需要一切能得到的帮助。东次知道新世纪福音战士对真嗣的影响有多么严重，他想让他免受一些痛苦，而且他也想保护世界，毕竟他现在有了光。

After agreeing to pilot Unit 03, Touji was escorted by Kaji back to NERV. There they did various tests and procedures to create and obtain all relevant data for Touji to be able to pilot the giant robot. As he was busy with all the preparation for piloting the robot, he was completely oblivious to anything else that was happening. After finding out that the other pilots hadn't arrived yet, it caused him to worry about Shinji.  
在同意驾驶 03 号机后，东治在梶的护送下回到了 NERV。在那里，他们进行了各种测试和程序，以创建并获取所有相关数据，以便 Touji 能够驾驶巨型机器人。当他忙于驾驶机器人的所有准备工作时，他完全没有注意到正在发生的任何事情。发现其他飞行员还没有到来后，他开始担心真嗣。

With NERV being destroyed by outside forces, they had no choice but to send Touji up onto the surface to do battle. The boy didn't take too kindly the idea of killing people, but he'd rather do it than have Shinji do it. And so, he had arrived at the surface and proceeded to take out the enemy forces. The sun was up and shining brightly down on Tokyo-3. All birds and manner of creatures had been frightened off by the weaponry or were hiding in the ground or lake.  
由于NERV被外力摧毁，他们别无选择，只能派东二到地表作战。男孩不太接受杀人的想法，但他宁愿这么做也不愿让真嗣这么做。就这样，他到达了地面，开始消灭敌军。太阳升起，照耀着东京三号。所有的鸟类和生物都被武器吓跑了，或者躲在地下或湖里。

Throughout Tokyo-3, the terrain was littered with craters, rubble and shells. Some of the forests had large clearings in them due to large scale bombings and tanks trampling the trees. NERV itself had received many hits, reducing it to a crater filled pile of debris. The ruins of NERV looked nothing like its former glory. Aircraft soared through the sky, tanks and artillery advanced towards NERV. The JSSDF forces soon focused their attention on Unit 03.  
在整个第三东京，地面上布满了弹坑、瓦砾和贝壳。由于大规模轰炸和坦克践踏树木，一些森林出现了大片空地。 NERV 本身也受到了多次打击，将其变成了一堆充满弹坑的碎片。 NERV 的废墟看上去与昔日的辉煌完全不同。飞机在天空中翱翔，坦克和火炮向NERV挺进。日本自卫队很快将注意力集中在03部队上。

Thousands of shots fired and impacted upon Touji's evangelion, not even scratching him. Touji turned his head to see a missile fired from a nearby aircraft, which he caught and crushed in his hand. A second was fired which hit Unit 03's head and exploded. The jock then grabbed the aircraft and threw it at another one, making them both explode.  
数千发炮弹射向东二的福音战士，却没有擦伤他。东次转过头，看到附近一架飞机发射了一枚导弹，他接住了导弹，将其捏碎在手中。第二发子弹击中 03 号部队的头部并爆炸。然后，运动员抓住这架飞机并将其扔向另一架，导致它们都爆炸。

An enormous amount of artillery fire erupted and began assaulting the evangelion. A pity that Touji didn't know how to erect an AT-Field, it would have made it slightly easier for him. Touji willed his eva to jump into the lake where an enormous wave was brought forth from the eva's entry. Unit 03 picked up the firing battleship and threw it with all his might onto the line of enemy tanks, causing tons of metal to crush the unsuspecting victims. The remaining air and ground forces focused all their fire on the giant mechanical beast.  
大量炮火爆发，开始攻击新世纪福音战士。可惜东次不会搭建AT场，倒是稍微方便一些。东次用意念让他的伊娃跳入湖中，伊娃的入口处掀起了巨大的波浪。 03部队拿起正在射击的战舰，用尽全身力气将其扔向敌方坦克阵线，造成数吨金属压碎了毫无戒心的受害者。剩下的空中和地面部队全部火力都集中在机械巨兽身上。

Unit 03 let out a roar and ran full speed to the nearest aircraft, decimating it with a kick. He then grabbed another and swung it around before releasing it, causing it to impact and explode with some ground forces. As the battle was fairly one-sided, the enemy forces began to retreat and the assault on NERV from the surface was put on hold for the moment.  
03号发出一声怒吼，全速冲向最近的飞机，一脚将其消灭。然后，他抓住另一个并旋转它，然后释放它，导致它与一些地面力量相撞并爆炸。由于战斗相当一边倒，敌军开始撤退，从地面对NERV的进攻暂时搁置。

"Is that all you got you lame ass excuse for people?" Touji shouted to no one in particular. "How can you assault the very people who saved your lives dozens of times you retards?!" he shouted once again.  
“这就是你给人们找的所有蹩脚借口吗？”东治没有对任何人大声喊叫。 “你怎么能攻击那些救了你几十次命的人呢？！”他再次喊道。

"Touji focus on your mission, do not get carried away" Ritsuko ordered calmly over the comm.  
“东司专注于你的任务，不要得意忘形。”律子在通讯中平静地命令道。

"Yes maam" the young boy replied.  
“是的，女士。”小男孩回答道。

Unit 03 then turned around and began to destroy any forces left that had not retreated as he didn't see the point in chasing a fleeing enemy. With all aggressors taken care of, Touji sighed in relief. This was short-lived however as a group of carrier aircraft flew over the battlefield. The eva pilot looked up in horror to see it release nine mass production evas. Despite the battle-torn terrain and the copious remains of tanks, artillery, aircraft and weaponry, the battle had only just begun.  
03部队随后转身开始消灭所有未撤退的部队，因为他不认为追击逃跑的敌人有什么意义。侵略者全部被解决后，东二松了口气。然而这只是短暂的，一群舰载机飞过战场上空。 eva飞行员惊恐地抬起头，看到它释放了九架量产eva。尽管地形饱经战火，坦克、大炮、飞机和武器残骸大量，但战斗才刚刚开始。

---

Back in NERV, two males were currently going down an elevator to reach Unit 01. It seemed strangely quiet in here despite the raging battle going on outside; it would seem they were really deep down now.  
回到NERV，两名男子正在沿着电梯前往01号单元。尽管外面正在激烈战斗，但这里却显得出奇的安静；看来他们现在真的陷得很深了。

"Hey Kaji, what's to stop the soldiers using this elevator? What even stopped them using it just then? I mean we found the elevator just where we left it" Shinji asked, suddenly worried.  
“嘿梶，有什么办法阻止士兵们使用这个电梯？是什么阻止了他们使用它？我的意思是我们在离开的地方找到了电梯”真嗣问道，突然担心起来。

"They don't know this elevator is fixed, but we have an operational security camera in this elevator so we'll know straight away if they use it"  
“他们不知道这部电梯是固定的，但我们在这部电梯里安装了一个可运行的安全摄像头，所以我们会立即知道他们是否使用它”

This seemed to quell Shinji's fears as he calmed down. Of course, he wasn't really calm; just the prospect of having to get into his evangelion to fight nine others was making him nervous, but the boy managed to keep his outward appearance neutral.  
这似乎平息了真嗣的恐惧，让他平静下来。当然，他并不是真的平静，而是平静。只是想到要进入新世纪福音战士与另外九个人战斗就让他感到紧张，但男孩设法保持自己的外表中立。

"Shinji, I know this all seems unfair how you children always have to go through this suffering, but you really are our only choice. Any of us would gladly use an alternate way or trade places with you if we could, but we can't. There's no need for you to pretend you're not afraid, I know how much responsibility is on your shoulders" Kaji comforted.  
“真嗣，我知道这一切看起来不公平，你们这些孩子总是要经历这种痛苦，但你们确实是我们唯一的选择。如果可以的话，我们任何人都会很乐意使用替代方式或与你们交换位置，但我们不能”你不用假装不害怕，我知道你肩上的责任有多大。”梶安慰道。

"I want to stay strong like Asuka does" Shinji replied.  
“我想像明日香一样保持坚强。”真嗣回答道。

"Asuka is Asuka, you are Shinji. Besides she is also afraid" Kaji remarked.  
“明日香是明日香，你是真嗣。而且她也害怕。”梶说道。

"But that's exactly the point, she can stay strong even when she's afraid" Shinji retorted.  
“但这正是重点，即使她害怕，她也能保持坚强。”真嗣反驳道。

"Look Shinji, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. Besides, what we're expecting of you is almost impossible. We are not going to blame you if you fail, we know we are asking too much of you. But… you are still willing to try, even though you know your chance of winning is very low. Together with Asuka your strength is unsurpassable, so do not forget that you are not alone in this. Even if you are feeling weak, you can draw on other's strength" Kaji reassured.  
“你看，真嗣，我们都有自己的优点和缺点。此外，我们对你的期望几乎是不可能的。如果你失败了，我们不会责怪你，我们知道我们对你的要求太多了。但是……你是仍然愿意尝试，即使你知道你获胜的机会很低，与明日香一起你的力量是不可超越的，所以不要忘记你并不孤单，即使你感觉很弱，你也可以借鉴别人的力量。 ”梶放心道。

Shinji felt slightly more relieved as he heard Kaji's words. He suddenly felt a little guilty at having made Kaji worry when surely he was still suffering greatly over Misato's death.  
听到梶的话，真嗣稍微安心了一些。他突然为自己让加持担心而感到有点内疚，而他肯定还在为美里的死而承受巨大的痛苦。

"Thank you Kaji, you're right" Shinji replied sincerely.  
“谢谢加治，你说得对。”真嗣真诚地回答道。

The elevator stopped and the doors opened. The two males exited the elevator and made their way to where Unit 01 lay. Passing through empty, gloomy corridors, the two finally came upon a clearing. This was the enormous corridor that the evangelions passed through just before the giant door to where Lilith was. The silence was deafening and the atmosphere intimidating, Shinji was instantly grateful Kaji had come with him. The corridor was especially dark with there being barely any lights. He wondered why he hadn't noticed how creepy this place was when he was last down here in his eva; probably because he was so full of emotions from discovering Aria was an angel.  
电梯停了下来，门打开了。两名男子走出电梯，朝01号单元所在的地方走去。穿过空荡荡、阴暗的走廊，两人终于来到了一片空地。这是福音战士们穿过的巨大走廊，就在通往莉莉丝所在的巨门之前。沉默震耳欲聋，气氛令人生畏，真嗣立刻很感激加持和他一起来。走廊里特别黑，几乎没有任何灯光。他想知道为什么当他上次乘坐伊娃时没有注意到这个地方有多么令人毛骨悚然；可能是因为他发现阿莉亚是天使后充满了情感。

Kaji then began to move down the corridor in the opposite direction of Heaven's gate.  
然后梶开始沿着走廊向天堂之门的相反方向移动。

"Hey Kaji, aren't you going the wrong way?" Shinji asked, confused.  
“喂，卡吉，你是不是走错路了？”慎二疑惑地问道。

"No, remember Asuka said she left your eva at the access shaft?" Kaji answered.  
“不，还记得明日香说她把你的伊娃留在了通道吗？”梶回答道。

"Oh yeah" Shinji recalled.  
“哦，是的”真嗣回忆道。

The two boys continued on down the massive corridor. Occasionally, they would pass by a massive patch of darkness as some of the lights had stopped working. At these moments, Shinji held onto Kaji's hand tightly making sure he didn't lose him, afraid that something would come out of the darkness at any moment.  
两个男孩继续沿着巨大的走廊前进。偶尔，他们会经过一片漆黑一片，因为一些灯已经熄灭了。这时，真嗣紧紧握住加持的手，确保自己不会失去他，生怕有什么东西随时会从黑暗中钻出来。

As they were walking, a gigantic figure could be seen in the distance and Shinji smiled at the familiar shape of Unit 01. The two quickened their pace as they approached the unmoving robot. However, upon reaching the mechanical beast they noticed something wrong; the entry plug was not in the eva, it was on the floor next to it. It would seem that fate was laughing at him, they had finally made it to Unit 01, but now he couldn't pilot it because of a stupid heap of metal.  
走着走着，远处出现了一个巨大的身影，真嗣看着一号机熟悉的身影，露出了笑容。两人加快了脚步，接近了那一动不动的机器人。然而，当他们到达机械兽面前时，却发现了不对劲。入口插头不在 eva 中，而是在旁边的地板上。命运似乎在跟他开玩笑，他们终于到达了01号机，但现在他却因为一堆愚蠢的金属而无法驾驶它。

"You gotta be kidding!" Kaji shouted.  
“你开玩笑的吧！”卡吉喊道。

"There's no way we can lift it either" Shinji replied.  
“我们也没办法举起它。”真嗣回答道。

"How can every hope fall to the ground…?" Kaji remarked, slumping to the floor.  
“怎么可能所有的希望都会落空……？”梶一边说着，一边倒在地上。

There was no way Shinji could pilot Unit 01 without using the entry plug and there was no way they could get the entry plug into the eva. The young boy walked up to the entry plug and kicked it angrily. Then he noticed the hatch had been opened manually, it would seem Asuka really did take him out of the plug herself. He looked inside to see some stagnant LCL still remaining and sighed. It seemed all was lost, even if Touji were to come down all the way here just to place the entry plug in or even just to free the other two evangelions, it would take too long and by then it would probably be too late.  
真嗣不可能在不使用入口插头的情况下驾驶 01 号机组，而且他们也不可能将入口插头插入 eva。小男孩走到入口插头前，愤怒地踢了它。然后他注意到舱门被手动打开了，看来明日香真的亲自把他从插头里带了出来。他往里面一看，发现还剩下一些停滞的拼箱，叹了口气。看来一切都已经失去了，即使东二一路下来只是为了插上入口插头，甚至只是为了释放另外两个新世纪福音战士，也需要太长的时间，到那时可能就太晚了。

The young boy walked up to Unit 01, their only hope, and looked up at it desperately.  
小男孩走到了他们唯一的希望——01号单元，绝望地抬头看着它。

"Mother, I was told you reside in Unit 01. I don't really know what to do now, I was hoping I could help save the day, but without the entry plug I can't pilot you. I don't want it to end like this, I've finally found what I've always wanted in life; someone who loves me. I want this destruction and death to end, so please mother… help me! I've done everything I could, I've tried my hardest to protect everyone, to protect those I love. Help me mother, I can't do this on my own…" Shinji implored, trailing off.  
“妈妈，有人告诉我你住在 01 号单元。我现在真的不知道该怎么办，我希望我能帮忙挽救局面，但没有入口插头，我无法驾驶你。我不想就这样结束了，我终于找到了我一生中一直想要的东西；我希望这种毁灭和死亡能够结束，所以请妈妈……帮助我，我已经尽力了！我已经尽了最大的努力来保护每个人，保护我所爱的人，帮助我，妈妈，我一个人做不到……”真嗣恳求道，声音逐渐减弱。

Unit 01 remained silent and unresponsive; it seemed his words had no effect. Shinji just couldn't take it anymore.  
01号部队保持沉默，没有任何反应；看来他的话并没有起到什么作用。真嗣实在是受不了了。

"Please!" the young boy pleaded, "You've protected me all those times, when I first came to NERV, when I fought the first angel and also against the 12th and 14th angels. This time I need your help more than ever. I don't want everyone to die, I want to have happiness" he said, tears trickling down his cheeks.  
“请！”小男孩恳求道：“你一直在保护我，当我第一次来到NERV时，当我与第一天使战斗时，也与第十二和第十四天使战斗时。这一次我比以往任何时候都更需要你的帮助。我不”我不想让每个人都死，我想要幸福”，他说，泪水从脸颊上流下来。

The biomechanical robot was untouched and lay there as motionlessly as before. The male eva pilot slumped to the ground and brought his knees to his chest. He sobbed silently; his only regret was that he wasn't going to live his last moments with Asuka.  
生物机械机器人没有受到任何影响，像以前一样一动不动地躺在那里。男EVA飞行员倒在地上，膝盖抵在胸前。他无声地抽泣着；他唯一的遗憾是他没有和明日香一起度过最后的时光。

"What's taking that baka so long?" Asuka said out loud.  
“那个巴卡怎么这么久才来？”明日香大声说道。

"Be patient Pilot Sohryu, I am sure Shinji is trying his best" Rei replied  
“要有耐心，飞行员 Sohryu，我确信 Shinji 正在尽力”Rei 回答道

"Nine ugly white evas are descending upon me" Touji announced over the P.A.  
“九个丑陋的白色伊娃降临在我身上”东治通过广播宣布。

"Great, we got a rookie taking on nine evas" Asuka remarked, annoyed.  
“太棒了，我们有一个新人可以对抗九个eva。”明日香恼怒地说。

"Hold them off as long as you can, the other pilots are currently doing their best to get into their evas" Ritsuko relayed to Touji.  
“尽可能地阻止他们，其他飞行员目前正在尽最大努力进入他们的evas”，律子向东司转述。

"Understood" the boy replied.  
“明白了”男孩回答道。

"Shinji better hurry, I don't know how long Touji can hold-" Asuka started, before being cut off by the sound of gunfire.  
“真嗣最好快点，我不知道冬嗣还能坚持多久——”明日香刚开口，就被枪声打断了。

Luckily, Rei had erected her AT-Field and blocked the incoming fire, shielding herself and Asuka. Several soldiers had infiltrated NERV and had already made their way to the eva cages.  
幸运的是，丽架起了她的 AT-Field，挡住了来袭的火力，保护了自己和明日香。几名士兵已潜入NERV，并已前往撤离笼。

"Ritsuko! Did they come down the elevator?" Asuka shouted.  
「律子！他们是从电梯下来的吗？」明日香喊道。

"Negative, I was monitoring it the whole time. No one has entered it since Kaji and Shinji" Ristuko answered.  
“没有，我一直在监视它。自从梶和真嗣之后就再没有人进去过。”里斯图科回答道。

"Come on, we need to take cover" the redhead directed, pulling Rei with her behind a wall.  
“来吧，我们需要躲起来。”红发女郎指示道，把雷拉到墙后。

"This is most regrettable, I cannot keep my AT-Field projected for much longer" Rei explained wearily.  
“这是最遗憾的，我不能让我的AT-Field投射太久。”Rei疲倦地解释道。

"This is ridiculous, do we have to have _all_ the odds against us? Can't we have one bit of luck just once?" Asuka huffed, irritated.  
“可笑，难道我们就一定要逆天而行吗？就不能有一点点运气吗？”明日香怒气冲冲地哼了一声。

The soldiers were quickly coming onto their position; they needed to move and fast.  
士兵们很快就到了他们的位置。他们需要快速行动。

"Where is our defence?" Asuka shouted to Ritsuko.  
“我们的防守在哪里？”明日香对律子喊道。

"Most of our soldiers are guarding the command centre and they're being attacked, I'm sorry" Ritsuko replied.  
“我们的大部分士兵都在守卫指挥中心，他们遭到了袭击，我很抱歉。”律子回答道。

Asuka grabbed Rei and they jumped down onto the solid Bakelite. They ran behind Unit 02 whose armour deflected the machine gun fire with ease. However, this was really a futile effort as the soldiers quickly began to surround Unit 02 blocking off any escape for the two pilots.  
明日香抓住了丽，他们跳到了坚固的胶木上。他们跑到了02号部队的后面，02号部队的装甲轻松地挡开了机枪的火力。然而，这确实是徒劳的，士兵们很快开始包围02号机组，封锁了两名飞行员的逃生通道。

The soldiers, having surrounded Unit 02, proceeded to move in on the children and fire at them. Rei erected her AT-Field once again, blocking all incoming bullets. Her forcefield was slowly but surely waning, the constant barrage of projectiles made it difficult to sustain. Asuka looked at Rei, her face set into a mask of concentration; she was using all her last efforts to protect her. Never had the redhead felt so helpless in her life, it was all going to end and there was nothing she could do. The redhead dropped to the floor and closed her eyes, refusing to cry or beg, not willing to give the soldiers any satisfaction.  
士兵们包围了 02 部队，开始向孩子们靠近并向他们开枪。丽再次架起了AT-Field，挡住了所有来袭的子弹。她的力场正在缓慢而坚定地减弱，持续不断的弹丸让她难以维持。明日香看着丽，她的脸上全神贯注。她正在用尽最后的力气来保护她。红发女郎一生中从未感到如此无助，一切都将结束，而她却无能为力。红发女子跪倒在地，闭上了眼睛，不肯哭泣，也不肯乞求，不愿让士兵们得到任何满足。

Rei's AT-Field was beginning to fluctuate; a few stray bullets had begun to pass through, missing the pilots by mere centimetres. The soldiers stopped to reload, creating a short moment of silence. Rei knew that the next volley would be the last and prepared herself for her death.  
雷的AT力场开始波动；几颗流弹开始穿过，与飞行员仅差几厘米。士兵们停下来重新装弹，造成了短暂的沉默。丽知道下一次齐射将是最后一次，并做好了死亡的准备。

Gunshots rang out and a few cries of pain were heard. Rei was shocked to see the soldiers receiving bullet wounds. The soldiers turned their attention onto the unknown attacker, but the surprise attack had cost them greatly and most of the soldiers were wounded and some even dead.  
枪声响起，还传来几声痛苦的叫喊声。雷看到士兵们受枪伤感到震惊。士兵们将注意力转向了来历不明的袭击者，但突如其来的袭击让他们付出了巨大的代价，大部分士兵受伤，甚至有的死亡。

"What's happening?" Asuka asked Rei.  
“发生了什么？”明日香向丽问道。

"Did you forget about me you bastards?!" a voice shouted out.  
“你们这群混蛋，忘记我了吗？！”一个声音喊道。

"It can't be…?" Asuka started.  
“该不会是……？”明日香开始了。

The soldiers fired at the source of the voice. While the soldiers were distracted, Asuka jumped the closest one, knocking his gun out of his hand. The other soldiers momentarily turned to see what was happening and received a few bullet wounds for their momentary lapse in concentration. The last soldier threw Asuka off of him and reached for the dropped rifle. However, this proved useless as he received a flying kick in the head from a purple haired woman. The woman then brought her handgun up and fired, causing the man to slump to the floor.  
士兵们向声音的来源开枪。当士兵们分心时，明日香跳到了最近的一个，把他手中的枪打落了。其他士兵也一瞬间转头看清情况，结果因为注意力不集中而受了几处枪伤。最后一个士兵把明日香从他身上甩开，伸手去拿掉落的步枪。然而这并没有什么用，他的头部被一名紫发女子飞踢了过去。随后，该女子举起手枪并开枪，导致该男子倒在地上。

"Misato?! How is this possible? I thought you died!" an angry Asuka shouted.  
“美里？！这怎么可能？我还以为你死了呢！”明日香愤怒地喊道。

The Major smiled weakly at her, panting and out of breath.  
少校对她虚弱地笑了笑，气喘吁吁，上气不接下气。

"How could you do that to us? You know how upset Shinji was?" Asuka shouted yet again, although she too had been affected strongly by it.  
“你怎么能这样对我们？你知道真嗣有多难过吗？”明日香再次大喊，尽管她也受到了强烈的影响。

"I'm sorry! But I did receive several bullets in the back, didn't I?" Misato remarked.  
“抱歉！但我背后确实中了几枪，不是吗？”美里说道。

"How did you survive then?" the redhead asked, sounding calmer.  
“那你后来是怎么活下来的？”红发问道，语气平静了一些。

"Pure luck really. I was wearing some body armour and the soldiers were aiming low to hit you guys so no bullets hit my head. The force of the bullets hitting me knocked me unconscious though, but the stupid soldiers didn't even check to see if I was still alive" Misato explained.  
“真是运气好。我穿着防弹衣，士兵们瞄准低低瞄准你们，所以没有子弹击中我的头。虽然子弹击中我的力量把我打昏了，但那些愚蠢的士兵甚至没有检查。看看我是否还活着。”美里解释道。

The redhead flung her arms around her guardian, hugging her tightly. The Major winced, the wound on her shoulder was still causing her pain, but at least the bleeding had stopped. Misato returned the embrace warmly, comforting the second child.  
红发女郎张开双臂搂住她的监护人，紧紧地拥抱着她。少校皱起眉头，肩膀上的伤口仍然让她疼痛，但至少已经止住了血。美里热情地回应了他的拥抱，安慰着老二。

"It is most fortunate that you are still alive" Rei remarked, smiling a little.  
“你还活着真是太幸运了。”雷微笑着说道。

"And it seems I came just in time! By the way, where's Shinji?" Misato queried.  
「看来我来得正是时候啊！对了，真嗣在哪儿？」美里问道。

"He's gone down to retrieve Unit 01" Asuka answered.  
“他下去取回01号机了。”明日香回答道。

The Major looked at the other two evas, noticing the state they were in.  
少校看了看另外两个eva，注意到他们现在的状态。

"I see, how long has he been gone?" the Major asked.  
“我明白了，他走了多久了？”少校问道。

"Quite a while actually, I'm kinda starting to get worried. In any case, how did you get here?" the redhead asked.  
“实际上，我已经开始有点担心了。不管怎样，你是怎么到这里来的？”红发问道。

"The elevator. When I re-entered NERV, I noticed it had been repaired and so I called it up and came down to find you guys in trouble. It would seem the soldiers still haven't found out that one elevator still works. Although before I entered NERV I noticed that Unit 03 had begun to fight, how's our man doing?" Misato answered.  
“电梯。当我重新进入NERV时，我发现它已经修好了，所以我打电话过来，下来发现你们有麻烦了。看来士兵们还没有发现有一部电梯还可以用。虽然在我进入NERV之前我就注意到03部队已经开始战斗了，但是我们的人怎么样了？”美里回答道。

"He's already defeated the surface forces, so the only soldiers remaining are the ones that have infiltrated NERV. However, the nine mass production evas have already landed. I don't think he can hold them off for long" Asuka replied.  
“他已经击败了地面部队，所以剩下的士兵就只有那些渗透到NERV的士兵了。不过，九个量产EVA已经降落了。我认为他不能阻止他们太久。”明日香回答道。

"Come on Shinji, hurry up" Misato urged.  
美里催促道：“真嗣，快点。”

"We just have to believe in him" Rei declared.  
“我们只需要相信他”雷宣称。

---

Touji braced himself as the nine evas had landed, surrounding him completely. He looked around; he really needed a weapon. Not finding anything, he decided it was probably better he attacked first lest he be attacked by all of them at the same time. He jumped and landed on one of them, the force of the attack breaking its back. He picked up its long blade-like weapon and swung it as hard as he could at the nearest eva and cut deep into its body.  
当九个幻影降落时，东次做好了准备，将他完全包围。他看了看周围;他确实需要一件武器。由于没有找到任何东西，他决定最好先攻击，以免同时遭到所有人的攻击。他跳了起来，落在其中一个身上，攻击的力量打破了它的背部。他拿起它的长刀般的武器，用力挥向最近的伊娃，深深地切入它的身体。

The other seven evas had gone into action and began to retaliate. Unit 03 jumped back but not fast enough, receiving a blow to the chest knocking him over. Touji managed to roll over just in time before the blade was brought down to where he was a few moments previously. He kicked the eva out of the way and jumped back up only to narrowly dodge another swing from another eva. Touji's sync ratio wasn't high enough and he wasn't skilled enough to fight them all at once. He quickly decided to run, hoping they would chase him.  
其他七名eva也纷纷行动起来，开始反击。 03号向后一跳，但速度不够快，胸部受到重击，将他击倒。东治及时翻了个身，刀刃又落到了他刚才所在的位置。他把那个伊娃踢开，然后跳起来，勉强躲开了另一个伊娃的另一次挥击。东治的同步率不够高，而且他的技术也不足以同时对抗他们。他很快决定逃跑，希望他们能追上他。

"Touji, quickly go over to the armament building next to you, it still has a rifle in it" Ritsuko announced over his comm.  
“东二，快去旁边的军械库，里面还有步枪。”律子在通讯中说道。

Unit 03 made a mad dash for the building and took out the weapon. He turned on his heel firing at the closest white eva, decimating it. He aimed again and fired at the next one who dodged the bullets. Another eva had come from behind and Touji was forced to jump out of the way, falling over in the process and dropping the rifle.  
03分队疯狂冲向大楼并拿出了武器。他转身向最近的白色伊娃开火，将其摧毁。他再次瞄准，向下一个躲过子弹的人开枪。另一个伊娃从后面过来，东司被迫跳开，在这个过程中摔倒并掉落了步枪。

"Damn, this is so much harder than it looks" Touji commented.  
“该死，这比看起来要难得多”Touji 评论道。

The two evas were coming up to him, ready to deal a final blow, but Touji managed to grab his rifle and fired at them, destroying one while the other moved out of the way. Another eva came from behind and threw a punch at the fallen Unit 03. Touji moved out of the way, but the enemy eva had scored a hit on the rifle, smashing it into pieces, causing the boy to swear loudly. The jock was sweating profusely; he knew he couldn't keep this up.  
两个eva正向他走来，准备给予最后一击，但东次设法抓住他的步枪并向他们开火，摧毁了其中一个，而另一个则移开。另一个伊娃从后面冲了过来，向倒下的03号队挥出一拳。东司闪开，但敌方伊娃击中了步枪，将其打成了碎片，让男孩大声咒骂。运动员满头大汗。他知道他不能再这样下去了。

"I really, _really_ need some help!" Touji shouted over his comm.  
“我真的真的需要帮助！”东治在通讯器里喊道。

"We still don't have the other evas ready, I'm sorry" Ritsuko replied.  
「抱歉，我们还没有准备好其他的eva。」律子回答道。

Keeping the remaining mass production evas in sight, he began backing up but was soon brought to the ground by a blow from behind. Confused, the jock looked up to see another white eva. He looked back at the other five that were left and noticed they were still there. Rolling out of the way to dodge another attack, he got up quickly and saw, to his horror, the four evas he had taken down back up and fighting again.  
保持着剩下的量产eva的视线，他开始后退，但很快就被后面的一击打倒在地。运动员困惑地抬起头，看到另一个白色的伊娃。他回头看了看剩下的五个人，发现他们还在那里。他翻身躲开另一次攻击，然后迅速站起来，惊恐地看到他打倒的四个伊娃又重新站起来并开始战斗。

"The evas I took down are still alive? What the hell is this?" Touji asked desperately.  
“我打倒的eva还活着？这是什么鬼？”东二急切地问道。

"It seems they can regenerate" Ritsuko remarked.  
“看来它们可以再生。”律子说道。

"What?! How am I supposed to win?" Touji retorted, dodging another attack.  
“什么？！我该怎么赢？”东二反驳道，躲开了另一次攻击。

"Destroy their cores" she answered.  
“摧毁他们的核心”她回答道。

"Easier said than done" he said running off, knowing that if he was surrounded he was done for.  
“说起来容易做起来难，”他说完就跑开了，因为他知道如果自己被包围了，他就完蛋了。

Almost tripping over a massive boulder, Unit 03 picked it up and threw it as hard as he could at the nearest enemy, making its head explode in a torrent of blood. The other eight evas seemed to have grown tired of chasing him around and expanded their wings and flew on after him.  
差点被一块大石头绊倒，03号把它捡起来，用力扔向最近的敌人，让它的头炸开，血流成河。其他八只幻影似乎厌倦了追赶他，展开翅膀追赶着他。

"Just fucking great!" Touji shouted disbelievingly.  
“简直太棒了！”东二不可置信地喊道。

The nine evas approached him at an alarming rate and all Touji could do was try his best to avoid their attacks as they swung past him. One of them managed to land a blow on his arm with their blade weapon, slicing his left arm off. The young boy screamed in pain but managed to keep on running. His vision was slowly fading, the exhaustion and pain was getting to him. Receiving another blow, he was knocked over onto the ground.  
九个幻影以惊人的速度接近他，东次所能做的就是在他们从他身边掠过时尽力避开他们的攻击。其中一人用刀刃武器击中了他的手臂，把他的左臂砍了下来。小男孩痛苦地尖叫，但还是继续跑。他的视线逐渐模糊，疲惫和痛苦袭来。又是一击，他被打倒在地。

He tried feebly to defend himself, but it was a futile effort and inevitably the evas had surrounded him. They stood there, their ugly faces smiling viciously as though they were enjoying his last pathetic attempts to survive. Touji closed his eyes, not wanting to see what they would do to him. His only regret was that he hadn't told Hikari how much he cared for her.  
他无力地试图自卫，但徒劳无功，伊娃们不可避免地包围了他。他们站在那里，丑陋的面孔邪恶地微笑着，仿佛正在享受他最后一次可怜的生存尝试。东二闭上了眼睛，不想看到他们会对他做什么。他唯一的遗憾是他没有告诉Hikari他有多么关心她。

Suddenly, a loud smash was heard but Touji felt no pain. Opening his eyes, he looked up to see a red evangelion wrestling with one of the evas. Touji used this chance to jump up and escape. Unit 03 had been saved by three other evangelions, who had attacked the mass production evas while they were distracted.  
突然，一声巨响传来，但东司却感觉不到疼痛。睁开眼睛，他抬头看到一名红色新世纪福音战士正在与其中一名伊娃摔跤。东次趁此机会跳起逃走。 03号机被另外三名新世纪福音战士救了出来，他们趁量产EVA分心的时候袭击了他们。

"It's about fucking time!" Touji shouted.  
“他妈的时间到了！”东二喊道。

"Sorry about that! It was difficult getting Unit 01 ready and the other evangelions were stuck in Bakelite" Shinji replied. Upon finding out that Misato was still alive, the third child had been overjoyed.  
“抱歉！让01号做好准备很困难，其他新世纪福音战士都被困在胶木里了”真嗣回答道。当得知美里还活着时，老三欣喜若狂。

"Good to hear your voice Shin-man!" Touji replied.  
“很高兴听到你的声音，辛曼！”东二回答道。

"What about a thanks for saving your sorry ass?" Asuka said over the comm.  
“感谢你救了你这个可怜的混蛋怎么样？”明日香在通讯中说道。

"Get stuffed!" Touji replied.  
“吃饱了！”东二回答道。

"It would be best if we were to work together" Rei commented.  
“如果我们能一起工作那就最好了”Rei 评论道。

"Rei's right guys, stop fighting already, this is definitely not the time for it. I brought the Lance of Longinus with me, I don't know if it'll help or not, but at least fighting four on nine is much better odds" Shinji replied.  
“雷说得对，你们都别再打了，现在绝对不是打架的时候。我带着朗基努斯之枪，不知道有没有用，但至少四打九好很多。”可能性不大”真嗣回答道。

Four evangelions stood together against nine white ones; the survival of humanity dependent on the outcome of this battle.  
四只新世纪福音战士站在一起，对抗九只白色的；人类的生存取决于这场战斗的结果。

"What brings you here? Surely it is most imperative at this time for you to be at your post" the man remarked emotionlessly.  
“你怎么来了？这个时候，你一定要坚守在自己的岗位上。”男人面无表情的说道。

"Don't give me that bullshit anymore Ikari" a rather irate blonde-haired woman snapped.  
“别再跟我说那些废话了，碇”一位相当愤怒的金发女人厉声说道。

"Do not waste my time Akagi, unless there is something important you wish to discuss, leave" the Commander replied, annoyed.  
“别浪费我的时间了，赤城，除非有重要的事情想讨论，否则就走吧。”指挥官恼怒地说道。

The doctor raised a handgun and aimed it at the Commander, cocking the weapon. "I think this is very important"  
医生举起手枪瞄准指挥官，扳动了扳机。 “我认为这非常重要”

"What is it you want?" Gendo asked impassively.  
“你想要什么？”源堂面无表情地问道。

"All I wanted from you was to look at me, to care about me! Ever since you abandoned the scenario, you've been constantly ignoring me. I'm smart enough to realise you were using me all along, why can't you just forget about that bitch" Ritsuko snarled.  
“我只想你多看我一眼，关心我！自从你放弃剧本之后，你就一直无视我。我很聪明，知道你一直在利用我，为什么不可以呢？”你就忘了那个贱人吧。”律子咆哮道。

"You'll never be half the woman she was" Gendo replied, sneering a little.  
“你永远不可能成为她的一半，”源堂回答道，带着一点冷笑。

"Don't piss me of anymore you bastard! I can't believe how much of a fool I was, just like my mother. You are just despicable!" Ritsuko shouted angrily, waving the gun at Gendo.  
“你这个混蛋，别再生我的气了！我简直不敢相信，我是多么的愚蠢，就像我的母亲一样。你简直太卑鄙了！”律子愤怒地喊道，向源堂挥舞着枪。

"You expected something more?" the man asked coldly.  
“你还期待更多吗？”男人冷冷问道。

"Well, I guess I shouldn't have. But I've made sure you won't get what you want" Ritsuko replied, smirking slightly.  
“好吧，我想我不应该这样做。但我已经确定你不会得到你想要的东西”Ritsuko 回答道，微微笑着。

"What do you mean?" he asked.  
“你是什么意思？”他问。

"I took care of all those clones of Rei, I think it's better for her anyway. Now she's unique and can live like a normal human. You can't retrieve Yui's DNA, I've destroyed all the data too" the doctor explained.  
“我照顾了丽的所有克隆体，我认为这对她来说无论如何都是更好的。现在她是独一无二的，可以像正常人一样生活。你无法检索Yui的DNA，我也毁掉了所有数据”医生解释道。

The Commander looked slightly annoyed. "If that is all, you are dismissed" he ordered.  
指挥官看上去有些恼怒。 “如果仅此而已，你就被解雇”他命令道。

"Still able to talk like that with a gun pointed at your face?" Ritsuko said irritated then frowned, "I don't understand why you couldn't choose me even though she was dead. All along I was just being played" Ritsuko remarked sadly.  
“拿枪指着脸还能这么说话吗？”律子有些恼怒，然后皱起了眉头，“我不明白，为什么她死了，你却不能选择我。一直以来，我都只是被玩弄的。”律子悲伤地说。

"No. Ritsuko I truly… needed you" Gendo admitted.  
“不。律子，我真的……需要你”源堂承认。

"Liar" the doctor replied, firing the gun.  
“骗子。”医生一边回答，一边开枪。

The Commander's body lay limply in his chair as the doctor exited his office.  
当医生离开他的办公室时，指挥官的身体无力地躺在椅子上。

Facing four evangelions this time, the nine white evas renewed their attack, battling ferociously. Touji, missing an arm, found it extremely difficult to fight and found he was dodging attacks most of the time and just trying to stay alive. Asuka was in a rage; she shouted in fury as she jumped to and fro, wielding her progressive knife, dealing several blows to the mass production evas. Rei was protecting Touji in his weakened state.  
这次面对四只新世纪福音战士，九只白色eva再次发起攻击，战斗得十分凶猛。失去一只手臂的东次发现战斗极其困难，他发现自己大部分时间都在躲避攻击，只是想活下去。明日香非常愤怒。她怒吼一声，跳来跳去，挥舞着进阶刀，对着量产EVA连续砍了几下。丽正在保护虚弱状态下的东次。

"You have to destroy their cores or they'll just regenerate!" Touji shouted.  
“你必须摧毁他们的核心，否则他们就会重生！”东二喊道。

Shinji took aim and threw the lance as hard as he could at the nearest white eva. The deadly lance impaled the mass production eva and it squirmed around in obvious pain. It soon stopped all actions and slumped to the ground dead.  
真嗣瞄准了目标，用尽全力将长枪投向最近的白色eva。致命的长枪刺穿了量产eva，它明显疼痛地蠕动着。很快它就停止了一切动作，倒在了地上死了。

"Killing them with the lance prevents regeneration!" Shinji shouted happily.  
“用长矛杀死他们会阻止再生！”慎二高兴地喊道。

His joy was short-lived as he was thrown over by another white eva. Just as he was about to receive a fatal blow from the eva's blade weapon, a loud clang resonated as Asuka had blocked the attack with another blade weapon she had pillaged. Shinji quickly kicked the white eva out of the way.  
他的喜悦是短暂的，因为他被另一个白色的伊娃扔了过去。正当他即将受到伊娃的刀刃致命一击时，一声巨响响起，明日香用她掠夺来的另一把刀刃挡住了攻击。真嗣迅速将白色的eva踢开。

"Don't die on me you baka" the redhead demanded, irritated.  
“别死在我的手上，你这个混蛋”红发人恼怒地要求道。

"Thanks, you be careful too" Shinji replied.  
“谢谢，你也小心点。”真嗣回答道。

"Heh don't worry about me! I can't lose, especially with you and mum at my side!" Asuka declared arrogantly.  
“呵呵，你别担心我！我不能输，尤其是有你和妈妈在身边！”明日香傲慢地宣称。

Asuka dropped the massive blade weapon and leaped onto the downed eva, stabbing her prog-knife as deep as she could into its core. After hearing a crack, Unit 02 jumped off only just dodging another attack. Shinji ran over to the eva he'd downed before to retrieve the Lance. Asuka, Touji and Rei guarded Unit 01 as he pulled out the Lance. Just as Shinji pulled out the Lance, Touji and Rei were knocked over and Asuka quickly went to pull Touji back up, leaving Shinji open to attack. He blocked the first attack with the lance, but found it very difficult to get in an attack with such a long weapon at close range.  
明日香丢下巨大的刀刃武器，跳到倒地的伊娃身上，将她的尖刀尽可能深地刺入其核心。听到一声爆响，02号部队跳了下去，刚刚躲过另一次攻击。真嗣跑到他之前击落的伊娃那里去取回长枪。当 01 号拔出长矛时，明日香、东次和丽守护着他。就在真嗣拔出长枪时，东次和丽被撞倒，明日香赶紧去把东次拉回来，让真嗣有机会攻击。他用长枪挡住了第一次攻击，但发现这么长的武器在近距离很难攻击。

Promptly, he threw the lance over to Asuka who caught it easily and ran it straight through another eva. Rei then ran over to the downed mass production eva to help Asuka pull out the lance. Unit 01 leapt up into the air, crashing down onto another white eva and taking out his progressive knife, he stabbed it deep into the enemy's core. With the other evas preoccupied, Touji found himself facing down five white evas.  
他立刻将长枪扔给明日香，明日香轻松地接住了它，并直接刺穿了另一个伊娃。丽跑到被击落的量产EVA身边，帮助明日香拔出长枪。 01号机腾空而起，撞到另一只白色eva身上，拿出进步刀，深深刺入敌人的核心。当其他伊娃全神贯注时，冬治发现自己面对着五个白色伊娃。

"Why do they always go for me?" Touji shouted out.  
“为什么他们总是来找我？”东二大声喊道。

Touji once again tried running, but found himself falling over as one of the mass production evas sliced his right leg clean off. Screaming in pain, the jock went unconscious and his entry plug was ejected. The other evas looked up as they saw the white capsule fly off in the distance; Touji was out of the battle. Shinji, having killed the eva, got back up and ran over to Asuka and Rei who had finally retrieved the Lance again. The three evangelions looked over at the five white evas who were standing stoically.  
东治再次尝试逃跑，却发现自己摔倒了，其中一名量产伊娃将他的右腿砍掉了。运动员痛苦地尖叫，失去知觉，入口塞被弹出。当其他伊娃看到白色胶囊飞向远处时，他们抬起头来；东司退出了战斗。杀死了eva的真嗣站了起来，跑向终于再次取回了长枪的明日香和丽。三位新世纪福音战士看向坚忍站立的五名白色伊娃。

"I think they're going to try something different this time" Shinji commented.  
“我认为他们这次会尝试一些不同的东西”真嗣评论道。

"Rei you hold onto the Lance, Shinji and me will go on the offensive" Asuka ordered.  
“丽，你拿着枪，我和真嗣进攻。”明日香命令道。

"Hai" Rei replied, taking the Lance off Asuka.  
“嗨”丽回答道，从明日香手中接过长枪。

Unit 01 and 02 then moved towards the five remaining mass production evas. Abruptly, one of the white evas threw their blade weapon at the two approaching evangelions. Not being able to dodge the attack, both evangelions raised their AT-Fields. The weapon impacted with their AT-Fields, staying stationary, confusing the two eva pilots. Suddenly, the weapon twisted into the shape of the Lance of Longinus. Both Shinji and Asuka's eyes grew wide as the Lance forced its way through their combined AT-Field.  
01号和02号机组随后又向剩下的五艘量产型eva进发。突然，一名白色伊娃向两名接近的新世纪福音战士扔出了他们的刀刃武器。无法闪避攻击的双方新世纪福音战士都举起了AT力场。该武器撞击了他们的 AT 场，保持静止，使两名 eva 飞行员感到困惑。突然，这把武器扭曲成了朗基努斯之枪的形状。当长矛强行穿过他们联合的 AT 场时，真嗣和明日香都瞪大了眼睛。

The Lance broke through their AT-Field and was about to impale Unit 02, when all of a sudden, Rei's Unit 00 moved in front taking the hit instead. Rei screamed out in pain, the lance having gone straight through the eva's chest. She dropped the original Lance and collapsed to the floor. A second later, her entry plug was ejected and it too flew off into the distance. The two remaining evangelions looked back up at the five white evas who were smiling cruelly back at them.  
长枪突破了他们的AT力场，正要刺穿02号机，突然，雷的00号机冲到了前面，接住了攻击。长枪直接刺穿了伊娃的胸口，丽痛苦地尖叫起来。她丢掉了原来的兰斯，倒在了地板上。一秒钟后，她的入口塞被弹出，也飞向了远处。剩下的两名新世纪福音战士回头看向那五名白色的eva，他们正对着他们残忍地微笑。

"Looks like it's just the two of us left Asuka" Shinji remarked.  
“看来明日香只剩下我们两个了。”真嗣说道。

"Two against five is easy" Asuka said pompously. "Shinji, you take the Lance. I'll distract the mass production evas"  
“二对五很容易。”明日香傲慢地说。 「真嗣，你拿着枪。我来分散量产eva的注意力。」

"Be careful!" Shinji replied, concerned.  
“当心！”慎二关切地回答道。

Unit 02 moved off towards the five remaining white evas again while Unit 01 picked up the Lance. Another white eva threw its weapon at Asuka, but she was expecting it and was able to quickly roll off to the side. Using this to his advantage, Unit 01 threw the Lance at the eva, downing another one. Asuka quickly got back up and delivered a devastating punch to the first eva she reached. It fell over to the ground and Unit 02 turned around swiftly, dealing a mighty kick to the next mass production eva.  
02号机再次向剩下的五个白色eva移动，而01号机则拿起了长枪。另一只白色伊娃向明日香扔出了武器，但她早有预料，很快就滚到了一边。 01号部队利用这一点，将长矛扔向了EVA，击落了另一架。明日香迅速站起来，对她碰到的第一个伊娃打出了毁灭性的一拳。倒在了地上，02号机迅速转身，对下一个量产级EVA发出了强力的一脚。

By then, Shinji had come up to them and quickly stabbed his prog-knife into the eva Asuka had punched earlier, silencing it too. The three remaining white evas moved off and spread their wings, taking flight. Shinji retrieved the Lance and waited with Asuka as they looked up at the sky, wondering what they were about to do.  
这时，真嗣已经走到了他们面前，并迅速将他的尖刀刺进了明日香之前打出的伊娃身上，也让它安静了下来。剩下的三只白色eva离开了，展开翅膀，飞了起来。真嗣收回了长枪，和明日香一起等待，他们抬头看着天空，想知道他们要做什么。

Suddenly, the mass productions evas all nose-dived and flew straight towards the two evangelions on the ground. Shinji only just barely dodged the attack, but Asuka was hit in the stomach hard. Fortunately, she managed to roll out of the way just as the third white eva was about to land a mortal blow. The white evas then took flight again, ready to attack again.  
突然，量产突然一俯冲，径直向地面上的两只新世纪福音战士飞去。真嗣勉强躲过了这一击，但明日香的腹部却被重重击中。幸运的是，当第三个白色伊娃即将发动致命一击时，她成功地滚了出去。随后，白色的EVA再次飞行，准备再次攻击。

"Schiesse, those cowards are using such cheap tactics to win!" Asuka shouted, annoyed.  
“希埃斯，那些胆小鬼竟然用如此廉价的手段来取胜！”明日香生气地喊道。

"What are we gonna do Asuka?" Shinji asked, worried.  
“我们要做什么，明日香？”慎二担心地问道。

"If we could fly this would be no problem, but at the moment, to win this we're gonna have to score a lucky hit when they come down at us" Asuka commented.  
“如果我们能飞的话，这就没问题，但目前，要赢得这场比赛，我们必须在他们向我们袭来时幸运地击中”明日香评论道。

The white evas came swooping down once again, however Unit 01 and 02 were both unsuccessful in dealing a blow; they were just too fast. They came down again, knocking Asuka's eva to the ground. Seeing victory, the third eva came down to deal its finishing blow. Asuka attempted to defend herself from the inevitable attack by shielding herself with her arms, though she knew it was futile. Shinji had seen Unit 02 downed and tried to run over, desperately trying to save her; there was no way he was going to let her die now.  
白色EVA再次俯冲而下，但01号和02号都未能成功击中；他们只是太快了。他们再次落下，将明日香的伊娃击倒在地。看到胜利，第三个eva下来给予最后一击。明日香试图用双臂保护自己，以抵御不可避免的攻击，尽管她知道这是徒劳的。真嗣看到02号机被击落，试图跑过去，拼命救她；现在他不可能让她死。

The white eva smiled in triumph as it came down upon its helpless victim. Asuka closed her eyes, certain she was about to die. Yet moments later, the redhead found herself still breathing and she opened her eyes to see that Unit 01 had caught the white eva, but more importantly, Unit 01 had sprouted wings! Asuka looked at Shinji's eva in awe, the ethereal wings protruding from Unit 01's back glowed eerily, giving the evangelion the look of a demon.  
当白色伊娃降落在无助的受害者身上时，它露出了胜利的微笑。明日香闭上眼睛，确信自己快要死了。然而片刻之后，红发发现自己还有呼吸，睁开眼睛发现01号机抓住了白色eva，更重要的是，01号机长出了翅膀！明日香敬畏地看着真嗣的eva，01号机背上伸出的空灵翅膀发出诡异的光芒，让新世纪福音战士看起来像恶魔。

"That was close Asuka" Shinji said, relieved.  
“明日香已经很接近了。”真嗣松了口气说道。

"What did you just do?" Asuka asked, puzzled.  
“你刚才做了什么？”明日香疑惑地问道。

"I just… wanted to save you, when suddenly I found myself flying and I was able to make it to you in time" Shinji replied.  
“我只是……想救你，突然我发现自己在飞，并且能够及时赶到你身边。”真嗣回答道。

The boy then threw the dead eva to the ground; he had stabbed its core with his prog-knife when he saved Asuka. Unit 01 then took flight and headed towards the remaining two mass production evas who were airborne again.  
男孩随后将死去的伊娃扔在地上；当他救明日香时，他用尖刀刺穿了它的核心。随后01号机起飞，朝着再次升空的剩余两架量产级驱逐舰飞去。

"What am I supposed to do?" Asuka asked angrily.  
“我应该做些什么？”明日香愤怒地问道。

"Just catch me if I fall or something" Shinji answered back.  
“如果我摔倒了或者怎么的，就来接住我吧。”真嗣回答道。

"Fine you baka" the redhead confirmed.  
“好吧，你baka”红发确认道。

Facing off the two white evas in the air, Shinji felt a bit of panic as he realised he was more or less on his own against the last two. This time, the two mass production evas charged at him and Shinji dodged their attack easily, swinging his fist at one. His blow connected and he swung his other arm around, wielding the prog-knife, and stabbed it straight into the eva's core. The white eva went limp and he let it fall.  
面对空中的两个白色eva，真嗣感到有些惊慌，因为他意识到自己或多或少只能靠自己来对抗最后两个。这一次，两个量产级的eva冲向了他，真嗣轻松地​​躲开了他们的攻击，一拳向其中一挥。他的一击接踵而至，他挥动另一只手臂，挥舞着尖刀，直接刺入了伊娃的核心。白色的伊娃变得软绵绵的，他让它掉了下来。

The last white eva looked furious as it realised it was the only one left. It charged yet again at Unit 01, dealing a heavy blow to Shinji's chest. Unit 01 was sent reeling back and he fell to the ground, thankfully, he found his impact lessened significantly as Unit 02 caught him.  
最后一只白色伊娃意识到自己只剩下一个了，看上去很愤怒。它再次冲向01号部队，对真嗣的胸口造成了沉重的打击。 01号机被撞得向后倒去，他摔倒在地，谢天谢地，他发现自己的冲击力被02号机接住了，明显减轻了。

"Come on baka, you can do better than that. There's only one left" Asuka encouraged.  
“来吧巴卡，你可以做得更好。只剩下一个了”明日香鼓励道。

As Unit 01 got off the red eva, he quickly took flight again. This last mass production eva was tougher than the rest and Asuka couldn't fly so he pondered what could he do. Soon, he thought of an idea.  
当01号机下了红色EVA后，他又迅速起飞了。这最后的量产EVA比其他的更难，明日香不会飞，所以他思考他能做什么。很快，他想到了一个主意。

"Asuka get ready, I'm gonna attempt to throw him to the ground" Shinji declared.  
“明日香做好准备，我要尝试把他扔到地上”真嗣宣布。

"Hai" Asuka replied. “嗨”明日香回答道。

The two airborne evas stared at each other. Unable to find the strength to beat the last white eva, Shinji called on the help of his mother again.  
两个空中的eva面面相觑。由于找不到击败最后一个白色伊娃的力量，真嗣再次向母亲求助。

_'Mother, I need your help one last time. I know it's a lot to ask, especially after you activated yourself so that I could free Rei and Asuka's evas, but I can't do this on my own. Protect and fight with me like you always do mother'_ he thought.  
“妈妈，我最后一次需要你的帮助。我知道有很多问题要问，尤其是在你激活自己以便我可以释放丽和明日香的eva之后，但我不能独自做到这一点。保护我并与我一起战斗，就像你一直做的那样，母亲”他想。

Finding the resolve, Unit 01 flew in towards the last mass production eva and they battled each other furiously, each trying to land a fatal blow to the other. They were surprisingly well matched and Shinji was finding it difficult to keep up with the remaining white eva. Finding no other alternative, Shinji tried his luck and feinted an attack. Fortunately, the mass production eva fell for it and Shinji quickly moved and grabbed the unsuspecting eva. He then rotated swiftly and used all his might to throw the mass production eva hurtling towards the earth.  
有了决心，01号飞向了最后一艘量产级EVA，双方展开激烈的战斗，都想给对方致命一击。他们出奇地匹配，真嗣发现很难跟上剩下的白色伊娃。真嗣别无选择，只能碰碰运气，佯攻。幸运的是，量产eva中招了，真嗣迅速出手，抓住了毫无防备的eva。然后他猛地旋转，用尽全力，将量产伊娃抛向了地面。

Asuka was ready for it and propped up the Lance she had retrieved. The white eva had been thrown with such momentum that the Lance of Longinus pierced straight through it. After a few moments it fell silent and the battle was over…  
明日香做好了准备，撑起了她取回的长枪。白色的eva被投出的势头如此之大，以至于朗基努斯之枪直接刺穿了它。片刻之后，一切归于平静，战斗结束了……

End Notes: Hurray, they won! I kinda felt bad for making Misato live, partly because some of the original reviewers praised me for having her die. The description last chapter also made it really sound like she was dead. But at least it deviates from what happened originally in End of Eva and also, I'm sure many wanted Misato to live.  
尾注：万岁，他们赢了！我对让美里活着感到有点难过，部分原因是一些最初的评论家称赞我让她死了。上一章的描述也让她听起来真的像是死了。但至少它偏离了《伊娃的终结》中最初发生的事情，而且我相信很多人都希望美里活下去。

Next chapter is the last chapter… except not really. I plan to add one more Chapter as a sort of Epilogue and additionally various notes and thoughts about the story. However, you can still look forward to the end of this story, for most things finish off with the next chapter.  
下一章就是最后一章……只不过不是真的。我计划再添加一章作为尾声，以及关于这个故事的各种注释和想法。不过，你仍然可以期待这个故事的结局，因为大多数事情都会在下一章结束。

### Chapter 23: Shinji and Asuka  
第23章：真嗣和明日香

"Wait!" “等待！”

The executioner halted mere millimetres from the knight's head while everyone turned to the princess expectantly.  
刽子手在距离骑士头部仅几毫米的地方停了下来，而每个人都满怀期待地转向公主。

"This can't happen! That man does not deserve to die, he has done nothing wrong!" Adelita shouted, beginning to cry. "_I_ was the one who chose to lay with him, him being a humble person accepted the blame to keep peace in this land. He has done nothing but dutifully serve his country!" she explained.  
“这不可能！那个人不该死，他没有做错什么！”阿黛丽塔大声喊道，开始哭泣。 “我是选择与他同眠的人，他作为一个谦虚的人接受了维护这片土地和平的责任。他除了尽职尽责地为他的国家服务之外什么也没做！”她解释道。

"Adelita… I was ready to die, you did not have to save me" the knight let out, though he was relieved he wasn't going to die.  
“阿黛丽塔……我已经准备好死了，你不必救我。”骑士说道，尽管他为自己不会死而松了一口气。

"I was not ready to accept your death…" the princess replied.  
“我还没有准备好接受你的死亡……”公主回答道。

"A true knight to the end" the king commented, "You almost had me execute a knight with more honour than anyone I've known"  
国王评论道：“一位真正的骑士到底”，“你几乎让我以比我认识的任何人都更有荣誉的方式处决了一位骑士”

"I did not wish for it to happen this way, and he was the one who took the blame upon himself selflessly" the princess elaborated.  
“我不希望事情变成这样，他是无私地把责任揽在自己身上的人。”公主解释道。

"Princess, you knew what you were doing and what would happen, so why did you lay with this man?" the king asked, confused by her decision.  
“公主，你知道自己在做什么，也知道会发生什么，为什么还要和这个男人睡在一起？”国王对她的决定感到困惑，问道。

"Because I love him, no offence to you Your Highness, but I did not want this. I was forced into this arranged marriage" the princess answered.  
“因为我爱他，我无意冒犯殿下，但我不想这样。我是被迫进入这包办婚姻的。”公主回答道。

"But that is customary" the king said matter-of-factly.  
“但这是习惯。”国王实事求是地说。

"I implore you Your Majesty, I will go ahead with this marriage, or you can imprison me instead, but please do not kill that man" she begged.  
“我恳求陛下，我会继续这桩婚姻，或者您可以监禁我，但请不要杀死那个男人”她恳求道。

"Give me a moment" the king commanded, as he began to ponder for a while.  
“给我一点时间。”国王沉吟了一会儿，命令道。

The king then spoke up, "I have grown old in age, I doubt I can bear this country an heir. With this in mind and seeing the nobility of this man, I think I put my kingdom in safe hands when I say that this man will be my heir. Therefore, Princess you will be married to this 'prince' and no war will occur" he announced.  
国王接着说道：“我已经年事已高，我怀疑我能否为这个国家继承一个继承人。考虑到这一点，并看到这个人的高贵，当我说这句话时，我想我已经把我的王国交到了安全的手中。”男人将成为我的继承人。因此，公主，你将嫁给这个‘王子’，不会发生战争。”他宣布。

The princess smiled widely, unable to believe the king's kindness. "Thank you O wise and generous king" she said, hugging him and kissing him on the cheek.  
公主笑得灿烂，不敢相信国王的仁慈。 “谢谢你，明智而慷慨的国王，”她拥抱着他，亲吻了他的脸颊。

"Think nothing of it my daughter, it would be a sin to separate you two lovers" the king replied. "Release sir Jonathan!" the king commanded.  
“别想那么多，我的女儿，把你们两个恋人分开是一种罪过”国王回答道。 “释放乔纳森先生！”国王命令道。

The executioner unlocked the headstock and freed the knight. The princess ran over to him and hugged him, sobbing on his shoulder.  
刽子手打开了琴头的锁，释放了骑士。公主跑到他身边，抱住他，靠在他肩上抽泣。

"There, there Adelita it's all over" the knight said, calming her.  
“好了，好了，阿德丽塔，一切都结束了。”骑士说道，让她平静下来。

The curtains closed upon this joyous scene and reopened moments later with the entire cast. They bowed as the audience clapped at their performance. Many people in the crowd whistled and cheered as the cast bowed again. Asuka, dressed up as the princess, smiled arrogantly while holding Shinji's hand. The two teens could see Misato in the crowd cheering loudly at them, even going as far as waving her arms at them.  
帷幕在这欢乐的场景中落下，片刻之后又与全体演员一起重新拉开。当观众为他们的表演鼓掌时，他们鞠躬。当演员们再次鞠躬时，人群中许多人吹口哨欢呼。装扮成公主的明日香，握着真嗣的手，露出傲慢的笑容。两个青少年看到人群中的美里大声地向他们欢呼，甚至还向他们挥舞着手臂。

"You did well Asuka" Shinji commented to her as they faced the audience.  
“你做得很好明日香”当他们面对观众时真嗣对她评价道。

"You didn't do too badly yourself" the redhead replied.  
“你自己做得还不错。”红发回答道。

The cast bowed again, followed by the curtain closing again. The children went off to change out of their costumes and the applause slowly died down. The two eva pilots arrived at the changing rooms and stripped off their costumes, finally glad to be out of those clothes. Their feeling was shared as many of the other students sighed in relief as they took off their garments. Today was particularly hot and the costumes didn't help. It did feel liberating to finally have finished the play though.  
演员们再次鞠躬，随后幕布再次关闭。孩子们去换衣服了，掌声慢慢平息下来。两名EVA飞行员到达更衣室，脱掉了他们的服装，终于很高兴脱掉了这些衣服。当其他学生脱掉衣服时，许多学生都松了口气。今天特别热，穿衣服也没用。不过，最终完成这部戏确实让人感到解放。

"Christ am I glad that's over. Come on Shinji let's go already, I don't care about the teacher's stupid praise, Misato's here so we can go leave" Asuka told him.  
“上帝啊，我很高兴一切都结束了。来吧，真嗣，我们走吧，我不在乎老师愚蠢的表扬，美里在这里，所以我们可以离开了”明日香告诉他。

"Already? But sensei said he really wanted to meet us after the performance" Shinji replied.  
“已经？但是老师说他真的很想在演出结束后见我们。”真嗣回答道。

"Who cares about some old windbag, let's just go home" she demanded.  
“谁在乎那些老废话，我们回家吧”她要求道。

"Oh well, I guess we can finish up on your promise when we get home since we'll have the time" Shinji remarked nonchalantly.  
“哦，好吧，我想我们回家后就可以完成你的承诺，因为我们有时间。”真嗣漫不经心地说。

"You know sensei really wanted to meet us after the performance, maybe we should stay" Asuka shot back venomously.  
“你知道老师真的很想在演出结束后见到我们，也许我们应该留下来”明日香恶毒地回击道。

Shinji smiled slightly before he set his face neutral again. The old teacher came in and addressed the students warmly.  
真嗣微微一笑，然后又恢复了平静的表情。老老师进来了，热情地对学生们讲话。

"Good job everyone, I was surprised to see everyone had remembered their parts even with all the events transpiring in this city. We only just rebuilt the school a week ago and we were able to get everything done by today. Congratulations!" the teacher praised.  
“大家干得好，我很惊讶地看到每个人都记得自己的角色，即使这座城市发生了所有的事情。我们一周前才刚刚重建学校，今天就完成了所有工作。恭喜！”老师表扬了。

"Thank you sensei" the students replied.  
“谢谢老师。”学生们回答道。

"Well, there's no real need to keep you any longer, you are dismissed" the teacher announced.  
“好了，没必要再留你了，你被解雇了。”老师宣布道。

The students rushed out, happy to finally have the play done and off their backs. Asuka took Shinji's hand and pulled him along, eager to leave the school; they got to leave early today because of the play. The two eva pilots made their way back to the stage room to see if Misato was still there. Soon enough, they spotted the tall purple-haired woman among the crowd. Asuka dragged Shinji towards the Major, making sure he wouldn't get lost in the crowd. Unfortunately for Shinji, being forcefully pulled through the crowd caused unintentional collisions with other people. The young boy gave several apologies to the people as he was ploughed through them by a certain redhead.  
学生们冲了出去，很高兴终于把戏演完了，卸下了后背。明日香拉着真嗣的手，拉着他急切地想要离开学校。今天因为有戏，他们必须早点出发。两名EVA飞行员返回舞台室，看看美里是否还在那里。很快，他们就在人群中看到了那个身材高挑的紫发女子。明日香拖着真嗣走向少校，确保他不会在人群中迷失方向。不幸的是，真嗣被强行拉过人群，导致无意中与其他人相撞。当这个小男孩被一个红头发的人犁过时，他向人们多次道歉。

"Just wait a second Asuka" Shinji requested after tripping someone over by accident.  
“等一下明日香”真嗣在不小心绊倒某人后问道。

"Do you have to be so slow?" Asuka asked, irritated.  
“有必要这么慢吗？”明日香恼怒地问道。

"You two fighting again already?" Misato remarked, hugging the two eva pilots together.  
“你们两个又吵架了？”美里说道，同时拥抱了两名 eva 飞行员。

"I think you're suffocating him Misato" Asuka remarked at seeing Shinji's face turn blue.  
“我觉得你让他窒息了，美里。”明日香看到真嗣的脸色变青，说道。

At this comment, Misato removed Shinji's face, who looked dazed, from her chest and crushed his face into Asuka's chest instead.  
听到这句话，美里把真嗣一脸茫然的脸从胸口移开，把脸埋进了明日香的胸口。

"How does that help?" Asuka shouted annoyed, pulling herself out of the embrace.  
“这有什么帮助？”明日香恼怒地大喊一声，从怀里挣脱出来。

"I just thought you were jealous" Misato teased.  
美里调侃道：“我只是以为你嫉妒了。”

"You're the one who shoved his face there you tramp. I think it's obvious he far prefers my chest and-" the redhead began retorting.  
“你就是那个把脸推到那里的人，你这个流浪汉。我认为很明显他更喜欢我的胸部而且——”红发开始反驳。

"Actually Asuka-" Shinji started.  
“其实明日香——”真嗣开口说道。

Asuka gave him a terrifying glare, which instantly shut him up. Satisfied with his silence, the redhead turned back to Misato, smiling triumphantly.  
明日香可怕地瞪了他一眼，让他立刻闭嘴了。红发人对他的沉默感到满意，转身对着美里，露出得意的微笑。

"There you see, he's obedient to me" Asuka replied, playfully patting Shinji's head.  
“你看，他对我很听话。”明日香回答道，开玩笑地拍着真嗣的头。

"Then that means you're just forcing his opinion" Misato commented.  
“那就意味着你只是在强迫他的意见。”美里评论道。

"No way! I'll even ask him" Asuka refuted, turning to face the boy who had a look of fear on his face. "Whose breasts do you like better, mine or Misato's?" the redhead asked sweetly.  
“不可能！我还要问他。”明日香反驳道，转身面对着一脸恐惧的男孩。 “你更喜欢我的胸部和美里的胸部？”红发甜甜地问道。

Now Shinji had seen and felt Asuka's bare breasts many times, but he could not boast the same with Misato. He then smiled mischievously.  
现在，真嗣已经多次看到并触摸过明日香裸露的乳房，但他不能对美里吹嘘同样的事情。然后他顽皮地笑了笑。

"I dunno, I've never tested out Misato's chest" Shinji disclosed.  
“我不知道，我从来没有测试过美里的胸部”真嗣透露道。

Asuka's face was a little shocked and a playful smile crept upon the Major's lips. "Then I declare you test both our chests now and announce the winner" Misato suggested a little too cheerfully.  
明日香的脸色有些震惊，少校的嘴角浮现出一丝俏皮的微笑。 “那么我宣布你们现在测试一下我们的胸部，并宣布获胜者。”美里提议得有点太高兴了。

"What, are you kidding Misato? You're more than twice his age and we're in public, do you want to be labelled as a pedophile" Asuka asked incredulously.  
“什么，你在跟美里开玩笑吗？你的年龄是他的两倍还多，我们在公共场合，你想被贴上恋童癖的标签吗？”明日香不可置信地问道。

"You're just afraid you'll lose" Misato rebuked.  
“你只是害怕自己会输。”美里斥责道。

"Fine whatever, I don't care" Asuka conceded, throwing her arms up in the air.  
“好吧，我不在乎。”明日香承认道，举起双臂。

A few onlookers couldn't help but feel how lucky Shinji was to get to touch the breasts of not one but two beautiful women and get away without injury. Shinji wouldn't pass up a chance to fondle Asuka's breasts and agreed wholeheartedly to the contest.  
一些围观的人不禁感叹真嗣是多么幸运，能够触摸到不是一个而是两个美女的乳房，并且毫发无伤地逃脱。真嗣不会放过抚摸明日香胸部的机会，并全心全意地同意这场比赛。

"Damn perverted baka" Asuka muttered at Shinji's quick compliance.  
“该死的变态笨蛋”明日香对真嗣的迅速服从低声嘀咕道。

"Alright, pick who to try out first" Misato directed.  
“好吧，先选谁试试。”美里指导道。

"Asuka" Shinji replied instantly.  
“飞鸟”真嗣立刻回答道。

The redhead just gave him a glare before turning around. Shinji brought his hands underneath her shirt and moved them up to cup her breasts. Asuka's heart race sped up and she blushed a little at the contact but made no resistance. The young boy continued his actions as he softly kneaded her breasts, making sure to occasionally rub her nipples. The redhead refused to let out a moan and kept her body stoic and unmoving. As always, Asuka's breasts felt wonderful, soft and firm and they were a generous size. _'I swear they seem bigger than last time'_ Shinji thought to himself.  
红发只看了他一眼，就转身了。真嗣把手伸进她的衬衫下面，托起她的乳房。明日香的心跳加速，她因接触而脸红了一点，但没有做出反抗。小男孩继续他的动作，轻轻地揉捏着她的乳房，时不时地揉揉她的乳头。红发不肯发出一声呻吟，身体保持着坚忍，一动不动。和往常一样，明日香的胸部感觉美妙、柔软、坚挺，而且尺寸很大。 “我发誓它们看起来比上次更大”真嗣心里想。

"I think you've 'tested' them enough Shinji" Asuka let out menacingly.  
“我认为你已经对他们进行了足够的‘测试’，真嗣”明日香威胁道。

Taking the hint, Shinji removed his hands and smiled sheepishly at his fiancée. The boy turned towards Misato and approached her.  
真嗣明白了这一点，松开了手，对未婚妻不好意思地笑了笑。男孩转向美里并靠近她。

"1000 yen says the tall lady wins" one man declared.  
一名男子宣称：“1000 日元表示高个子女士获胜”。

"No way! I bet 10000 yen the redhead wins" another man said.  
“不可能！我赌10000日元，红头发的人赢了。”另一名男子说道。

"Impossible, the older woman definitely has larger breasts" the first man remarked.  
“不可能，年纪大的女人胸部肯定更大。”第一个人说道。

"It's not about the size of them but the feel of them" a third man commented.  
“这不在于它们的大小，而在于它们的感觉”第三位男子评论道。

"I'm inclined to agree" a fourth man concurred.  
“我倾向于同意”第四个人表示同意。

"That would make sense" the first man agreed, nodding.  
“这是有道理的”第一个人点头同意。

"You are wise in the ways of women's chests" the second man added.  
“你在女性胸部方面很聪明，”第二个男人补充道。

Facing Misato's back, Shinji brought his hands under the Major's shirt and moved them up to her breasts. _'There's no way I'm going to fondle my guardian's chest, this was just an excuse to fondle Asuka's breasts'_ Shinji thought. The young boy moved his hands, pretending to feel Misato's breasts.  
真嗣面对美里的背影，把手伸进少校的衬衫下面，移到她的胸部。 “我不可能去抚摸我的监护人的胸部，这只是抚摸明日香胸部的借口”真嗣想。少年动了动双手，假装触摸美里的胸部。

"Oh Shinji" Misato said playfully, infuriating a certain redhead.  
“哦，真嗣。”美里俏皮地说，激怒了某红发。

"Why is she even letting you touch her?" Asuka asked, annoyed.  
“为什么她还让你碰她？”明日香生气地问道。

"Ok I'm done" Shinji stated, removing his hands from Misato. He had tested the Major much faster than Asuka.  
“好吧，我完成了。”真嗣说着，把手从美里身上拿开。他对少校的考验比明日香快得多。

The two women looked at him expectantly as he put on a mask of concentration, pretending to decide whose breasts were better.  
两个女人满怀期待地看着他，而他则戴上一副全神贯注的面具，假装在判断谁的胸部更好。

"Hmmm" he let out, dragging it out as long as he could. Asuka couldn't help her eye twitching.  
“嗯”了一声，他尽可能地拖了拖。明日香忍不住眼角抽搐。

"How long does it take to work out the obvious?" Asuka spat angrily.  
“弄清楚显而易见的事情需要多长时间？”明日香愤怒地吐口水。

"Ok I've decided" Shinji finally said. "It's a very hard decision, both breasts are a nice size, but Misato's are bigger" Shinji started. Asuka gave him a glare but said nothing. "However, size isn't the only thing that matters. The softness, shape and firmness also count" he said continuing, trying to make up as much bullshit as he could. "The shape of Asuka's breasts is definitely more favourable and both breasts are soft and firm, so I declare that both breasts win, it's a tie" he finished.  
“好吧，我决定了。”真嗣最终说道。 “这是一个非常艰难的决定，两个乳房都很大，但美里的更大，”真嗣开始说道。明日香瞪了他一眼，但什么也没说。 “然而，尺寸并不是唯一重要的因素。柔软度、形状和硬度也很重要。”他继续说道，试图尽可能地编造一些废话。 “明日香的乳房形状肯定更有利，而且两个乳房都柔软又坚挺，所以我宣布两个乳房都赢了，平局”他最后说道。

"That boy is an artisan, a master of women's breasts!" the crowd of men shouted.  
“那小子是位工匠，是女性乳房的大师！”人群大喊。

"You're such a prick Ikari!" Asuka shouted. She stormed off, completely annoyed at her fiancé's behaviour.  
“碇你真是个混蛋！”明日香喊道。她怒气冲冲地走了，对未婚夫的行为感到非常恼火。

"You didn't even touch my chest Shinji, why didn't you just say Asuka's were better? I couldn't care less, I was just joking about that contest to be honest" Misato commented to Shinji.  
“你甚至没有碰我的胸部，真嗣，你为什么不直接说明日香的更好？我不在乎，说实话，我只是在开玩笑那场比赛”美里对真嗣评论道。

"I just felt like having some fun, I'll always think her breasts are the best no matter what" Shinji admitted.  
“我只是想找点乐子，无论如何我都会认为她的胸部是最好的”真嗣承认。

"Ha! I knew it, you dickhead!" Asuka shouted from behind them.  
“哈！我就知道了，你这个白痴！”明日香在他们身后喊道。

Both guardian and ward jumped in surprise and turned around to see Asuka smiling smugly at Misato.  
监护人和被监护人都吓了一跳，转头就看到明日香对美里得意地笑了。

"Well, I usually don't like to rub it in Misato" Asuka started.  
“嗯，我通常不喜欢在美里身上擦它”明日香开口道。

_'Yeah right'_ they both thought.  
“是啊，对”他们都想。

"But… I TOLD YOU SO! It is quite obvious that my chest is superior" the redhead stated matter-of-factly.  
“但是……我早就告诉过你了！很明显，我的胸部更胜一筹。”红发实事求是地说。

"Yeah, yeah you win Asuka. Now let's go already, this place is too crowded" Misato replied, hating Asuka's arrogant attitude when she was right or thought she was right.  
“是啊，是啊，你赢了明日香。现在我们走吧，这里太拥挤了。”美里回答道，她讨厌明日香在她是对的或自认为是对的时候表现出的傲慢态度。

"Mmm I agree" Asuka concurred, wanting to leave as well.  
“嗯，我同意。”明日香附和着，也想离开。

Much of the crowd had cleared from the exit area of the stage room and so the three roommates headed towards there, making their way through the crowd of adults once again; this time without Asuka pulling Shinji through, preventing any potential accidents occurring like before.  
舞台出口处的人群已经散去，三个室友又朝那里走去，再次穿过大人的人群；这次没有明日香拉真嗣过去，避免了像以前那样发生任何潜在的事故。

"So" Misato began, "I thought that play wasn't too bad. The storyline was pretty shoddy, but the student's acting sure made up for it. I mean I found it enjoyable to watch, especially that wonderful kiss scene, did you hear me cheering?" Misato explained.  
“所以，”美里开始说道，“我觉得这部戏还不错。故事情节很糟糕，但学生的表演确实弥补了这一点。我的意思是我觉得很有趣，尤其是那场精彩的吻戏，是吗？听到我欢呼了吗？”美里解释道。

"You were so loud I'd be surprised if all of Tokyo-3 didn't hear you" Asuka remarked.  
“你声音太大了，如果第三东京都没有听到你的声音，我会感到惊讶，”明日香说道。

"Quiet you" Misato snapped at her. "Now back to what I was saying, I couldn't help but be reminded of the day when I was watching you two practising the play, back when you two were still apart and attempting to do the kiss scene…"  
“你安静点。”美里冲她厉声说道。 “言归正传，我不禁想起了那天我看着你们两个排练戏，当时你们两个还没有分开，试图拍吻戏的时候……”


_**Misato spat out her beer. "You two have to kiss?" she asked, laughing.  
美里把啤酒喷了出来。 “你们两个一定要接吻吗？”她笑着问道。**_

_**"Don't blow in Misato" Asuka snapped angrily.  
“别向美里吹气。”明日香愤怒地说道。**_

_**"I will take the day off work just to see you two kiss in that play, man it'll be worth it" Misato teased, giggling.  
“我会请一天假，只是为了看到你们两个在那部戏中接吻，伙计，这是值得的”美里笑着说道。**_

_**"Misato!" Asuka threatened.  
“美里！”明日香威胁道。**_

_**"Oh don't let me stop you, go ahead and practise it. Or are you afraid of kissing a little boy like Shinji?" Misato said mischievously.  
“哦，别让我阻止你，你去练习吧。还是你害怕亲吻像真嗣这样的小男孩？”美里顽皮地说道。**_

_**"I'm not afraid of anything!" the redhead said indignantly.  
“我什么都不怕！”红发人愤怒的说道。**_

_**The young girl grabbed Shinji by the neck and pulled him into a deep lip lock. Misato gave Shinji two thumbs up as she grinned cheekily.  
少女抓住真嗣的脖子，将他深深地锁住。美里对真嗣竖起两个大拇指，露出厚脸皮的笑容。**_


"Never had to take the day off work though, thanks to you guys, NERV isn't needed anymore. Hell, we already decommissioned the evangelions" Misato finished.  
“不过从来不用请假，多亏了你们，不再需要NERV了。天啊，我们已经让新世纪福音战士退役了。”美里说道。

"Yes and now you're behaving even lazier than before" Asuka remarked.  
“是的，现在你表现得比以前更懒了。”明日香说道。

Misato was about to retort when Shinji cut her off, "But of course Misato, don't forget your role as well. You saved our lives and took care of the aftermath"  
美里正要反驳，真嗣打断了她的话，“当然，美里，也别忘了你的角色。你救了我们的命，还处理了善后事宜。”

"God, even after saving the world I couldn't escape the paperwork" Misato whined, recalling the horror of countless sleepless nights.  
“天哪，即使拯救了世界，我也无法摆脱文书工作。”美里哀嚎着，回忆起无数个不眠之夜的恐怖。

The trio had already made it outside the stage room and were heading back home. The sun was still high up in the sky as it was just after midday.  
三人已经走出舞台，准备回家了。正午刚过，太阳还高高地挂在天空中。

"Wasn't there any other NERV staff that could help you?" Shinji asked.  
“没有其他NERV工作人员可以帮助你吗？”真嗣问道。

"With your father dead, organisation was slow. Also, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki declined the Commander position, shoving it onto me. As I was the Commander, responsibility fell onto me and everyone made up excuses to get out of doing it. Ritsuko said she needed to help with all the casualties involved, Kaji said he needed to investigate the death of Commander Ikari" Misato answered.  
“你父亲去世后，组织工作进展缓慢。而且，冬月副司令拒绝了指挥官的职位，把它推给了我。因为我是指挥官，所以责任就落在了我身上，大家都找借口逃避。律子说道。她需要帮助处理所有涉及的人员伤亡，梶说他需要调查碇司令的死因。”美里回答道。

Asuka scoffed at hearing that. A couple of cars passed by, beeping madly as they walked; did fate even scorn him?  
明日香闻言嗤之以鼻。几辆车驶过，一边走一边发出疯狂的嘟嘟声；命运甚至蔑视他吗？

"I mean… I know everyone is glad he died anyway, I doubt Kaji actually cares about who killed him" Misato said disdainfully.  
“我的意思是……我知道每个人都很高兴他死了，我怀疑加持是否真的关心谁杀了他”美里轻蔑地说。

"He is still my father and I had some things I wanted to tell him, but it's too late now" Shinji replied, a little annoyed.  
“他仍然是我的父亲，我有些话想告诉他，但现在已经太晚了。”真嗣回答道，有点恼火。

"Yeah yeah I know, but I doubt we'll find out what happened and at this stage it doesn't really matter, NERV has been dissolved" Misato finished.  
“是的，是的，我知道，但我怀疑我们会查出发生了什么，在这个阶段，这并不重要，NERV 已经解散了”美里结束道。

"Well now that Unit 01 has been decommissioned, I hope my mother's soul was freed so that she will finally be with him. In the end, that's all he wanted" Shinji stated.  
“现在01号机已经退役了，我希望我母亲的灵魂能够得到释放，这样她就能最终和他在一起。最终，这就是他想要的。”真嗣说道。

The two women stayed silent as the three continued their walk to their apartment. As they walked, people would greet them or nod at them, acknowledging their efforts in saving the city. It was quite awkward at first, but the three had already gotten used to the attention and they were happy that people appreciated what they had done.  
当三人继续朝公寓走去时，两名妇女保持沉默。当他们行走时，人们会向他们打招呼或向他们点头，承认他们为拯救城市所做的努力。一开始很尴尬，但三人已经习惯了这种关注，他们很高兴人们赞赏他们所做的事情。

After a while, Asuka decided to break the silence. "Speaking of Unit 01, I recall in the final battle it took you quite some time to get Unit 01 up to speed, we only just saved Touji too. What exactly happened down there?" she asked.  
过了一会儿，明日香决定打破沉默。 “说到01号机，我记得在最后的战斗中，你们花了相当长的时间才让01号机跟上进度，我们才刚刚救了东次。那下面究竟发生了什么？”她问。

"It was your fault!" Shinji replied. "When you took out my entry plug to get me inside your eva after defeating the angel, you left it on the ground. You didn't think I had the strength to lift the plug and insert it into my eva myself, did you?"  
“都是你的错！”真嗣回答道。 “当你在击败天使后拿出我的入口插头让我进入你的eva时，你把它留在了地上。你不认为我有力量自己抬起插头并将其插入我的eva，是吗？ ”

"No of course not you baka, placing your entry plug back into your eva wasn't really on my mind at the time. So how did you get Unit 01 started?" Asuka asked curiously.  
“不，当然不是你笨蛋，当时我并没有真正考虑过将你的入口插头放回你的 eva 中。那么你是如何启动 01 号单元的呢？”明日香好奇地问道。

Shinji then began to explain the sequence of events that led to the activation of Unit 01…  
真嗣随后开始解释导致 01 号机启动的事件顺序……


_**"Please!" the young boy pleaded, "You've protected me all those times, when I first came to NERV, when I fought the first angel and also against the 12th and 14th angels. This time I need your help more than ever. I don't want everyone to die, I want to have happiness" he said, tears trickling down his cheeks.  
“请！”小男孩恳求道：“你一直在保护我，当我第一次来到NERV时，当我与第一天使战斗时，也与第十二和第十四天使战斗时。这一次我比以往任何时候都更需要你的帮助。我不”我不想让每个人都死，我想要幸福”，他说，泪水从脸颊上流下来。**_

_**The biomechanical robot was untouched and lay there as motionlessly as before. The male eva pilot slumped to the ground and brought his knees to his chest. He sobbed silently; his only regret was that he wasn't going to live his last moments with Asuka.  
生物机械机器人没有受到任何影响，像以前一样一动不动地躺在那里。男EVA飞行员倒在地上，膝盖抵在胸前。他无声地抽泣着；他唯一的遗憾是他没有和明日香一起度过最后的时光。**_

_**Suddenly, Shinji heard a gunshot ring out and looked up surprised to see Kaji holding his gun up, aimed at Unit 01. He fired a few more times, the bullets harmlessly bouncing off the thick armour of the evangelion. To say Shinji was surprised was an understatement.  
突然，真嗣听到一声枪响，抬头惊讶地看到梶举起枪，瞄准了01号。他又开了几枪，子弹从新世纪福音战士厚重的装甲上弹了回来，没有造成任何伤害。说真嗣感到惊讶是轻描淡写的。**_

_**"Get up you stupid hunk of metal! How can you just sit there not caring?" Kaji shouted angrily at the unmoving evangelion.  
“站起来，你这个愚蠢的金属块！你怎么能坐在那里漠不关心？”加治对着一动不动的新世纪福音战士愤怒地喊道。**_

_**"Kaji I don't-" Shinji started.  
“加持，我不——”真嗣开口说道。**_

_**"No! I WILL make this evangelion startup!" Kaji shouted again.  
“不！我会让这个新世纪福音战士启动！”卡吉再次大喊。**_

_**He then turned around aiming his gun at Shinji and fired, the bullets passing by him dangerously close. Shinji fell to the ground in shock; was Kaji going to kill him?  
然后他转身用枪瞄准真嗣并开枪，子弹从他身边擦过，距离很近，非常危险。真嗣震惊地倒在地上；卡吉要杀他吗？**_

_**"Yeah?! Are you willing to let your son die, you stupid woman?" Kaji provoked.  
“是啊？！你愿意让你的儿子死吗，你这个蠢女人？”加治挑衅道。**_

_**Shinji swore he saw the evangelion's eyes flash very faintly but dismissed it as his imagination. Kaji fired a few more bullets at Shinji, one grazing his arm making him cry out from the pain.  
真嗣发誓他看到新世纪福音战士的眼睛非常微弱地闪烁，但他认为这只是他的幻觉。加治又向真嗣开了几枪，其中一颗擦伤了他的手臂，让他疼得大叫起来。**_

_**"Just typical, women are so selfish and lazy! You can't even be bothered to help your son who is about to be killed by a psychotic spy. Why are women always so indecisive? You slept with that asshole Ikari and gave birth to Shinji. Take some responsibility you stupid fuck!" Kaji screamed. He then pulled his trousers down, revealing something nobody wanted to see, well except maybe Misato.  
“典型的，女人就是这么自私和懒惰！连自己即将被变态特务杀死的儿子都懒得去帮助。女人怎么总是这么优柔寡断？你跟碇那个混蛋睡了，还生了个孩子？”慎二，你这个笨蛋，负点责任吧！”卡吉尖叫起来。然后他把裤子脱下来，露出了没人愿意看到的东西，也许除了美里之外。**_


Shinji had to stop talking _and_ walking as the two females were on the floor crying from laughter. "It wasn't funny at the time, stop laughing already" he said, annoyed.  
真嗣不得不停止说话和行走，因为两个女人在地板上笑得哭起来。 “当时不好笑，别笑了，”他生气地说。

"No wonder Kaji was always quiet about that event" Misato commented.  
“难怪加持对那件事总是保持沉默”美里评论道。

"Keep in mind he wasn't all himself, he thought you were dead and he couldn't sit by and let everyone else die. Although, I was a bit scared he was going to kill me" Shinji explained.  
“记住，他并不完全是他自己，他认为你已经死了，他不能袖手旁观，让其他人死去。尽管如此，我有点害怕他会杀了我。”真嗣解释道。

"Just finish the story already" Asuka prompted, growing impatient.  
“快把故事讲完吧”明日香提示道，越来越不耐烦了。

Shinji started walking again and the others followed suit. "Alright then, you might be thinking why I'm telling you about this, well it's because…"  
真嗣又开始向前走，其他人也跟着走了。 “好吧，你可能会想我为什么要告诉你这件事，那是因为……”


_**Kaji's rant was short-lived as he was flung across the cavern by a mechanical hand; Unit 01 had activated! Shinji was completely bewildered by Kaji's behaviour but he didn't want him to die now. Running over to where he lay, Shinji checked on him. The male eva pilot heard some groaning and smiled happily.  
卡吉的咆哮声很短暂，他被一只机械手扔到了洞穴的另一边； 01号机已启动！真嗣对加持的行为感到完全困惑，但他现在不想让他死。真嗣跑到他躺着的地方查看他的情况。男EVA飞行员听到一些呻吟声，开心地笑了。**_

**"**_**Are you okay Kaji?" Shinji asked, concerned.**_  
“卡吉你还好吗？”慎二关切地问道。

**"**_**I'm fine kid, just go and finish all of this" Kaji managed to say.**_  
“我很好，孩子，去完成这一切吧”梶勉强说道。

_**The young boy didn't want to leave him alone here, but he didn't have the time to help him; with Unit 01 activated he had to go and free Asuka's and Rei's evangelions. Reluctantly, Shinji moved back to Unit 01.  
小男孩不想把他一个人留在这里，但他没有时间帮助他；随着 01 号机的启动，他必须去解救明日香和丽的福音战士。真嗣无奈地搬回了01号单位。**_

**"**_**Thank you mother, I promise I will do my best to live on for your sake" Shinji told the activated evangelion.**_  
“谢谢你，妈妈，我保证为了你我会尽力活下去”真嗣对激活的新世纪福音战士说道。

_**The young boy then entered the entry plug and closed the hatch. He wasn't in his plugsuit, so his school uniform would have to suffice. Suddenly, Shinji could feel the sense of weightlessness as the entry plug was lifted off the ground and inserted into the eva. The eva pilot felt the familiar feeling of the plug being filled with LCL and the synchronisation of himself with the evangelion. Soon, he was ready and Unit 01 stood up; finally glad that he could save the others. Being reminded by his current mission, he decided not to waste any time.  
然后小男孩进入入口塞并关闭舱门。他没有穿紧身衣，所以他的校服就足够了。突然，当入口插头被提离地面并插入eva时，真嗣感受到了失重的感觉。 eva飞行员感受到了塞满拼箱的熟悉感觉以及自己与新世纪福音战士的同步。很快，他就准备好了，01部队站了起来；终于庆幸自己能够拯救其他人了。被眼前的任务提醒，他决定不再浪费时间。**_

_**Shinji quickly made sure Kaji was ok, picking him up and putting him in the light at least. He then began running off full sprint towards heaven's gate, remembering Ritsuko's words on retrieving the Lance of Longinus. With the size of the eva's bounds, the trek was very short and the cavern no longer seemed as ominous as it had. Upon entering the gate, he saw the familiar sight of the eva graveyard and the massive form of Lillith crucified on the cross by the Lance of Longinus.  
真嗣很快确认了加持的状况，把他抱起来，至少把他放在了灯光下。然后，他记起律子关于取回朗基努斯之枪的话，开始全力冲刺，奔向天堂之门。由于伊娃的范围如此之大，跋涉的时间非常短，洞穴也不再像以前那样不祥。一进大门，他就看到了伊娃墓地熟悉的景象，以及被朗基努斯之枪钉在十字架上的莉莉丝巨大身躯。**_

_**The young boy quickly willed his eva over to the giant white being and began to pull on the enormous Lance. The Lance hadn't been moved for a while and as such he found some difficulty pulling out the weapon. However, it didn't take too long for him to pull it free and as he did, Lilith regenerated its lower body. Having the weapon in hand, he turned around and exited the area, making a mad dash towards the eva elevator; as it could not be used by humans and it didn't go to the surface they didn't bother taking it out, a most fortunate outcome for Shinji.  
小男孩迅速将他的伊娃拉向巨大的白色生物，并开始拉动巨大的兰斯。长枪已经有一段时间没有移动了，因此他发现拔出武器有些困难。然而，没过多久，他就将它拔了出来，莉莉丝的下半身也随之再生了。他拿着武器，转身离开了这个区域，疯狂的冲向了EVA电梯。因为它不能被人类使用，也不会浮到地表，所以他们懒得把它拿出来，这对真嗣来说是最幸运的结果。**_

_**As Unit 01 entered the elevator, it started moving up to the eva cages. The eva pilot impatiently tapped his heel as he waited for the elevator to reach the eva cages, creating a loud noise as Unit 01's foot tapped the elevator floor. Finally arriving at his desired level, Shinji quickly moved off the elevator and proceeded to smash the solid red Bakelite that was hindering the other two evangelions. He could see Asuka screaming and yelling at him for being so slow and to make sure not to damage her evangelion in any way.  
当01号机进入电梯后，它开始向上移动到逃生笼。等待电梯到达逃生轿厢时，逃生飞行员不耐烦地跺着脚后跟，01号机组的脚踩在电梯地板上，发出巨大的噪音。终于到达了他想要的高度，真嗣迅速离开了电梯，开始砸碎阻碍另外两个新世纪福音战士的实心红色胶木。他可以看到明日香对他尖叫并大喊大叫，因为他太慢了，并确保不要以任何方式损坏她的福音战士。**_


"…and well you know the rest" Shinji finished.  
“……剩下的你都知道了”真嗣说完。

"Who woulda thought it only took some insulting to get an eva started?" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“谁会想到只需要一些侮辱就能让伊娃开始呢？”明日香讽刺地说。

"Actually Unit 01 had an S2 Engine" Shinji explained.  
“实际上 01 号机有一台 S2 引擎”真嗣解释道。

"I think you missed the sarcasm boy" Asuka snapped at him.  
“我想你错过了那个讽刺男孩”明日香对他厉声说道。

"Now now, no need to start fighting again, we're almost home. Shinji can make us something great to eat" Misato said cheerily.  
“现在好了，不用再打了，我们快到家了。真嗣可以给我们做好吃的。”美里高兴地说。

Indeed, the explanation for Unit 01's activation had passed the time quite rapidly; in fact, the trio had stopped many times along the way as they were so absorbed in the story.  
确实，01号机启动的解释已经过得很快了；事实上，三人一路上停了很多次，因为他们全神贯注于这个故事。

"Oh, that reminds me!" Asuka announced suddenly. "I remembered something else. I recall Shinji making these extremely wonderful waffles. They were absolutely mouth-watering, so please make them again Shinji, I have a craving for them" she said eagerly.  
“哦，这让我想起了！”明日香突然宣布。 “我还记得一件事。我记得真嗣做了这些非常美味的华夫饼。它们绝对令人垂涎欲滴，所以请再做一次，真嗣，我很想吃它们”她急切地说。

Shinji almost tripped over while Misato sweat dropped recalling the "ingredients" those waffles were made of. Both Misato and Shinji gave each other a "no way" look.  
真嗣差点被绊倒，美里回忆起华夫饼的“原料”，汗水直流。美里和真嗣对视一眼，露出“不行”的表情。

"Umm Asuka, I don't think it's such a good idea. I'll make something else" Shinji suggested.  
“嗯，明日香，我觉得这不是一个好主意。我会做点别的东西。”真嗣建议道。

"Come off it, they're just waffles. How hard can they be to make?" Asuka replied.  
“别这样，它们只是华夫饼。它们能有多难做呢？”明日香回答道。

"No really Asuka, I don't have the ingredients to make them again" Shinji said, trying to weasel out of making those waffles.  
“不，明日香，我没有再次制作它们的原料”真嗣说道，试图避免制作那些华夫饼。

"Asuka, Shinji's right. I really think it's better he doesn't make them" Misato added, desperately trying to forget the incident.  
“明日香，真嗣是对的。我真的认为他最好不要制造它们。”美里补充道，拼命试图忘记这件事。

"What's the big deal? Just give me money and I'll even buy the ingredients myself!" Asuka offered, starting to grow annoyed at both of them and their refusal to have the waffles. They had tasted so good, what was the issue?  
“有什么大不了的？给我钱，我自己去买材料！”明日香提议道，他开始对他们俩拒绝吃华夫饼感到恼火。他们的味道这么好，有什么问题吗？

"Look… you can't buy those ingredients, just forget about it" Misato said, growing anxious. Her facial expression clearly showed she wanted Asuka to move to another topic.  
“你看……那些原料你买不到，算了。”美里说道，变得越来越焦虑。她的表情清楚地表明她希望明日香转移到另一个话题。

"What the hell do you mean? What in God's name did you put in them Shinji?" Asuka asked stubbornly, unwilling to stand down.  
“你到底是什么意思？看在上帝的份上，真嗣你到底在里面放了什么？”明日香固执地问道，不愿退下。

"IGNORANCE IS BLISS ASUKA, JUST DROP IT!" Misato shouted at the redhead.  
“无知是福明日香，丢掉它吧！”美里对着红发大喊道。

"Misato please calm down, you're making it worse" Shinji said, sweat dropping.  
“美里，请冷静一点，你会让事情变得更糟。”真嗣说，汗水流了下来。

"Nothing is going to be hidden from me! You _will_ tell me what you put into those waffles right now!" Asuka demanded, furious.  
“没有什么可以瞒过我的！你现在就告诉我你在那些华夫饼里放了什么！”明日香愤怒地问道。

"Ok fine… but Asuka you must promise not to inflict any physical or mental pain on either of us if I tell you" Shinji said adamantly.  
“好吧……但是明日香，你必须保证，如果我告诉你，你不会给我们任何人带来任何身体或精神上的痛苦。”真嗣坚定地说。

"Alright fine" Asuka said, rolling her eyes, wondering what could possibly be so bad about waffles.  
“好吧，好吧，”明日香翻了个白眼，想知道华夫饼到底有什么不好。

Shinji noticed they had arrived at their apartment already; their discussion really had passed the time. However, there was still much traffic out and about and the sun was really scorching. Stopping outside the building, he decided it was better he told her inside.  
真嗣发现他们已经到了公寓。他们的讨论确实已经过去了。然而，外面的交通仍然很拥挤，而且太阳也很毒辣。在大楼外停了下来，他决定最好在里面告诉她。

"Let's go inside first, then I'll tell you" Shinji replied.  
“我们先进去吧，然后我再告诉你。”真嗣回答道。

"Yes, yes whatever. Let's just go inside then" Asuka said impatiently.  
“是的，是的，无论如何。那我们就进去吧。”明日香不耐烦地说。

The trio made their way inside the apartment building and entered the elevator. After pressing their floor number, the three of them leant against the elevator wall, keeping an awkward silence between them. The redhead eyed the other two occupants suspiciously while they avoided her gaze. _'And here I thought I had remembered every secret'_ Asuka thought.  
三人走进公寓楼，进入电梯。按下楼层号码后，三人靠在电梯壁上，保持着尴尬的沉默。红发疑惑地看着另外两个人，而他们则避开了她的目光。 “我以为我已经记住了每一个秘密”明日香想。

Upon arriving at their level, the elevator doors opened and the three roommates made their way to their door. Shinji silently prayed that something would happen, like him passing out from the heat but alas his prayers went unanswered. Misato took out her key, unlocking the door before opening it and rushing inside.  
到达他们所在的楼层后，电梯门打开，三个室友向门口走去。真嗣默默地祈祷会发生什么事情，比如他因热而昏倒，但可惜的是，他的祈祷没有得到回应。美里拿出钥匙，打开门，然后冲了进去。

_'Don't leave me alone Misato!'_ Shinji thought as he saw the purple-haired woman retreat inside.  
“美里，别丢下我一个人！”看到紫发女子退到里面，真嗣这样想着。

"Come on, get in already" Asuka prodded, pushing Shinji through the front door.  
“来吧，进来吧。”明日香催促着，推着真嗣进了前门。

"I'm going, I'm going. Calm down" he replied.  
“我去，我去。冷静点。”他回答道。

After entering through the front door, Asuka closed the door behind her, locked it and turned to face Shinji. The boy quickly scanned the room, noticing the Major had escaped to her room. Stepping back, the boy found himself being held back forcefully by the redhead. As it was impossible to flee, the male eva pilot returned his attention to the increasingly impatient redhead.  
从前门进去后，明日香关上身后的门，锁上，然后转身面向真嗣。男孩迅速扫视了一下房间，发现少校已经逃到了她的房间。男孩往后退了一步，却发现自己被红发人用力地拦住了。由于无法逃跑，男逃生飞行员将注意力又转移到了越来越不耐烦的红发身上。

"Spit it out already third child, I really don't like to wait" she demanded, glaring at him.  
“已经是第三个孩子了，我真的不喜欢等。”她怒视着他，要求道。

"Jeez, I don't know why you're so interested, but trust me you're better off not knowing" Shinji insisted.  
“天哪，我不知道你为什么这么感兴趣，但相信我，你最好不知道”真嗣坚持道。

"Just tell me!" she snapped, her patience worn.  
“就告诉我嘛！”她厉声说道，她的耐心已经耗尽。

The male eva pilot found himself opening and closing his mouth, trying to think up of a plausible excuse. However, with the whole thing being made into a huge deal, it was pretty much impossible to make up a lie that would convince the redhead. Sighing, the boy decided he would disclose half the secret.  
男性EVA飞行员发现自己张开又闭上嘴，试图想出一个貌似合理的借口。不过，事情闹大了，想要编出一个能让红发信服的谎言，几乎是不可能的。男孩叹了口气，决定透露一半的秘密。

"Ok fine, the secret ingredient in those stupid waffles is… is my…my semen" he answered, finishing quietly.  
“好吧，那些愚蠢的华夫饼的秘密成分是……是我的……我的精液”他回答，安静地结束了。

"Eh? I must've heard you wrong, I swear you said semen" Asuka replied.  
“呃？我一定是听错了，我发誓你说的是精液”明日香回答道。

"You heard right, that's what I said. I was playing a prank on you, unfortunate that Misato tried them as well" Shinji explained.  
“你没听错，我就是这么说的。我是在跟你开个玩笑，不幸的是美里也尝试了它们。”真嗣解释道。

"What the hell? You put your _semen_ into those waffles?" Asuka asked disbelievingly.  
“到底什么？你把精液放进那些华夫饼里了？”明日香不可置信地问道。

"That's what I said. See, I knew you wouldn't want to know" Shinji replied timidly.  
“我就是这么说的。瞧，我就知道你不会想知道的。”真嗣胆怯地回答道。

Asuka grabbed Shinji's collar and stared at him menacingly. "This better not be some sick joke, because it really isn't funny" she threatened.  
明日香抓住真嗣的衣领，恶狠狠地盯着他。 “这最好不要是一些恶心的笑话，因为它真的不好笑，”她威胁道。

"Asuka, remember your promise" Shinji let out in fear. Sighing, the redhead let go of him and the boy recomposed himself. "Why do you think we were so reluctant to tell you?" Shinji continued.  
“明日香，记住你的承诺。”真嗣惊恐地喊道。叹了口气，红发放开了他，男孩重新平静下来。 “你觉得我们为什么这么不愿意告诉你？”真嗣继续说道。

"But how would Misato know?" Asuka asked.  
“但是美里怎么会知道呢？”明日香问道。

"She wanted me to make them again and nothing would convince her against making them again, so I told her" Shinji answered. _'Go figure how stubborn women can be'_ he thought to himself.  
“她想让我再做一次，但没有什么能说服她反对再做一次，所以我告诉了她。”真嗣回答道。 “你去想想女人有多固执”他心里想。

"That is so disgusting! You've put me off waffles for life you stupid moron! What could have possibly been going through your mind to do something so outrageous?" she asked, bewildered.  
“这太恶心了！你这辈子都不让我吃华夫饼了，你这个愚蠢的白痴！你脑子里到底在想什么，才会做出如此无耻的事？”她困惑地问道。

"I just wanted to get you back in a way that you would never find out. But it's in the past Asuka, I can't change it now. Besides you liked the taste!" Shinji said, defending himself.  
“我只是想以一种你永远不会发现的方式让你回来。但那已经是过去的明日香了，我现在无法改变它。而且你喜欢这个味道！”真嗣一边为自己辩护一边说道。

"It doesn't matter; it's the principal of the point! We are both engaged now and I haven't ever let you cum into my mouth, let alone when we were single!" Asuka shouted at him.  
“没关系，这是重点！我们现在都订婚了，我从来没有让你射到我嘴里，更何况我们还是单身的时候！”明日香对他喊道。

"Maybe that should change!" Shinji countered.  
“也许这应该改变！”慎二反驳道。

"I am never going to give you a blowjob Ikari!" she refuted.  
“我永远不会给你口交碇！”她反驳道。

"And why is that?" he asked.  
“为什么是这样？”他问。

"Why should I have to put your cock in my mouth?" she replied.  
“为什么我要把你的鸡巴放进我的嘴里？”她回应。

"It's not about 'having to,' and where is the problem in putting my cock in your mouth?" he replied back.  
“这不是‘必须’的问题，把我的鸡巴放进你嘴里有什么问题吗？”他回复道。

"Because it's big, ugly and dirty" she answered.  
“因为它又大又丑又脏”她回答道。

"But you let it in your vagina?" he asked confused.,  
“但是你让它进入你的阴道了？”他困惑地问道，

"I don't have to see it or taste it there, do I?" she countered.  
“我不必在那里看到或品尝它，不是吗？”她反驳道。

"I have given you oral sex _many_ times Asuka, do you see me having a problem with it?" Shinji retorted.  
“我已经给明日香给你口交很多次了，你觉得我有问题吗？”慎二反驳道。

"My vagina is much prettier to look at and as a woman I keep it clean" she replied.  
“我的阴道看起来更漂亮，作为一个女人，我会保持它的清洁”她回答道。

"God, _you_ are so ridiculous!" he shot back.  
“天哪，你太可笑了！”他还击了。

"_You_ should understand by now, I will NOT submit in bed" Asuka declared.  
“你现在应该明白了，我不会在床上屈服。”明日香宣称。

The boy sighed. "Asuka you should stop being so selfish all the time and do things for me once in a while"  
男孩叹了口气。 “明日香你不要总是这么自私，偶尔为我做点事吧”

"I've done many things for you! What are you saying?" Asuka said, a little offended.  
“我为你做了很多事！你说什么？”明日香有些生气地说道。

"Yes you have, but only when it has benefited you as well. I'm talking about something just for me" Shinji explained.  
“是的，你有，但前提是这对你也有好处。我正在谈论一些只适合我的事情。”真嗣解释道。

The redhead suddenly stayed silent, knowing it was pretty much true. Asuka couldn't really bring up in her head a time where she did something purely for Shinji.  
红发突然沉默了，他知道这几乎是真的。明日香实在无法在脑海中回忆起她纯粹为真嗣做事的那段时光。

"Anyway, I was going to make us something to eat. I'm sure you don't want me to make waffles, right?" Shinji said, breaking the silence.  
“不管怎样，我本来是要去给我们做点吃的。我肯定你不想让我做华夫饼，对吧？”慎二打破沉默说道。

"Uhh yeah" she replied, feeling a little guilty.  
“嗯，是的。”她回答道，心里有些愧疚。

With that, the male eva pilot went off to the kitchen to prepare his roommates a meal. The redhead sat down on the couch with a sigh. In all honesty she had tried to behave nicer towards her fiancé, but it was harder for her than she had thought. The young girl was so used to doing what she wanted without question, it had become instinct. _'Why is he making me feel guilty over something so stupid? I should be angry at him for doing something so disgusting to me in the past'_ she thought.  
说完，男EVA飞行员就去厨房给室友们准备饭菜。红发女郎坐在沙发上，叹了口气。老实说，她试图对她的未婚夫表现得更好，但这对她来说比她想象的要困难。少女已经习惯了毫无疑问地做自己想做的事，这已经成为了本能。 “为什么他要让我对如此愚蠢的事情感到内疚？”我应该对他生气，因为他过去做了一些让我恶心的事。”她想。

Noticing the lack of noise, Misato walked back into the living room and saw the redhead sitting down on the couch. After making sure she was safe, the purple-haired woman sat down next to Asuka.  
注意到没有噪音，美里走回客厅，看到红发坐在沙发上。确认安全后，紫发女子在明日香身边坐下。

"So, you still want the waffles?" Misato asked jokingly.  
“那么，你还想要华夫饼吗？”美里开玩笑地问道。

"Yep, Shinji's making them right now" Asuka replied.  
“是的，真嗣现在就在做。”明日香回答道。

"WHAT?" Misato exclaimed in horror.  
“什么？”美里惊恐地叫道。

Asuka giggled a bit at Misato's response. "Relax Misato I was joking, though I can't believe he did something so gross" Asuka remarked.  
听到美里的回答，明日香咯咯地笑了起来。 “放松点，美里，我只是开玩笑，虽然我不敢相信他做了这么恶心的事，”明日香说道。

"Yeah, I can't eat waffles anymore so never bring this topic up again please" Misato requested.  
“是的，我不能再吃华夫饼了，所以请不要再提这个话题了。”美里请求道。

"Ditto" Asuka replied. “同上。”明日香回答道。

The warmth from the sun came in through the windows, warming up the apartment. Suddenly feeling thirsty, Misato stretched and got up from the couch.  
阳光透过窗户射进来，温暖了整个公寓。美里突然感到口渴，伸了个懒腰，从沙发上站了起来。

"You want something to drink Asuka?" the Major asked.  
“你想给明日香喝点什么吗？”少校问道。

"Sure" the redhead answered.  
“当然”红发回答。

Going to the kitchen, Misato went to the fridge to get a beer and a bottle of water. By now a pleasant smell permeated throughout the apartment as Shinji was cooking a meal. Asuka's stomach grumbled as she smelt the food; clearly she was hungry. The young girl decided to move over to the dining table as she saw the purple-haired woman return from the kitchen with a beer and bottle of water in hand. Following the girl, Misato also sat down at the dining table handing Asuka her drink. Having nothing better to do to pass the time, the redhead attempted a conversation with her guardian.  
去了厨房，美里到冰箱里拿了一瓶啤酒和一瓶水。此时，真嗣正在做饭，整个公寓里都弥漫着令人愉悦的香味。明日香闻到食物的味道，肚子咕咕叫。显然她饿了。看到紫发女子从厨房回来，手里拿着一瓶啤酒和一瓶水，少女决定往餐桌那边走去。美里也跟着少女坐到了餐桌前，递给明日香一杯饮料。由于没有更好的事情可做来打发时间，红发女郎尝试与她的监护人交谈。

"So how are you and Kaji doing?" Asuka asked Misato randomly.  
“那你和加吉怎么样了？”明日香随意询问美里。

"Oh, we're doing fine. We've already arranged our wedding too. It'll be on in about three months. Man, it seems so far away and so close at the same time" Misato answered.  
“噢，我们做得很好。我们的婚礼也已经安排好了。大约三个月后就会举行。伙计，它看起来很遥远，同时又很近。”美里回答道。

"It's about time you stuck with one man" Asuka remarked, smirking.  
“你是时候和一个男人在一起了。”明日香笑着说道。

"Don't even start it Asuka" Misato warned.  
“明日香，别启动它。”美里警告道。

"But it's good you've got everything settled with him" Asuka replied, exhaling.  
“不过很高兴你已经和他解决了一切”明日香叹了口气回答道。

"Is something wrong with you and Shinji?" Misato asked a little quieter, mindful of the subject of discussion being in the kitchen.  
“你和真嗣有什么事吗？”美里问得小声了一些，考虑到讨论的话题是在厨房里。

"Well not really, it's just that there's something about him. It's like he has a big secret inside him that he won't tell me. Perhaps he feels guilty about something? I've told him I've forgiven him for everything many times already and it doesn't seem to work. He keeps putting it off, getting angry, feeling sorry for himself or calling me selfish and I'm really at a loss for what to do" Asuka explained.  
“嗯，不是真的，只是他身上有一些东西。就像他内心有一个大秘密，他不肯告诉我。也许他对某些事情感到内疚？我已经告诉他，我已经原谅他的一切了。”已经好几次了，但似乎不起作用，他总是拖延，生气，为自己感到难过，或者说我自私，我真的不知道该怎么办。”明日香解释道。

The Major pondered this for a while, trying to think of a possible reason Shinji would be acting this way. _'It couldn't be that Shinji still feels guilty over raping Asuka before? Not that I blame him. The only way to solve this would be for him to discuss it with Asuka, but this is something that I cannot bring up'_ Misato thought.  
少校思考了一会儿，试图思考真嗣会这样做的可能原因。 “真嗣该不会还因为之前强暴明日香而感到内疚吧？”并不是我责怪他。解决这个问题的唯一办法就是和明日香商量一下，但这件事我不能提。”美里想道。

"Well?" Asuka prompted Misato.  
“出色地？”明日香对美里说道。

"Shinji has always kept things to himself, I suggest you just try to find out what's bugging him. He might discuss it with you eventually if you persist. It is obviously something within himself and only you can get it out of him" Misato answered.  
“真嗣总是把事情藏在心里，我建议你试着找出他到底在烦恼什么。如果你坚持的话，他最终可能会和你讨论这个问题。这显然是他内心的东西，只有你才能从他身上得到它。”美里回答道。

"Yeah, thanks for the 'great' advice Misato" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“是的，谢谢美里的‘伟大’建议”明日香讽刺地说。

"You understand him better than I do and it's really not my place to interfere with your relationship anyway" Misato replied.  
“你比我更了解他，反正我也无权干涉你们的关系。”美里回答道。

"Whatever" Asuka dismissed, "Shinji! You done yet?" she called out to him.  
“不管怎样，”明日香不屑一顾，“真嗣！你完成了吗？”她向他喊道。

"Just about" he replied. “差不多”他回答道。

"Good, I'm starving!" Asuka replied back.  
“好啊，我饿了！”明日香回应道。

Soon enough, the male eva pilot entered the dining area and placed the meal he had prepared on the table, earning much confusion from the two females. They both looked at him for an explanation.  
很快，男逃生飞行员就进入了用餐区，将自己准备好的饭菜放在了桌子上，引起了两名女飞行员的困惑。两人都看着他寻求解释。

"I decided to try something different today. Those are dumplings filled with meat, those are sausages and those are roast potatoes" he said, pointing to the different food items.  
“我今天决定尝试一些不同的东西。那些是肉馅饺子，那些是香肠，那些是烤土豆”他指着不同的食物说道。

Asuka chuckled lightly at the meal before her. "You know Shinji, I'm glad for the change in food, but these dishes together are a bit of a strange combination" she said, smiling, "But I'm sure it'll taste great anyway"  
明日香看着面前的饭菜，轻轻地笑了起来。 “你知道真嗣，我很高兴食物的改变，但这些菜放在一起有点奇怪，”她微笑着说，“但我相信无论如何味道都会很棒”

"I don't really know what this food tastes like, but I'll give it a go. Surely anything made by Shinji will taste great" Misato commented, sucking up.  
“我真的不知道这食物是什么味道，但我会尝试一下。肯定真嗣做的任何东西都会很好吃。”美里拍着拍子说道。

And so with that, the two girls began to eat the meal before them as Shinji sat down and helped himself as well. All three found the food delicious as they ate, Asuka making sure to eat as much as she could. Soon, the redhead finished and she got up, placing her plate in the sink. The other two had eaten much slower than Asuka and as such much of their meal still remained. Satisfied and wanting to relax, the young girl left the dining room to go to her bedroom, leaving the other two roommates alone. The purple-haired woman saw this as an opportunity to speak up.  
就这样，两个女孩开始吃面前的饭菜，真嗣也坐下来吃东西。三人吃起来都觉得食物很美味，明日香确保尽可能多地吃。很快，红发女郎就吃完了，起身，将盘子放到了水槽里。另外两人吃得比明日香慢得多，所以他们的饭菜还剩下很多。少女心满意足地想要放松一下，离开餐厅去了自己的卧室，留下了另外两个室友。紫发女子将这视为一个说话的机会。

"Shinji umm…" Misato started.  
“真嗣嗯……”美里开口说道。

"Yeah?" Shinji prompted. “是的？”真嗣提示道。

"Something tells me you're still feeling guilty over that incident a long time ago" she said straightforwardly.  
“我知道，你对很久以前的那件事还感到愧疚。”她直截了当地说道。

"Why are you bringing that up?" Shinji asked, surprised at the question.  
“你为什么要提这个？”真嗣对这个问题感到惊讶地问道。

"Asuka" Misato simply replied.  
“飞鸟”美里简单地回答道。

The boy just stayed silent. Shinji didn't like talking about this topic, it was one of the things he was most disgusted about himself with.  
男孩只是保持沉默。真嗣不喜欢谈论这个话题，这是他最厌恶自己的事情之一。

"It will eat you from the inside Shinji, you have to discuss it with Asuka" Misato continued at the boy's silence.  
“它会从真嗣的内部吃掉你，你得和明日香商量一下。”男孩的沉默让美里继续说道。

"Are you crazy? There's no way I could tell her about that and of course I still feel guilty about it…" Shinji finally responded.  
“你疯了吗？我没办法告诉她这件事，当然我仍然对此感到内疚……”真嗣终于回答道。

"You don't have to tell her you actually did it at first, just talk about it hypothetically or something. Shinji, you can't leave this alone or it will bite you back in the future. Doesn't she deserve to know the truth eventually? Especially about something like this" Misato answered back.  
“你不必告诉她你一开始确实这么做了，只是假设性地谈论一下什么的。真嗣，你不能不管这件事，否则将来它会反咬你一口。难道她不应该知道吗？”最终真相是什么？尤其是这样的事情。”美里回答道。

"I… I don't know, what you say makes sense, but at the same time… would she want to remember that? Besides, I wouldn't have a clue how to bring it up" Shinji said truthfully.  
“我……我不知道，你说的有道理，但同时……她会想记住这一点吗？而且，我也不知道如何提起。”真嗣如实说道。

"Asuka is worried about you, if you try to talk to her, she'll listen" Misato said with certainty.  
“明日香很担心你，如果你试着跟她说话，她会听的。”美里肯定地说。

"But it's so hard to talk about, plus I don't know how she'll respond" Shinji replied.  
“但这很难说，而且我不知道她会如何回应。”真嗣回答道。

"You just gotta trust in yourself and her" Misato encouraged.  
“你只需要相信自己和她”美里鼓励道。

Shinji stayed silent, contemplating would he should do. The Major knew it was a great difficulty for the boy since he usually kept his problems to himself, but she also knew he needed to move on. Misato also believed Asuka would want to know about their troubled past, even if it was painful.  
真嗣沉默不语，思考着自己该怎么做。少校知道这对这个男孩来说是一个很大的困难，因为他通常把问题留给自己，但她也知道他需要继续前进。美里还相信明日香会想知道他们麻烦的过去，即使那是痛苦的。

"You don't have to do it right now, you've got time. But don't take too long or it will become harder" Misato finished. Having nothing more to say, the Major stood up and left the dining room to go to her room, leaving the boy alone.  
“你不必现在就做，你还有时间。但不要花太长时间，否则会变得更难。”美里说完。少校没什么好说的，站起身来，离开餐厅，往自己的房间走去，留下男孩一个人。

After a while of just staring blankly out into space, the boy shook off his stupor and stood up. Shinji didn't exactly know how to bring up the subject without sounding suspicious, but what he was more worried about was that she might remember the incident; he was sure it was an experience no one would want to remember. But Misato was right that Asuka also had the right to know about such an event; it was a difficult conflict to solve. Regardless, he needed to talk to her now anyway so he moved off to her room.  
少年愣愣地望着虚空，过了一会儿，才从恍惚中站了起来。真嗣不知道如何提起这个话题才不会显得可疑，但他更担心的是她可能还记得这件事；他确信这是一次没有人愿意记住的经历。但美里说得对，明日香也有权知道这样的事件；这是一个很难解决的冲突。不管怎样，他现在无论如何都得跟她说话，所以他就去了她的房间。

The male eva pilot arrived at her door and knocked on it quietly. Almost immediately, he heard a "come in baka" from the redhead as a response. Taking that as an invitation, the boy opened her door and entered her room.  
男EVA飞行员来到了她的门前，轻轻地敲了门。几乎就在同时，他就听到红发女郎一声“进来吧”作为回应。男孩以此为邀请，打开门，走进了她的房间。

"How did you know it was me?" Shinji asked.  
“你怎么知道是我？”真嗣问道。

The redhead didn't answer, thinking it was a stupid question. Shinji looked around, noticing it was untidy as always and the girl was lying down on her bed looking up at him questioningly. As Shinji walked forward, his foot caught on something. Looking down, he discovered it was a pair of panties, used or unused was unknown to him. With an amused look, he bent down to pick it up and stood back up, presenting his find to the girl.  
红发没有回答，认为这是一个愚蠢的问题。真嗣环顾四周，发现房间一如既往地不整洁，女孩躺在床上，疑惑地抬头看着他。真嗣向前走的时候，脚被什么东西绊住了。低头一看，发现那是一条内裤，不知道是用过的还是没用过的。他一脸有趣地弯腰捡起它，然后站起来，将他的发现呈现给女孩。

Asuka just looked at him strangely. "What? They're panties Shinji, you've seen them heaps of times" she remarked, slightly annoyed.  
明日香只是奇怪地看着他。 “什么？它们是内裤，真嗣，你已经看过很多次了。”她有点生气地说。

"It's not very ladylike to leave undergarments lying around everywhere" Shinji replied in a mocking tone.  
“把内衣到处乱放是不太淑女的行为。”真嗣用嘲讽的语气回答道。

"Did you come in here just to comment on my untidiness or what?" she asked.  
“你来这里是为了批评我的不整洁还是什么？”她问。

"No, these just remind me of something we haven't done in a while" he answered, dropping the underwear back onto the floor.  
“不，这些只是让我想起我们已经有一段时间没有做过的事情了，”他回答道，把内衣放回地板上。

"If you came here for that, turn 180 degrees, walk three metres and close the door behind you as you exit the room" Asuka said exasperated.  
“如果你来这里是为了这个，那就转个180度，走三米，然后在退出房间时关上身后的门。”明日香愤怒地说。

"No actually, I came here to say sorry-" he started.  
“不，实际上，我来这里是为了说对不起——”他开口说道。

"Damn and I thought that habit of yours had died already" she interrupted.  
“该死，我以为你的习惯已经改掉了，”她打断道。

He almost said it again but stopped himself. "Umm… about the discussion we had before, don't worry about it, I just snapped a little" he explained.  
他几乎要再说一遍，但又停住了。 “嗯……关于我们之前的讨论，别担心，我只是稍微生气了一下，”他解释道。

"Oh, you don't want me to give you oral sex?" Asuka said, smirking.  
“哦，你不想让我给你口交吗？”飞鸟笑着说道。

"That's not exactly what I meant" Shinji said, sweat dropping.  
“我不是这个意思。”真嗣说，汗水流了下来。

"Look what you said was kinda true and it's only natural for a guy to want a girl to go down on them, I don't see why you came to apologise" Asuka replied.  
“看你说的有点对，一个男人想要一个女孩贬低他们是很自然的，我不明白你为什么要道歉”明日香回答道。

"Well… um" Shinji started, suddenly at a loss for words.  
“呃……嗯”真嗣开口说道，突然说不出话来。

"More importantly Shinji, it seems something's troubling you. If there is something bothering you, just talk to me. There is no need for you to keep secrets from me" Asuka said understandingly.  
“更重要的是，真嗣，你好像有什么烦恼。如果有什么烦恼，就跟我说吧，你没必要向我隐瞒秘密。”明日香理解道。

The boy looked down at his fiancée; her face betrayed a hint of concern. He noticed her beautiful red hair hung down over her shoulders and her gaze was focused unfalteringly on him. The girl sat up straighter, expecting the boy to say something, causing her hair to shift, breaking the boy out of his daydream.  
男孩低头看着他的未婚妻；她的脸上流露出一丝担忧。他注意到她一头美丽的红发垂落在肩上，目光坚定地落在他身上。女孩坐直了身子，期待着男孩说些什么，头发一抖，将男孩从白日梦中惊醒。

Shinji moved towards the redhead, getting onto the bed as he moved his right hand to caress her cheek. Asuka noticed the scar on his hand, remembering the time he had shielded her against the knife. Still, his hand felt soft as it made contact with her face and she closed her eyes, enjoying the comfort. The girl reopened her eyes and reached up to flick Shinji on the forehead.  
真嗣走向红发，坐到床上，右手抚上她的脸颊。明日香注意到他手上的伤疤，想起他保护她免遭刀砍的那次。然而，他的手触碰到她的脸时却感觉很柔软，她闭上眼睛，享受着这种舒适。少女重新睁开眼睛，伸手弹了一下真嗣的额头。

"Don't distract me Shinji, just tell me what's wrong" Asuka requested.  
“别打扰我，告诉我出了什么事。”明日香请求道。

"When I'm with you, all my problems disappear" Shinji said, placing a hand on her shoulder.  
“当我和你在一起时，我所有的问题都会消失。”真嗣说道，将一只手放在她的肩膀上。

The redhead rolled her eyes. "Please" she remarked, brushing off his hand. "I can't stand your corny shit. When I'm with you, your problems multiply exponentially so don't make up such crap" she replied, smiling wickedly.  
红发女郎翻了个白眼。 “求你了，”她说，拍开他的手。 “我受不了你那些陈词滥调。当我和你在一起的时候，你的问题就会成倍增加，所以不要编出这样的废话。”她回答道，邪恶地微笑着。

Shinji couldn't help chuckling a little at that comment, however, he moved closer to the girl closing the distance between them. Cheekily, the redhead grabbed her pillow and placed it in between her and Shinji, causing the boy to kiss it instead. The male eva pilot took the pillow and threw it away. He then grabbed the redhead and quickly pulled her towards him, landing his lips on hers. The boy wrapped his arms around the girl, embracing her tenderly as she did the same. Slowly but surely, Shinji pushed Asuka down flat on the bed.  
听到这句话，真嗣忍不住轻笑了一声，但他还是靠近了女孩，拉近了两人之间的距离。红发厚颜无耻地抓住了她的枕头，把它放在她和真嗣之间，导致男孩亲吻了它。男eva飞行员接过枕头扔掉了。然后他抓住了红发女郎，迅速将她拉向自己，嘴唇落在了她的唇上。男孩伸出双臂搂住女孩，温柔地拥抱着她，女孩也同样温柔地拥抱着她。真嗣缓慢而坚定地将明日香推倒在床上。

Asuka let her arms fall on the bed and the two teens parted. The redhead raised her eyebrow at the boy as he looked down at her. Moving down, Shinji began to nuzzle her neck while his hand found its way onto her chest. The girl moaned as he fondled her breast.  
明日香将手臂放在床上，两个青少年分开了。当男孩低头看着她时，红发女郎对男孩扬起了眉毛。真嗣向下走去，开始用鼻子蹭她的脖子，而他的手则摸到了她的胸口。当他抚摸她的乳房时，女孩呻吟着。

"It has been a while" Asuka commented, enjoying the contact. "But I told you to walk out of the room if you came for that" she said sternly, removing his hand.  
“已经有一段时间了”明日香评论道，很享受这次的接触。 “但我告诉过你，如果你是为了这个，就走出房间。”她严厉地说，松开了他的手。

"But what about your promise?" Shinji asked.  
“但是你的承诺呢？”真嗣问道。

"Not today Shinji" Asuka answered with finality.  
“今天不行。”明日香斩钉截铁地回答。

The boy sighed in frustration, but moved off the redhead. "Damn it, playing hard to get only makes me more determined" he said anxiously.  
男孩沮丧地叹了口气，但还是离开了红发女郎。 “该死，欲擒故纵只会让我更加坚定。”他焦急地说。

"Don't worry baka-shin, Asuka always keeps her word. I never said we had to do it today, besides you should be content with just looking at me" she retorted, sticking her tongue out at him.  
“别担心，baka-shin，明日香总是遵守诺言。我从来没有说过我们今天必须这样做，而且你应该满足于只是看着我”她反驳道，向他伸出舌头。

"Well, you haven't graced me with a good look for a long time either" Shinji countered.  
“好吧，你也已经很久没有给我好看的容貌了。”真嗣反驳道。

"Oh yeah?" Asuka started. "Well, I suppose it doesn't hurt" she continued, lifting up her skirt and smiling mischievously.  
“哦耶？”明日香开始了。 “嗯，我想这并不疼，”她继续说道，撩起裙子，顽皮地微笑着。

Shinji froze with his mouth open and she dropped her skirt back down. The girl walked past Shinji and whispered in his ear, "I think that was sufficient"  
真嗣张大了嘴，僵住了，她把裙子放了下来。少女从真嗣身边走过，在他耳边低声说道：“我想这样就足够了。”

Asuka exited the room while Shinji stood there still, wondering when she had become such a tease. But when the boy thought about it, those panties he had picked up had felt a little warm, why hadn't he realised earlier? _'God damn I love her'_ Shinji thought.  
明日香退出了房间，而真嗣则一动不动地站在那里，想知道她什么时候变得这么爱捉弄人了。但男孩一想，他捡起的那条内裤就感觉有点温暖，为什么他没有早点意识到？ “该死的我爱她”真嗣想。

The boy followed after the girl and exited the room. Quickly scanning around, he saw her about to enter the bathroom and moved swiftly towards her. The male eva pilot grabbed his fiancée around the waist and pulled her back.  
男孩跟着女孩走出了房间。快速扫视了一圈，看到她要进浴室，他快步朝她走来。男EVA飞行员一把搂住未婚妻的腰，将她拉了回来。

"Waah?" Asuka let out, surprised.  
“哇？”明日香惊讶地说道。

"You didn't think you could escape that easily did you?" Shinji said, reaching under her skirt.  
“你以为你没那么容易逃走吧？”真嗣把手伸到裙子下面说道。

"I told you, not today!" she refuted, her face turning red.  
“我说过了，不是今天！”她红着脸反驳道。

"Why aren't you wearing any underwear then?" he asked, inserting his finger deeply to emphasise his point.  
“那你为什么不穿内衣？”他问，将手指深深地插入以强调他的观点。

"Ahhh… I can do what I want, let go of me!" Asuka shouted, struggling.  
“啊啊……我可以做我想做的事，放开我吧！”明日香挣扎着喊道。

"I'll make you a deal. If you can make me cum, I'll let you go. But if you fail, we go back to your room and have sex until we fall asleep" Shinji explained, smirking.  
“我会跟你做一笔交易。如果你能让我射精，我就放你走。但如果你失败了，我们就回到你的房间做爱直到睡着”真嗣笑着解释道。

"That's preposterous!" Asuka rebuked, completely outraged.  
“这太荒谬了！”明日香怒不可遏地斥责道。

"Cool, I guess I'll just take you back to your room then" Shinji replied, turning around.  
“好吧，我想我会带你回你的房间。”真嗣回答道，转身。

"No wait! Wait! I accept the deal!" Asuka agreed quickly.  
“不，等等！等等！我接受这个交易！”明日香很快就答应了。

"Good, you've got five minutes starting now" Shinji declared.  
“好，现在开始有五分钟时间”真嗣宣布。

At once, the redhead turned herself around and went for his pants. However, Shinji had caught her arm and she found herself unable to pull his pants down. The girl rubbed herself against his groin and she felt his erection through his pants. Asuka was hesitant about using her other hand because if he got it trapped, she was done for. The redhead twirled around, forcing Shinji to release his grip on her arm.  
红发女郎立刻转过身去拿他的裤子。然而，真嗣抓住了她的手臂，她发现自己无法拉下他的裤子。女孩摩擦着他的腹股沟，隔着裤子感觉到他的勃起。明日香犹豫着是否要使用另一只手，因为如果他的手被困住了，她就完蛋了。红发女郎转过身来，迫使真嗣松开了她的手臂。

Asuka then jumped onto the boy and found herself with her legs around his waist and her chest in his face. Shinji grabbed both her arms making her unable to move, but this is exactly what she thought he would do. She moved her legs inside his pants and dropped them to the floor, pulling his pants down with them. Now the girl found herself unable to do anything further as Shinji's grip was too strong.  
然后明日香跳到男孩身上，发现自己的腿搂着他的腰，胸部贴在他的脸上。真嗣抓住了她的双臂，让她无法动弹，但这正是她所认为的他会做的事情。她把腿伸进他的裤子里，然后扔到地板上，把他的裤子也拉了下来。现在女孩发现自己无法再做任何事了，因为真嗣的握力太强了。

Asuka tried to position herself over his cock, but Shinji caught onto what she was doing and picked her up, flipping her upside down. With her legs around his neck and her arms held by his, Asuka found herself completely helpless. His erect cock was right in front of her eyes but she couldn't do anything to get him to cum.  
明日香试图将自己放在他的阴茎上，但真嗣发现了她正在做的事情，并将她抱了起来，将她翻了个底朝天。双腿搂住他的脖子，双臂被他握住，明日香发现自己完全无助。他勃起的阴茎就在她眼前，但她却无能为力让他射精。

"Only one minute left Asuka" Shinji announced, absolutely enjoying the situation.  
“明日香只剩下一分钟了”真嗣宣布，非常享受这种情况。

Asuka was not in the mood to "have sex until they fell asleep," and Shinji made things worse by moving his mouth down onto her exposed pussy. With his tongue exploring her depths, Asuka found it impossible to concentrate but she would not accept defeat. Grudgingly, Asuka opened her mouth and took his cock into her mouth, sucking and licking it as hard she could, trying her best to get him to cum. For some reason, the redhead found the feeling of her mouth wrapped around his cock familiar. Furthermore, an image of her pleasuring him like this came to mind and she wondered why her mind was suddenly fantasising about such a thing.  
明日香没有心情“在他们睡着之前做爱”，真嗣把他的嘴移到了她裸露的阴户上，让事情变得更糟。当他的舌头探入她的深处时，明日香发现自己无法集中注意力，但她不肯接受失败。明日香不情愿地张开嘴，把他的阴茎含进嘴里，用力吸吮和舔舐它，尽最大努力让他射精。出于某种原因，红发女郎发现她的嘴含住他阴茎的感觉很熟悉。而且，她的脑海里还浮现出她这样取悦他的画面，不知道为什么自己的脑子里突然会幻想出这样的事情。

Having been taken by surprise and not having cummed for a while, the boy came right into the girl's mouth. As he removed his cock from her mouth, his semen dripped out of her mouth; she hadn't swallowed it, but then again, she _was_ upside down.  
男孩吃了一惊，好久没有射精，直接进入了女孩的嘴里。当他将阴茎从她的嘴里移开时，他的精液从她的嘴里滴了下来。她还没咽下去，但话又说回来，她已经天翻地覆了。

"Would you let me down?" Asuka asked angrily, glaring at him.  
“你会让我失望吗？”明日香瞪着他，愤怒地问道。

The boy turned her right way up and let her down. "Damn I totally didn't expect that, I was so close too, but of course Asuka you win again" he replied a little disappointed, pulling his pants back up.  
男孩把她转到正确的位置，然后让她放下来。 “该死的，我完全没想到，我也这么接近，但当然明日香你又赢了。”他有点失望地回答，把裤子拉了起来。

The girl spat out Shinji's cum and wiped the remainder of his fluid off her face. "If that's what made those waffles taste good, I think my tastebuds must have died!" Asuka remarked.  
女孩吐出了真嗣的精液，并擦掉了脸上残留的精液。 “如果这就是华夫饼好吃的原因，我想我的味蕾一定已经死了！”明日香说道。

Shinji chuckled at that comment, but his laughter was short-lived as another presence entered the room.  
真嗣听到这句话咯咯地笑起来，但他的笑声很快就消失了，因为另一个人走进了房间。

"Why are you two still making such a racket?" Misato snapped angrily.  
“你们两个怎么还这么吵？”美里愤怒地吼道。

Both teens jumped at the voice and turned to see the purple-haired woman standing in the hallway.  
两个青少年都被这个声音吓了一跳，转身看到站在走廊里的紫发女人。

"I don't really care what you do, but I'm tired and I wanna sleep for the rest of the day so stop making so much noise" Misato demanded, turning back around.  
“我真的不在乎你做什么，但我累了，我想睡一觉，所以别再发出那么多噪音了。”美里转身要求道。

After hearing her door close, they waited for a few minutes just to be sure and turned to face each other again. "You know it's a good thing she didn't walk in earlier" Shinji let out in relief.  
听到她关门的声音后，他们等了几分钟以确定，然后再次转身面对对方。 “你知道她没有早点进来真是件好事”真嗣松了口气。

"You know it's a good thing I didn't decide to bite your balls off! Next time you pull a stunt like that, I won't be so forgiving" she shot back menacingly, before entering the bathroom and closing the door.  
“你知道，幸好我没有决定咬掉你的蛋蛋！下次你再做出这样的事，我不会那么宽容”她威胁地回击道，然后走进浴室并关上了门。

Shinji just looked at the closed door smiling. He couldn't help feeling happy that he had just received his first blowjob since the memory loss. With Misato in her bedroom and Asuka in the bathroom, the residence was pretty quiet. The boy looked at his watch and saw there was still some time left before they should go to sleep. He decided he would just wait for Asuka to get out and do something with her. It didn't take long to hear a flush, followed by water running and finally the door opening. As the redhead came out, the male eva pilot brought her into a kiss.  
真嗣只是微笑地看着紧闭的门。他不禁为自己刚刚接受了失忆后的第一次口交而感到高兴。美里在卧室，明日香在浴室，宅邸里相当安静。男孩看了看手表，发现距离他们睡觉还有一段时间。他决定等明日香出去陪她做点什么。没过多久就听到冲水声，接着是流水声，最后是门打开的声音。当红发女郎出来时，男伊娃飞行员将她拥入吻中。

"Oww" Shinji yelped as he felt his hair being pulled.  
“呜呜”真嗣惊叫一声，感觉自己的头发被拉扯了。

Releasing his hair, the girl averted her eyes. "You know Shinji, I suppose it wasn't that bad. I guess I could… do it for you sometimes, I mean you do the same for me and I'm going to be your wife so it can't hurt" Asuka said, blushing a little.  
少女松开他的头发，移开了视线。 “你知道真嗣，我想这并没有那么糟糕。我想我可以……有时为你做这件事，我的意思是你为我做同样的事情，我将成为你的妻子，所以这不会伤害”明日香说着，脸有些红了。

Shinji hugged his fiancée tightly; she always acted so cute when she was embarrassed. "You wanna do something Asuka? I don't feel like going to sleep now" Shinji asked.  
真嗣紧紧地拥抱着他的未婚妻；她害羞的时候总是表现得那么可爱。 “你想做点什么吗，明日香？我现在不想睡觉”真嗣问道。

"I don't feel like going out now, we could watch television together I suppose" she suggested.  
“我现在不想出去，我想我们可以一起看电视，”她建议道。

"Good idea, we haven't watched something together in a while. I wonder if there's anything worth watching on though" Shinji replied.  
“好主意，我们已经有一段时间没有一起看东西了。不过我想知道有没有什么值得看的。”真嗣回答道。

"What does it matter? You'll be spending time with me, isn't that enough?" Asuka said smugly.  
“有什么关系？有你陪我，还不够吗？”明日香得意地说。

"Quite right" Shinji agreed, smirking.  
“确实如此。”真嗣笑着答应道。

With that the boy picked up the redhead, carrying her traditional style to the couch in the living room.  
说着，男孩抱起了红发女郎，带着她传统的造型坐到了客厅的沙发上。

"You know I'm pretty sure I can walk to the couch thank you" Asuka remarked, annoyed. But deep down inside, the redhead secretly revelled in being carried by Shinji.  
“你知道我很确定我可以走到沙发上，谢谢你”明日香生气地说。但内心深处，红发却暗自享受被真嗣抱着的感觉。

The male eva pilot set her down on the couch, after which he grabbed the TV remote and sat down next to the girl. Asuka held out her hand expectantly and Shinji reluctantly handed her the remote.  
男EVA飞行员将她放在沙发上，然后抓起电视遥控器，坐在女孩旁边。明日香期待地伸出手，真嗣不情愿地把遥控器递给她。

"Thank you Liebling" Asuka said sweetly, taking the remote and switching on the television.  
“谢谢你，莉布林。”明日香甜甜地说，拿起遥控器，打开了电视。

"Liebling?" Shinji asked curious, having never heard Asuka call him that.  
“利布林？”真嗣好奇地问道，因为他从来没有听明日香这样称呼过他。

"Don't you know some German? I mean you knew what 'Ich Liebe Dich' meant" Asuka replied, a little surprised. How else would he know how to say "I love you" in German other than learning German by himself?  
“你不懂德语吗？我的意思是你知道‘Ich Liebe Dich’的意思。”明日香回答道，有点惊讶。除了自学德语之外，他怎么知道如何用德语说“我爱你”呢？

"Umm, is it 'lover'?" Shinji asked.  
“嗯，是‘恋人’吗？”真嗣问道。

Asuka giggled. "Well, that's a pretty good guess I suppose. But you can find out for yourself" she answered.  
明日香咯咯笑起来。 “嗯，我想这是一个很好的猜测。但你可以自己找出答案。”她回答道。

The boy snuggled up to the redhead as they sat there on the couch. After switching through channels to find a decent program on the television, Asuka put down the remote. The girl put her arms around the boy snuggled up against her and they shared each other's warmth as they sat there watching together. Shinji couldn't help noticing Asuka's scent as he sat with her; she smelt pleasant. Her magnificent red hair was splayed out over them and he enjoyed the nice tickling sensation she gave him when she shifted position.  
当他们坐在沙发上时，男孩依偎着红发女郎。切换频道找到电视上合适的节目后，明日香放下了遥控器。女孩用双臂搂住依偎在她身上的男孩，他们坐在一起看着，分享着彼此的温暖。当真嗣坐在明日香身边时，他忍不住注意到她身上的气味。她闻起来很香。她华丽的红发散落在他们身上，当她改变位置时，他很享受她给他带来的美妙的痒痒感觉。

Moving his eyes back to the screen, Shinji could see they were watching some movie about a magical ring and massive battles with men and monsters, but honestly, he really wasn't paying much attention. Soon the images became blurred as the male eva pilot slowly fell asleep.  
真嗣将目光移回到屏幕上，发现他们正在看一部关于魔法戒指以及人类和怪物之间的大规模战斗的电影，但说实话，他并没有太在意。很快，图像变得模糊，男宇航员慢慢睡着了。

---

Shinji awoke slowly as something next to him shifted position. Momentarily confused as to why he felt so warm, he opened his eyes gradually, taking in the light steadily. Not surprisingly, the girl he had fallen asleep next to had him completely bound by her legs and arms. Her head was resting on his shoulder and her warm breath could be felt across his neck. The boy looked down at her sleeping face and smiled; he loved how peaceful she was in her sleep.  
当旁边的某个东西移动了位置时，真嗣慢慢醒来。一时不明白为什么自己会感觉这么温暖，他缓缓睁开眼睛，稳稳地接受着光线。毫不奇怪，他睡在旁边的那个女孩把他的腿和胳膊完全绑住了。她的头靠在他的肩膀上，脖子上能感觉到她温热的呼吸。男孩低头看着她熟睡的脸，笑了。他喜欢她睡梦中的宁静。

Moving his free arm without waking the redhead, he stroked her hair. A content smile could be seen plastered on the girl's face as she felt his comforting hand. Deciding to be a little cheeky, he moved his hand down to her skirt. Reaching under her skirt, he moved his hand to her most sensitive spot. A little confused at first, he then remembered she hadn't been wearing any underwear when she went to watch with him.  
他移动空着的手臂，抚摸着她的头发，没有吵醒红发女郎。当女孩感受到他安慰的手时，她的脸上露出了满足的微笑。他决定厚颜无耻，将手移到她的裙子上。他的手伸到了她的裙子下面，移到了她最敏感的地方。起初他有点困惑，然后他想起来她和他一起去看的时候没有穿内衣。

_'Oh, so she trusts me enough to fall asleep next to me without any panties on?'_ Shinji thought devilishly.  
“哦，所以她足够信任我，可以不穿内裤就睡在我旁边？”真嗣邪恶地想。

The boy very lightly stroked her slit, eliciting a soft "mmm" from the redhead and making her move a little. The male eva pilot very much enjoyed sexually stimulating her in her sleep because she behaved so much more timid. Increasing the friction a little, the girl began to moan more erotically, her facial expression becoming a little anxious. Freeing his other hand, Shinji gently fondled Asuka's breast, all the while continuing to stimulate her private region.  
男孩轻轻地抚摸着她的阴户，引得红发女郎轻声“嗯”了一声，让她动了动。男EVA飞行员非常喜欢在她睡梦中对她进行性刺激，因为她表现得胆怯得多。随着摩擦力的增加，少女的呻吟声变得更加淫荡，表情也变得有些焦急。真嗣松开另一只手，轻轻抚摸明日香的胸部，同时继续刺激她的私处。

"No stop… we can't do that ahhh… we're too young Shinji" she let out, still asleep.  
“别停下……我们不能这么做啊……我们太年轻了，真嗣”她喊道，还在睡梦中。

The boy was finding it difficult to hold himself back; she was just so damn cute. Pushing his finger in slightly, Asuka clung onto him even tighter, moaning girlishly. Shinji couldn't help chuckling; her reaction was so funny. He then stopped all his actions, picked up the redhead and carried her with him to her room.  
男孩发现自己很难克制住自己。她真是太可爱了。明日香将手指轻轻推了进去，将他抱得更紧，少女般地呻吟着。真嗣忍不住笑了起来；她的反应很有趣。随后他停下了一切动作，抱起了红发，带着她往自己的房间走去。

"Mmm Shinji, I love you too…" she said tenderly.  
“嗯，真嗣，我也爱你……”她温柔地说。

At this, Shinji kissed Asuka on the lips, finally waking up the sleeping girl. It took her a few moments to realise what was happening, before she forcefully parted from Shinji's kiss. The sudden movement, as well as Asuka loosening her grip on the boy, caused Shinji to drop her with a loud thump. The annoyed redhead looked up at him with a glare.  
这时，真嗣吻上了明日香的嘴唇，终于叫醒了熟睡的女孩。她花了好一会儿才意识到发生了什么，然后才用力挣脱真嗣的吻。突如其来的动作，加上明日香松开了男孩的手，真嗣重重地把她摔在了地上。红发女郎恼怒地抬起头，怒视着他。

"What are you doing taking advantage of me while I'm asleep?" Asuka said irritated, rubbing her backside.  
“你趁我睡着的时候占我的便宜做什么？”明日香揉着自己的后背，恼怒地说道。

"You fell asleep without your underwear on, it was a temptation I couldn't resist" he replied, sticking his tongue out.  
“你没穿内裤就睡着了，这是我无法抗拒的诱惑。”他伸出舌头回答道。

"That's the last time I trust you dummkopf!" she shouted at him.  
“这是我最后一次相信你这个笨蛋！”她对他喊道。

"Yeah yeah, we should get ready for school" Shinji replied, dismissing her comment.  
“是啊是啊，我们应该准备去学校了”真嗣回答道，驳回了她的评论。

"You better not forget to make breakfast or our lunches" Asuka remarked, standing up.  
“你最好不要忘记做早餐或我们的午餐”明日香站起来说道。

As the girl took a step, she felt dizzy for a moment, almost causing her to trip over. Immediately, Shinji had moved over to her. "Are you alright Asuka?" he asked, concerned.  
女孩刚迈出一步，就感觉一阵头晕，险些摔倒。真嗣立刻走到她身边。 “明日香你还好吗？”他关切地问道。

"I'm fine, just get to work Ikari" she answered, pushing him away and walking off to her room.  
“我很好，碇去上班吧。”她回答道，推开他，朝自己的房间走去。

The male eva pilot looked on after her a little puzzled but shrugged it off. He turned around and went to the kitchen ready to make breakfast, knowing it wasn't a good idea to delay. Taking out the ingredients and materials he required, he soon set to work making the breakfast. As the boy was preparing the meal, Misato had woken up and made her way to the kitchen. The Major went straight for the fridge and took out a beer. Draining the can in seconds, Misato then screamed out her morning call. It never ceased to amaze Shinji how beer could work like coffee.  
男EVA飞行员有点困惑地看着她，但耸了耸肩。他转身去厨房准备做早餐，他知道耽搁不好。拿出自己需要的食材，很快他就开始做早餐了。当男孩准备饭菜时，美里醒来并走向厨房。少校径直走向冰箱，拿出一瓶啤酒。美里几秒钟内就把罐子里的水倒干了，然后尖叫着叫醒她。啤酒竟然能像咖啡一样发挥作用，这一直让真嗣感到惊讶不已。

Instantly, the half-asleep woman had turned into a very energetic one and proceeded over to Shinji. The purple haired woman smiled and brought the boy into a big hug, squeezing the life out of him.  
瞬间，那个半睡半醒的女人就变得精神抖擞，走到真嗣面前。紫发女子微笑着将男孩抱入怀中，将他的生命榨干。

"Get off him Misato" a certain redhead said irately.  
“美里，放开他。”某红发人愤怒地说道。

"Why? Are you jealous?" Misato asked teasingly.  
“为什么？你嫉妒吗？”美里戏谑地问道。

"No, you're killing him. I want him to finish making breakfast" Asuka replied.  
“不，你要杀了他。我要他把早餐做好。”明日香回答道。

The Major turned to see Shinji's face turning blue and his arms trying to pry Misato's arms off of him. Reluctantly, the purple-haired woman let go of the poor boy and he quickly resumed preparing breakfast. Both Misato and Asuka sat down at the dining table, waiting for Shinji to finish making their meal. As he had started quickly, it wasn't long till the boy had finished preparing the food and set down the meals on the table.  
少校转过身，看到真嗣的脸色变蓝，他的手臂试图将美里的手臂从他身上撬开。紫发女子无奈地放开了可怜的男孩，他赶紧继续准备早餐。美里和明日香都坐在餐桌旁，等待真嗣做好饭菜。由于动作很快，没过多久，男孩就准备好了食物，将饭菜放在了桌子上。

Shinji then joined the two females at the table and began to eat with them. A little bored, the boy smiled cheekily and lightly kicked Asuka under the table while he was eating. The girl shot her head up and looked at her fiancé suspiciously, before dismissing it as her imagination. After a while, Shinji once again moved his leg and gently kicked his fiancée. This time, the redhead shot the boy a glare as if daring him to do it again. Shinji pretended not to notice as he was "busy" eating his breakfast.  
真嗣随后和两位女性一起坐在餐桌旁，开始和她们一起吃饭。男孩有些无聊，一边吃着饭，一边厚颜无耻地笑了笑，轻轻踢了桌子底下的飞鸟。女孩猛地抬起头，疑惑地看着自己的未婚夫，随后又否认这是自己的幻觉。过了一会儿，真嗣再次迈开腿，轻轻地踢了未婚妻一脚。这一次，红发女郎瞪了男孩一眼，仿佛是在挑衅他再做一次。真嗣假装没注意到，“忙着”吃早餐。

Unable to hold himself back, the male eva pilot brought his leg up, kicking the redhead once again. This time, Asuka was ready for it and she grabbed his leg with hers, trapping it. Despite this, Shinji still continued to look down at his meal, pretending it wasn't him. A little confused, Asuka looked to Misato who was also concentrating on her meal. Smiling cruelly, she devised a plan to work out who it really was. Reaching down, she pinched Shinji's leg as hard as she could.  
男伊娃飞行员按捺不住，抬起腿，再次踢了红发一脚。这一次，明日香已经做好了准备，她用自己的腿抓住了他的腿，将其困住。尽管如此，真嗣仍然低头看着自己的饭菜，假装那不是他。明日香有些疑惑地看向同样专心吃饭的美里。她残忍地微笑着，想出了一个计划来查明这个人到底是谁。她弯下腰，用尽全力捏住真嗣的腿。

The sudden sharp pain in his leg caused the boy to jump in his seat, giving away his actions. At once, the redhead began kicking Shinji back and a furious battle began under the table between their legs. Both of them refused to say anything as they maneuvered about in their seats trying to avoid each other's kicks while also taking every chance they got to score a hit on the other.  
腿上突如其来的剧痛让男孩从座位上跳了起来，暴露了他的举动。红发立刻开始踢真嗣，两人的腿间在桌子下展开了一场激烈的战斗。两人都没有说话，在座位上扭来扭去，试图避开对方的踢腿，同时也抓住一切机会攻击对方。

By now, the table had begun to shake constantly from all their movements and Misato stood up abruptly from her chair, extremely annoyed.  
此时，桌子已经开始因为他们的动作而不断摇晃，美里猛地从椅子上站起来，非常恼火。

"Would you stop behaving like such children? Seriously, this is so stupid!" Misato shouted at them.  
“你能停止像这样的孩子吗？说实话，这太愚蠢了！”美里对他们喊道。

Both of them stopped their actions immediately and turned to face the Major.  
两人立刻停下了动作，转身面向少校。

"He/She started it!" they both shouted at the same time both, pointing at the other.  
“他/她开始了！”他们同时指着对方喊道。

The purple-haired woman just shook her head in disbelief and walked off to her room mumbling incoherently. Asuka gave Shinji another glare and one last kick before finishing her meal and standing up.  
紫发女子只是不可置信地摇了摇头，语无伦次地咕哝着向自己的房间走去。明日香又瞪了真嗣一眼，又踢了最后一脚，然后吃完饭站起来。

"You better make those lunches soon and no more silly behaviour from you either" Asuka remarked steadfastly, before moving off to her room.  
“你最好尽快把午餐做好，也别再做出愚蠢的行为了。”明日香坚定地说，然后走向她的房间。

Alone again, Shinji proceeded to make both his and Asuka's bentos. The boy began to think over recent events as he did his work. After the battle with the Mass Production Evas, Asuka's Unit 02 had gone out of power. Somewhere during the battle her umbilical cable had been cut. Shinji's Unit 01, however, had been operating on its S2 Engine and so it hadn't run out of power. As such, Shinji had to carry Unit 02 back to NERV, which wasn't easy as there wasn't much of NERV left or Tokyo-3 for that matter.  
真嗣再次独自一人，开始为他和明日香做便当。男孩一边做事，一边开始思考最近发生的事情。与量产型EVAS的战斗结束后，明日香的02号机失去了动力。在战斗中的某个地方，她的脐带被切断了。然而，真嗣的 01 号机一直在使用 S2 引擎运行，因此它并没有耗尽电力。因此，真嗣必须将 02 号机带回 NERV，这并不容易，因为 NERV 或 Tokyo-3 已经所剩无几了。

Luckily, Rei and Touji had been picked up by NERV medical teams during the battle with the Mass Production Evas. Shinji had felt guilty for leaving them behind and only making sure Asuka was okay, but then again, he didn't know where they were and with all the rubble and debris around, there was a high probability he could accidentally step on their entry plugs. It turned out Asuka was fine, but he had expected so.  
幸运的是，在与量产型EVA的战斗中，丽和东次被NERV医疗队接走。真嗣对把他们留在身后并只确保明日香没事感到内疚，但话又说回来，他不知道他们在哪里，而且周围都是瓦砾和碎片，他很可能会不小心踩到他们的入口插头。事实证明明日香没事，但他早料到会这样。

The two teens had then made their way back to the command centre, sadly noticing the many bodies of NERV and JSSDF alike strewn about. It was unfortunate that it had come down to this, but they knew they had prevented many more deaths. Arriving at the command centre, the two eva pilots were immediately met with congratulations and applause. Misato herself had gone and hugged them as usual.  
两名青少年随后返回指挥中心，悲伤地发现 NERV 和 JSSDF 的尸体散落在各处。不幸的是事情发展到了这个地步，但他们知道他们已经避免了更多的死亡。抵达指挥中心后，两名逃亡飞行员立即受到热烈的祝贺和掌声。美里本人也像往常一样走过去拥抱了他们。

Soon, the big news had got around that the Commander of NERV, Shinji's father, was dead. This came as a shocking surprise to the two eva pilots, the almighty infallible Commander of NERV was gone. The cause of death was a bullet wound to the head; obviously someone had taken him out. The person responsible was unknown though. With the Commander gone and Sub-Commander resigning, responsibility was handed over to Misato.  
很快，NERV指挥官、真嗣的父亲去世的大消息就传开了。这让两名 eva 飞行员感到震惊，万能的 NERV 指挥官消失了。死因是头部枪伤；显然是有人把他带出去了。但负责人尚不清楚。随着指挥官的离开和副指挥官的辞职，责任就移交给了美里。

After all the greetings and warm exchanges, the pilots were then escorted down to the medical bay. Ritsuko insisted that she check up on them, she didn't want anything happening to them after they had just saved the world. The two teens wanted nothing more than to just go home and relax, however they reluctantly agreed, slightly annoyed. But then again, their apartment was probably destroyed anyway.  
经过一番寒暄和热情的交流后，飞行员们被护送至医疗舱。律子坚持要她去看看他们，她不想让他们在刚刚拯救了世界之后发生任何事情。两个青少年只想回家放松一下，但他们勉强同意了，有点恼火。但话又说回来，他们的公寓可能无论如何都被毁了。

After arriving at the medical bay, they were greeted by the sight of both Touji and Rei. Shinji went over and hugged both of them immediately, glad that nothing had happened to them. Asuka on the other hand awkwardly shook Touji's hand and gave a nod of approval to the blue haired girl. It appeared Touji was absolutely fine; he had received a few bruises and nothing more.  
到达医疗区后，映入眼帘的是东次和丽。真嗣立即走过去拥抱了两人，庆幸他们没有发生什么事。明日香则尴尬地握着东次的手，对蓝发少女点了点头。看来东治绝对没问题。他只受了几处瘀伤，仅此而已。

Rei on the other hand had been stabbed by the fake Lance of Longinus and it appeared as though her actual torso had also received some damage. Ritsuko had said that she was in critical condition when they had first found her, however as they brought her to the medical bay she seemed to have improved and even now her wound was healing itself much faster than usual. The doctor was unable to explain it, but Rei was going to survive.  
而丽则被假的朗基努斯之枪刺中，看起来她的真实躯干也受到了一些伤害。律子说，当他们第一次发现她时，她的情况很危急，但是当他们把她带到医疗室时，她似乎有所好转，甚至现在她的伤口愈合得比平时快得多。医生无法解释，但丽会活下去。

The only person unaccounted for was Kaji and Shinji told Ritsuko that he was still down where Unit 01 was before. Shinji did not want to disclose the story with everyone at that moment for the sake of Kaji.  
唯一下落不明的人是梶，真嗣告诉律子，他还在 01 部队之前所在的地方。为了加持，真嗣此时并不想向大家透露这个故事。

After all these events had transpired, the citizens of Tokyo-3 all returned. It seemed the people were grateful for the evacuation and the effort NERV put in to defeat Seele. As thanks, many volunteered in work to help in rebuilding the grand city. Without having to pay much and with the great enthusiasm of the workers, the reconstruction of Tokyo-3 went rather fast. Shinji and Asuka's, or should we say Misato's, apartment was rebuilt in the second week and after having been extremely busy the entire time being debriefed and helping with reparations, the two stayed there that day. As celebration, Asuka "gave him a good time" in the new apartment that night.  
所有这些事件发生后，第三东京的居民都回来了。人们似乎对疏散以及 NERV 为击败 Seele 所付出的努力表示感谢。为了表示感谢，许多人自愿参加工作，帮助重建这座宏伟的城市。在没有花太多钱的情况下，在工人们的极大热情下，第三东京的重建进展得相当快。真嗣和明日香的公寓，或者应该说是美里的公寓，在第二周就被重建了，在一直忙于接受汇报和帮助赔偿之后，两人当天就住在那里。作为庆祝，明日香当晚在新公寓“让他度过了一段愉快的时光”。

Shinji recalled with a blush the intensity of that night together; she had been so wild. But ever since then, she had constantly refused to do it again until recently she promised they would do it again.  
真嗣回忆起那天晚上的紧张气氛，不禁脸红了。她是如此狂野。但从那以后，她一直拒绝再这样做，直到最近她答应他们会再这样做。

Whenever they could, they used Shinji to pilot Unit 01, as it required no power, to help in the reconstruction. He mostly just cleared rubble and debris out of the way, but helped with heavy lifting too. The shops, restaurants, cinemas, residences were all rebuilt in no time. The school was also rebuilt and they started to go back to school and were happy to be with their friends again. Hikari was proud of Touji helping the other eva pilots in the final battle and Kensuke was jealous over the jock, wishing he had been chosen to help as well. It had been about a month and a half since the battle with the mass production evas and Shinji was amazed to see how quickly Tokyo-3 had been rebuilt.  
只要有可能，他们就会使用真嗣来驾驶 01 号机组，因为它不需要动力，以帮助重建。他主要只是清理路上的瓦砾和杂物，但也帮忙搬运重物。商店、餐馆、电影院、住宅都很快被重建。学校也重建了，他们开始回到学校，很高兴再次和朋友们在一起。光为东次在最后的战斗中帮助其他 eva 飞行员而感到自豪，健介则嫉妒这位运动员，希望他也能被选中来帮忙。距离量产eva的战斗已经过去了大约一个半月，真嗣惊讶地发现第三东京的重建速度如此之快。

The boy was broken out of his reverie when he felt a sharp jab in his ribs. Surprised, Shinji turned around to see Asuka looking at him annoyed.  
当男孩感到肋骨被猛烈一击时，他从沉思中惊醒。真嗣惊讶地转过头来，看到明日香正恼怒地看着他。

"Stop spacing out boy" she demanded, a little tense.  
“别发呆了，孩子，”她有点紧张地要求道。

"Err… I already finished the lunches" Shinji replied.  
“呃……我已经吃完午饭了。”真嗣回答道。

"Then dress up already you baka!" Asuka shouted at him, shoving him out of the kitchen.  
“那你就好好打扮一下吧！”明日香对他大喊，把他推出厨房。

"Jeez, so cranky already?" Shinji shot back in disbelief.  
“天哪，已经这么暴躁了吗？”真嗣难以置信地回击道。

"Who do you think is the cause?" the girl snapped back at him.  
“你认为是谁造成的？”女孩厉声斥责他。

Deciding it was better not to answer the question, the male eva pilot hurried to his room to change into his school uniform. After dressing up, he took his bag and looked around the room to check if he forgot anything. Not finding anything, he exited his room. Walking back to the kitchen, he packed his bento into his bag, noticing that Asuka's bento was already gone. The boy then traversed over to the front door and saw the redhead already there. Noticing Shinji coming towards her, Asuka turned to face him.  
决定还是不回答这个问题比较好，男EVA飞行员赶紧跑回自己的房间换上校服。穿好衣服后，他拿起包，在房间里环视了一圈，看看有没有忘记带什么东西。没有找到任何东西，他退出了房间。走回厨房，他把便当装进包里，发现明日香的便当已经不见了。然后男孩走到前门，看到红发女郎已经在那里了。明日香注意到真嗣朝她走来，转过身来面对他。

"About time you slow poke, your snail's pace is starting to get annoying" she remarked.  
“到了你慢慢戳戳的时候了，你的蜗牛速度开始变得烦人了”她评论道。

"Are you angry with me Asuka? Or are you just in a bad mood?" Shinji asked, worried about her behaviour.  
“明日香，你是在生我的气吗？还是只是心情不好？”真嗣担心她的行为，问道。

"Nothing's wrong! Let's just go to school already" Asuka replied, grabbing his hand.  
“没事！我们去学校吧。”明日香抓住他的手回答道。

The two eva pilots went through the front door, closing and locking it behind them. The redhead pulled Shinji down the stairs with her and they exited the apartment. The brilliant sun once again shone over the rebuilt city of Tokyo-3 and onto the two teens. It was good to see people up and about, good to see all the activity in this thriving city. It was amazing how everything had come together, how everyone was able to return even after all that had happened.  
两名逃生飞行员穿过前门，将门在身后关上并锁上。红发女郎拉着真嗣下了楼梯，然后出了公寓。灿烂的阳光再次照耀在重建后的第三东京市上空，照耀在两个少年的身上。很高兴看到人们走来走去，很高兴看到这个繁荣城市的所有活动。令人惊奇的是，一切都聚集在一起，即使在发生了这一切之后，每个人都能够回来。

Shinji and Asuka began their walk towards the school. Despite her earlier behaviour, Asuka wasn't in a rush to get to school and so the two walked calmly down the footpath towards their destination. Occasionally people would smile, wave or nod their head at the eva pilots as they recognised them. It would seem people really were grateful to those who had saved Tokyo-3.  
真嗣和明日香开始向学校走去。尽管明日香之前有这样的行为，但她并不急于去学校，所以两人平静地沿着人行道向目的地走去。有时，当人们认出他们时，他们会向 eva 飞行员微笑、挥手或点头。看来人们真的很感激那些拯救了第三东京的人。

Soon, the couple had arrived at the front gates of the school. There were still a few students outside the school building as classes hadn't started yet. The two eva pilots made their way through the front gates and into the school building. Heading down the corridor, they moved towards their classroom, always happy to see the fair number of students at the school.  
很快，夫妻俩就到了学校门口。由于还没开始上课，教学楼外还站着一些学生。两名紧急救援飞行员穿过前门，进入教学楼。他们沿着走廊朝教室走去，看到学校里有这么多的学生，他们总是很高兴。

Arriving at their classroom door, the redhead opened it and the two entered the room. Recently every time the two eva pilots entered the room, all the students would turn to look at them and give them a nod before returning to their previous activities. Shinji still wasn't used to it, but Asuka loved the attention. It didn't take long for Kensuke and Touji to come over. Hikari was currently busy giving instructions to some other students. Having had time to get used to Shinji's and Asuka's relationship, Touji was able to accept the redhead as Shinji's girlfriend. But he would still throw jokes at her or call her a demon, although most of the time Hikari kept him in line.  
到了教室门口，红发打开门，两人就进了房间。最近，每当两名EVA飞行员进入房间时，所有的学生都会转头看向他们，向他们点点头，然后再继续之前的活动。真嗣仍然不习惯，但明日香喜欢这种关注。没过多久，健介和东次就过来了。光现在正忙着给其他一些学生做指示。在适应了真嗣和明日香的关系后，东次能够接受红发女郎作为真嗣的女朋友。但他仍然会跟她开玩笑或者称她为恶魔，尽管大多数时候光都让他遵守规矩。

Surprisingly, it would seem Kensuke sought after the blue haired eva pilot and even managed to hold a conversation with her. With further encouragement from Shinji and the fact that he was Shinji's friend, Rei was able to express herself a little to the spectacled boy. Neither Rei's nor Kensuke's intentions were clear, but it seemed each was at least a little interested in the other.  
令人惊讶的是，剑介似乎在寻找蓝发的伊娃飞行员，甚至设法与她进行了交谈。在真嗣的进一步鼓励以及他是真嗣的朋友这一事实下，丽能够向戴眼镜的男孩表达一些自己的想法。丽和健介的意图都不清楚，但似乎都对对方有一点兴趣。

"Greetings enslaved one" Touji said to Shinji, grinning.  
“你好，奴隶。”东次笑着对真嗣说道。

Shinji snickered a little while Kensuke nudged Touji in the gut. As always, Asuka seemed to take offence from the jock's comments.  
真嗣窃笑了一声，健介则用胳膊肘碰了碰东次的肚子。和往常一样，明日香似乎对运动员的言论感到生气。

"You better shut up, or _you_ will be the enslaved one!" Asuka retorted.  
“你最好闭嘴，不然你就是被奴役的人！”明日香反驳道。

"I'd like to see you try" Touji provoked.  
“我希望你能尝试一下。”东治挑衅道。

"It'd be such a waste of my efforts and you wouldn't even make a good slave. I don't think you can do anything right" Asuka shot back, glaring.  
“这真是浪费我的努力，你甚至不能成为一个好奴隶。我不认为你能做任何正确的事。”明日香怒视着反驳道。

"Hey Asuka come on, no need to get angry" Shinji intervened, trying to calm her down.  
“嘿明日香，别生气了，不用生气。”真嗣介入，试图让她平静下来。

"Don't bother Shinji, a demon is always angry" Touji commented.  
“别打扰真嗣，恶魔总是生气的。”东次评论道。

Asuka went and smacked the jock over the head. "Are you really that stupid to go and piss me off even more?" she snapped, annoyed.  
明日香走过去，敲了一下运动员的头。 “你真的这么蠢，竟然去惹我生气吗？”她生气地厉声说道。

"What was that for?" Touji said, rubbing his head. "You need to get the sand out of your vagina honestly!" he remarked.  
“那是干什么用的？”东二摸着头说道。 “你得老老实实把阴道里的沙子弄出来！”他说。

Asuka's eyes glared menacingly and Shinji was in fear for his friend's life. The male eva pilot decided to turn the redhead's wrath towards himself.  
明日香的眼神充满威胁，真嗣担心他朋友的生命安全。男伊娃飞行员决定将红发的愤怒转向自己。

"Now that you mention it, it was pretty coarse last time" Shinji joked.  
真嗣开玩笑道：“既然你这么说，上次就很粗暴了。”

Both Touji and Kensuke let out a laugh at his comment. "Shinji you dog, what have you been up to?" Touji said, still chuckling.  
听到他的评论，东治和健介都笑了起来。 “真嗣你个狗东西，你在忙什么呢？”东二依然笑着说道。

"Just what the hell do you think you're implying Ikari?" Asuka rebuked, slapping Shinji hard.  
“你到底认为你在暗示碇是什么？”明日香一边斥责，一边狠狠地打了真嗣一巴掌。

"Relax Asuka, I was just joking" Shinji replied, rubbing his sore cheek.  
“放心明日香，我只是开玩笑。”真嗣揉着酸痛的脸颊回答道。

"You can just go to hell Ikari!" she shouted at him, turning around and walking off to Hikari.  
“碇你就见鬼去吧！”她对他喊道，转身朝光走去。

Shinji usually wouldn't pay heed to her bad temper, but she looked like she was about to cry. Something was strange about her today; did something happen to upset her? Was this morning's incident the cause? The male eva pilot couldn't really think of what would put her into her current mood and resolved to ask her at the lunchbreak. Touji just patted Shinji on the shoulder as the redhead walked off.  
真嗣平时不会理会她的坏脾气，但她看起来却快要哭了。今天她有些奇怪。是不是发生什么事让她不高兴了？是今天早上发生的事情吗？男EVA飞行员实在想不出什么会让她陷入现在的心情，并决定在午休时问她。东次只是拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，红发女郎就走开了。

"I don't know how you can stand her" Touji remarked.  
“我不知道你怎么能忍受她”，东治说道。

"You wouldn't understand. And Touji no more jokes today, I think she's upset about something" Shinji said firmly.  
“你不会明白的。而且冬儿今天不能再开玩笑了，我想她是因为什么事情而感到不安。”真嗣坚定地说。

"Fine fine" the jock agreed.  
“好吧好吧”运动员同意了。

"So Kensuke, speaking of girlfriends, Touji and I both have one. How's your luck going with Rei?" Shinji asked, grinning.  
“健介，说到女朋友，我和东次都有一个。你和丽的运气怎么样？”真嗣笑着问道。

"Who said I was trying to get with Rei?" Kensuke answered.  
“谁说我是想和丽在一起？”健介回答道。

"Oh, so how come you keep talking to her?" Shinji asked suspiciously.  
“哦，那你怎么还跟她说话呢？”真嗣疑惑地问道。

"Can't I?" Kensuke replied.  
“我不能吗？”健介回答道。

"I saw you talking to her alone on the rooftop the other day, just spill the beans already" Touji demanded.  
“那天我看到你在屋顶上单独和她说话，就泄露秘密吧。”冬治要求道。

"Fine, I'll tell you how the conversation went…" Kensuke started.  
“好吧，我会告诉你谈话是如何进行的……”健介开始说道。


_**Kensuke approached the blue haired albino a little nervously. Upon noticing him, Rei turned to face the young boy.  
健介有些紧张地走近蓝发白化人。注意到他后，雷转过身来面对着这个少年。**_

**"**_**Why did you request of me to proceed up here to meet with you?" Rei asked.**_  
“你为什么要求我到这里来见你？”雷问道。

**"**_**I just wanted to talk to you" Kensuke answered.**_  
“我只是想和你谈谈。”健介回答道。

**"**_**We can converse in various other places, even over the phone if you required privacy. Why here in particular?" she replied.**_  
“我们可以在其他地方交谈，如果你需要隐私，甚至可以通过电话交谈。为什么特别是在这里？”她回应。

**"**_**I wanted to talk in person" Kensuke said, growing more nervous.**_  
“我想亲自谈谈，”健介说，变得越来越紧张。

**"**_**Very well, what is it that you wished to speak to me about?" Rei queried.**_  
“好吧，你想跟我谈什么？”雷问道。

_**The bespectacled boy found it very difficult to talk with the first child and her seemingly emotionless tone.  
戴眼镜的男孩觉得很难和第一个孩子说话，而且她的语气似乎毫无感情。**_

**"**_**Err… you see there's this new movie that's come out and I wanted to see it…" he started before pausing.**_  
“呃……你看，有一部新电影上映了，我想看它……”他开始说道，然后停了下来。

**"**_**How is this relevant to me?" Rei asked, not realising how cold her words sounded.**_  
“这和我有什么关系？”丽问道，并没有意识到她的话听起来有多冷酷。

_**The military otaku mustered up all his courage and resolve and went for it.  
军人御宅族鼓起全部勇气和决心，全力以赴。**_

**"**_**I would like you to come see the movie with me" Kensuke stated, relieved he finally said it.**_  
“我希望你能和我一起看电影。”健介说道，他终于说出这句话，松了口气。

**"**_**If you wish to see the film with other people, there are much more convenient people" Rei commented, clearly not getting the hint.**_  
“如果你想和其他人一起看电影，还有更方便的人。”雷评论道，显然没有得到暗示。

**"**_**No no, I want to see the movie with**_ **you** _**specifically" Kensuke replied.**_  
“不不，我想专门和你一起看电影。”健介回答道。

**"**_**If you want to have my opinion of this film, I will watch the film when I have time" Rei said in response.**_  
“如果你想知道我对这部电影的看法，我有时间就会看这部电影。”Rei回应道。

**"**_**I want to see a movie with you Rei and no one else, because I want to spend time with you" Kensuke admitted, getting slightly annoyed; he didn't think she could misunderstand him this time.**_  
“我想和你一起看电影，丽，而不是其他人，因为我想和你一起度过时光。”健介承认，有点恼火；他不认为她这次会误会他。

**"**_**You are spending time with me right now are you not?" Rei asked, completely confused.**_  
“你现在正在和我一起度过，不是吗？”雷一脸困惑地问道。

_**The boy just looked at the blue haired girl in disbelief. Anybody would have praised him for his courage, anybody would have said he tried; yet here this girl missed all the clues. Supposing he had nothing left to lose, Kensuke decided to try one more time.  
少年一脸不可置信的看着蓝发少女。任何人都会称赞他的勇气，任何人都会说他尝试过；然而这个女孩却错过了所有的线索。既然已经没有什么可失去的了，健介决定再试一次。**_

**"**_**Look Rei, I can see you don't understand the purpose of this, but please at least come with me just this once and you might come to understand" Kensuke implored, hoping she would agree.**_  
“听着丽，我看你不明白这样做的目的，但至少请跟我来一次，你可能会明白”健介恳求道，希望她会同意。

**"**_**Very well, I shall think upon this. It is true that I do not understand several things and I trust that you have no ill intentions. I will give my reply when I come to a decision" Rei answered back.**_  
“好吧，我会考虑一下。确实有几件事我不明白，我相信你没有恶意。等我做出决定后，我会给出答复。”雷回答道。

**"**_**Thank you, that's fine with me" Kensuke replied happily. "That's all I wanted to talk to you about, so see ya" the boy finished, waving at her and walking off…**_  
“谢谢，我没问题。”健介高兴地回答。 “我想跟你说的就是这些，再见。”男孩说完，向她挥手走开……


"…so you see, nothing's going on, I just wanted to go see a movie" Kensuke finished.  
“……所以你看，没什么事情发生，我只是想去看电影”健介说完。

"You're still gonna say that bullshit after telling us that? Come on, how did she reply?" Touji asked.  
“都说了你还说那些废话？我说，她是怎么回答的？”东二问道。

"She hasn't said anything to me yet" Kensuke answered, a little disappointed.  
“她还没有对我说什么？”健介有些失望地回答。

"Don't worry about it Kensuke. She said she's going to give you a reply, if she didn't want to go, she would have told you already" Shinji reassured.  
“不用担心，健介。她说过会给你答复的，如果她不想去，早就告诉你了。”真嗣安慰道。

"I suppose, but even if she agrees, I don't think she'll understand the point and will never do it again" Kensuke replied, a little downcast.  
“我想，但即使她同意了，我想她也不会明白这一点，也不会再这么做了。”健介有些沮丧地回答道。

"Have a little faith man" Touji encouraged, putting his arm around the otaku's shoulder.  
“要有一点信心，伙计”东治鼓励道，用手臂搂住御宅族的肩膀。

"But it's so hard to express yourself towards her" Kensuke remarked.  
“但是很难向她表达自己的想法，”健介说道。

"Take an example from Ikari, he got together with Asuka. If _that's_ possible then surely Rei shouldn'- oww" Touji began, stopping as he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his ear.  
“就拿碇来说吧，他和明日香在一起了。如果可以的话，丽肯定应该——呜呜”东次开口说道，突然感觉耳朵一阵剧痛，他停了下来。

"I heard you were saying nasty things to Asuka, I'm sure I've told you stop saying those things _darling_" Hikari said, a little annoyed.  
“我听说你对明日香说了难听的话，我确信我已经告诉过你不要再说那些话了，亲爱的”光有点生气地说。

"But, but…" Touji started.  
“但是，但是……”东司开口道。

"No buts" Hikari interrupted. Releasing her hold on his ear, she looked sternly at him. "I expect you to apologise to her and make sure you do it today" she ordered, before turning around and walking off.  
“没有但是”光打断道。松开了他的耳朵，她严肃地看着他。 “我希望你向她道歉，并确保今天就这样做”，她命令道，然后转身走开。

Whatever the jock wanted to say in reply was cut off by their teacher entering the classroom. At once, the students all went to their desks followed by Hikari's "Rise! Bow! Sit!"  
运动员想要回答什么，都被走进教室的老师打断了。学生们立刻都回到自己的课桌前，伴随着光的“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”

Shinji quickly began typing a message on his laptop to send to Asuka.  
真嗣很快开始在他的笔记本电脑上输入消息并发送给明日香。

_**Shinji: Hey Asuka, I need to talk to you! Meet up with me at lunch please.  
真嗣：嘿明日香，我有话要和你谈谈！请在午餐时与我会面。**_

Shinji waited for a reply from his fiancée, but received none. The male eva pilot was sure he had sent the message and confirmed it by checking his _**sent**_ folder. Shinji looked up at Asuka to see her looking straight ahead with her laptop closed. Was she purposely not replying? He supposed he could just go up to her when the bell rang, hopefully she wouldn't ignore him.  
真嗣等待未婚妻的回复，但没有收到任何回复。男EVA飞行员确信他已经发送了这条消息，并通过检查他的发送文件夹确认了这一点。真嗣抬头看着明日香，发现她合着笔记本电脑，直视前方。她是故意不回复的吗？他想当铃声响起时他可以走到她身边，希望她不会忽视他。

Sighing, Shinji lay his head back down on his desk; it seemed Seele's attack hadn't changed the dullness of his teacher's lecture. After all the information about the real Second Impact got out, it seemed the teacher took it to heart to give a lecture about this new topic. Having nothing better to do, Shinji looked over at Rei. The blue haired girl was occasionally glancing at Kensuke with confused eyes; it was like she couldn't come to a decision within herself. The boy smiled at her behaviour, finally after years of her emotionless façade, it was starting to break.  
真嗣叹了口气，把头靠回办公桌上。看来希儿的攻击并没有改变老师讲课的平淡。当真正的第二次冲击的信息全部传出后，老师似乎很认真地讲授这个新话题。真嗣无事可做，便看向丽。蓝发少女时不时地用疑惑的目光看向健介。就好像她自己无法做出决定一样。男孩对她的行为微笑，多年来她毫无感情的外表终于开始破裂。

Shinji tried his best to pass the time, but he felt so restless; he really wanted to talk to Asuka and find out what was wrong. The boy found it impossible to pay attention to the teacher and so he began impatiently tapping his pencil under his desk. Soon, he found himself tapping a little rhythm. Looking around the room, Shinji could see that no one had really noticed yet and the teacher continued on without hesitance. Completely bored, Shinji began to tap the rhythm with his pencil a little louder and was glad to hear someone on the other side of the classroom copy him.  
真嗣竭尽全力地打发时间，但他却感到心神不宁；他真的很想和明日香谈谈，看看出了什么问题。男孩发现不可能专心听老师讲课，于是他开始不耐烦地用铅笔在课桌下敲击。很快，他发现自己有点节奏了。真嗣环顾四周，发现还没有人真正注意到，老师毫不犹豫地继续说道。完全无聊的真嗣开始用铅笔敲击节奏，声音更大一些，很高兴听到教室另一边有人模仿他。

Tapping again, another person returned it and soon more people had caught on to the little game. One would tap a rhythm and other people would follow suit, tapping the same rhythm. It would travel around the class, making it impossible to determine the source. At first not everyone noticed it, but as it continued to progress and more and more people joined in, the tapping became an incessant noise.  
再次点击，另一个人返回了它，很快更多的人开始玩这个小游戏。一个人敲击一种节奏，其他人也会效仿，敲击相同的节奏。它会在班级中传播，从而无法确定来源。起初并不是所有人都注意到了，但随着事情的不断进展，越来越多的人加入进来，敲击声变成了持续不断的噪音。

The teacher stopped what he was saying and looked around the room unable to figure out who it was. The sound had come from all over the classroom and everyone was tapping their pencil under their desk, so it was almost impossible to see who was doing it. As the teacher started again, the tapping game begun again. This time, the teacher slammed a book down on his desk.  
老师停下了话，环顾四周，看不出是谁。声音从教室各处传来，每个人都在桌子底下敲击铅笔，所以几乎看不到是谁在做这件事。随着老师重新开始，敲击游戏又开始了。这一次，老师把一本书重重地摔在了他的课桌上。

"I ask that you refrain from making all that noise and pay attention" the teacher snapped, a little annoyed.  
“我请你们不要发出那么多噪音，要专心听讲。”老师有些生气地厉声说道。

Shinji had had his fun so he decided to stop; besides the class was almost over. Soon, the bell rang and the boy sighed in relief; finally, he could talk to Asuka. The male eva pilot wasted no time in getting up and moving over to the redhead. It seemed she didn't want to speak to him as she also got up swiftly and moved towards the exit of the classroom. Fortunately, Shinji was too quick and he caught her arm. The redhead just turned around and faced him with a glare.  
真嗣玩得很开心，所以他决定停下来；再说课也快下课了。很快，铃声响起，男孩松了口气。终于，他可以和明日香说话了。男性EVA飞行员立即站起身来，走到了红发女郎身边。她似乎不想跟他说话，也快步起身，向教室出口走去。幸好真嗣速度太快，一把抓住了她的手臂。红发刚刚转过身来，怒视着他。

The other students piled out of the classroom, leaving Shinji and Asuka alone in the room. As both of them were silent they could hear the faint sound of laughter and chatting coming from outside. Shinji knew he had to speak up first as Asuka wouldn't.  
其他学生纷纷走出教室，只剩下真嗣和明日香两个人在教室里。两人都沉默着，隐隐约约听到外面传来笑声和聊天声。真嗣知道他必须先开口说话，而明日香不会。

"Didn't you get my message Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“明日香你没收到我的消息吗？”真嗣问道。

"I didn't think it was worth my time to stay and listen to you" Asuka answered.  
“我觉得不值得我花时间留下来听你说话。”明日香回答道。

"Come on Asuka, I can see you're upset. Why don't you tell me what's wrong?" Shinji implored.  
“来吧，明日香，我看得出来你很沮丧。你为什么不告诉我出了什么问题呢？”真嗣恳求道。

"Says you, who can't say what's bothering you" Asuka retorted.  
“你说，谁说不出你在烦恼什么。”明日香反驳道。

"Well… that's a bit different" Shinji replied.  
“嗯……有点不同。”真嗣回答道。

"Always full of bullshit Ikari!" she snapped angrily.  
“碇总是满嘴废话！”她愤怒地厉声说道。

"Asuka…" he started, only to see the girl turn away from him, crossing her arms.  
“明日香……”他开口说道，却看到女孩背对着他，交叉着双臂。

Shinji slowly walked up behind her, putting his arms around the girl, embracing her gently. The boy felt no resistance from the redhead and so began nuzzling her neck. At this, the female eva pilot unfolded her arms and Shinji moved his hands up to cup her breasts, fondling them softly. A gust of wind then came through the window, blowing Asuka's hair about.  
真嗣缓缓走到她身后，伸手搂住女孩，温柔地拥抱着她。男孩没有感觉到红发女郎的反抗，于是开始用鼻子蹭她的脖子。这时，女伊娃飞行员张开了双臂，真嗣抬起双手捧住了她的乳房，轻轻地抚摸着。一阵风从窗户吹了进来，吹乱了明日香的头发。

"Give it a rest Shinji" she remarked, slightly irritated.  
“真嗣，休息一下吧。”她有些恼怒地说。

In response, the boy moved one of his hands down her body and under her skirt. At this, the redhead moved away and turned to face the boy.  
作为回应，男孩将一只手移到她的身体和裙子下面。说到这里，红发女郎退开，转过身来面对着男孩。

"None of that! Apparently my vagina is full of sand" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“都不是！显然我的阴道里充满了沙子”明日香讽刺地说。

"I was joking Asuka, your vagina is the most wonderful thing I've ever felt" Shinji replied earnestly.  
“我在开玩笑，明日香，你的阴道是我感受过的最美妙的东西。”真嗣认真地回答道。

"It is a _privilege_ to even just LOOK at my vagina, to insult it, you forfeit any privilege you had" Asuka said resolutely.  
“即使只是看我的阴道，侮辱它也是一种荣幸，你就放弃了你拥有的任何特权”明日香坚决地说。

"What about your promise?" Shinji asked, a little amused at her behaviour.  
“那你的承诺呢？”真嗣对她的举动感到有些好笑，问道。

"You should have thought about that before you opened your mout-" she started, getting cut off by Shinji's lips.  
“你在开口之前就应该考虑一下这一点——”她开口说道，却被真嗣的嘴唇打断了。

The boy wasted no time in deepening the kiss on the surprised redhead. Moving his hand under her skirt again, he pulled her panties down. Pushing her down onto a desk, he parted with her, reaching down to completely remove her undergarment.  
男孩不失时机地加深了对惊讶的红发女郎的吻。他再次把手伸进她的裙子下面，把她的内裤拉了下来。他将她推倒在桌子上，与她分开，伸手将她的内衣彻底脱掉。

"Stop it Shinji! I said you can't!" she shouted at him angrily.  
“住手真嗣！我说了你不能！”她愤怒地对他喊道。

Normally the male eva pilot would overlook her typical anger, but with her behaviour today, his fear of breaking his vow kicked in and he stopped immediately. The boy moved away from Asuka a little unsteadily and she looked up at him, utterly confused at his sudden change in demeanour. The girl decided to let go of her frustration and find out what was bothering her fiancé, after all she knew he had just been teasing her.  
通常情况下，男性EVA飞行员都会忽略她典型的愤怒，但今天她的行为，让他害怕违背自己的誓言，并立即停止了动作。男孩摇摇晃晃地离开了明日香，她抬头看着他，对他突然的态度变化感到十分困惑。女孩决定放下沮丧，找出未婚夫困扰的原因，毕竟她知道他只是在捉弄她。

"You're acting a little strange Shinji… what the hell is up with you?" Asuka asked, a little calmer than before.  
“你的行为有点奇怪，真嗣……你到底怎么了？”明日香问道，语气比之前平静了一些。

The boy stayed silent for a while wondering what to say. It was impossible to tell her what was bothering him, but Misato's conversation yesterday still rang inside his head. It was true what his guardian had said, just now was proof that this guilt inside him would constantly eat at him.  
男孩沉默了一会儿，不知道该说什么。无法告诉她到底是什么在困扰着他，但美里昨天的谈话仍然在他的脑海中响起。监护人所说的确实如此，刚才就证明了他内心的愧疚会不断侵蚀着他。


**"**_**Asuka is worried about you, if you try to talk to her, she'll listen"**_  
“明日香很担心你，如果你试着跟她说话，她会听的”


Shinji sighed and turned to face the girl. "You know Asuka, there has been something on my mind, but I didn't know how to express it or if I even should" he started.  
真嗣叹了口气，转身面对少女。 “你知道明日香，我心里一直有一些想法，但我不知道如何表达，也不知道是否应该表达，”他开始说道。

At his sudden serious tone, the redhead sat up to listen attentively; she was sure he was about to confess whatever had been making him act a little odd. "Hurry up baka, I'm listening" Asuka encouraged.  
听到他突然严肃的语气，红发的人坐了起来，聚精会神地听着。她确信他即将承认是什么让他表现得有点奇怪。 “快点吧，我在听。”明日香鼓励道。

The boy took a few breaths before continuing.  
男孩吸了几口气才继续说道。

"It's just that, many times you tell me to stop…doing things to you. And well, I get worried about myself… sometimes I can get really angry. I don't know if I can control myself all the time…" Shinji continued, trying to express what he felt in words.  
“只是，很多时候你告诉我停止……对你做事。而且，我很担心自己……有时我会很生气。我不知道我是否能一直控制自己……”真嗣继续，试图用语言表达他的感受。

"You're not making much sense Shinji" Asuka remarked.  
“真嗣，你说得不太清楚。”明日香说道。

"Sometimes I don't know if I go too far, sometimes I don't know if you're kidding or not. What if I do something bad to you without realising it?" Shinji clarified, trying to make himself clearer.  
“有时候我不知道自己是不是太过分了，有时候我也不知道你是不是在开玩笑。如果我在没有意识到的情况下对你做了坏事怎么办？”真嗣澄清道，试图让自己更清楚。

"I still don't get what point you're trying to make" Asuka said, growing frustrated at his explanation.  
“我还是不明白你想表达什么意思，”明日香说道，对他的解释感到越来越沮丧。

"What if… because I was angry, angry enough not to be able to stop myself…what if I… I raped you Asuka" Shinji finished quietly.  
“如果……因为我很生气，生气到无法阻止自己……如果我……我强奸了你明日香怎么办？”真嗣平静地结束了。

_'So that's it!'_ Asuka thought. Shinji had made many advances towards her, but she would refuse many of them and he was worried about raping her in frustration or something along those lines? It was a little bit strange that he was thinking about this, or that it would make him behave like he had, but then again, Shinji always worried about silly things. The girl looked straight back at Shinji to give him her reply.  
'就是这样了！'明日香心想。真嗣向她做出了很多举动，但她会拒绝其中的很多，而他担心他会在沮丧中强奸她或者类似的事情？他的想法有点奇怪，或者这会让他表现得像他那样，但话又说回来，真嗣总是担心一些愚蠢的事情。少女直视着真嗣，给出了答案。

"To think that you were worried about something like that all this time, you really are a baka. I personally think it is preposterous that you would _rape_ me. I would definitely make sure you knew I didn't want it, furthermore I don't think I could make you angry enough to do so either, though you never know" she replied, smiling a little.  
“没想到你一直担心这样的事情，你真是个笨蛋。我个人认为你强奸我是很荒谬的。我一定会让你知道我不想要它，而且我不想要它。”我认为我也不会让你生气到这样做，尽管你永远不知道”她回答道，微笑着。

The male eva pilot stayed silent, unable to respond.  
男EVA飞行员保持沉默，无法回应。

"Though I can see you obviously think it's plausible so I'll tell you what I would do. If you were to rape me Shinji, for whatever reason, I would kick your ass and forbid you to touch me for a year!" she answered, smacking him across the head.  
“虽然我看得出来你显然认为这是合理的，所以我会告诉你我会做什么。如果你要强奸我，真嗣，无论出于什么原因，我都会踢你的屁股，一年内不准你碰我！”她回答道，拍了拍他的头。

"But…" Shinji began, a little confused. _'That was it?'_ he thought.  
“但是……”真嗣开始说道，有点困惑。 “就是这样吗？”他以为。

"What, you think I'd let you get away with it?" Asuka asked incredulously.  
“怎么，你以为我会让你逍遥法外吗？”明日香不可置信地问道。

"No, that's not what I mean, it's just… you would stay with me?" Shinji asked.  
“不，我不是这个意思，我只是……你愿意留在我身边吗？”真嗣问道。

"Where would I find another baka like you? Not to say I wouldn't feel betrayed or that it's not a horrible thing to do but, I… love you. You've already faked your own death and I've forgiven you, a couple will always have their ups and downs, albeit rape is a _little_ extreme, but still. I'm not stupid Shinji, I know if you were to rape me it wouldn't be fully intentional and I know that I can sometimes be… 'difficult'," she explained.  
“我在哪里可以找到另一个像你这样的笨蛋？并不是说我不会感到被背叛，也不是说这不是一件可怕的事情，但是，我……爱你。你已经假死了，我已经原谅你了，一对夫妇总会有起起落落，虽然强奸有点极端，但我并不傻，真嗣，我知道如果你强奸我，那不是完全故意的，我知道有时我可能是故意的。 ……‘困难’，”她解释道。

"But nothing you could do would make you deserve that and I always have a choice" Shinji argued.  
“但无论你做什么，你都不会得到这样的结果，而我总是有选择的”真嗣争辩道。

"Look Shinji, stop thinking about these crazy extreme situations. Unfortunately, we are engaged to be married, you must stay with me regardless of what happens and the same goes for me" the redhead declared, smiling, "As long as you're mine, it doesn't really matter about the rest. I wouldn't let anyone else have sex with me but you, so if _you_ raped me, then it's not _as_ bad" Asuka said, getting a little annoyed at her fiancé's constant questioning.  
“听着真嗣，别再想这些疯狂的极端情况了。不幸的是，我们订婚了，无论发生什么，你都必须留在我身边，我也是如此，”红发微笑着说道，“只要你我的，其他的都不重要，除了你，我不会让任何人和我发生性关系，所以如果你强奸了我，那就没那么糟糕了。”明日香说道，对她的未婚夫不断的询问感到有点恼火。 。

"It's different when you think about it hypothetically and when you actually experience it. What if we weren't together and I did it, what then?" Shinji asked.  
“当你假设地思考它和当你实际经历它时，这是不同的。如果我们不在一起而我做到了，那又怎么样？”真嗣问道。

"Mein Gott you stupid baka, what more do you want me to say? I would forgive you, I would stay with you and I would still… love you. Why are you so damn insecure about this anyway? Stop thinking about 'what if this' and 'what if that,' it doesn't matter what could happen, it doesn't matter if you did it while we weren't together, it doesn't change how I feel right now. I have experienced much worse things in my life, we will deal with whatever happens as it comes along. Now I've given you my reply on this topic so just get over it already" Asuka finished determinedly.  
“我的天啊，你这个愚蠢的笨蛋，你还想让我说什么？我会原谅你，我会和你在一起，我仍然会……爱你。为什么你对此如此缺乏安全感？别再想‘如果会怎样？’” “这个”和“如果那样怎么办”，无论会发生什么，无论你在我们不在一起的时候做了什么，这都不会改变我现在的感受，我经历过更糟糕的事情。 “我的生活中发生的事情，无论发生什么，我们都会处理。现在我已经给了你关于这个话题的答复，所以你就别介意了。”明日香坚定地说道。

The male eva pilot just stood there stunned, unable to believe what he had heard. To say things with such conviction; Shinji knew her feelings for him were solid. After hearing her words, a weight that had burdened him for quite a while was finally lifted. It was true he should stop worrying about it, it was in the past and he couldn't change what he had done. Furthermore, he and Asuka were now together and that was all he should think about. The boy also felt like he could eventually reveal the truth to his fiancée; maybe he was being cowardly, but hearing that she would love and forgive him if it hypothetically happened really put him at ease.  
男EVA飞行员目瞪口呆地站在那里，无法相信自己所听到的。说出如此坚定的话；真嗣知道她对他的感情是坚定的。听她这么一说，压在他身上许久的重担终于卸下了。确实，他不应该再担心了，那已经是过去的事情了，他无法改变自己所做的事情。而且，现在他和明日香在一起了，这才是他应该考虑的事情。男孩还觉得他最终可以向未婚妻透露真相。也许他很胆怯，但听到如果假设发生的话她会爱他并原谅他，这确实让他放心了。

Seeing the tension from her fiancé's face disappear, Asuka softened her face a little. "I can't believe you had so much frustration bottled up inside you Shinji. Next time you have something to discuss, just say it no matter how stupid it is. You can always count on me to give you an honest answer" Asuka replied, sticking her tongue out at him.  
看到未婚夫脸上的紧张消失了，明日香的表情稍微缓和了一些。 “真嗣，我不敢相信你内心隐藏了如此多的挫败感。下次你有事情要讨论时，不管它有多愚蠢，只要说出来。你总是可以指望我给你一个诚实的答案。”明日香回答道，向他伸出舌头。

Unable to hold back, Shinji embraced the girl as tightly as he could and began sobbing. The redhead just sighed and rubbed his back comfortingly. Asuka was relieved that her fiancé had finally let it all out.  
真嗣无法抑制地用力抱住女孩，开始抽泣。红头发的人只是叹了口气，安慰地揉着他的背。明日香松了口气，因为她的未婚夫终于把一切都说出来了。

"I'm glad you're moved by my words and all, but I've been sitting on this desk with my panties down the entire time and this room is a little drafty" Asuka remarked, shifting a little.  
“我很高兴你被我的话所感动，但我一直穿着内裤坐在这张桌子上，而且这个房间有点通风”明日香说道，移动了一点。

The boy moved off of her and wiped his eyes dry, looking at her cheekily. "Hmm, I can make it so you won't feel the draftiness at all" he replied playfully.  
男孩从她身上移开，擦干眼睛，厚脸皮地看着她。 “嗯，我可以做到，让你根本感觉不到通风。”他开玩笑地回答道。

"Already back to your perverted self Ikari?" she teased.  
“碇已经变回原来的样子了吗？”她取笑道。

Moving her hands down seductively, she completely removed her panties and threw them at the boy's head.  
她双手诱惑地垂下，将内裤彻底脱掉，扔到了男孩的头上。

"Well, I have a promise to fulfil, fortunately for you, and as such I will let you engage in the act of _consensual_ sex with me. But make sure to be quick of course, I don't want the class to come in while we're having sex" Asuka declared, opening her legs.  
“好吧，我有一个承诺要履行，对你来说幸运的是，因此我会让你与我进行自愿的性行为。但是当然要快点，我不想让班级进来当我们做爱的时候”明日香张开双腿说道。

Shinji took a whiff of his fiancée's panties before taking them off his head, pocketing them and moving in between the redhead's legs. Asuka wrapped her legs around the boy's waist as he moved down to kiss her. Moving swiftly, he soon found his hand under her skirt, rubbing her private region vigorously. The girl shivered at the contact and moaned into the kiss.  
真嗣闻了闻未婚妻的内裤，然后把它们从头上脱下来，装进口袋，移进红发的双腿之间。当男孩走下来亲吻她时，明日香用双腿搂住男孩的腰。动作很快，很快他的手就探到了她的裙子下面，用力的揉搓着她的私处。女孩因接触而颤抖，并在亲吻中呻吟。

The redhead parted so that she could speak. "Don't tease me Shinji… you know what gets me wet really fast, just do-mmmmm" she let out as he began to rub her clitoris as well.  
红发女郎分开，以便她能说话。 “别取笑我真嗣……你知道什么会让我很快湿透，只是做——嗯嗯”当他也开始摩擦她的阴蒂时，她喊道。

Asuka couldn't hold back her erotic noises; she hadn't felt this sensation for a while. Shinji made sure to stimulate her thoroughly, using one hand for her breasts, making sure her nipples were adequately satisfied, while his other hand made sure her cunt also received proper attention.  
明日香无法抑制她的色情声音；她已经有一段时间没有感受到这种感觉了。真嗣确保彻底刺激她，用一只手抚摸她的乳房，确保她的乳头得到充分的满足，而他的另一只手确保她的阴户也得到适当的关注。

Deciding she was wet enough, the boy pushed Asuka down flat on the desk and unbuckled his pants, pulling them down with his boxers. Positioning his erect cock at her entrance, Shinji grabbed onto the redhead's shoulders for support before plunging into her depths without hesitation. Asuka cried out in ecstasy at the penetration, her face set into an expression of pure rapture. The girl held the boy towards her even tighter with her legs as he continually filled her with his cock.  
男孩认为她已经湿透了，于是把明日香推倒在桌子上，解开裤子的扣子，把它们和平角内裤一起拉下来。真嗣将勃起的阴茎抵在她的入口处，抓住红发女郎的肩膀作为支撑，然后毫不犹豫地插入她的深处。明日香因插入而狂喜地叫喊起来，她的脸上露出纯粹狂喜的表情。女孩用双腿将男孩抱得更紧，男孩不断地用他的鸡巴充满她。

The desk he was fucking her on began to creak and wobble as he continually thrust into her keen wet pussy.  
当他不断地插入她敏锐潮湿的阴户时，他操她的桌子开始吱吱作响并摇晃。

"This desk…is going…to fucking…break" Asuka let out between thrusts.  
“这张桌子……他妈的……要……坏掉了”明日香在推力之间喊道。

"You're finally admitting you're heavy Asuka?" Shinji joked.  
“你终于承认自己很重了，明日香？”慎二开玩笑道。

"I would so…kill you right now…" Asuka retorted, finding it hard to talk.  
“我真想……现在就杀了你……”明日香反驳道，发现自己很难说话。

The boy grunted in exertion as he was getting close to cumming and was struggling to hold it in. In a last-ditch effort, the male eva pilot began to ram his cock up her vagina with all his strength. The redhead cried out even louder; it was a wonder that no one had heard the activity going on inside this classroom.  
当男孩快要射精时，他用力地咕哝着，并努力控制住它。在最后的努力中，男伊娃飞行员开始用尽全力将他的阴茎塞进她的阴道。红头发的人叫得更大声了。奇怪的是，没有人听到这间教室里正在进行的活动。

Unable to stop himself Shinji, cummed inside Asuka, his hot sticky semen filling up her insides. No sooner had the boy released his load when the girl followed suit and orgasmed intensely, screaming out Shinji's name at full volume. Both teens panted heavily as they went down from their climax, the sweat they perspired had been absorbed by their clothes. The boy moved off Asuka to allow her to sit up.  
真嗣无法阻止自己，在明日香体内射精，他滚烫粘稠的精液充满了她的内脏。男孩刚刚释放了他的负荷，女孩也紧随其后，剧烈地高潮，大声尖叫着真嗣的名字。两个少年从高潮中跌落时，都气喘吁吁，汗水都被衣服吸收了。男孩从明日香身上移开，让她坐起来。

"Damn that felt good, why have I been putting this off for so long?" Asuka remarked.  
“该死的感觉真好，为什么我要推迟这么久？”明日香说道。

"You're asking me?" Shinji asked, bewildered.  
“你在问我？”慎二疑惑地问道。

"Quiet you" Asuka snapped. "Give me back my panties already" she ordered.  
“你安静点。”明日香厉声说道。 “把我的内裤还给我”她命令道。

The male eva pilot pulled his pants and boxers up, covering up his member once again. Shinji then pulled out the redhead's underwear from his pocket, handing it to her. Asuka wasted no time in grabbing her underwear and putting them back on. The girl flung her hair back before getting off the desk. She stood up, wobbling a bit before she steadied herself and straightened her skirt.  
男EVA飞行员拉起裤子和四角裤，再次遮住他的内裤。真嗣从口袋里掏出红发的内衣，递给她。明日香立刻抓起内衣并穿上。女孩在离开桌子之前把头发往后一甩。她站了起来，摇摇晃晃地站了起来，然后才稳住身子，拉直了裙子。

"You know to tell you the truth, I was feeling shitty today. I suppose I made you worry, didn't I?" Asuka explained, smirking. "But that felt refreshing, it definitely got my blood flowing again and I feel much better now"  
“说实话，我今天感觉很糟糕。我想我让你担心了，不是吗？”明日香笑着解释道。 “但这感觉很清爽，它确实让我的血液再次流动，我现在感觉好多了”

"And here I thought I had done something again" Shinji admitted, chuckling.  
“在这里我以为我又做了一些事情”真嗣笑着承认。

"Oh don't you worry, if you're doing something wrong I'll be sure to tell you straight away" Asuka replied, grinning cheekily. The girl turned to look at the clock. "Hmm there's still a few minutes before the end of lunch, thank God we finished quickly"  
“哦，不用担心，如果你做错了什么，我一定会立即告诉你。”明日香笑着回答道。女孩转头看向时钟。 “嗯，距离午餐结束还有几分钟，谢天谢地，我们很快就吃完了”

"What's the big deal? It would only confirm that you are mine" Shinji teased smugly.  
“有什么大不了的？这样就可以确认你是我的了。”真嗣得意地调侃道。

"Don't be so conceited Ikari, whereas I don't mind kissing in public, fondling and sex is just too embarrassing" Asuka stated.  
“别这么自负，碇，虽然我不介意在公共场合接吻，但抚摸和做爱太尴尬了，”明日香说道。

"Haha I was kidding. By the way, I just realised we didn't eat our lunches. There's not enough time now though" Shinji commented, sighing.  
“哈哈，我开玩笑的。顺便说一句，我刚刚意识到我们没有吃午饭。不过现在时间不够了。”真嗣叹了口气说道。

"Whose fault is that, baka?" Asuka snapped at him.  
“这是谁的错，巴卡？”明日香对他厉声说道。

Grinning, the male eva pilot moved towards his fiancée, bringing his lips onto hers. Shinji then wrapped his arms around the redhead, pulling her closer as he deepened the kiss. The world around them disappeared as the two kissed, momentarily forgetting all their problems and just enjoying the other's affection.  
男伊娃飞行员微笑着走向他的未婚妻，将嘴唇贴在了她的嘴唇上。真嗣用双臂搂住红发女郎，将她拉得更近，加深了这个吻。两人接吻时，周围的世界都消失了，暂时忘记了所有的问题，只是享受着对方的爱意。

It was almost the end of lunchtime and Kensuke was heading back to the classroom. However, the bespectacled boy noticed the blue haired albino walking towards him. Stopping in his tracks, Kensuke just looked at her surprised. When Rei finally walked up to him, she addressed him.  
午饭时间快结束了，健介正准备回教室。然而，眼镜少年却发现蓝发白化人正朝他走来。健介停下脚步，只是惊讶地看着她。当丽最终走到他面前时，她对他说道。

"Aida, I have been thinking about your proposal and have come to a decision" Rei started.  
“阿依达，我一直在思考你的提议，并做出了决定”，丽说道。

"Alright, what's your decision?" Kensuke asked, holding his breath.  
“好吧，你的决定是什么？”健介屏住呼吸问道。

"I accept your proposal and will accompany you to the cinema" Rei answered.  
“我接受你的提议，陪你去看电影。”雷回答道。

With that, the female eva pilot walked off without saying another word while the boy allowed a smile to form on his face.  
说完，女EVA飞行员没有再说什么就走开了，男孩的脸上露出了微笑。

---

Shinji and Asuka were still kissing passionately when the bell rang. They were so wrapped up in each other, they hadn't heard it. It came as a surprise to the students when they saw the two eva pilots smooching each other; it wasn't often they publicly displayed affection. No one said a word, not daring to disturb the redhead.  
铃声响起时，真嗣和明日香还在热烈地接吻。他们太投入了，没有听到。当学生们看到两名 eva 飞行员互相亲吻时，他们感到很惊讶；他们并不经常公开表达爱意。没人说话，也不敢打扰红发。

"Ahem! Class is starting!" Hikari announced, interrupting the two.  
“咳咳！上课了！”光打断了两人的话。

The two jumped, a little shocked. They both blushed as they realised all the students were watching them. The two eva pilots quickly moved off of each other, with Asuka going straight to her desk.  
两人都跳了起来，有些震惊。当他们意识到所有学生都在看着他们时，他们都脸红了。两名 eva 飞行员迅速分开，明日香直接走向她的办公桌。

"Sorry, didn't hear the bell Hikari" Shinji replied, bowing.  
“抱歉，没听到铃声。Hikari”真嗣鞠躬回答道。

"Just go to your seat Shinji, class is about to begin" Hikari stated.  
“真嗣快去座位上吧，马上就要开始上课了。”光说道。

No sooner had the class representative said this when the teacher walked into the classroom and everyone fell silent. Hikari stood up and said her usual "Rise! Bow! Sit!" followed by the teacher resuming where he left off before the lunchbreak.  
班代表这句话刚说完，老师就走进了教室，大家都沉默了。光站起来，像往常一样说：“起立！鞠躬！坐下！”接下来，老师从午休前停下的地方继续讲下去。

Shinji sat in his chair smiling slightly; he had finally mostly gotten his deep ridden guilt off his chest and had a little fun with Asuka as a bonus, today was definitely looking up. Unfortunately though, he still had to endure this wearisome lecture; even if he learnt some things occasionally, it was still far too dreary to make up for it. Looking at his laptop, he saw that someone had sent him a message.  
真嗣坐在椅子上，微笑着。他终于摆脱了心中深深的负罪感，并与明日香一起享受了一点乐趣作为奖励，今天肯定是抬头了。可惜的是，他还是要忍受这令人厌烦的教训。就算偶尔学到一些东西，也还是太沉闷了，无法弥补。看了看笔记本，发现有人给他发了一条消息。

_**Touji: What were you doing all lunch with Asuka :D?  
Touji：你和 Asuka 共进午餐都在做什么 :D？**_

Sighing, Shinji didn't even bother replying to his friend's teasing, even though this time he actually _had_ done something. The boy then looked over at the topic of discussion and noticed the redhead was looking a little unwell; she was holding her forehead and she looked a little pale.  
叹了口气，真嗣连朋友的调侃都懒得回应，尽管这次他确实做了一些事情。男孩这才看向了讨论的话题，发现红发的脸色有些不舒服。她捂着额头，脸色有些苍白。

_'She was fine just a few moments ago, is she sick?'_ Shinji thought, thinking back to this morning.  
“她刚才还好好的，是不是生病了？”真嗣想着，回想起今天早上的事。

Apparently, the teacher had noticed as well as he addressed her. "Miss Langley, are you feeling well?" the teacher asked.  
显然，老师也注意到了，也对她说话了。 “兰利小姐，你感觉还好吗？”老师问道。

The redhead in question decided she wouldn't pass up a chance to escape from this mind-numbing session and she wasn't feeling that good anyhow. "Not particularly" Asuka answered, straightening up a bit.  
红发女郎决定不会错过逃离这场令人麻木的会议的机会，而且她感觉无论如何都不太好。 “不是特别，”明日香回答道，稍微挺直了身子。

"Then you may go to the infirmary and choose someone to go with you" the teacher replied.  
“那你可以去医务室，选一个人陪你去。”老师回答道。

"Shinji" was all she said as she stood up slowly.  
她只说了一声“真嗣”，缓缓站了起来。

Shinji stood up as well and walked over to Asuka's desk. The two eva pilots then walked over to the classroom door together and a few people whispering to each other could be heard. Opening the door, the couple exited the room and closed the door behind them. Shinji turned to walk towards the infirmary, however soon realised Asuka was heading in the opposite direction.  
真嗣也站了起来，走到明日香的办公桌前。随后，两名逃亡飞行员一起走到了教室门口，隐约可以听到几个人窃窃私语的声音。打开门，夫妻俩退出了房间，并关上了身后的门。真嗣转身朝医务室走去，但很快就发现明日香正朝相反的方向走去。

"Where are you going Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“明日香你要去哪里？”真嗣问道。

"To the toilet, I don't feel like being nursed" Asuka answered.  
“去厕所，我不想被喂奶。”明日香回答道。

"But, aren't you sick?" Shinji asked, concerned.  
“可是，你不是有病吗？”慎二关切地问道。

"I just feel shitty and I wanted to get out of that class, I'll be fine" Asuka replied.  
“我只是感觉很糟糕，我想离开那堂课，我会没事的”明日香回答道。

Shinji couldn't say he wanted to stay any longer either and didn't really see a point to argue with her now. "Ok, but tell me if you start feeling bad alright?" Shinji requested.  
真嗣也不能说他想再留下来，而且现在也没有必要和她争论。 “好吧，但是告诉我你是否开始感觉不舒服，好吗？”真嗣请求道。

"Yes yes, let's go" Asuka agreed, pulling him towards the female toilets.  
“是是是，我们走吧。”明日香答应道，拉着他朝女厕所走去。

The two teens walked together, hand in hand, down the corridor towards their destination. Upon arriving, Shinji stood outside the door while Asuka went in to freshen up a little. The boy insisted that the door stay slightly open, just in case something happened as no one else had decided to come to the toilet at this time.  
两个少年手牵着手，沿着走廊向着目的地走去。到达后，真嗣站在门外，明日香则进去梳洗一番。男孩坚持把门稍微开着，以防万一发生什么事情，因为此时没有其他人决定去厕所。

All was silent for a moment as Shinji stood there patiently. Suddenly, he heard Asuka running and the sound of a door slamming open. Alarmed, the male eva pilot opened the door and entered the bathroom. He soon heard the sound of retching coming from one of the cubicles and headed over to it. Inside the cubicle, the sight of Asuka hunched over the toilet came into view. The redhead looked a little shocked; she totally had not been expecting it. Wiping her mouth, she stood up unsteadily, supporting herself on the wall; her faced looked even paler than before.  
真嗣耐心地站在那里，一时间鸦雀无声。突然，他听到明日香奔跑的声音和关门的声音。男EVA飞行员惊慌失措，打开门进入浴室。很快他就听到一间隔间里传来干呕的声音，于是他朝那间隔间走去。隔间内，映入眼帘的是明日香弯腰坐在马桶上的样子。红发看起来有些震惊；她完全没想到会这样。她擦了擦嘴，扶着墙摇摇晃晃地站了起来。她的脸色看上去比之前更加苍白。

"Are you ok Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“明日香你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"Stupid question of the year" Asuka replied sarcastically.  
“年度愚蠢问题”明日香讽刺地回答道。

The boy smiled a bit, seeing that she still had enough strength to tease him.  
男孩微微一笑，见她还有力气逗他。

"Well, what's wrong Asuka? You said you were feeling just a _little_ unwell" Shinji asked, worried.  
“嗯，明日香怎么了？你说你只是感觉有点不舒服”真嗣担心地问道。

"I don't know, I was feeling sort of dizzy in class and just now I had the sudden urge to vomit. Gosh I haven't felt this bad for a long time" Asuka answered.  
“我不知道，我在课堂上感觉有点头晕，刚才我突然有种想吐的感觉。天哪，我已经很久没有感觉这么难受了。”明日香回答道。

"Well, you were a little moody today… did you umm… have your period?" Shinji suggested quietly.  
“嗯，你今天有点情绪化……你呃……来月经了吗？”慎二小声提议道。

The girl wasted no time in slapping Shinji, however, in her current state it caused her to fall into the boy and he caught her.  
少女连忙打了真嗣一巴掌，但以她现在的状态，却让她陷入了少年的怀抱中，被少年接住了。

"Are you trying to piss me off you baka? For your information, I still haven't had my period yet and besides if I did, there's no way in hell I'd let you fuck me" Asuka shouted at him angrily.  
“你想惹怒我吗？顺便说一句，我还没有来月经，而且如果来了，我绝对不会让你操我。”明日香愤怒地对他喊道。

"Hmmm, can you think of anything that could be causing this? Did you eat something off?" Shinji questioned.  
“嗯，你能想到是什么原因造成的吗？你是不是吃了什么东西了？”真嗣问道。

"No, I can't think of anything that would make me feel sick" Asuka answered.  
“不，我想不出有什么会让我感到恶心的。”明日香回答道。

"Yeah, besides your German stomach can handle anything, except LCL maybe, every time I swallow that by accident it makes me feel really sick" Shinji replied.  
“是的，除了你的德国胃可以处理任何事情，也许除了拼箱之外，每次我不小心吞下它，我都会感到非常恶心。”真嗣回答道。

Asuka's eyes widened in sudden realisation. "LCL! LCL, you fucking stupid moron! I can't believe you did this to me!" the redhead yelled at him, beating her fists against his chest.  
明日香猛然意识到，睁大了眼睛。 “LCL！LCL，你这个该死的白痴！我不敢相信你竟然这么对我！”红发女郎对他大喊大叫，用拳头敲打他的胸口。

"Calm down Asuka! What are you talking about?" Shinji asked, completely confused.  
「明日香冷静点！你在说什么？」真嗣一脸困惑地问道。

"Fuck! How stupid are you? LCL acts as a contraceptive remember? We stopped piloting the Evangelions two weeks before that night in the apartment!" Asuka shouted in disbelief.  
“操！你有多蠢？拼箱可以起到避孕作用，还记得吗？我们在公寓那天晚上之前两周就停止了新世纪福音战士的驾驶！”明日香不敢置信地大喊。

Only one thought went through Shinji's mind as the news was revealed.  
消息一出，真嗣脑子里只有一个念头。

_'Holy shit' “天啊”_

THE END 结束

Epilogue: 结语：

"You stupid baka! Why are you always so clumsy?" a clearly irritated redheaded woman shouted.  
“你这个笨蛋！你怎么总是这么笨手笨脚的？”一个明显恼怒的红发女人喊道。

The atmosphere inside the house had suddenly become tense. The "baka" in question looked up from his place on the floor, smiling sheepishly.  
屋内的气氛顿时变得紧张起来。那个“baka”从地板上的位置抬起头，不好意思地微笑着。

"Come on Asuka, it's not that bad. I promise I'll clean it up" the brown-haired man replied timidly.  
“来吧明日香，没那么糟糕。我保证我会把它清理干净。”棕发男子胆怯地回答道。

"I couldn't care less about the mess on the floor! You spilt that coffee on me and one of my favourite dresses!" she shouted even louder as if to make sure her point got across.  
“我根本不在乎地板上的乱七八糟！你把咖啡洒到了我和我最喜欢的裙子上！”她喊得更大声，好像是为了确保她的观点得到传达。

Wincing from the pain in his ear, the man got up to confront his wife but was interrupted by another redheaded girl, only this one was a lot younger.  
男人因耳朵疼痛而皱起眉头，站起身来面对妻子，却被另一位红发女孩打断了，只不过这个女孩年纪要小得多。

"Daddy, why does mummy always shout at you and call you baka?" the child asked innocently.  
“爹地，为什么妈咪总是对你大喊大叫，叫你巴卡？”孩子天真地问道。

The man couldn't help chuckling as he gently patted his daughter on the head. Asuka, however, saw this as an opportunity to "educate" her child.  
男人忍不住笑了笑，轻轻拍了拍女儿的头。然而明日香却将此视为“教育”孩子的机会。

"It's because he is one. He is the biggest moron to ever walk this planet" Asuka declared, smirking.  
“因为他就是其中之一。他是这个星球上有史以来最大的白痴”明日香笑着宣称。

The young girl turned around to face her mother, her forehead creased in confusion.  
少女转过身来面对母亲，额头皱起，困惑不已。

"I think daddy's pretty cool and if he's so dumb, why did you marry him?" the curious child asked, holding her father's arm.  
“我觉得爸爸很酷，如果他这么笨，你为什么要嫁给他？”好奇的孩子挽着父亲的手臂问道。

The father thought it was best not to laugh out loud this time, in case he might feel his wife's hand across his cheek; it didn't stop him from grinning however. Though he could see this question had caught Asuka by surprise. Asuka soon recovered and looked down at her child, smiling.  
父亲认为这次最好不要笑出声，以免他感觉到妻子的手抚过他的脸颊。但这并没有阻止他微笑。虽然他看得出来这个问题让明日香感到惊讶。明日香很快回过神来，低头看着自己的孩子，微笑着。

"Beats me. It just seemed like a good idea at the time" she answered, smiling smugly.  
“打败了我。当时这似乎是个好主意，”她回答道，得意地微笑着。

"Asuka!" the father retorted, slightly annoyed.  
“飞鸟！”父亲有些恼怒地反驳道。

"What is it Shinji?" the mother asked innocently.  
“什么是慎二？”母亲天真地问道。

"Don't lie to your daughter" he replied.  
“不要对你的女儿撒谎。”他回答道。

"What are you talking about?" Asuka asked, pretending to be confused.  
“你在说什么？”明日香假装困惑地问道。

Shinji just sighed and let go of his daughter. He went over to the cupboard to take out some materials to clean the coffee that he had spilt on the floor. While Shinji was busy, Asuka bent down so that she was eye-level with her child.  
真嗣只是叹了口气，放开了女儿。他走到柜子前拿出一些材料来清理他洒在地板上的咖啡。当真嗣忙碌的时候，明日香弯下腰，与孩子的视线齐平。

"I'll tell you a secret" Asuka whispered to her daughter.  
“我告诉你一个秘密。”明日香对女儿低声说道。

"K" the child replied, holding her hands behind her back.  
“K”孩子回答道，双手背在身后。

"I married your father because I loved him and because he loved me, it's as simple as that. Don't worry about me calling him baka, it's just my nickname for him. Now go and hug your dad and show him how much you love him" Asuka explained.  
“我嫁给你父亲是因为我爱他，因为他也爱我，就这么简单。别担心我叫他巴卡，这只是我给他起的昵称。现在去拥抱你的父亲，让他看看你有多努力。”爱他”明日香解释道。

"Sure mum!" the child replied happily.  
“当然妈妈！”孩子高兴地回答。

The child eagerly moved over to her father and tugged at his trouser leg. Shinji turned around and looked down at his daughter inquiringly.  
孩子急切地走到父亲身边，拉扯他的裤腿。真嗣转过身来，低头询问地看着女儿。

"What is it Teri?" he asked.  
“泰瑞是什么？”他问。

"I just wanted to tell you that _I_ love you very much" Teri declared proudly, putting her hand on her chest.  
“我只是想告诉你，我非常爱你”泰瑞自豪地宣布，将手放在胸前。

Shinji smiled happily and bent down to hug his daughter warmly, kissing her on the forehead affectionately. The young girl giggled and Shinji let her run off around the house again. The man then turned back around and took out the cleaning utensils he had found. Walking back over to his wife, he placed the equipment on the table and turned to face her.  
真嗣开心地笑了，弯下腰热情地抱住女儿，深情地在她的额头上亲吻了一下。年轻女孩咯咯地笑起来，真嗣又让她在房子里跑了。男子随后转身，拿出了找到的清洁用具。他走回妻子身边，将设备放在桌子上，然后转身面对她。

"So, what did you tell her?" Shinji asked, curious.  
“那你跟她说什么了？”真嗣好奇地问道。

"Nothing" Asuka replied, smirking.  
“没什么。”明日香笑着回答。

"Really?" he said, moving closer to her.  
“真的吗？”他一边说，一边靠近她。

"Really" she replied, poking him in the chest.  
“真的。”她回答道，戳了戳他的胸口。

Shinji closed the distance between them and their lips met. Asuka put her arms around his neck, whilst he held her waist. As the couple deepened their kiss, Shinji's hand slowly began to move up her thigh.  
真嗣拉近了他们之间的距离，他们的嘴唇相遇了。明日香双手搂住他的脖子，他则搂着她的腰。随着两人的吻加深，真嗣的手慢慢地向上移到她的大腿上。

"Ewww mum and dad are kissing again!" a young boy shouted. His hair was brown with streaks of red in it.  
“哇妈妈和爸爸又接吻了！”一个小男孩喊道。他的头发是棕色的，里面夹杂着红色的条纹。

Shinji and Asuka instantly parted, blushing.  
真嗣和明日香立刻红着脸分开。

"For that, you're not getting any dinner Kyou!" Asuka shouted back at her son.  
「这样的话，你就别想吃晚饭了，Kyou！」明日香对儿子喊道。

"But that's so unfair!" Kyou whined.  
“但这太不公平了！”京哀嚎道。

"Maybe it'll teach you to respect your parents" she shot back, smiling arrogantly.  
“也许它会教你尊重你的父母。”她傲慢地笑着反驳道。

Unable to argue with his mother, Kyou walked off grumbling to himself. Shinji looked at his wife, slightly amused.  
京无法与母亲争论，只能自言自语地走开。真嗣看着自己的妻子，有些好笑。

"You don't need to starve our son just for that, besides maybe it was good he stopped us" he remarked, teasing her.  
“你不需要仅仅为了这个而让我们的儿子挨饿，而且也许他阻止了我们也是件好事，”他戏弄她说道。

"Please, as if I would let you do that right out in the open" Asuka refuted, rolling her eyes.  
“拜托，就好像我会让你在公开场合这样做一样。”明日香翻着白眼反驳道。

"You never used to mind where we did it" he replied seductively.  
“你以前从来不介意我们在哪里做的，”他诱人地回答道。

"Yeah, but that was before we had three children" she retorted, pushing him off her.  
“是的，但那是在我们生三个孩子之前。”她反驳道，把他从身上推开。

"Three?" he asked, confused.  
“三？”他困惑地问道。

"Oh yeah I forgot to tell you, you managed to get me pregnant a second time. Can't believe I have to go through it all over again" the redhead remarked, sighing.  
“哦，是的，我忘了告诉你，你成功地让我第二次怀孕了。不敢相信我还要重新经历这一切。”红发女郎叹了口气说道。

"Come on, it's not so bad" he said playfully.  
“得了吧，没那么糟糕。”他开玩笑地说。

"Hah yeah, you're not the one who has to go through the pain of giving birth. It's bad enough that you kept calling me fat you bastard, I even had to push out two on my first pregnancy" she shot back, giving him a glare.  
“哈哈，是的，你不是那个要经历分娩痛苦的人。你一直说我胖，你这个混蛋，这已经够糟糕了，我什至在第一次怀孕时就不得不生下两个孩子。”她反驳道，他瞪了他一眼。

"I didn't mean anything by it Asuka, I was just teasing you" Shinji replied, grinning at her. "So, when did you find out?" he asked.  
“我没有任何意思，明日香，我只是在逗你。”真嗣回答道，对她微笑。 “那么，你什么时候知道的？”他问。

"Just yesterday actually" she answered.  
“实际上就在昨天，”她回答道。

"Are you sure? How did you know?" Shinji inquired.  
“你确定？你怎么知道？”真嗣问道。

"What's with the twenty questions? You don't like talking about this subject" Asuka retorted.  
“二十个问题是怎么回事？你不喜欢谈论这个话题。”明日香反驳道。

"What do you mean?" Shinji replied, confused.  
“你是什么意思？”慎二疑惑地回答道。

"Remember when you came home and saw me breastfeeding Teri and you fainted?" Asuka reminded.  
“还记得当你回到家看到我给泰瑞喂奶时你就晕倒了吗？”明日香提醒道。

"Come off it! I had never seen you do something like that in my life. Can't you just tell me?" Shinji requested, getting annoyed.  
“别说了！我这辈子从来没有见过你做这样的事。你就不能告诉我吗？”真嗣恼怒地问道。

"Look I missed my period and so I took a pregnancy test, wala I knew I was pregnant. Now stop asking stupid questions" Asuka said with finality.  
“看，我错过了月经，所以我做了妊娠测试，我知道我怀孕了。现在别再问愚蠢的问题了。”明日香最后说道。

A silence formed between the two inside the kitchen. Shinji decided to use this time to clean up his mess while Asuka went and changed her clothes, putting her dirty ones in the wash. When the redhead finished, she returned to the kitchen to see her husband putting away the cleaning materials in the cupboard.  
厨房里，两人之间陷入了沉默。真嗣决定利用这段时间收拾烂摊子，而明日香则去换衣服，把脏衣服放进去洗。红发说完，回到厨房，看到丈夫把清洁用品收进了柜子里。

"Do you know what day it is today?" he asked, suddenly serious, turning around to face her.  
“你知道今天是什么日子吗？”他突然严肃地问道，转过身来面对她。

The expression on Asuka's face changed completely as she frowned slightly. She looked up at her husband with a hint of sorrow.  
明日香的脸色彻底变了，眉头微微皱起。她抬头看着自己的丈夫，眼中带着一丝悲伤。

"Yeah, how could I forget. We saved the world today. So, when are we going to visit the graves?" she asked him.  
“是啊，我怎么会忘记呢。今天我们拯救了世界。那么，我们什么时候去扫墓呢？”她问他。

"I was thinking straight after Rei arrives to babysit" Shinji suggested.  
“我在丽来照顾保姆后就开始思考，”真嗣建议道。

"You know, it still amazes me to see how motherly Rei is. Kensuke must be loving it" Asuka remarked, smiling slightly.  
“你知道，我仍然很惊讶丽如此慈母。健介一定很喜欢它。”明日香微笑着说道。

"Mmm" was his response. “嗯”是他的回应。

"Are you going to see your father's grave this year too?" she asked with a little spite.  
“今年你也去看你父亲的坟吗？”她带着一点怨恨地问道。

"Yeah" he answered. “是的”他回答道。

"I still can't understand why. That bastard doesn't deserve to have you visit his grave" she spat.  
“我还是不明白为什么。那个混蛋不值得你去参观他的坟墓。”她骂道。

"Well, he is my father and he did help us get back together after all" Shinji replied.  
“嗯，他是我的父亲，他确实帮助我们复合了。”真嗣回答道。

"What do you mean 'back' together? We never broke up on account of the fact we were never together before you faked your death and we've been together since" Asuka said, perplexed.  
“‘重新’在一起是什么意思？我们从来没有分手，因为在你假死之前我们从未在一起过，而且从那以后我们就在一起了。”明日香困惑地说。

"Sorry I meant he helped us get together" he corrected himself, a little too quickly.  
“抱歉，我的意思是他帮助我们聚到了一起。”他纠正道，语气有点太快了。

Asuka looked at the man suspiciously, after being his wife for all these years she could now tell when he was lying; his master ability had been beaten by her. As such, the redhead could tell he was hiding something.  
明日香狐疑地看着这个男人，做了这么多年的妻子，她现在能看出他什么时候在撒谎；他的宗师能力，已经被她打败了。因此，红发看出他在隐瞒什么。

"Cut the bullshit Ikari, you tell me right now what you meant by that statement" she demanded threateningly.  
“别废话碇了，你现在就告诉我你这句话的意思。”她威胁地要求道。

"What do you mean?" he asked timidly; his heartbeat increasing.  
“你是什么意思？”他胆怯地问道；他的心跳加快。

"Don't 'what do you mean' me, you know precisely what I mean. I can't believe that you still had a secret that you 'forgot' to tell me. It's not nice to keep information from someone just because they can't remember it, especially if it's your wife!" Asuka snapped heatedly.  
“别对我说‘你什么意思’，你知道我的意思。我不敢相信你还有一个‘忘记’告诉我的秘密。仅仅因为某人隐瞒信息是不好的。”我不记得了，尤其是你的妻子！”明日香怒气冲冲地说道。

Shinji really didn't have a way out of this one, he had to say something. Racking his brain, the man could think of nothing; karma had caught up to him at last.  
真嗣实在没有办法了，他必须说点什么。那人绞尽脑汁，却想不出什么来。业力终于追上了他。

"Errr, I need to go to the toilet" he lied, trying his best to sound sincere.  
“呃，我要去趟厕所。”他撒谎，尽量让自己听起来很真诚。

Asuka saw straight through it but decided she would let him anyway.  
明日香看穿了这一点，但还是决定让他这么做。

"Alright, but once you finish, you're telling me what happened" she demanded.  
“好吧，但是一旦你完成了，你就告诉我发生了什么，”她要求道。

"Ok ok" he agreed as he began walking off to the bathroom door.  
“好吧，好吧”他同意了，然后开始向浴室门口走去。

His "lovely" wife followed him on his journey to the toilet, well more like temporary escape from Asuka's wrath. Upon arriving at the bathroom, Shinji opened the door and entered inside, closing the door behind him. He looked about frantically, wondering what the hell he was going to do. He momentarily considered climbing out the window, but then realised it was far too small for him to fit through. He sat down on the toilet and smiled weakly to himself.  
他“可爱”的妻子跟着他去厕所，更像是暂时逃避明日香的愤怒。到达浴室后，真嗣打开门走了进去，并在身后关上了门。他疯狂地环顾四周，想知道他到底要做什么。他一度考虑从窗户爬出去，但随后意识到窗户太小了，他无法爬进去。他坐在马桶上，自顾自虚弱地笑了笑。

_'How do I get out of this one?'_ he thought.  
“我怎样才能摆脱这个困境呢？”他以为。

End Notes: And there you go. I wonder what'll happen to Shinji ^^. So there's the end to Shinji and Asuka (at least the original one). For all those who are curious 'Liebling' just means 'darling' in German. I wonder who worked out that Asuka was pregnant before the toilet scene? Kudos to you if you did, I did leave hints everywhere. What did you guys think of Unit 01's activation hehe?  
尾注：就这样。我想知道真嗣会发生什么^^。所以真嗣和明日香就结束了（至少是原来的）。对于所有好奇的人来说，“Liebling”在德语中的意思就是“亲爱的”。不知道谁在上厕所那场戏之前就发现明日香怀孕了呢？如果你这样做了，我真的很感激你，我确实到处都留下了提示。你们对于01号部队的激活有什么看法呢呵呵？

At this current moment I have _finally_ finished (after all this time) rewriting the chapters. Next, I'm gonna post a new chapter after this with another epilogue (if anyone is still interested) + my notes/thoughts on this story and similar (my estimate is that it'll be finished by the end of March 2021).  
此时此刻，我终于完成了（经过这么长时间的）章节的重写。接下来，我将在这之后发布一个新的章节，并附上另一个尾声（如果有人仍然感兴趣的话）+我对这个故事和类似故事的笔记/想法（我的估计是它会在 2021 年 3 月底完成）。

Note that the name Teri comes from a story called 'Child of Love' written by Axel Terizaki, who was the one who first inspired me to read eva fics and so it's a tribute to him.  
请注意，Teri 这个名字来自 Axel Terizaki 写的一个名为“爱之子”的故事，他是第一个激励我阅读 eva 小说的人，所以这是对他的致敬。

I previously had some notes which I think were a bit too demanding to readers asking them to leave reviews. While I like honest feedback (good or bad), I shouldn't have been so pushy and so I apologise. At the end of the day what I want the most is for you to have enjoyed reading the story. This is my first Evangelion story, so if you feel like it, I'd like to know how I did, how good or bad the end was, anything you can think of about this story. That's all from Deadlypole!  
我之前有一些笔记，我认为对于要求他们留下评论的读者来说有点太苛刻了。虽然我喜欢诚实的反馈（无论好坏），但我不应该如此咄咄逼人，所以我道歉。归根结底，我最希望的是你能享受阅读这个故事的乐趣。这是我的第一个新世纪福音战士故事，所以如果你愿意的话，我想知道我是怎么做的，结局是好还是坏，以及你对这个故事的任何想法。这就是《致命极》的全部内容！

An extra note: I originally had a note about a sequel being written by a fan and friend titled 'Evangelion – The Armageddon Prophecy,' however this story was cancelled a long time ago now. I believe I read a few chapters of it, but it was never published as far as I recall. In any case, there's no need to keep the old note saying it's going to be written, because it is not.  
额外说明：我最初有一个关于由粉丝和朋友撰写的续集的说明，标题为“新世纪福音战士 - 世界末日预言”，但是这个故事很久以前就被取消了。我相信我读过其中的几章，但据我记忆，它从未出版过。无论如何，没有必要保留旧的纸条，说它会被写下来，因为它没有。

It's finally here! About a year late; sorry about that, just life keeping me busy. Without further ado, the epilogue is below, followed by Story Notes about the chapters and lastly some self-reflection on the making of "Shinji and Asuka".  
终于来了！大约晚了一年；抱歉，生活让我很忙。话不多说，下面是尾声，接下来是各章节的故事笔记，最后是对《真嗣与明日香》制作过程的一些自我反思。

### Final Epilogue: 

There sometimes comes a moment in one's life where they know their world is about to be turned upside down. Today was that day for a certain individual and not only that, but it was also the anniversary of the day the eva pilots of NERV saved the world in the final battle after the angels were defeated. Of particular importance were the events currently going on in the residence of a certain two former eva pilots; Shinji and Asuka. Several years after they had gotten back together, the former pilot of Unit 02 had caught onto a slipup from her dear husband. Said husband was currently taking a temporary reprieve in the bathroom, one that wasn't going to last much longer.  
人的一生中有时会出现这样的时刻，他们知道自己的世界即将发生翻天覆地的变化。今天是某个人的日子，不仅如此，也是NERV的eva飞行员在击败天使后在最后的战斗中拯救世界的纪念日。特别重要的是，目前在两名前 eva 飞行员的住所中发生的事件；真嗣和明日香。他们重归于好几年后，这位前 02 机组飞行员发现了她亲爱的丈夫的失误。这名丈夫目前正在浴室里暂时休息，这种情况不会持续太久。

'_How do I get out of this one?'_ the man thought.  
“我怎样才能摆脱这个困境呢？”男人想。

"Don't even think about staying in there the whole day" a voice said through the door; it belonged to Asuka.  
“别想整天待在那里。”门外传来一个声音。它属于明日香。

"Of course not!" Shinji replied, before sighing.  
“当然不是！”真嗣回答道，然后叹了口气。

The anxious man realised there was no avoiding the confrontation this time, he had no other option; he had to tell… the truth. _'Well, it's my own fault that it has come to this. I should have confessed everything to her ages ago… why am I still such a coward sometimes?'_ he thought. Feeling knots twist in his stomach, Shinji tried to calm himself as he slowly came to the realisation of what was about to happen. _'This is going to be… messy, I'll need to call Misato over'_  
心急如焚的男子意识到，这一次的对峙已经无法避免了，他没有别的选择，只能这样了。他必须说出……真相。 ‘好吧，都是我自己的错才造成这样的结果。我早该向她坦白一切的……为什么我有时还是那么胆小？他以为。真嗣感到胃里一阵绞痛，他努力让自己平静下来，慢慢意识到即将发生的事情。 “这会……很混乱，我需要把美里叫过来”

Taking in a deep breath, the former male eva pilot stood up and flushed the toilet before washing his hands at the sink. He looked up at himself in the mirror, his older self having features quite similar to his father Gendo. Shinji couldn't help his apprehension of what was to come and looked at himself sadly as he recalled the horrid past he had perpetrated. The man shook himself from his daze as he knew this wasn't something he should have put off; this was something Asuka needed to know, no matter how painful. Reaching into his pocket, he took out his phone and called his former guardian. He heard the dial ring a few moments before the call connected.  
深吸了一口气，这位前逃亡男飞行员站了起来，冲了马桶，然后在洗手池前洗手。他抬头看着镜子里的自己，年长的自己与父亲源堂的容貌非常相似。真嗣无法抑制对即将发生的事情的担忧，当他回想起自己所犯下的可怕过去时，他悲伤地看着自己。男人从茫然中挣脱出来，因​​为他知道这不是他应该推迟的事情；这是明日香需要知道的事情，无论多么痛苦。他把手伸进口袋，掏出手机，给他以前的监护人打了电话。在电话接通前几分钟，他听到拨号铃声。

"Hey Shinji! What's up? Unusual of you to be calling me today at this time" Misato answered.  
“嘿真嗣！怎么了？你今天这个时候给我打电话真不寻常”美里回答道。

"Hey Misato! Look…" he paused, unsure of how to tell her. "I… I'll just get straight to the point. I'm gonna confess 'everything' to Asuka today" he announced.  
“嘿美里！看……”他停了下来，不知道如何告诉她。 “我……我就开门见山。今天我要向明日香坦白‘一切’”他宣布。

There was a long silence on the other side of the phone as the former Major understood the implication of his statement.  
电话那头沉默了很长时间，这位前少校明白了他这句话的含义。

"Wait… today of all days? I mean, I think this is _long_ overdue so I'm glad you decided to do this, but why now?" Misato eventually asked.  
“等等……今天是所有日子中的今天？我的意思是，我认为这早就该发生了，所以我很高兴你决定这样做，但为什么是现在呢？”美里最终问道。

"Well to be honest, it's been forced on me. I slipped up and mentioned something about the past and Asuka quickly caught on that something was off" Shinji answered.  
“好吧，说实话，这是强加给我的。我不小心提到了一些过去的事情，明日香很快就意识到有些不对劲。”真嗣回答道。

"She always was a sharp girl" Misato replied, chuckling. "How lame of you Shinji, not only slipping up, but you're finally going to confess what happened in the past because of an accident. What's done is done, I assume you're not calling me just to announce this"  
“她一直是个聪明的女孩”美里笑着回答道。 “真嗣你真是太蹩脚了，不仅失言了，还因为一次意外，你终于要承认过去发生的事情了。事情已经过去了，我想你打电话给我不是为了宣布这件事”

"I think it's best if you come over, if only to give me moral support and… keep Asuka calm" the man clarified.  
“我认为你过来是最好的，哪怕只是给我道义上的支持，并且……让明日香保持冷静。”那人澄清道。

"I see" Misato replied, "Alright I'll come over, what about your kids?" she asked.  
“我明白了，”美里回答道，“好吧，我就过去，你的孩子们呢？”她问。

"Rei should be coming soon to babysit them" he answered.  
“丽应该很快就会来照顾他们。”他回答道。

"Ok then, see you soon and… good luck" Misato finished off.  
“好吧，那么，一会儿见，祝你好运”美里结束了。

"I'll need it, see ya Misato and thanks" he replied before hanging up.  
“我需要它，再见，美里，谢谢”他在挂断电话之前回答道。

The former eva pilot took a deep breath as he pocketed his phone and went to exit the bathroom. As he opened the door and went to walk out, a hand shot across in front him to stop him. _'Heh, some things never change'_ Shinji thought as he recalled a similar situation in the past.  
这位前EVA飞行员深吸了一口气，将手机装进口袋，然后走出了卫生间。正当他打开门准备往外走的时候，一只手突然挡在了他的面前，拦住了他。 “呵呵，有些事情是永远不会改变的。”真嗣想起过去类似的情况，心里这样想。

"Hello 'darling.' Now that you're finished with your business _and_ your phone call, we can continue our discussion" Asuka declared. "Who did you call anyway?"  
“你好，亲爱的。”现在你的事情和电话都处理完了，我们可以继续讨论了。”明日香说道。 “你到底给谁打电话了？”

"Hey honey! I called Misato, she'll be coming over soon" he answered, trying to seem calm before he started the serious conversation.  
“嘿，亲爱的！我给美里打了电话，她很快就会过来。”他回答道，在开始严肃的谈话之前努力让自己显得平静。

"Oh? That's surprising, what business does our former guardian have with us? Is it to do with what you're going to tell me?" she asked.  
“哦？真是奇怪了，我们以前的监护人和我们有什么关系？和你要告诉我的事情有关吗？”她问。

"Sort of… but before that. Do you know when Rei is arriving?" he replied.  
“有点……但在那之前。你知道丽什么时候来吗？”他回答。

"Her estimated time was about 10 minutes from now? Either way, stop delaying already!" the redhead snapped.  
“她预计的时间还有十分钟左右？不管怎样，别再拖延了！”红发女郎厉声说道。

"No well, it's relevant. This isn't going to be a… quick discussion nor an… easy one" Shinji said, his tone suddenly more serious.  
“不，这很重要。这不会是一场……快速的讨论，也不会是……轻松的讨论。”真嗣说道，他的语气突然变得更加严肃。

His wife looked at him with surprise, not expecting to have touched onto a topic that was complicated. "Wait a second… is this actually a big deal? Is there something serious I had forgotten way back when?"  
妻子惊讶地看着他，没想到话题这么复杂。 “等一下……这真的是一件大事吗？是不是有什么严重的事情我忘记了？”

"To put it simply; yes. Don't misunderstand though, you know most of what happened in the period you lost your memory either through your own recovery or from what you've been told. However… there are things that I omitted or gave an alternate version of. I'm not talking about trivial inconsequential things, I mean… I have intentionally deceived you with some information" he admitted.  
“简单来说，是的。不过别误会，你失去记忆期间发生的大部分事情，你都知道，要么是你自己恢复的，要么是从别人告诉你的。不过……有些事情我遗漏了或者给出了另一个版本。我不是在谈论琐碎的无关紧要的事情，我的意思是……我故意用一些信息欺骗了你”他承认。

Asuka looked at her husband with an angry look; while she appreciated his honesty, admitting this now, after being married for some time _and_ having kids was not acceptable.  
明日香用愤怒的眼神看着她的丈夫。虽然她很欣赏他的诚实，但在结婚一段时间并生孩子之后，她现在承认了这一点。

"So after all this time, I was FUCKING RIGHT! You fuckers were deceiving me, how dare you talk calmly about this!" she snapped, her words laced with venom. She took care not to raise her volume too loudly in case the kids caught on that they were having a fight, but she struggled to control herself.  
“这么久了，我他妈的就是对的！你们这些混蛋都在欺骗我，你们竟然敢平静地谈论这件事！”她厉声说道，言语中充满了恶毒。她小心翼翼地不要把音量调得太大，以免孩子们发现他们在打架，但她努力控制自己。

Shinji took a deep breath. "You have every right to be angry, but trust me… this isn't as simple as you think"  
慎二深吸了一口气。 “你完全有权利生气，但相信我……这并不像你想象的那么简单”

"Don't give me anymore bullshit Ikari!" she refuted. "Just _when_ were you going to tell me, you dickhead?! We're only having this discussion now because you slipped up, you FUCK"  
“碇别再跟我废话了！”她反驳道。 “你到底要什么时候告诉我，你这个白痴？！我们现在才开始讨论，因为你犯了错误，你操！”

The redhead was livid, feeling something akin to betrayal; after they had shared so much together, she just couldn't conceive how Shinji could have kept something like this from her.  
红发脸色铁青，有种被背叛的感觉。在他们一起分享了这么多之后，她简直无法想象真嗣怎么能对她隐瞒这样的事情。

"I had planned to tell you long ago honestly but… I just could never find the right time. You know me Asuka… I am afraid of these sorts of confrontations, not that it's a good enough excuse. Anyway, nothing I say will justify it so I won't bother. But know this, I did have the intention of revealing this to you and this is _not_ a simple thing to disclose" he explained.  
“我早就打算诚实地告诉你了，但是……我只是找不到合适的时间。你了解我，明日香……我害怕这种对抗，但这并不是一个足够好的借口。无论如何，我说什么都不能证明是合理的。”所以我不会打扰，但要知道，我确实有意向你透露这一点，但这不是一件容易透露的事情。”他解释道。

At his words the redhead calmed slightly, appreciating his sincerity. "Fine you prick, you don't sound like you're lying. Even still, this hurts Shinji. I thought you loved me, we've gone through so much shit, we got married, we've raised children; it's incomprehensible to me" she replied, her voice sounding dejected.  
听到他的话，红发稍稍平静下来，欣赏他的诚意。 “好吧，你这个混蛋，你听起来不像是在撒谎。即便如此，这还是伤害了真嗣。我以为你爱我，我们经历了那么多狗屎，我们结婚了，我们养育了孩子；这令人无法理解对我来说。”她回答道，声音听起来很沮丧。

"And all of that is real and something I would never change. And yes, it makes sense you find it incomprehensible and that's because what happened… what I _did_, was incomprehensible" he elaborated.  
“所有这些都是真实的，我永远不会改变。是的，你发现它不可理解是有道理的，那是因为发生的事情......我所做的，是不可理解的，”他解释道。

Asuka sighed at his words. "What the hell did you do that you're acting like this and you had to keep it a secret?"  
阿斯卡听了他的话叹了口气。 “你到底做了什么事情，竟然变成这样，还必须保密？”

Her husband moved over to her, bringing his hand up to caress her cheek. "Something unforgiveable" he answered. "Let's wait till Rei & Misato arrive before we continue this discussion. Don't worry, I won't run away"  
她的丈夫走到她身边，伸出手抚摸她的脸颊。 “一些不可原谅的事情”他回答道。 「等丽和美里到来后再继续讨论吧。放心，我不会逃跑的。」

Asuka could see Shinji was trembling; whatever this past event was, caused him great distress. Even though she felt angry and hurt, Asuka could see that this was a demon of the past of sorts; she knew exactly what those were like. Wanting to encourage her husband, she grabbed his hand and pulled his face down towards hers and kissed him gently.  
明日香看到真嗣在颤抖。无论过去发生的事情是什么，都给他带来了巨大的痛苦。尽管明日香感到愤怒和受伤，但她还是看出这是过去的恶魔；她清楚地知道那些是什么样的。为了鼓励丈夫，她抓住他的手，把他的脸拉向自己，轻轻地吻了他。

"I appreciate it" Asuka replied after parting, "I am still pissed off at you but, nothing is gained by making it more difficult for you to reveal this past incident"  
“我很感激，”明日香在分手后回答道，“我仍然生你的气，但是，让你更难揭露过去的事情并没有什么好处。”

Shinji couldn't help tearing up a little at her understanding and a pang of guilt ripped through him. He embraced his wife tenderly; he loved this woman so much. The redhead pushed her husband away after a short time, looking at him with a mixture of sadness and anger.  
真嗣因她的理解而忍不住流下了眼泪，一股愧疚感席卷了他的全身。他温柔地拥抱了他的妻子；他非常爱这个女人。过了一会儿，红发将丈夫推开，看着他的眼神里充满了悲伤和愤怒。

"Enough of that. I hate this feeling… the sooner we discuss things, the better" Asuka remarked, leaning against the wall. It was good that the kids were distracted with whatever they were doing, she didn't want them to see them like this.  
“够了。我讨厌这种感觉……我们越早讨论事情越好”明日香靠在墙上说道。孩子们无论做什么都分心，这很好，她不想让他们看到他们这个样子。

After what seemed like an eternity of silence but was only a few minutes, the doorbell rang.  
看似永恒的沉默，但仅仅几分钟后，门铃响了。

"I'll get it" Shinji offered, breaking the uncomfortable silence.  
“我去拿。”真嗣说道，打破了令人不安的沉默。

"Better you do" his wife confirmed.  
“你最好这样做”，他的妻子证实道。

With that, the man walked towards the front door to greet their guest. Shinji opened the door to reveal his "sister" Rei, smiling at him happily.  
说完，男子便走到门口去迎接客人。真嗣打开门，露出了他的“妹妹”丽，幸福地对他微笑。

"Hello Shinji!" the blue haired woman greeted; it still seemed a bit odd when Rei showed some expression, things really had changed in these past years.  
“真嗣你好！”蓝发女子打招呼。雷伊表情有些奇怪，这些年确实发生了变化。

"Hi Rei! Come on in. How are you?" he replied, trying not to betray the anxiety he felt.  
“嗨，Rei！进来吧。你好吗？”他回答道，尽量不流露出他内心的焦虑。

Rei entered their residence, soon to be assaulted by the smaller Ikaris. "Auntie Rei!" they screamed in excitement; it seems they had heard the front door open. The blue haired woman knelt down to give the kids a hug as she smiled warmly.  
丽进入了他们的住所，很快就遭到了较小的伊卡里斯的袭击。 “雷阿姨！”他们兴奋地尖叫；他们似乎听到前门打开的声音。蓝发女子跪下拥抱孩子们，笑容温暖。

"Hi Teri, Kyou. How are you two doing?" she asked.  
“嗨，Teri，Kyou。你们两个怎么样？”她问。

"Great!" the kids replied enthusiastically, "I wanna show you something we built" Teri added quickly.  
“伟大的！”孩子们热情地回答道：“我想向你们展示我们建造的东西。”泰瑞很快补充道。

"One moment kids, I want to talk to Auntie for a bit" Shinji interjected.  
“等一下，孩子们，我想和阿姨谈谈。”真嗣插话道。

"Nawww, ok" they replied obediently and moved off.  
“不，好的。”他们顺从地回答，然后就离开了。

"Listen Rei, I'll get straight to the point. It's about Asuka, I'm about to reveal what I did to her a long time ago," Shinji declared. "You remember that discussion we had after the fight with the… last angel?"  
“听着丽，我要开门见山了。这是关于明日香的事情，我要透露很久以前我对她做了什么，”真嗣宣布。 “你还记得我们在与……最后一位天使战斗后的讨论吗？”

At once, his sister's face looked downcast. "Yes… I remember Shinji. I do not understand why you haven't told her yet. Also, why have you chosen to do this today?" she asked.  
顿时，妹妹的脸色就阴沉了下来。 “是的……我记得真嗣。我不明白你为什么还没有告诉她。还有，你为什么选择今天这样做？”她问。

"I slipped up. I have no choice now, but it's about time anyway. I'd appreciate if you take the kids from here, it's not a good idea to have them here as the situation is quite delicate. Misato will come here soon as well" he answered.  
“我失误了。我现在别无选择，但无论如何也该是时候了。如果你能把孩子们从这里带走的话，我会很感激的，把他们留在这里并不是一个好主意，因为情况很微妙。美里很快就会来这里。” ”他回答道。

"I understand Shinji… good luck" she replied.  
“我理解真嗣……祝你好运”她回答道。

"Alright Teri, Kyou! Listen up!" Shinji announced loudly.  
“好吧，泰瑞，恭！听着！”慎二大声宣布。

Two pairs of feet could be heard bounding back towards Shinji and Rei. "Coming!" the two young voices called out.  
可以听到两双脚向真嗣和丽的方向跳跃。 “未来！”两个年轻的声音叫道。

"Auntie Rei is going to take you out now, don't cause her any trouble ok?" Shinji directed.  
“雷阿姨要带你出去，别给她添麻烦好不好？”慎二执导。

"Ok!" they both agreed. “好的！”他们都同意了。

"Say bye to mummy before you go" Shinji reminded.  
“走之前先跟妈妈说再见。”真嗣提醒道。

The two kids ran off to find their mother, shouting "Mum!" as they went.  
两个孩子跑去找妈妈，喊着“妈妈！”他们走了。

"Thank you so much Rei, I really appreciate it" the man thanked.  
“非常感谢Rei，我真的很感激。”男人道谢。

"It is no problem" Rei replied, "I wish I could do more to help you, but perhaps it is better this way. I am reminded of the day you left my place to confront Asuka before she accepted your love. I am certain that you'll get through this trial, your wife really loves you"  
“没问题，”丽回答道，“我希望我能做更多的事情来帮助你，但也许这样更好。我想起了那天，在明日香接受你的爱之前，你离开我的住所去面对她。我确信你一定能度过这次考验，你的妻子真的很爱你”

Shinji hugged the blue haired woman in response; he really didn't deserve the love he had from everyone.  
真嗣拥抱了蓝发女子作为回应。他真的不值得所有人的爱。

"Excuse me Rei" another woman greeted.  
“对不起，丽”另一个女人打招呼。

The two adults turned around to see the redhead in question with her two children in tow.  
两个大人转过头，看到了那个红头发的女人，还带着她的两个孩子。

"I heard from Teri and Kyou that you're taking them out, is this at my idiot husband's request?" Asuka asked, a little anger seeping out.  
“我听泰莉和恭说，你们要带他们出去，是我那个白痴丈夫要求的吗？”明日香问道，脸上流露出一丝愤怒。

"Yes, I thought-" Shinji started.  
“是的，我想——”真嗣开口说道。

"Did I ask you?" the redhead interrupted abruptly.  
“我问过你了吗？”红发突然打断道。

"Yes Asuka, I was happy to take your kids out to have fun… Shinji informed me of the current situation" Rei answered.  
“是的，明日香，我很高兴带你的孩子出去玩……真嗣告诉我目前的情况。”丽回答道。

"Is that so? Should I be leaving my kids with a fellow accomplice?" Asuka questioned threateningly.  
“是这样吗？我应该把孩子留给同伙吗？”明日香威胁地问道。

"Asuka!" Shinji said firmly, catching his wife by surprise. "Rei had nothing to do with this, she barely even knows what happened"  
“飞鸟！”真嗣坚定地说道，让妻子吃了一惊。 “丽与这件事无关，她几乎不知道发生了什么”

The two kids looked up at the adults, wide eyed, not ever seeing such an interaction between them. The redhead sighed. "Sorry Rei… I shouldn't take this out on you, I just can't keep calm. I'm also pregnant, which doesn't help"  
两个孩子睁大眼睛抬头看着大人，从来没有见过他们之间有这样的互动。红发叹了口气。 “对不起，丽……我不应该把这个出气在你身上，我只是无法保持冷静。我也怀孕了，这无济于事”

"Congratulations" Rei replied a little timidly, the blue haired girl had forgotten how intimidating Asuka could be.  
“恭喜你了。”丽有些胆怯地回答道，蓝发少女已经忘记了明日香有多么可怕。

At that point, the doorbell rang again, interrupting the awkward moment.  
就在这时，门铃再次响起，打破了这尴尬的时刻。

"I'll get it" Shinji said quickly, moving over to the front door and opening it.  
“我去拿。”真嗣很快说道，走到前门并打开了门。

"Hi Shinji! I hope I didn't take too long" the former Major greeted.  
“嗨，真嗣！我希望我没有花太长时间”这位前少校打招呼。

"Not at all, thanks for listening to my selfish request" he replied.  
“一点也不，谢谢你听我自私的请求。”他回答道。

"Nanna Misato!" Teri and Kyou shouted, running up to her.  
“南奈美里！”泰瑞和奎大喊着，跑向她。

"Hey! Didn't I tell you two not to call me 'nanna'," Misato shot back at the kids.  
“嘿！我不是告诉过你们两个不要叫我‘奶奶’吗？”美里回击孩子们。

"Are you worried it makes you sound old?" the redheaded woman asked as she walked forward to greet her former guardian. "You were our guardian, so you kind of are their nanna" she teased.  
“你担心这会让你听起来老吗？”红发女子一边问道，一边上前迎接自己曾经的监护人。 “你是我们的监护人，所以你有点像他们的奶奶”她开玩笑道。

"Asuka…" Misato started, unsure of the redhead's state of mind. "How are you doing?" she asked.  
“明日香……”美里开口说道，不确定红发的心情。 “你好吗？”她问。

"Not great at all actually, but that's why you're here right? I… was going to say I didn't mean to rush or sound pissy, but I actually do. But let's not continue this conversation until Rei takes the kids out" Asuka answered.  
“其实一点都不好，但这就是你来这里的原因，对吧？我……本来想说我不是故意着急或者听起来很生气，但我确实是这么做的。但是在丽带孩子们出去之前我们不要继续这个谈话。” ”明日香回答道。

Misato's face turned a little grim; this wasn't the way she wanted to reveal the information to Asuka, but she had to let Shinji be the one to start the process. The older woman sighed before walking inside, leaving the door open. "Ok Asuka, that's fine. You are totally justified with your behaviour"  
美里的脸色变得有些凝重。这不是她想要向明日香透露信息的方式，但她必须让真嗣开始这一过程。老妇人叹了口气，走进去，没有关门。 “好吧，明日香，没关系。你的行为完全有道理”

Rei took the hint, not wanting to subject her niece and nephew any further to this gloomy atmosphere. "Ok Teri and Kyou, we're going to leave now" Rei piped up.  
丽明白了这一点，不想让侄女和侄子再陷入这种阴郁的气氛中。 “好的，Teri 和 Kyou，我们现在就出发。”Rei 说道。

"But we want to play with Nanna too!" Teri declared.  
“但是我们也想和外婆一起玩！”泰瑞宣称。

"Yeah! Why can't we play with Nanna too?" Kyou added.  
“是啊！为什么我们不能和外婆一起玩呢？”京补充道。

"Kids" Shinji started firmly. "You are going with Auntie Rei and Nanna is staying here. Understand?"  
“孩子们”真嗣坚定地开口说道。 “你和雷阿姨一起去，外婆留在这里，明白吗？”

"Okay" they both accepted begrudgingly.  
“好吧”两人都勉强答应了。

"Thank you" Shinji replied, "Remember, behave with Auntie Rei. Good bye Teri, Kyou" he finished.  
“谢谢你”真嗣回答道，“记住，对丽阿姨好一点。再见，泰瑞，恭”他说完。

"Good bye daddy! Good bye Mummy! Good bye Nanna!" they both chorused out in unison.  
“再见爸爸！再见妈妈！再见南娜！”两人异口同声。

"Bye Teri, bye Kyou" Asuka responded.  
“再见Teri，再见Kyou”明日香回应道。

"Bye bye kids!" Misato finished off.  
“再见了，孩子们！”美里结束了。

At this, Rei led the kids out of the residence and closed the door behind her, leaving the room in total silence as the remaining adults contemplated the current situation.  
说到这里，丽带着孩子们走出了住所，关上了门，房间里一片寂静，剩下的大人们思考着当前的情况。

"Before you begin you two _fuckheads_" Asuka started.  
“在开始之前，你们两个混蛋”明日香开始说道。

Misato couldn't help grimacing; the redhead was far angrier than she thought.  
美里忍不住做了个鬼脸。红发女郎比她想象​​的要愤怒得多。

"I'm gonna get myself some water, oh and by the way Misato, I'm pregnant" the redhead finished, turning around to walk to the kitchen.  
“我去给自己倒点水，哦，对了，美里，我怀孕了。”红发说完，转身向厨房走去。

"Asuka, I can do that-" Shinji started.  
“明日香，我能做到——”真嗣开始说道。

"You two go sit down at the table and make yourselves comfortable!" Asuka snapped. "I'll bring everyone water"  
“你们两个到桌边坐下来吧！”明日香厉声说道。 “我给大家送水”

"Congratulations" Misato let out loudly so that Asuka could hear.  
“恭喜你。”美里大声喊道，让明日香能够听到。

"Thanks" the redhead muttered in response before disappearing into the kitchen.  
“谢谢”红发小声回应道，然后消失在厨房里。

After a moment, Misato spoke up. "You decided to do this when she was pregnant?" she asked incredulously.  
过了一会儿，美里开口了。 “你是在她怀孕的时候就决定这么做的？”她难以置信地问道。

"I didn't 'decide' to do this today remember?" Shinji refuted, "But anyway, it's not like there's ever a good time for this. Let's just sit down and mentally prepare ourselves. Don't worry, I'll do most of the explaining since I was the one who deceived her the most"  
“我今天没有‘决定’这样做，还记得吗？”真嗣反驳道：“不过，现在也不是最好的时机，我们先坐下来做好心理准备吧。你放心，大部分的解释都是我来完成的，因为我才是欺骗她最多的人。” ”

"Ok… sounds like a plan" Misato agreed.  
“好吧……听起来像是一个计划”美里同意了。

The two adults moved over and sat at the dining table, not the same one from the Katsuragi household where so many discussions and various other activities had occurred, no, this was one that the married Ikari couple had got for themselves at their new residence. Since then, many new memories had been associated with this new table, including a few naughty ones. Shinji reminisced as he recalled the many dinners and conversations he shared with his family, or Misato, Kaji, Rei, Kensuke, Touji, Hikari whenever they came over. He had shared so many experiences with his family and friends over the years; it was a life he never imagined he would ever attain. Reflecting on this only made the guilt hit harder, why hadn't he told her the truth after all this time?  
两个大人走过去，坐在了餐桌旁，这不是葛城家那张议论纷纷、各种活动不断的桌子，不，这是碇夫妇在新住处为自己准备的一张。从那时起，许多新的记忆就与这张新桌子联系在一起，其中包括一些顽皮的记忆。真嗣回忆起与家人或美里、梶、丽、健介、东次、光每次过来时一起吃饭和交谈的情景。多年来，他与家人和朋友分享了很多经历；这是他从未想象过的生活。想到这里，愧疚感更重了，为什么这么久了还不告诉她真相？

His thoughts then went all the way back to when they first realised Asuka was pregnant by accident. _'Ah yes LCL, I even lied about why we needed its contraceptive properties'_ he thought. He smiled, remembering the time his friends came over and teased Asuka when she could no longer hide that she was pregnant; it was no secret what they had been doing after that. Their friends' teasing was the least of their worries when Asuka finally gave birth and they had Teri and Kyou to look after. The panic as they struggled to figure out how to be parents, the many _many_ sleepless nights and the never-ending cleaning. It didn't help that Misato was utterly useless for the most part, they had basically taught their former guardian how to babysit.  
他的思绪又回到了他们第一次意识到明日香意外怀孕的时候。 “啊，是的，拼箱，我什至在为什么我们需要它的避孕特性方面撒了谎，”他想。他微笑着，想起有一次，当明日香无法再隐瞒自己怀孕的事实时，他的朋友们过来取笑她；他们在那之后所做的事情已经不是什么秘密了。当明日香终于生下孩子并且他们还有泰瑞和恭需要照顾时，朋友们的嘲笑是他们最不担心的。当他们努力弄清楚如何成为父母时感到恐慌，无数个不眠之夜和永无休止的清洁工作。美里在很大程度上毫无用处，这并没有什么帮助，他们基本上已经教会了他们的前监护人如何照顾孩子。

Everything that occurred from then was a blur, their marriage, Kensuke and Rei, raising the kids, moving out, their new work. There were also some rare more charitable moments from Asuka; he recalled once she made him chocolate muffins for his birthday as a surprise. In another life, maybe she would have thrown them on the ground, tipped over a pot of broth, assaulted him violently… the whole shebang. But no, if anyone was a villain at this point it would be him.  
从那时起发生的一切都变得模糊，他们的婚姻、健介和丽、抚养孩子、搬出去、他们的新工作。明日香也有一些罕见的慈善时刻。他记得有一次她给他做了巧克力松饼作为生日礼物，给他一个惊喜。在另一世，也许她会把它们扔在地上，打翻一锅肉汤，猛烈地攻击他……整个行为。但不，如果此时有谁是恶棍的话，那就是他了。

Shinji mused that in some ways he was always occupied with daily activities and too tired to bring up the past with Asuka and as time passed the event became more and more distant. It wasn't a good excuse, not that there were any. Either way, the moment was finally upon him. _'It doesn't matter if I'm afraid, that's irrelevant. I will finally, fully_ _**accept**_ _the consequences of my actions'_ he finished thinking as he saw Asuka return to the table with water.  
真嗣若有所思地想，在某些方面，他总是忙于日常活动，太累了，无法与明日香提起过去的事情，随着时间的推移，这件事变得越来越遥远。这不是一个好的借口，也不存在这样的借口。不管怎样，这一刻终于降临到了他身上。 “我是否害怕并不重要，那是无关紧要的。我最终会完全接受我的行为所带来的后果。”当他看到明日香端着水回到桌子上时，他这样想道。

"Here's water for you two" the redhead announced, placing the glasses in front of Shinji and Misato before sitting down next to Misato and opposite Shinji.  
“这是给你们两个的水。”红发宣布，将眼镜放在真嗣和美里面前，然后在真嗣对面坐下。

The man took a sip of water as he pondered how to start. Seeing everyone seated in such a serious mood at the table only reminded him of his confession to Misato in the past about the incident; in comparison to now, that was a walk in the park.  
男人喝了一口水，思考着如何开始。看到餐桌上大家都那么严肃的表情，他不禁想起了自己当年向美里坦白过的事情；与现在相比，那只是在公园散步。

"Listen fuckhead" Asuka spoke up, seeing Shinji remain silent. "I don't care if you feel scared or apprehensive, you better start talking now!"  
“听着，混蛋”明日香开口说道，见真嗣保持沉默。 “我不在乎你是否感到害怕或担心，你最好现在就开始说话！”

"Sorry!" the man replied instinctively, his old habits resurfacing at her tone. "No! I mean, yes, right away!" he corrected, not wanting to anger her further.  
“对不起！”男人本能地回答道，他的旧习惯随着她的语气又浮现了出来。 “不！我的意思是，是的，马上！”他纠正道，不想进一步激怒她。

Asuka betrayed no emotion and continued to stare at her husband expectantly.  
明日香没有流露出任何情绪，继续期待地盯着丈夫。

"I n-never know how to start these sorts of conversations" Shinji began nervously, "but in summary… there's really two main things I lied to you about," the redhead's face twitched slightly. "First… we were actually a couple _before_ you lost your memory"  
“我、不知道如何开始这种谈话，”真嗣紧张地开口，“但总而言之……我确实在两件事上骗了你，”红发的脸微微抽搐。 “首先……在你失去记忆之前，我们其实是情侣”

"What!" Asuka interrupted.  
“什么！”明日香打断道。

"I will explain everything!" Shinji quickly replied.  
“我会解释一切的！”慎二很快回答道。

"That's ridiculous! And why the fuck wouldn't you tell me that?!" the redhead refuted, looking at Misato as well with an incredulous look.  
“这太荒谬了！你他妈的为什么不告诉我呢？！”红发反驳道，同样用难以置信的眼神看着美里。

"He's not lying Asuka" Misato said firmly. "I understand your confusion, but you two were definitely together before your memory loss"  
“明日香他没有说谎。”美里坚定地说。 “我理解你的困惑，但在你失忆之前，你们两个肯定是在一起的。”

"I will get to why I didn't tell you but, think about it honey" Shinji started, "I'm sure you recall I was acting overly familiar and affectionate towards you and you were quite suspicious of my behaviour at first. Not to mention about how adamant I was to try to get together with you, remember how even I faked my death? I could definitely have taken things slower"  
“我会明白为什么我没有告诉你，但是，想一想，亲爱的，”真嗣开始说道，“我相信你还记得我对你表现得过于熟悉和深情，而你一开始对我的行为非常怀疑。不是更何况我是多么坚定地想要和你在一起，还记得我是如何假死的吗？我绝对可以放慢脚步”

Asuka paused. "I… guess. If we had been a couple, it makes sense that you were like that and… that you could kiss me so well"  
明日香停了下来。 “我……猜想。如果我们是情侣，那么你就是这样，而且……你可以如此亲吻我，这是有道理的”

"Remember how we were all sad about you losing your memory? How we all acted a little weird? That was because you forgot that you were together with me" Shinji explained.  
“还记得我们都为你失去记忆而难过吗？我们都表现得有点奇怪？那是因为你忘记了你和我在一起。”真嗣解释道。

"Now that you say that, it does make a lot of sense" Asuka admitted. "I take it there's far more to this story than you're letting on though…"  
“既然你这么说，确实很有道理。”明日香承认道。 “我认为这个故事的内涵远比你所透露的要多……”


"_**You said beforehand, I was a bitch and it's true so get used to it! It certainly doesn't make us a perfect couple alright?! Just get the fuck away from me! Ich Liebe Dich!" Asuka yelled.**_  
“你之前说过，我是个婊子，这是事实，所以要习惯它！这肯定不会让我们成为完美的情侣好吗？！他妈的离我远点！Ich Liebe Dich！”明日香喊道。


The redhead looked almost dazed as she recalled her distant memory; her buried past was beginning to resurface.  
红发女郎回忆起遥远的记忆，看上去几乎有些茫然。她被埋葬的过去开始重新浮现。

"Are you ok Asuka?" Shinji asked full of concern, standing up to move over to her.  
“明日香你还好吗？”真嗣起身走到她身边，关切地问道。

"Sit back down!" Asuka snapped. "I was just remembering some of the past… seems we were in the middle of a fight and I screamed 'I love you' in German"  
“坐回去吧！”明日香厉声说道。 “我只是想起了一些过去的事情……好像我们正在打架，我用德语尖叫着‘我爱你’”

"Oh yeah, that was… hmm… just before the fight with the 15th Angel" Shinji recalled.  
“哦，是的，那是……嗯……就在与第十五天使战斗之前”真嗣回忆道。

"Thanks for the timeline, but you still haven't explained much" the younger woman prompted.  
“谢谢你的时间表，但你还没有解释太多”年轻女子提示道。

"I know, everything will make sense shortly. I just want to go through what you were told after your memory loss first" the man explained.  
“我知道，一切很快就会变得有意义。我只是想先把你失忆后告诉你的内容再看一遍。”男人解释道。

"Ok fine" the redhead agreed.  
“好吧。”红发同意了。

"Thank you honey. Do you remember what I said about the drowning incident? When you jumped into the pool to save me?" Shinji asked.  
“谢谢你，亲爱的，你还记得我说的关于溺水事件吗？当你跳进泳池救我的时候？”真嗣问道。

"Yeah? Was that not actually what happened?" the redhead asked surprised; she thought for sure that it had been the truth.  
“是吗？事实并非如此吗？”红发惊讶的问道；她确信这就是事实。

"No, it did happen, but I lied about why you did it. It was because we were already a couple at that time, although to be fair no one other than Misato and Kensuke knew about us. You also gave me CPR as I had stopped breathing momentarily" he answered.  
“不，确实发生过，但我对你这么做的原因撒了谎。那是因为我们当时已经是情侣了，尽管公平地说，除了美里和健介之外没有人知道我们的事。你还给我做了心肺复苏，因为我呼吸暂时停止了”他回答道。

"Putting aside that I gave you CPR since that is totally irrelevant now, why the hell did Kensuke know about us before I lost my memory? Why didn't anyone else know?" the girl retorted, perplexed.  
“先不说我给你做了心肺复苏，这已经不重要了，为什么健介在我失忆之前就知道我们的事？为什么其他人都不知道？”少女疑惑地反驳道。

"Pure coincidence, he happened to be in the right place at the right time. He caught us in a precarious situation and was informed of our relationship, among other things, along with Misato. In exchange, he promised not to tell anyone about our relationship since we didn't want people to find out yet. That's why no one else knew" Shinji replied.  
“纯属巧合，他恰好在正确的时间出现在正确的地点。他发现我们处于危险的境地，并与美里一起得知了我们的关系等。作为交换，他承诺不会告诉任何人我们的事情。”因为我们不想让别人知道，所以没有人知道。”真嗣回答道。

Asuka thought over what he said, trying to absorb the information…  
明日香仔细思考着他所说的话，试图吸收其中的信息……


_**"Man, who woulda thought that you two, out of all people, had sex and became a couple" Kensuke remarked.  
“伙计，谁会想到你们两个，在所有人中，发生了性关系，成为了情侣？”健介说道。**_

_**"Man, I can't believe I confessed all that in front of you" Asuka replied. "Don't forget your promise stooge, no one is to know about this" she warned.  
“伙计，我不敢相信我在你面前承认了这一切”明日香回答道。 “别忘了你的跟班承诺，没有人会知道这件事，”她警告道。**_

_**"Don't worry, I'll keep my silence. If I was in the same situation, I would have asked you to do the same" Kensuke assured.  
“放心，我会保持沉默。如果我处于同样的情况，我也会要求你做同样的事情。”健介保证道。**_


Asuka's face looked completely taken aback as her memory jogged. Hearing Kensuke talk about the discussion was one thing, but he mentioned they _had sex_?  
当她的记忆开始运转时，明日香的脸看起来完全震惊了。听到健介谈论讨论是一回事，但他提到他们发生了性关系？

Again, Shinji's eyes locked onto hers with concern, trying to make sure she was alright.  
真嗣再次用关切的目光锁定她的眼睛，试图确定她是否还好。

"Just… more memories" the younger woman explained in response to his look. "But, I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly. Did… did we have sex before I lost my memories?" she asked, straight to the point.  
“只是……更多的回忆。”年轻女子看着他的表情解释道。 “但是，我不确定我是否记得正确。在我失去记忆之前，我们……有没有发生过性关系？”她问，开门见山。

"Yes" the man answered. "I lied about us being virgins, we had already slept with each other before"  
“是的”男人回答道。 “我谎称我们是处女，我们之前已经睡过”

"Seriously, this is just insane. That 'first' time we had together makes a lot more sense now that I know it wasn't the first…" Asuka responded.  
“说真的，这太疯狂了。现在我知道这不是第一次，我们在一起的‘第一次’就更有意义了……”明日香回答道。

"Exactly, it was also the _real_ reason we needed to bathe in LCL regularly. I'm sure you can see a pattern with the lies so far…" Shinji added.  
“确实，这也是我们需要定期在拼箱中洗澡的真正原因。我相信你可以看到到目前为止谎言的模式......”真嗣补充道。

"Christ, I can't believe how much bullshit you fed me. You certainly were a master deceiver back then" the redhead shot back.  
“天哪，我简直不敢相信你给我说了这么多废话。你当时真是个骗子大师”红发反驳道。

"What _is_ the deal with LCL?" Misato asked confused, still not understanding what they were talking about.  
“拼箱是怎么回事？”美里疑惑地问道，还是不明白他们在说什么。

"Don't worry" the other two said in unison.  
“别担心。”另外两人异口同声说道。

"That discussion with the Commander where I told you we got drunk on Misato's beer? All a complete fabrication. He was telling us off for having sex and threatened to separate us if our relationship affected our ability to pilot" Shinji continued.  
“我和指挥官的那次谈话，我告诉你我们喝了美里的啤酒喝醉了？这完全是捏造的。他斥责我们发生性行为，并威胁说，如果我们的关系影响了我们的驾驶能力，就要分开我们。”真嗣继续说道。

"At this point, I shouldn't care, but I kinda wished that story had been true. I have to praise your creativity there, how many more things did you make up?" Asuka demanded.  
“现在我不应该在意，但我有点希望那个故事是真的。我不得不称赞你的创造力，你还编造了多少东西？”明日香问道。

"For completeness' sake, there was that photo of us snuggled on the couch…" the man started.  
“为了完整起见，有一张我们依偎在沙发上的照片……”男人开始说道。

"Which wasn't because we accidentally fell asleep and snuggled on the couch watching a movie – it's because we were a couple then" Asuka interrupted. "The real reason we went to the school dance together was because we were a couple blah blah blah, I get it" she continued.  
“这并不是因为我们不小心睡着了，依偎在沙发上看电影——而是因为我们当时是情侣，”明日香打断道。 “我们一起去学校舞会的真正原因是因为我们是一对等等，我明白了”她继续说道。

"I just want to make sure you know everything, though speaking of that photo; I had never showed it to Touji and Kensuke, the _actual_ reason you had skipped school was because you found me at Rei's apartment after I was gone all night and you thought I was cheating on you" he recounted.  
“我只是想确保你知道一切，不过说到那张照片；我从来没有把它拿给东司和健介看，你逃学的真正原因是因为我离开一整夜后你在丽的公寓找到了我，而你我以为我在欺骗你”他回忆道。

"Haha what? I got jealous over Rei before my memory loss as well? In any case… every one of these lies are just because you didn't want to tell me that we were in a relationship before I lost my memories. Were you really afraid to tell me this after we got back together? What's the big deal?" the redhead questioned, getting confused about this whole mess.  
“哈哈什么？失忆前我也嫉妒丽了？总之……这些谎言，都是因为你不想告诉我，在我失忆前我们已经谈过恋爱了。你是吗？”我们复合后真的不敢告诉我这件事吗？”红发问道，对这整件事感到困惑。

"That's because there were _two_ main things I lied about. The second thing is well… something you can't imagine…" he answered.  
“那是因为我在两件事上撒了谎。第二件事是……你无法想象的……”他回答道。

"Well spit it out already!" Asuka said, slamming her fist on the table. Her anger and impatience getting the better of her.  
“好吧，已经吐出来了！”明日香一边说着，一边用拳头重重地敲在桌子上。她的愤怒和不耐烦占据了她的上风。

"I didn't go to prison because I disobeyed the Commander's orders!" Shinji blurted out. "It was something far worse… and… and that scar on your abdomen… every time I see it, I can't forget what I did to you…" he choked.  
“我入狱并不是因为我违抗了司令的命令！”慎二脱口而出。 “那是更糟糕的事情……而且……还有你腹部的伤疤……每次我看到它，我都无法忘记我对你做了什么……”他哽咽了。

"Shinji… what are you talking about?" Asuka asked, her voice full of dread. Her heart was beating many miles an hour, she could feel her mind telling her to stop, not to open this box. There was something terribly wrong and the former Unit 02 pilot _had_ to know the truth. "Tell me… please"  
“真嗣……你在说什么？”明日香问道，声音里充满了恐惧。她的心脏每小时跳动数英里，她能感觉到她的大脑告诉她停下来，不要打开这个盒子。发生了严重的错误，这位前 02 号机组飞行员必须知道真相。 “请告诉我”

Wanting to give Shinji a small reprieve, Misato finally spoke up. "It happened sometime after the defeat of the 14th Angel, after Shinji had returned from being absorbed" she started. "I… I was often absent from the residence on a mad quest for knowledge and I'm… I'm so sorry Asuka" Misato continued, her eyes tearing up. "I neglected you two so much… even though I cared for you both. This event happened one night I was away and you two were alone"  
想要给真嗣一点缓刑，美里终于开口了。 “这发生在第14天使被击败之后的某个时间，在真嗣从被吸收中回归之后”她开始说道。 “我……我经常缺席住所，因为对知识的疯狂追求，我……我很抱歉明日香”美里继续说道，她的眼睛流着泪。 “我太忽视你们两个了……尽管我很关心你们两个。这件事发生在我不在的一个晚上，你们两个单独在一起”

The redhead stayed silent, her mind reeling from everything she heard. She could tell she had passed the point of no return; she was going to find out the truth whether she wanted to or not.  
红发女郎沉默不语，她的思绪被她所听到的一切所困扰。她知道自己已经到了无法回头的地步。不管她愿不愿意，她都要找出真相。

"It was my fault!" Shinji shouted, not wanting Misato to take the blame. "That night… you were shouting at me to make dinner Asuka, but you were also incredibly angry, the worst I had ever seen you. Even so, that's utterly trivial in comparison to what I did in response when I… grabbed a knife and cut your abdomen and then I… I…" he spluttered, unable to finish his sentence.  
“是我的错！”真嗣大喊道，不想让美里承担责任。 “那天晚上……明日香，你对我大喊大叫，要我做晚饭，但你也非常生气，这是我见过的最糟糕的。即便如此，与我……抓起一把刀然后做出的回应相比，这完全是微不足道的。”切开你的腹部，然后我……我……”他结结巴巴地说不出话来。

"What the _fuck_ did you do Shinji?!" the redhead shouted.  
“慎二你到底做了什么？！”红发人喊道。

"I raped you!" her husband shouted back, causing Asuka to visibly flinch.  
“我强奸了你！”她的丈夫大声回应，让明日香明显退缩了。


_**"I raped her" “我强奸了她”**_

**;**

"_**I raped her… I violently assaulted her and then… raped her"**_  
“我强奸了她……我暴力侵犯了她，然后……强奸了她”

_**;**_

_**"Will you just shut up and get out of here! Are you fucking brain dead? Why the fuck would I want to talk to someone who raped me?!"  
“你能闭嘴并离开这里吗？你他妈的脑死亡了吗？我他妈为什么要和强奸我的人说话？！”**_

**;**

"_**Here… you raped me… you painfully penetrated me… I am still sore… I am still violated… you did something unforgiveable…"**_  
“这里……你强奸了我……你痛苦地插入了我……我仍然很痛……我仍然被侵犯……你做了一些不可原谅的事情……”

**;**

_**"I don't care! You're currently acting way too indifferent considering what happened just yesterday. Now get lost or I'll tell Misato how her good little Shinji raped me"  
“我不在乎！考虑到昨天发生的事情，你现在表现得太冷漠了。现在滚吧，否则我会告诉美里她的好小真嗣是如何强奸我的”**_

**;**

_**"Just because I'm not bawling my eyes out doesn't mean I'm ok, far from it. If you haven't yet realised you numbskull, you raped me! Things between us? You're a rapist, I'm the one you violated, that's where we stand…"  
“仅仅因为我没有哭出来并不意味着我很好，远非如此。如果你还没有意识到你是个麻木的人，你就强奸了我！我们之间的事情？你是一个强奸犯，我”我是你所侵犯的人，这就是我们的立场……”**_

**;**

"_**I-I was in s-so much pain Shinji, the humiliation from losing to you… the pain after you**_ **raped** _**me"**_  
“我、我真的很痛苦，真嗣，输给你的屈辱……你强奸我后的痛苦”

**;**

_**"What if… because I was angry, angry enough not to be able to stop myself…what if I… I raped you Asuka"  
“如果……因为我很生气，生气到无法阻止自己……如果我……我强奸了你明日香怎么办？”**_


A single tear trickled down Asuka's face as the memories assaulted her. Her heart ached; she felt betrayed, she felt humiliated, deceived, violated… broken. Her mind finally unlocked what it had kept hidden for so long and her body convulsed, as if she was about to throw up. Shinji rushed over to her immediately, worried about her state of mind.  
当回忆袭击她时，一滴泪水从明日香的脸上流下来。她的心很痛；她感到被背叛、被羞辱、被欺骗、被侵犯……心碎。她的思绪终于解开了隐藏已久的东西，她的身体抽搐起来，仿佛就要呕吐。真嗣立即冲到她身边，担心她的精神状态。

"DON'T TOUCH ME!" the redhead yelled instinctively.  
“别碰我！”红发本能的喊道。

The young man halted instantly, fear evident on his face. Asuka looked up at him with disgust, the memories of that night became more lucid with every passing moment. How he held her down, forced himself on her, the violence, the awful things he had said; it was so grotesque.  
青年顿时停了下来，脸上露出惊恐之色。明日香厌恶地抬头看着他，那晚的记忆随着时间的推移而变得更加清晰。他如何压制她，强行压在她身上，他的暴力行为，他所说的可怕的话；太怪异了。

"You disgusting creep, what the hell possessed you to do that to me?! Oh my God Shinji, this is so bad, so… so much worse than I could have ever thought" the redhead let out, her voice almost breaking.  
“你这个恶心的变种，到底是什么让你对我做出这样的事？！天哪，真嗣，这太糟糕了，所以……比我想象的还要糟糕。”红发女郎大声说道，她的声音几乎破裂了。

"Y-yes, you are right… I-I still don't really know why I went through with it… you even pleaded with me that night… urgh" Shinji responded, his voice failing.  
“是、是的，你是对的……我、我还是不知道为什么我要这么做……那天晚上你甚至恳求我……呃”真嗣回答道，他的声音有些微弱。

"And YOU Misato! How could you participate in trying to get us back together?! After that disgrace?! Are you out of your mind?!" Asuka fired at Misato, right in her face.  
“还有你美里！你怎么能参与到让我们重归于好的行动中？！那次耻辱之后？！你疯了吗？！”明日香向美里开枪，正中她的脸。

Their former guardian was at a loss for words, Asuka's words stinging deeply.  
他们的前守护者无言以对，明日香的话语深深刺痛了他们。

"I… I… just… you were happy with him… I thought it was what you would have wanted" the older woman answered, tears streaming down her face.  
“我……我……只是……你和他在一起很开心……我想这就是你想要的。”年长的女人回答道，泪水从她的脸上流下来。

"Don't you think…" the redhead started. "DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THIS AND MAKE MY OWN DECISION ABOUT IT?!" she finished, slamming her fist on the table.  
“你不觉得……”红发问道。 “你不认为我应该被告知这件事并做出自己的决定吗？！”她说完，用拳头重重地敲在桌子上。

Shinji could feel despair coming over him, his whole life was unfolding before him; this was why he had been so afraid to tell her the truth, but at the same time, it was not a consequence he should or could avoid. He should have told her the truth before; whatever happened at the time, would have been the best thing that could have happened given the circumstances.  
真嗣感到绝望向他袭来，他的一生都在眼前展开。这就是为什么他一直不敢告诉她真相，但同时，这也不是他应该或能够避免的后果。他早该告诉她真相的；无论当时发生什么，在当时的情况下都是最好的事情。

"A-Asuka, you have every right to be upset. I sh-should have told you, I know! But it was so hard to tell you, I know it's no excuse honey but even so… it's the truth. There are no more lies between us now and whatever you're thinking or feeling right now, I love you Asuka, no matter what" Shinji entreated.  
“明、明日香，你完全有权利感到不安。我——应该告诉你，我知道！但是很难告诉你，我知道这不是借口，亲爱的，但即便如此……这就是事实。没有现在我们之间还有更多的隔阂，无论你现在在想什么或有什么感受，我爱你明日香，无论发生什么。”真嗣恳求道。

"DON'T call me _honey_!" the younger woman snapped. "I… I just can't take your words as sincere Shinji. It feels like a joke, how can you say that you love me when you… when you did _that_ to me? Shinji… why? Why did you do that? Why did you come after me again?" Asuka asked, her tone grave.  
“别叫我亲爱的！”年轻女子厉声说道。 “我……我只是不能把你的话当成真诚的真嗣。这感觉就像个笑话，当你……当你对我这么做的时候，你怎么能说你爱我呢？真嗣……为什么？你为什么这么做？为什么你又来追我了？”明日香语气严肃地问道。

"Asuka, I am truly sorry for what I did to you, at least believe that. I sincerely regret it. I came after you again because I love you, I didn't want to spend my life without you. I probably didn't deserve it, but I wanted you in my arms again more than anything" he answered.  
“明日香，我真的很抱歉我对你所做的事，至少相信这一点。我真诚地后悔。我再次追求你是因为我爱你，我不想在没有你的情况下度过我的一生。我可能没有'这是我应得的，但我最想把你再次抱在怀里，”他回答道。

His wife sighed loudly, her mind calming down at last. The vivid memories were slowly pushed from her mind as she attempted to analyse the current situation. Indeed, this was a terrible secret for Shinji to hide; she could only imagine how it ate at him.  
妻子长长地叹了口气，心终于平静下来。她一边试图分析眼前的情况，一边慢慢将那些鲜活的记忆从脑海中赶走。确实，这对真嗣来说是一个可怕的秘密。她只能想象这对他来说是怎样的折磨。

"Alright Shinji, now I get why you were so reluctant to tell me about the past but… I need some time to think. I understand everything that occurred now, the reasons still… elude me but I want some time to reflect on all this and remember what our previous relationship was like. I can't believe that I willingly choose to stay with you after… _that_" Asuka said, trailing off.  
“好吧，真嗣，现在我明白为什么你这么不愿意告诉我过去的事情了，但是……我需要一些时间思考。我明白现在发生的一切，原因仍然……我不明白，但我想要一些时间来反思这一切。”记住我们之前的关系是什么样的，我不敢相信在……之后我竟然愿意选择和你在一起。”明日香说道，声音逐渐减弱。

"Of course Asuka, I didn't expect this to be easy for you at all… I will leave" the man stated before standing up and leaving the residence.  
“当然了，明日香，我没想到这对你来说是一件容易的事情……我这就走。”男人说道，然后站起身来，离开了住所。

After a moment of silence after hearing the door shut, the older woman spoke up. "Do you want me to leave as well?" she asked with trepidation.  
听到门关上的声音，沉默了一会儿，老妇人开口了。 “你也想让我离开吗？”她战战兢兢地问道。

The redhead gave her former guardian a look mixed with hurt, despair and anger. Misato looked on, wanting nothing more than to embrace the poor girl but dared not move. Without warning, Asuka pulled Misato into a hug, her face screaming into the older woman's side; all her emotions released as she tried to cope with the situation. The purple haired woman stood frozen for a moment before wrapping her arms around the girl, wanting nothing more than to wish away the suffering.  
红发女郎看着她以前的监护人，表情中夹杂着受伤、绝望和愤怒。美里看着，只想拥抱这个可怜的女孩，却不敢动。毫无预兆地，明日香把美里拉进怀里，她的脸尖叫着贴在老妇人的身边。当她试图应对这种情况时，她所有的情绪都释放了出来。紫发女子愣愣地站了一会儿，然后伸手抱住少女，只想祈求痛苦消失。

"I'm so sorry Asuka… I should have been there that night… I'm so sorry" Misato finally let out after some time.  
“我很抱歉明日香……那天晚上我应该在那里……我很抱歉”过了一会儿美里终于开口了。

"I… I would be foolish not to accept that this is a complex situation… and you're not entirely responsible for Shinji's actions-" the younger woman started after pulling away.  
“我……如果我不承认这是一个复杂的情况，那我就太愚蠢了……而且你对真嗣的行为并不完全负责——”年轻女子在抽身离开后开始说道。

"Yes I was! I was his guardian!" Misato interrupted.  
“是的，我是！我是他的监护人！”美里打断道。

"He wasn't 5 years old Misato!" Asuka retorted. "Look… I understand what you're saying, I accept your apology… again. As I'm older now and have raised kids, I can better understand the difficulties you had and I can't claim to know what you could have done differently, no parent is perfect"  
“他不是五岁的美里！”明日香反驳道。 “听着……我明白你在说什么，我再次接受你的道歉。随着我现在长大并抚养了孩子，我可以更好地理解你所遇到的困难，我不能声称知道你可以做什么不同的是，没有一个父母是完美的”

"B-But Asuka-" the older woman started.  
“可是——但是明日香——”年长的女人开口说道。

"Misato! I remember everything ok?" the redhead interrupted. "I thought it was weird that Shinji was sent to prison for disobeying the Commander that one time, but _you_ actually sent him there. You made sure he was punished for his crime, I know you've always been my ally"  
“美里！我都记得了，好吗？”红发人打断道。 “真嗣有一次因为不服从指挥官而被送进监狱，我觉得很奇怪，但你真的把他送进了监狱。你确保他因他的罪行而受到惩罚，我知道你一直是我的盟友”

Misato couldn't help hugging the girl tightly, the weight of the guilt she felt finally lifted. Asuka could never know how much her words had impacted Misato. "Thank you Asuka… your words truly mean a lot to me. I was so upset when he first told me about what happened to you, I honestly felt like beating him to a pulp. Ironically, it was you that stopped me going further"  
美里忍不住紧紧地抱住了女孩，心中的愧疚终于减轻了。明日香永远不知道她的话对美里的影响有多大。 “谢谢明日香……你的话对我来说确实意义重大。当他第一次告诉我发生在你身上的事情时，我非常沮丧，老实说，我真想把他打成肉浆。讽刺的是，是你阻止了我继续前进。”

"It's all so much to take in" Asuka remarked. "I need some time to myself to think… alone"  
“这一切都太值得接受了，”明日香说道。 “我需要一些时间让自己思考......独自”

"Understood, I will lea-" the older woman started.  
“明白了，我会——”年长的女人开始说道。

"Don't leave the house just… stay in my room. I just need time to think, I probably need a lot of time actually. It's better you stay here, Rei will be bringing back the kids and-"  
“别离开家，就……呆在我的房间里。我只是需要时间思考，实际上我可能需要很多时间。你最好留在这里，丽会带孩子们回来，然后——”

"Don't worry about the kids right now, you need a break to sort this out. I'm going to call Rei and tell her to keep the kids for as long as you need" Misato interrupted.  
“现在不用担心孩子们，你需要休息一下来解决这个问题。我会打电话给丽，告诉她只要你需要，就可以照顾孩子。”美里打断道。

"Ok thanks, but I still want you around. And if Shinji comes back, tell him to piss off. I don't want to see him right now" the redhead added.  
“好吧，谢谢，但我还是想要你在身边。如果真嗣回来了，让他滚蛋。我现在不想见到他。”红发补充道。

"Sure thing, I just wanted to say one thing though… Shinji really does love you" Misato said gently.  
“当然，我只是想说一件事……真嗣真的很爱你”美里温柔地说。

"I know that! He's a fucking hopeless idiot, but I know that" Asuka replied with a sigh.  
“我知道！他是个他妈的无可救药的白痴，但我知道。”明日香叹了口气回答道。

At this, the older woman left the room without another sound, leaving the redhead alone to ruminate. _'Baka Shinji, why didn't you tell me earlier?'_  
说完，老妇人一声不吭地离开了房间，留下红发独自沉思。 “巴卡真嗣，你为什么不早点告诉我？”

---

A young man with brown hair walked the streets of Tokyo-3, though it looked completely different to when the angel wars had started. Without constantly needing to rebuild nor requiring defenses against angel attacks, the city had thrived into a bustling metropolis. Not that Shinji cared about any of that at the moment. Looking up at the sky, he was at a complete loss on what to do next. He finally, _finally_ told Asuka the truth about everything. He could feel the years old weight, the all-consuming guilt, the fetters that chained his behaviour and stopped him from truly being free with his wife, gone at last. The relief that he never had to lie, pretend, alter his behaviour about the past anymore was liberating. However, he had paid the price for his cowardice and was sure Asuka would take a long time to come around, if she ever did.  
一名棕色头发的年轻人走在第三东京的街道上，尽管现在的情况与天使战争爆发时完全不同。不需要不断地重建，也不需要防御天使的攻击，这座城市已经发展成为一座繁华的大都市。真嗣现在并不关心这些。抬头看着天空，他完全不知道下一步该怎么办。他终于、终于告诉了明日香一切的真相。他能感觉到岁月的沉重、吞噬一切的负罪感、束缚他行为的枷锁，阻止他与最终离去的妻子真正获得自由。他再也不用撒谎、假装、改变自己对过去的行为，这让他松了口气。然而，他已经为自己的怯懦付出了代价，并且确信如果明日香愿意的话，她也需要很长时间才能回心转意。

'_Why didn't I do this sooner? I didn't realise how suffocated I felt until I finally let it all out'_ Shinji thought. _'Because I'm a lowly coward, of course. But at least I finally told her, it was tough… but it was definitely for the best no matter what. I will never forget Aria's words…'_  
“我为什么不早点做这件事呢？直到我终于把这一切都发泄出来时，我才意识到自己有多窒息。”真嗣想道。 “当然，因为我是一个卑微的胆小鬼。但至少我最后告诉她，这很艰难……但无论如何这绝对是最好的。我永远不会忘记阿丽亚的话……”


"…_**Once you make a choice, you cannot erase the past and you must accept the consequences of your chosen path…"**_  
“……一旦做出选择，你就无法抹去过去，你必须接受你所选择道路的后果……”


'_I can't run away; I must face whatever happens next. Truth and reality are now on my side and I love Asuka and my kids. I don't deserve the happiness I was given, so if that's the final price to pay for my sin… so be it'_  
“我无法逃跑；接下来发生的一切我都必须面对。真相和现实现在站在我这边，我爱明日香和我的孩子们。我不配得到我所得到的幸福，所以如果这是为我的罪孽付出的最终代价……那就这样吧”

The man's contemplation was interrupted by the sound of his phone ringing, he hoped against hope his wife was calling. Looking at the caller ID, his face dropped as he saw Misato's name. Shinji accepted the call and brought the phone to his ear.  
男人的沉思被电话铃声打断了，他满怀希望地希望是妻子打来的电话。看着来电显示，看到美里的名字，他脸色沉了下来。真嗣接听电话，将手机放到耳边。

"Hello Misato, is everything ok?" he asked, hoping Asuka was alright.  
“你好，美里，一切都好吗？”他问道，希望明日香没事。

"As well as things could be, I guess. Asuka has calmed down and is currently by herself reflecting on all we told her. Also… she doesn't want to see you anytime soon" Misato replied.  
“我想事情也可能是这样。明日香已经平静下来，目前正在独自思考我们告诉她的一切。而且……她不想很快见到你”美里回答道。

"I didn't expect otherwise, but I'm glad she's coping" he remarked.  
“我没想到会是这样，但我很高兴她能够应对，”他说。

"Asuka's always been a strong girl, but even so… this will be very difficult for her. I can't imagine what she feels right now. No matter what happens in the end Shinji, I just want you know that I won't abandon you; you are like a son to me. I won't defend your past actions and I will be on Asuka's side in that aspect, but I will always care for you" Misato said sincerely.  
“明日香一直是个坚强的女孩，但即便如此……这对她来说也会很困难。我无法想象她现在的感受。无论最后会发生什么，真嗣，我只想让你知道我不会抛弃你，你就像我的儿子一样，我不会为你过去的行为辩解，在这方面我会站在明日香这边，但我会永远关心你。”美里真诚地说。

Shinji took in a deep breath at his former guardian's words, thankful for the comfort. "Thanks Misato, I really appreciate it. After what I did it's more than I deserve, but I'm glad you won't abandon me"  
听到前监护人的话，真嗣深吸了一口气，感谢他给的安慰。 “谢谢美里，我真的很感激。我所做的一切超出了我应得的，但我很高兴你不会抛弃我”

"Of course not. In any case, I also wanted to call about your kids. I think Asuka should take a break from the kids to sort through her feelings and all. Asuka also wants me to stay with her currently, I think it's best you go to Rei's place and take your kids to my place. I'll tell Kaji you're coming. When Asuka's ready, they will go back home, whether or not you're coming too" the woman explained.  
“当然不是。不管怎样，我也想打电话问问你孩子的事情。我觉得明日香应该暂时离开孩子们一段时间，好好整理一下自己的感受什么的。明日香现在也想让我留在她身边，我想这样最好。”你去丽的地方，带你的孩子去我的地方，我会告诉卡吉你要来，当明日香准备好时，无论你是否也来，他们都会回家。”女人解释道。

"Sounds like a plan, I'll do that then. Thanks again Misato, keep me posted if anything else happens" he replied.  
“听起来像是一个计划，我会这么做的。再次感谢美里，如果发生任何其他事情请随时通知我”他回答道。

"Will do, see you later Shinji" the woman finished, before hanging up.  
“好的，真嗣再见。”女人说完，就挂断了电话。

The man then began walking to Rei's residence to do as Misato had suggested. At least entertaining his kids would keep his mind busy for a while.  
然后，这名男子开始步行前往丽的住所，按照美里的建议去做。至少让他的孩子们开心能让他的头脑忙碌一段时间。

---

Betrayal; that was the strongest feeling she felt. Her trust was betrayed, her love was betrayed. He had forcefully violated her at the place she usually felt safe, he had then hidden the truth from her when she lost her memory. He had then manipulated her to achieve his desires and still never came clean even after years of marriage and raising kids; it was complete treachery.  
背叛；这是她感受到的最强烈的感觉。她的信任被背叛了，她的爱被背叛了。他在她平时觉得安全的地方强行侵犯了她，又在她失忆后向她隐瞒了真相。然后他操纵她来实现他的愿望，即使在结婚和抚养孩子多年之后仍然没有坦白；这完全是背叛。

Several days had passed since the revelation. Asuka had been in disbelief for the first day, still wondering if it was a dream, but whenever she saw Misato around the house or noticed her kids missing, the cold hard truth pressed against her mind. Sleeping was another challenge altogether, she was so used to… Shinji's warmth next to her, the bed felt so empty, her heart felt so hollow. When she eventually did succumb to tiredness, she was plagued by nightmares where she relieved the horrible experience of that night again and again; it was torture.  
距离消息曝光已经过去了好几天。第一天明日香一直难以置信，仍然怀疑这是否是一个梦，但每当她在房子周围看到美里或发现她的孩子失踪时，冰冷残酷的事实就会压在她的脑海里。睡觉又是一个挑战，她太习惯了……真嗣的温暖在她身边，床感觉那么空，她的心感觉那么空虚。当她最终屈服于疲倦时，她被噩梦所困扰，一次又一次地缓解了当晚的可怕经历；这是酷刑。

As the days passed, the redhead recalled their past relationship and all the past events previously locked away in her mind. Everything clicked, every moment from when she woke up with her memory lost now made complete sense. Shinji's behaviours and attitudes were all driven by his unwillingness to let go of her and all the inconsistencies were now obvious; at the very least she finally felt that she was in complete control of her destiny again, that she was no longer kept in the dark.  
日子一天天过去，红发想起了他们以前的关系，以及之前锁在脑海里的所有往事。一切都很顺利，从她失去记忆醒来的每一刻现在都完全有意义了。真嗣的行为和态度都是因为他不愿意放开她，所有的矛盾现在都显而易见了；至少她终于感觉到自己再次完全掌握了自己的命运，不再被蒙在鼓里。

With the knowledge of what had happened, also came the knowledge of how she had treated Shinji after he came back from being absorbed by the angel and Asuka did not at all feel proud of her actions. It was somewhat incredible how much the two had hurt each other during the angel wars, although nothing came close to Shinji's rape.  
知道了发生的事情后，也知道了真嗣被天使吸收回来后她是如何对待他的，明日香并没有为自己的行为感到骄傲。令人难以置信的是，两人在天使战争期间互相伤害了多少，尽管没有什么能与真嗣的强奸相提并论。


"_**I told you… there is so much we do together… I've always wanted us to get along… that's part of why it all hurt so much with you after I had returned from being absorbed…"**_  
“我告诉过你……我们在一起做了很多事情……我一直希望我们能够和睦相处……这就是为什么在我从被吸收中回来后，这一切对你如此伤害的部分原因……”


The young woman found it unusual that Shinji had come to her after the incident to try to take responsibility and try to figure out a way forward. Obviously, he had no clue what to do and not many people would. With the magnitude of what he had done and the guilt he felt, she supposed it made sense he overcame his fear of confrontation that time.  
这位年轻女子发现真嗣在事件发生后来找她试图承担责任并试图找出解决办法，这很不寻常。显然，他不知道该怎么做，也没有多少人会这样做。考虑到他所做的事情的严重性和他所感到的内疚，她认为他那次克服了对对抗的恐惧是有道理的。

The redhead unconsciously traced the scar on her abdomen again; a permanent reminder of that night. Discovering how she had attained the wound made her feel uneasy, although Shinji had never done anything like that again she couldn't help thinking about him swinging the knife at her or his hands on her throat. It was all so surreal; it was like her mind was overcompensating for all the time that these memories had been buried. Though she also remembered how she had grabbed the same knife and tried to kill him with it herself. It was really unbelievable how things had transpired.  
红发不自觉的又摸了摸腹部的伤疤；那一晚的永久回忆。发现自己是如何到达伤口的，她感到不安，尽管真嗣再也没有做过这样的事，但她还是忍不住想起他向她挥刀，或者双手掐住她的喉咙。一切都是那么的超现实；就好像她的大脑对这些记忆被埋葬的时间进行了过度补偿。但她也记得自己是如何抓起同一把刀并试图亲手杀死他的。事情的发生实在令人难以置信。


_**"Just shut up! You have no right to ask what the fuck is wrong with me when you acted like a total psycho"  
“闭嘴！当你表现得像个疯子时，你没有权利问我他妈的怎么了”**_


Wanting to talk to someone who had no knowledge of the event, Asuka had called Hikari. She told her friend how Shinji had hidden a terrible secret from her for a long time and only just revealed it. Asuka didn't expect Hikari to be able to provide any resolution but it just felt good to talk to her best friend about it and how much she was struggling to come to terms with it. Hikari told her in response that she would listen to her as much as she wanted, but in the end, Asuka had to decide what to do.  
明日香想和一个不知道这件事的人谈谈，所以给光打了电话。她告诉她的朋友真嗣如何向她隐瞒了一个可怕的秘密很长时间，直到现在才透露出来。明日香并不指望光能够提供任何解决方案，但与她最好的朋友谈论这件事以及她是如何努力接受这件事的感觉很好。光回应道，只要她愿意，她都会听她的，但最后，明日香必须决定该怎么做。


"_**I'm not going to tell you what to do Asuka" Hikari started, "But perhaps ask yourself, do you love him? Does he love you? You understand Shinji the most, the answer will come to you and… something like this is your decision alone to make, no one else should convince or persuade you one way or another"**_  
“我不会告诉你明日香该怎么做，”光开始说道，“但也许问问你自己，你爱他吗？他爱你吗？你最了解真嗣，答案就会出现在你的脑海里……就像这样这是你一个人做出的决定，任何人都不能以某种方式说服或说服你”


The redhead pondered over Hikari's words. Did she love him? Before she knew she had been deceived she would have said yes in a heartbeat, now she wasn't so sure. Did he love her? Well, he certainly professed as much and she felt that he did. But how could someone who loves you, lie about something so important? Unable to answer definitively, she put it aside and thought about all her husband's actions after the event before she had lost her memory.  
红发思考着光的话。她爱他吗？在她知道自己被骗之前，她会立刻答应，但现在她不太确定了。他爱她吗？嗯，他确实是这么说的，而她也觉得他是这么说的。但一个爱你的人怎么可能在如此重要的事情上撒谎呢？她无法给出明确的答案，便将这件事放在一边，回想着事发后丈夫的所作所为，直到她失去了记忆。

One aspect that spoke in favour of Shinji was that he had been truly remorseful for the event. He had never defended his actions that night, made no excuses and accepted all punishment.  
对真嗣有利的一个方面是，他对这件事确实感到悔恨。他从来没有为自己当晚的行为辩护，没有找任何借口，接受了所有的惩罚。


"_**I… am so sorry Asuka… what I did to you… that was so fucked up… I can't stop crying every time I think about what you went through, how powerless you must have felt…"**_  
“我……很抱歉明日香……我对你做了什么……真是太糟糕了……每当我想到你所经历的一切，你一定感到多么无力……我就忍不住哭泣……”


Him trying to patch things up after the event, looking out for her and caring for her, admitting his sins in front of Misato, getting smacked by Misato, going to prison; she could be certain at least that he wanted to atone for his mistakes. Unfortunately, it was undermined by his actions after her memory loss and regardless of his wish to atone, she still had to forgive him. Could Asuka forgive him for what he had done? She had done so in the past, before she had lost her memory. The young woman clearly recognised that she had truly forgiven him before, not some half-baked flippant dismissal, no, she really had accepted Shinji, rape and all.  
他在事后试图修补关系，照顾她，照顾她，在美里面前认罪，被美里打，进监狱；她至少可以确定他想弥补自己的错误。可惜，她失忆后，被他的行为破坏了，无论他愿意赎罪，她还是要原谅他。明日香能原谅他的所作所为吗？在她失去记忆之前，她曾经这样做过。年轻女子清楚地认识到，自己之前确实原谅了他，而不是半生不熟的轻率拒绝，不，她真的接受了真嗣，接受了强奸等等。


"…_**I've been feeling so bitter all this time way before that incident, it can't be him alone and I know he's not pitying me. It's just… he doesn't deserve forgiveness… even so, he's shown nothing but remorse and he does fight against the angels with me. I remember the times he saved my life. I haven't treated him well for a long time and I know it pales in comparison to what he did to me, but even so… I can just let it go… he doesn't deserve it, but I can let it go…"**_  
“……在那件事发生之前，我一直感到很痛苦，不可能是他一个人，我知道他不是在可怜我。只是……他不值得原谅……即便如此，他除了悔恨之外什么也没有表现出来。”他确实和我一起对抗天使。我记得他救了我很长一段时间，我知道这与他对我所做的相比相形见绌，但即便如此……我可以。就放手吧……他不值得，但我可以放手……”

_**;**_

"_**Shinji… I've already forgiven you. Yes, it was horrifying at the time, but I know you genuinely regretted it. Thank you for your apology, I really appreciate it"**_  
“真嗣……我已经原谅你了。是的，当时很可怕，但我知道你真的后悔了。谢谢你的道歉，我真的很感激”


All the facts were clear in her head now but in the end, Shinji should have told her what had happened. He had robbed Asuka the real choice of whether or not to continue a relationship with him, to forgive him or not again, to… love him or not.  
现在所有的事实都在她的脑海中清晰可见，但最终，真嗣应该告诉她发生了什么。他剥夺了明日香真正的选择权：是否继续与他保持关系，是否再次原谅他，是否……爱他。

During these past few days, the young woman had sorted through her feelings. There was nothing more she could achieve by just thinking about it. She knew there was only one way to resolve this now; she needed to talk to Shinji, she needed the wound in her heart to heal.  
这几天，少妇已经整理好了自己的心情。光是想想，她已经没有什么可以实现的了。她知道现在只有一个办法可以解决这个问题：她需要和真嗣谈谈，她需要治愈内心的伤口。

Asuka shifted her gaze to her phone, staring at it intently. _'I should call him to meet in person… this is the best way'_  
明日香将目光转向手机，专注地盯着它。 “我应该亲自打电话给他见面……这是最好的方式”

At last finished with her deliberation, she grabbed the phone and hit call on _**Idiot Husband**_.  
终于思虑完毕，她抓起手机，拨通了白痴老公的电话。

The phone rang only moments before Shinji picked up. "Asuka! Are you alright?" he asked immediately.  
就在真嗣接起电话之前，电话突然响了。 “明日香！你没事吧？”他立即问道。

"No I'm not baka, but you know that already" she shot back. An audible gasp could be heard through the phone.  
“不，我不是笨蛋，但你已经知道了，”她反驳道。电话那头传来一声喘息声。

"Y-yes Asuka I know, I meant did anything happen to you… you haven't called me for several days" Shinji replied.  
“是、是的明日香，我知道，我的意思是你发生了什么事情吗……你已经好几天没有给我打电话了。”真嗣回答道。

"And you know why I haven't. But no, aside from your _betrayal_, nothing happened. I'm calling you so we can meet up in person, I want to discuss it all with you" Asuka explained.  
“你知道我为什么没有。但是不，除了你的背叛之外，什么也没发生。我打电话给你是为了我们可以亲自见面，我想和你讨论这一切。”明日香解释道。

"Yes of course!" he exclaimed. "I… I assume just the two of us, right? Your kids miss you, but they can wait a bit longer no problem"  
“是的当然！”他惊呼道。 “我……我假设只有我们两个人，对吧？你的孩子想你，但他们可以再等一会儿，没问题”

"And I miss them too, but yes, just the two of us. You know where. Bye" she answered before promptly hanging up.  
“我也想念他们，但是，是的，只有我们两个人。你知道在哪里。再见”她回答，然后立即挂断电话。

The redhead laid back on her bed, sighing; it was finally time to let this demon lay to rest.  
红发女郎躺在床上，叹了口气。终于到了让这个恶魔安息的时候了。

---

Her hair swept around her as she walked up the hill, the wind blowing stronger than usual. The redhead felt a pit in her stomach as she made her way towards the confrontation with her husband. After calling Shinji, Asuka informed Misato she was going to meet up and talk to him. The older woman simply nodded and gave her a brief hug, after which Asuka left the house. Thinking about her destination, she recalled how they would often come up here to enjoy the serenity, especially as almost no one came to this place. Whenever they needed to spend some important time together or have serious discussions, the sight of the mighty city they saved always kept them calm.  
她走上山坡时，头发披散在身上，风比平常刮得更大。当红发女郎走向与丈夫的对峙时，她感到胃部一痛。给真嗣打电话后，明日香告诉美里她要和他见面并谈谈。年长的女人只是点点头，给了她一个简短的拥抱，然后明日香就离开了家。想到目的地，她想起他们经常来这里享受宁静，尤其是这里几乎没有人来。每当他们需要一起度过一些重要的时光或进行认真的讨论时，看到他们所拯救的这座强大的城市总是让他们平静下来。

The woman saw a figure in the distance and recognised the familiar silhouette. She slowly made her way to the top of the hill and stood next to the man, once again admiring the view. Shinji quickly turned to face his wife and fought back the urge to embrace her fiercely and instead simply smiled at her. The redhead made no acknowledgement of his existence and just continued to look over the city with all its dazzling lights and activity; it was already quite late.  
女子看到远处有一个人影，认出了那熟悉的身影。她缓缓走到山顶，站在男人身边，再次欣赏着眼前的景色。真嗣迅速转过身来面对自己的妻子，强忍住想要猛烈拥抱她的冲动，只是对她微笑。红发没有承认他的存在，只是继续眺望着这座城市，那里有令人眼花缭乱的灯光和活动。已经很晚了。

"Asuka…" Shinji began, causing the young woman to finally shift her attention to him. "Whatever it is you have decided, I am willing to bear it. I will do anything for you"  
“明日香……”真嗣开口说道，年轻女子终于将注意力转移到了他身上。 “无论你决定什么，我都愿意承受。我会为你做任何事情。”

"Before we get to that" Asuka started, staring at him intently. "A while ago, just after we had defeated Seele, you had a discussion with me in the school classroom where you were worried about doing something to me out of anger?"  
“在我们开始之前”明日香开始说道，专注地盯着他。 “不久前，我们刚刚击败希儿之后，你在学校教室里和我讨论，担心会因为愤怒而对我做什么？”

Shinji's heart dropped as he recalled that discussion; he had intended that discussion to be a stepping stone to eventually telling Asuka the truth, but the coward had never taken the next step. "Yes, I remember"  
真嗣回忆起那次谈话，心就沉了下去。他本来打算把这次讨论作为最终告诉明日香真相的垫脚石，但这个胆小鬼从未采取下一步。 “是的，我记得”

"You asked me back then what I would do if you… raped me, all the while as a cruel irony, you had already performed such a deed" she continued.  
“你当时问我，如果你……强奸了我，我会怎么做，而残酷的讽刺是，你已经做了这样的事，”她继续说道。

Shinji just remained silent, not really sure what to say.  
真嗣只是沉默着，不知道该说什么。

"Do you remember how I answered?" Asuka asked firmly.  
“你还记得我是怎么回答的吗？”明日香坚定地问道。

"Y-you thought it was preposterous that I would do such a thing… but if it did actually happen you would kick my ass and forbid me to touch you for a year. But even so Asuka, it wasn't fair on you. It's not the same if it had already happened and-" he answered.  
“你、你认为我会做这样的事情是荒谬的……但如果真的发生了，你会踢我的屁股，一年内不许我碰你。但即便如此，明日香，这对你也不公平。如果事情已经发生了那就不一样了——”他回答道。

"What else did I say? You really pressed me on that question remember?" the redhead continued.  
“我还说了什么？你真的在这个问题上逼迫过我，还记得吗？”红发继续说道。

"You said it would be a horrible thing to do and you'd feel betrayed but that you would still stay with me, forgive me and… love me" he replied.  
“你说这样做是一件可怕的事情，你会感到被背叛，但你仍然会和我在一起，原谅我并且……爱我”他回答道。

The young woman continued to look at the boy expectantly.  
年轻女子继续满怀期待地看着男孩。

"And that we will deal with whatever comes along" he finished off.  
“我们将处理发生的任何事情”他最后说道。

"Can you imagine all the way back then I gave you carte blanche to do anything? I mean it wasn't an invitation to do horrible things to me just because I said I'd forgive you but don't you think that it was probably the EXACT FUCKING MOMENT you should have told me about the past?! Not fucking YEARS later?!" she ended, yelling.  
“你能想象当时我全权委托你做任何事情吗？我的意思是，这并不是因为我说过我会原谅你而邀请你对我做可怕的事情，但你不认为这是也许正是在他妈的那一刻，你应该告诉我过去的事？！不是他妈的几年后？！”她喊道，结束了。

Shinji's mouth open and shut as he had no retort to her question; she was totally right.  
真嗣的嘴张开又合上，因为他没有反驳她的问题。她是完全正确的。

"I asked you a question Shinji!" she demanded.  
“我问你问题了，慎二！”她问道。

"You're right Asuka. I should have… I wanted to tell you soon after but I chickened out, I… don't have any good reason for why I didn't tell you" he answered.  
“你说得对，明日香。我应该……我很快就想告诉你，但我退缩了，我……没有任何充分的理由为什么我没有告诉你”他回答道。

"Look I get it; it makes complete sense you didn't tell me the moment you knew I lost my memory, 'Oh hey Asuka, guess what? I raped you a few weeks back'! But it was not something you had the right to hide from me! You're always brave when you need to be, WHY weren't you _then_? I made it so easy for you!" she shot back in frustration.  
“听着，我明白了；当你知道我失去记忆时，你没有告诉我，这是完全有道理的，‘哦，嘿明日香，你猜怎么着？几周前我强奸了你’！但这不是你拥有的东西你在需要的时候总是很勇敢，为什么我不让你那么容易呢？”她沮丧地回击。

"BECAUSE I MADE A MISTAKE! I loved you so much, I didn't want to see you sad… I was stupid, I am stupid, really fucking stupid" he finally retorted.  
“因为我犯了一个错误！我太爱你了，我不想看到你伤心……我很蠢，我很蠢，真的他妈的很蠢”他最后反驳道。

Asuka relented at his response and took a deep breath. "You need to explain to me exactly what you did that night, every last detail. You need to own up to what you did, I need to hear it from your lips"  
听到他的回答，明日香松了口气，深吸了一口气。 “你需要向我准确地解释你那天晚上做了什么，每一个细节。你需要承认你所做的事情，我需要从你的嘴里听到它”

"B-but Asuka, do… do you really want to hear all that?" he replied, making sure he understood.  
“但、但是明日香，你……你真的想听这些吗？”他回答道，确保他明白。

"Yes, this is _not_ a request" she confirmed.  
“是的，这不是一个请求”她确认道。

The man sighed, trying to calm himself. It wasn't going to be easy to recount the events of that night. Shinji looked into his wife's eyes as he began to relive that night. "That night… I… well it started when I lost control of my emotions. I was in the middle of washing the dishes when I couldn't take your taunts anymore and I shoved you away. I approached you with a knife in my hand that I had been washing and wildly slashed at you with it, managing to cut you there" he explained, pointing to her abdomen. "At that point, you managed to kick the knife out of my hands so I… grabbed you by the throat and began to s-strangle you" he continued, pausing as he recalled his terrible violence. "A-asuka, are you sure you want to hear th-"  
男人叹了口气，试图让自己平静下来。回忆起那天晚上发生的事情并不容易。真嗣看着妻子的眼睛，开始回忆那天晚上的情景。 “那天晚上……我……好吧，事情是从我情绪失控开始的。我正在洗碗，我再也受不了你的嘲笑，我把你推开了。我手里拿着刀靠近你。”我当时正在洗澡，用它猛烈地砍你，成功地把你割到了那里。”他指着她的腹部解释道。 “就在那时，你设法把刀从我手中踢开，所以我……抓住你的喉咙，开始勒——勒死你”，他继续说道，在回忆起他可怕的暴力行为时停了下来。 “阿、明日香，你确定想听——”

"I did not ask you to stop!" she interrupted.  
“我没有叫你停下来！”她打断道。

Shinji couldn't help tears going down his face; he couldn't understand why she wanted to hear this painful memory. "Fortunately, it didn't last long as you kicked me and I released my grip on you but then I… went to grab you as you tried to escape and only managed to catch your shirt, which was ripped at this point. You fell over and your shirt was completely torn off, revealing your breasts…" Shinji recounted and paused again; the anguish of recalling his actions, the look of terror on Asuka's face was something he did not want to remember.  
真嗣忍不住流下了泪水。他不明白她为什么想听这段痛苦的回忆。 “还好，没持续太久，你踢了我一脚，我松开了对你的手，但当你试图逃跑时，我……去抓住你，只抓住了你的衬衫，此时衬衫已经撕破了。你摔倒了。”你的衬衫完全被撕掉了，露出了你的胸部……”真嗣回忆道，然后又停了下来；回想起自己的行为所带来的痛苦，明日香脸上的恐惧表情，都是他不想回忆的。

"It was then that I… I got on top of you and pinned you down. I p-punched you in the stomach so you would stop r-resisting and I then started to f-fondle your b-breasts roughly" Shinji continued, his voice choking. The man continued explaining all the events that transpired that night, his violence, his insults, him forcefully kissing her, touching her everywhere, her pleading, her resistance and ultimately the intercourse. By now he was sobbing; hearing himself say the words out loud, he couldn't help but be disgusted by every little bit he had done.  
“就在那时，我……我压在你身上，把你按倒在地。我对着你的肚子打了一拳，这样你就可以停止抵抗，然后我开始粗暴地爱抚你的乳房”真嗣继续说道，他的声音有些哽咽。男人继续解释那天晚上发生的所有事情，他的暴力，他的侮辱，他用力亲吻她，触摸她的各处，她的恳求，她的抵抗，以及最终的性交。这时他已经抽泣起来。听到自己大声说出这些话，他不禁对自己所做的每一点都感到厌恶。

At last Asuka spoke up. "That was awful Shinji, did you really think you could keep such a thing hidden from me forever? Even now, look how much torment you're in you baka! Tell me Shinji… after hearing it from you personally, it's almost unbelievable. Why… tell me, why did you do it?"  
明日香终于开口了。 “真是太糟糕了，真嗣，你真的认为你可以永远瞒着我吗？即使是现在，看看你在你的baka中承受了多少折磨！告诉我真嗣……从你亲口听到后，这几乎令人难以置信。为什么……告诉我，你为什么这么做？”

"I don't know why! There's no good reason why I did it Asuka. Superficially, I was angry at you because you were insulting me and treating me horribly, but how can that be a valid reason?" he answered, his voice cracking.  
“我不知道为什么！明日香，我这么做是没有充分理由的。表面上看，我对你很生气，因为你侮辱了我，对待我很糟糕，但这怎么能是一个正当的理由呢？”他回答道，声音沙哑。

"Enough, I don't care if the reasons weren't valid, just TELL ME WHY!" she shouted.  
“够了，我不在乎这些理由是否合理，只要告诉我为什么！”她喊道。

"Because I was sexually attracted to you, I wanted to have sex with you, I wanted to hold you down, make you feel powerless, make you feel like I did whenever you yelled at and insulted me. I wanted to hurt you!" he yelled back, expelling all his rage and disgust from that day.  
“因为我对你有性吸引力，我想和你发生性关系，我想压制你，让你感到无能为力，让你感觉就像每次你对我大喊大叫、侮辱我时我所做的那样。我想伤害你！”他吼了回去，将那天的愤怒和厌恶全部发泄出来。

"Finally! You're finally being honest with me! You finally found your balls you fucking asshole!" Asuka rebuked, raising her fist as if to strike.  
“终于！你终于对我说实话了！你终于找到你的蛋蛋了，你这个混蛋！”飞鸟斥责道，举起拳头，仿佛要出击。

"Urghh, I truly regret what I did that night! It was so wrong Asuka, it was so wrong!" he snapped.  
「呃呃，我真的很后悔那天晚上的行为！明日香真是太错了，太错了！」他厉声说道。

"I know you baka! I know exactly when you're lying or not, I already know you regret it. I remember all our discussions in the past… God, you… do you think I'm stupid? Regretting dumb things is what everyone does! You think I don't have any regrets either?! Stop behaving like a child!" the redhead shot back, stamping her foot.  
“我知道你笨蛋！我清楚地知道你什么时候在说谎，我已经知道你后悔了。我记得我们过去所有的讨论……上帝，你……你认为我很愚蠢吗？对愚蠢的事情感到后悔是什么？大家都这样啊！你以为我也没有遗憾吗？！”红发女郎猛地反击，跺着脚。

It finally dawned on Shinji what Asuka was doing. "You're right. I… accept that I made that terrible choice, I can't change what I did back then, I can only move forward. Asuka… there's nothing more I can say, I've told you everything… all I can do now is accept the consequences of my actions. I love you and I will do anything for you"  
真嗣终于明白明日香在做什么了。 “你是对的。我……接受我做出了那个可怕的选择，我无法改变我当时所做的事情，我只能继续前进。明日香……我没有什么可以说的了，我已经告诉你一切了……全部我现在能做的就是接受我的行为的后果，我爱你，我会为你做任何事情。”

"I will admit it was hard for me sort through my feelings, my memories, your recount of that night. I have a bitter taste in my mouth I can't get rid of" Asuka started. "But at the same time, it's not like I don't completely understand why you didn't tell me. Even _I_ thought for a moment that I wished you had continued to keep it a secret" she explained, sighing. "With all the memories, I also recalled every insult, punch, kick, taunt I inflicted on you – I am not proud of my actions, but I accept that I, with my pride and bitterness, went through with tormenting you daily. Shinji, I too regret many things, but even so… your crime that day was… unforgiveable"  
“我承认，我很难理清我的感受、我的记忆、你对那天晚上的叙述。我嘴里有一种苦涩的味道，无法摆脱”明日香开始说道。 “但同时，我也不是完全不明白你为什么不告诉我。就连我也曾想过，我希望你继续保守秘密。”她叹了口气解释道。 “连同所有的记忆，我还记得我对你施加的每一次侮辱、拳打、脚踢、嘲讽——我并不为自己的行为感到自豪，但我承认，我带着我的骄傲和痛苦，每天都在折磨你。” ，我也后悔了很多事情，但即便如此……你那天的罪行……也是不可饶恕的”

"Yes… I was angry and wanted revenge… but that was a line that should never be crossed" he agreed.  
“是的……我很生气，想要报复……但这是一条永远不应该跨越的界限，”他同意道。

"So it all comes down to this moment, how do we go forward from here?" she prompted.  
“所以一切都归结为这一刻，我们如何继续前进？”她提示道。

"I'm not going to tell you what the right thing to do is, I lost that right a long time ago. I want to spend the rest of my life together with you Asuka and I will act accordingly… but I will not force you down any path, I will not make you feel guilty or manipulate you. The choice is… yours alone" Shinji said at last. Every impulse in his body was screaming at him to take back what he said, to remind her of the kids, to make it impossible for her to leave but he held back; this was the final moment, the culmination of his stalling and of his terrible deeds.  
“我不会告诉你什么是正确的做法，我很久以前就失去了这个权利。我想和你一起度过余生，明日香，我会采取相应的行动……但我不会强迫无论你走哪条路，我都不会让你感到内疚或操纵你。选择权……是你自己的。”真嗣最后说道。他体内的每一种冲动都在尖叫着让他收回自己所说的话，让她想起孩子们，让她无法离开，但他忍住了；这是最后时刻，是他的拖延和他的可怕行为的顶峰。

The two stood there looking at each other, both thinking deeply. As the wind blew their hair about, time seemed to stand still and neither said a word.  
两人对视一眼，站在那里，都陷入了沉思。风吹乱了他们的头发，时间仿佛静止了，两人都没有说话。

After what seemed like an eternity, Asuka spoke up. "Ok Shinji… it's time for this to end. We can discuss the details later but here we part ways… farewell"  
仿佛过了很久很久，明日香才开口说道。 “好吧，真嗣……是时候结束了。我们可以稍后再讨论细节，但现在我们就分道扬镳了……再见”

Shinji felt an icy chill grip his heart, but he forced himself to stand still. "If… if that is what you've decided… then I accept the consequences of the decision I made back then" he said resolutely, not wanting Asuka to feel manipulated. "I will never stop loving you and I will always be there for you… farewell Asuka"  
真嗣感到一股冰冷的感觉袭上心头，但他强迫自己站稳。 “如果……如果这就是你的决定……那么我接受我当时所做决定的后果。”他坚决地说，不想让明日香感到被操纵。 “我永远不会停止爱你，我会永远在你身边……再见明日香”

At this, the redhead turned around and walked off without a word, leaving Shinji all alone. As soon as she disappeared from sight, the boy fell to his knees and wept bitterly as he realised he had lost the love of his life. _'This is it… it finally happened. After all we've been through, this is how it ends?'_  
说到这里，红发一言不发地转身走了，留下真嗣一个人。当她从视线中消失后，男孩跪倒在地，痛哭起来，因为他意识到自己失去了一生的挚爱。 '就是这样……它终于发生了。我们经历了那么多之后，就这样结束了吗？

He stared at the ground, tears running down his cheeks, rooted to the spot. The conversation kept playing in his mind over and over. Even at the end Asuka showed him such kindness, letting him have his say and explaining all her thoughts. He was free of that horrible burden, free to behave with Asuka exactly how he wanted, but at the cost of losing her.  
他盯着地面，泪水顺着脸颊流下来，在原地扎根。这段对话在他的脑海里一遍又一遍地浮现。即使到了最后，明日香也对他表现出了如此的善意，让他畅所欲言，并解释了她所有的想法。他摆脱了那种可怕的负担，可以自由地按照他想要的方式对待明日香，但代价是失去她。

Honestly, he wanted to run after her, to tell her not to leave him, but he was mature enough now to know that it wasn't right; this wasn't some small thing after all. Shinji pondered over the past few days being separated from his wife. He had first gone to Rei's house to pick up the kids before taking them to the Ryoji household. When he had explained that they weren't going to see their mum for a few days they both cried for a while. Shinji did his best not to join in with them as he needed to stay strong and the kids eventually calmed down. He reassured them that their mother wanted to be with them, but was currently too sick to take care of them. Of course, then the kids wanted to go back home to take care of their mother. In response, he hugged them and thanked them for their intentions but told them that they would only make it harder for her to get better. They finally relented and began to bother the older man instead.  
老实说，他想追上她，告诉她不要离开他，但他现在已经足够成熟了，知道这样做是不对的；这毕竟不是一件小事。真嗣回想起这几天与妻子分开的情况。他先去丽家接孩子们，然后带他们去了亮司家。当他解释说他们有几天不能见到妈妈时，他们都哭了一会儿。真嗣尽力不加入他们，因为他需要保持坚强，孩子们最终平静下来。他向他们保证，他们的母亲想和他们在一起，但目前病得太重，无法照顾他们。当然，孩子们想回家照顾妈妈。作为回应，他拥抱了他们，感谢他们的意图，但告诉他们，他们只会让她更难康复。他们终于心软了，开始骚扰老人。

After the kids had gone to bed, Shinji spoke to Kaji explaining in detail all that had happened and how he had finally confessed his sin to Asuka. The younger man described what he was feeling, how he was so unsure of what to do next, of how he should react should the news be the worst, about how ashamed he felt. Kaji sat there and listened to all of Shinji's admissions without judgement and encouraged him to be strong. The older man's only advice was to let Asuka make her own decision, but also reassured him that he would continue to be there for him no matter what. It had been hard to spend the next few days without the redhead by his side but the kids kept him occupied most of the time and it helped him to cope.  
孩子们上床睡觉后，真嗣向加持详细解释了所发生的一切，以及他最终如何向明日香忏悔自己的罪行。年轻人描述了他的感受，他如何不确定下一步该做什么，如果这个消息是最坏的消息他应该如何反应，他感到多么羞愧。梶坐在那里，不加评判地听着真嗣的所有坦白，并鼓励他要坚强。年长的男人唯一的建议是让明日香自己做决定，但也向他保证，无论如何，他都会继续在他身边。接下来的几天里，没有红发在他身边，他很难过，但孩子们让他大部分时间都有事可做，这帮助他应对。

Shinji came back to reality as he was starting to feel cold. He figured that it was probably time to get up now. After having been on his knees for a bit, he struggled getting upright. However, any effort to stand up was lost as something impacted against his buttocks heavily causing him to fall forward straight into the ground he had been staring at moments earlier.  
当真嗣开始感到寒冷时，他回到了现实。他想现在大概是时候起床了。跪了一会儿之后，他才勉强站起来。然而，他想要站起来的力气都没有了，因为有什么东西重重地撞在了他的臀部上，让他直接向前摔倒在了刚才还盯着的地上。

Utterly confused, the man quickly stood up rubbing his sore backside and turned around, his mouth wide open at what he saw.  
男人一头雾水，连忙站了起来，揉着酸痛的后背，转过身来，看到的景象张大了嘴。

"A-Asuka?" he asked in disbelief.  
“阿、明日香？”他难以置信地问道。

"The one and only! You'd think I'd go back on my word you retard?! I said I'd kick your ass and forbid you to touch me for a year. And that was a solid ass kick too if I do say so myself" she answered.  
“唯一的！你以为我会食言，你这个迟钝的人？！我说过我会踢你的屁股，一年内禁止你碰我。如果我我自己也这么说吧”她回答道。

"B-but, why are you here?" he asked, still unable to comprehend.  
「可是、但是，你为什么在这里？」他问道，仍然无法理解。

"How does it feel huh?! I wanted to fake my death to get back at you, but I'm pregnant so it wasn't exactly appropriate. Anyway! Don't you get it, you numbskull?" she asked, her voice sounding irritated.  
“感觉怎么样啊？！我想假死来报复你，但我怀孕了，所以不太合适。不管怎样！你还不明白吗，你这个笨蛋？”她问道，声音听起来有些恼怒。

"B-but I thought that you were… I don't understand" Shinji let out, his mind not registering what was happening.  
“但、但我以为你是……我不明白”真嗣脱口而出，他的大脑没有注意到发生了什么。

"Look Shinji, I'm sorry, I pretended to leave and snuck past behind you. Call me petty, but I thought you should have a taste of your own medicine" she answered.  
“你看真嗣，对不起，我假装离开，从你身后溜过去。你可以说我小气，但我觉得你应该尝尝自己的药。”她回答道。

"What about everything you said before?" he questioned.  
“那你之前说的那些话呢？”他问道。

"Except for the very end when I said farewell, it was all true Shinji. To be clear… I don't want to leave you, I also… want to spend the rest of my life with you. I… forgive you Shinji… dear" she explained.  
“除了最后我说再见之外，这一切都是真的真嗣。要明确的是……我不想离开你，我也……想和你一起度过余生。我……原谅你真嗣……亲爱的，”她解释道。

"You… forgive me? But I don't deser-" he started.  
“你……原谅我？但我不想——”他开口说道。

"Stop!" she interrupted. "You may not deserve it, but I choose to. I forgave you a long time ago remember? The Asuka in the past wasn't someone else or a clone, it was the same plain old Asuka. I made the decision back then and I trust that decision to this day. Hell, I wanted to forgive you the day you told me but I was just too stubborn to admit it"  
“停止！”她打断道。 “你也许不值得，但我选择这么做。我很久以前就原谅了你，还记得吗？过去的飞鸟不是别人，也不是克隆人，就是那个普通的老飞鸟。我当时就做出了决定，直到今天我仍然相信这个决定，天啊，在你告诉我的那天我就想原谅你，但我太固执了，不肯承认。”

"A-Asuka, are you sure? Are you telling the truth?" Shinji asked as he moved towards her.  
“明、明日香，你确定吗？你说的是真的吗？”真嗣一边朝她走去一边问道。

"Gosh, I shouldn't have pranked you like that, now you won't believe my earnest words. Listen hard Shinji, because I'm only going to say this once!" she started, before tears began falling down her cheek. "I love you, and that means I'm giving you a second chance or third chance or whatever the fuck you wanna call it. My feelings for you didn't disappear, I chose you, no one else. I know you're not perfect, but love isn't about loving someone perfect, that's what your friend Aria said remember? I too accept the consequences of my actions, and I choose to forgive you and spend my life with you!"  
“天哪，我不应该这样恶作剧，现在你不会相信我的真心话了。认真听真嗣，因为我只会说一次！”她吃了一惊，泪水从她的脸颊上流下来。 “我爱你，这意味着我给你第二次机会或第三次机会，或者无论你想怎么称呼它。我对你的感情并没有消失，我选择了你，没有其他人。我知道你是不完美，但爱不是爱一个完美的人，这就是你的朋友阿丽亚所说的，记得吗？我也接受我行为的后果，我选择原谅你并与你共度一生！”

At once, Shinji held onto his wife tight, not wanting to let go, and cried with pain and joy. The redhead returned the embrace just as fierce, showing her husband and lover her sincerity. The man couldn't help his overwhelming emotions as he cried and hugged her. He had finally admitted everything and Asuka forgave him and wanted to stay with him; it was all he could ever ask for.  
真嗣立刻紧紧地抱住妻子，不愿放开，痛并快乐着地哭了。红发女郎也同样激烈地回应了拥抱，向她的丈夫和情人展示了她的诚意。男人无法抑制自己的情绪，哭着抱住了她。他终于承认了一切，明日香原谅了他并想和他在一起。这是他所能要求的一切。

"I remember… everything you said during that horrifying fight with the 15th angel" the redhead said softly in Shinji's ear. "You told me 'Fuck it all Asuka, just forget the insanity that happened. You're the one I want, now and forever, and no one else. I promise we can start over after this, we will get through this together,' and indeed Shinji, I feel the same. I won't hold this past against you, I want you to be free with me, to care and love for me without guilt, to get upset and angry with me without fear. I just want _you_ Shinji"  
“我记得……你在与第十五天使那场可怕的战斗中所说的一切。”红发在真嗣耳边轻声说道。 “你告诉我‘去他的这一切，明日香，忘记发生过的疯狂吧。你是我想要的人，从现在到永远，没有其他人。我保证我们可以在这之后重新开始，我们会一起度过这一切， ” 事实上，真嗣，我也有同样的感觉，我不会因为过去的事情而反对你，我希望你能自由地和我在一起，毫无愧疚地关心和爱我，毫无恐惧地对我感到不安和愤怒。真嗣想要你”

Shinji pulled away and looked into his wife's eyes, his expression saying more than any words could before he closed the distance between them and gave a tender kiss. The two of them stayed like that for a while, blissfully unaware of their surroundings. After parting, they walked over to view the city once again, an ever-present reminder of the trials they endured and overcame. There were sure to be future tribulations, but Shinji felt confident that they would get through them together. With that, they turned around to return to their home.  
真嗣退开，看着妻子的眼睛，他的表情比任何言语都更能说明一切，然后拉近了他们之间的距离，温柔地吻了吻。两人就这样呆了一会儿，对周围的环境一无所知。分别后，他们再次走过去观看这座城市，这时刻提醒着他们所经历和克服的考验。未来肯定会有磨难，但真嗣有信心他们能够一起渡过难关。说完，他们转身就回了自己的家。

The two of them, Shinji and Asuka, walked hand in hand, looking forward, an end to the past, the beginning of a new future.  
真嗣和明日香两人，手牵着手，展望未来，过去的结束，新的未来的开始。

**FINISH (FOR SURE THIS TIME)  
完成（这次肯定是）**

Post-Epilogue: 尾声后：

Somewhere along the journey back, the man couldn't hold back any longer; the redhead completely ignorant of the stupidity about to unfold.  
回来的路上，男人再也忍不住了，红发女郎完全不知道即将发生的愚蠢事情。

"By the way Asuka…" he started.  
“顺便说一句，明日香……”他开始说道。

"Mm?" she responded. “毫米？”她回答道。

"There's one last _little_ thing I haven't been totally honest about" he continued.  
“还有最后一件小事我还没有完全诚实，”他继续说道。

"Really?" she asked, raising her eyebrow curiously.  
“真的吗？”她好奇地扬起眉毛问道。

"It's about… the waffles" he remarked.  
“这是关于……华夫饼”他说。

This time, the woman stopped in her tracks. "What?" was all she said, but her tone conveyed utter disgust.  
这一次，女人停下了脚步。 “什么？”她只是这么说，但她的语气却透着极度的厌恶。

Shinji couldn't help a smirk as he described in minute detail exactly what ingredients made up the waffles; the redhead's face was far from amused as he finished the explanation.  
当真嗣详细描述华夫饼的成分时，他忍不住笑了。红发人解释完后，脸色一点也没有好笑。

"You know Shinji, that was something I would have been content never remembering" Asuka remarked.  
“你知道真嗣，那是我永远不会记得的事情，”明日香说道。

"Hey, you said you wanted to know the truth about _everything_" he retorted, grinning.  
“嘿，你说你想知道一切的真相”他笑着反驳道。

"Your smug face only convinces me more that you need to be punished, I guess we're having waffles with Misato tonight" she said flatly.  
“你得意的表情只会让我更加相信你需要受到惩罚，我想我们今晚要和美里一起吃华夫饼”她平淡地说。

At her tone of voice, Shinji felt absolute terror, not fully understanding where this was going. "Y-you want to make the waffles? B-but why would you want me to do that to you aga-"  
听到她的语气，真嗣感到了绝对的恐惧，完全不明白这是怎么回事。 “你、你想做华夫饼吗？但、但你为什么要我再对你做那个——”

"I think you're misunderstanding something _dear_" Asuka interrupted. "_Misato_ is going to help you"  
“我认为你误会了一些亲爱的事情，”明日香打断道。 “美里会帮你”

"Y-you can't be serious" he replied, backing away.  
“你——你不是认真的”他回答道，后退了一步。

"Who says I need your consent?" she rebuked, holding up a taser. "You have three seconds. You better run boy"  
“谁说我需要你的同意了？”她举起泰瑟枪斥责道。 “你有三秒钟的时间。你最好跑，孩子”

Shinji turned tail and ran for his life, needing to get as far away as possible. As he ran through the streets, twisting and turning, tripping and bumping into people, sweat poured down his face and his lungs felt like they were about to burst.  
真嗣转身逃命，需要逃得尽可能远。他在街上跑来跑去，扭来扭去，绊倒，撞到人，汗水从脸上流下来，肺部感觉快要破裂了。

The man came to a grinding halt when he saw her in front of him. _'Oh Shit-'_ he thought before he fell to the ground from the electricity running through his body. His pain and paralysis were short lived as he felt something hit the back of his head and his world went dark.  
当看到她出现在自己面前时，男人猛地停了下来。 “哦该死——”他在因电流流过身体倒在地上之前这样想。他的疼痛和瘫痪是短暂的，因为他感觉有什么东西击中了他的后脑勺，他的世界变得一片黑暗。

---

Opening his eyes groggily, the man found it difficult to breathe. He tried to move his hands to his face but was unable to as they were bound. Shinji couldn't help panicking as he struggled to breathe and found himself unable to get up or move; he soon realised he was bound to a chair. The man looked around and noticed a familiar figure next to him also bound to a chair.  
男人迷迷糊糊地睁开眼睛，呼吸困难。他试图将双手移至脸上，但由于双手被束缚而无法移动。真嗣不禁惊慌失措，他呼吸困难，发现自己无法起身或移动。他很快意识到自己被绑在椅子上。男人环顾四周，发现旁边有一个熟悉的身影，也被绑在椅子上。

He tried to call out but his voice was muffled; something was covering his mouth. As the other figure stirred, Shinji brought his attention back to it and realised… it was Misato! She had a ball gag tied to her face and he suspected that must be exactly what was covering his mouth too. The purple haired woman opened her eyes and reacted much the same way Shinji did, but she had little time to absorb what was going on as they heard a sound.  
他试图喊叫，但声音低沉；有什么东西捂住了他的嘴。随着另一个人影的动静，真嗣将注意力回过神来，发现……那是美里！她的脸上绑着一个球形口塞，他怀疑这也一定是捂住他嘴的东西。紫发女子睁开了眼睛，反应和真嗣差不多，但还没来得及反应过来，就听到了声音。

Looking towards the source of the noise they saw a young redheaded woman coming to them. As the light revealed Asuka carrying a whole bunch of "utensils," the two bound figures began struggling and trying to beg; only muffled grunts being heard.  
顺着声音的来源看去，只见一名红发少女朝他们这边走来。当光线显示明日香背着一大堆“器皿”时，两个被束缚的人开始挣扎并试图乞讨；只听到低沉的咕哝声。

"Don't worry you two… this won't take long" Asuka said wickedly.  
“你们两个别担心……这不会花太长时间的。”明日香邪恶地说。

Making her way to Shinji, the younger woman put on some gloves. "First… pants down Shinji… and then the fun begins…" she remarked, scissors in one hand.  
在走向真嗣的路上，这位年轻女子戴上了手套。 “首先……给真嗣脱裤子……然后有趣的事情就开始了……”她一手拿着剪刀说道。

The young man's eyes went wide in horror as he struggled with all his might but to no avail. The redhead was upon him, pulling his pants down, _'Nooooooooooo!'_  
青年双眼惊恐地睁大，用尽全身力气挣扎，却无济于事。红发女郎扑到他身上，把他的裤子拉下来，“不啊啊啊啊啊！”

---

A sweat stained man woke up, his heart just about ready to burst out of his chest and he looked around frantically. Recognising the familiar bedroom and the fact that he was in bed, breathing properly, not bound or gagged, he calmed down. He looked to his side and saw Asuka sleeping peacefully, not a clue in the world as to what was going on.  
一个浑身是汗的男人醒了过来，他的心脏都快要跳出胸膛了，他疯狂地环顾四周。认出那间熟悉的卧室，以及他躺在床上、呼吸正常、没有被束缚或堵嘴的事实，他平静下来。他看向身边，看到明日香睡得很安详，完全不知道发生了什么。

'_Just a dream… thank God. I don't think Asuka ever needs to know the truth about those waffles'_ he thought before drifting off to sleep again.  
“只是一个梦……感谢上帝。我认为明日香不需要知道那些华夫饼的真相。”他想道，然后再次入睡。

**DONE**

Author's Notes: I apologise for that haha, I just couldn't resist! And now for some notes about the chapters, either comments on changes or explanations of parts of the story some may not have understood – there's no more story though. You can stop or skip past to the last section if you're not interested.  
作者注：我为此道歉，哈哈，我实在无法抗拒！现在关于章节的一些注释，要么是对变化的评论，要么是对故事部分内容的解释，有些人可能不理解——但没有更多的故事了。如果您不感兴趣，可以停止或跳到最后一部分。

Story Chapter Notes 故事章节注释

Chapter 1: 第1章：

_Originally Shinji went straight into raping Asuka after he snapped, but I felt that it wasn't drastic enough nor would that allow Asuka to be overpowered, so I changed it to first have a bit of a crazy episode of Shinji trying to 'kill' her, which led to a more realistic depiction.  
本来真嗣在明日香发脾气后就直接强奸了他，但我觉得这不够激烈，也不能让明日香被制服，所以我把它改为先有一段真嗣试图“杀死”的疯狂情节她，这导致了更真实的描述。_

_I originally had the second part of this chapter end with Asuka giving Shinji oral sex. But this really didn't make sense to occur, so I replaced it with a more appropriate scene.  
我原本在本章的第二部分以明日香给真嗣口交作为结尾。但这确实没有意义，所以我用更合适的场景代替了它。_

Chapter 2: 第2章：

_The only real change here from the original chapter 2 was the reason/method used for Asuka to eventually have sex with Shinji during the lunch break. Originally, he just forced her to come, but I thought it didn't make sense for Asuka not to fight back – so I replaced it with him leading her down with the premise of telling her something.  
与最初的第 2 章相比，唯一真正的变化是明日香最终在午休期间与真嗣发生性关系的原因/方法。本来他只是强迫她来，但我觉得明日香不反击是没有意义的——所以我把它改为他在告诉她一些事情的前提下带她下来。_

Chapter 3: 第3章：

"**But first things first, you are still a US citizen, where the age of consent is 16. Even though you are under Japanese jurisdiction currently, America might not be happy about this, so technically you are having underage sex. Depending on who the other person is, this could be a legal problem"** Ritsuko elaborated.  
“但首先，你仍然是美国公民，同意年龄是 16 岁。即使你目前处于日本管辖之下，美国也可能对此不高兴，所以从技术上讲，你发生了未成年性行为。这取决于谁其他人则认为，这可能是一个法律问题。”Ritsuko 解释道。

_Originally, I had just said they were having underage sex, but quite a number of reviewers pointed out that the age of consent in Japan is quite low and so it wasn't underage. I instead decided to add some vague legal conundrum because of Asuka's US citizenship since most states in the US seem to have an age of consent of 16. I'm hoping this is more realistic.  
本来我只是说他们是未成年性行为，但不少评论指出日本的同意年龄很低，所以并不是未成年。相反，由于 Asuka 是美国公民，我决定添加一些模糊的法律难题，因为美国大多数州的同意年龄似乎为 16 岁。我希望这更现实。_

Chapter 4: 第 4 章：

"You said beforehand, I was a bitch and it's true so get used to it! It certainly doesn't make us a perfect couple alright?! Just get the fuck away from me! **Ich Liebe Dich**!" Asuka yelled.  
“你之前说过，我是个婊子，这是事实，所以要习惯它！这肯定不会让我们成为完美的情侣好吗？！他妈的离我远点！Ich Liebe Dich！”明日香喊道。

_She says 'I love you' in German because she finally realises why everything hurts so much, why his words hurt, why him raping her was even more of a betrayal, why her forcefully separating each other hurts. She doesn't want Shinji to have this effect on her so she's trying to stop the relationship progressing.  
她用德语说“我爱你”，因为她终于明白了为什么一切都那么痛，为什么他的话语如此痛，为什么他强奸她更是一种背叛，为什么她强行分开彼此如此痛。她不希望真嗣对她产生这种影响，所以她试图阻止这段关系的发展。_

Chapter 5: 第5章：

**Alone in a room, a boy with glasses was in front of a computer. A flurry of key presses could be heard as the teenage boy typed furiously on a keyboard, trying to get some information. The day's events had left him curious as to what had happened at NERV; he didn't get a chance to see the angel and he also wanted to see if there was anything he could find out about the pilots. Adrenalin pumped through the bespectacled boy's veins as he knew making any mistakes could be disastrous. After retrieving the information he wanted, he quickly removed all traces of himself before severing the connection.  
一个房间里，一个戴着眼镜的男孩独自坐在电脑前。十几岁的男孩在键盘上疯狂地打字，试图获取一些信息，可以听到一连串的按键声。那天发生的事情让他很好奇NERV发生了什么；他没有机会见到天使，他也想看看是否能找到关于飞行员的任何信息。戴眼镜的男孩的血管里充满了肾上腺素，因为他知道犯任何错误都可能造成灾难性的后果。拿到自己想要的信息后，他迅速清除了自己的所有痕迹，然后切断了联系。**

_If you didn't figure it out, this is Kensuke finding out about the angel fight with the 15__th_ _angel._  
如果你没明白的话，这是健介发现了与第十五天使的天使之战。

Chapter 6: 第6章：

**"Well, I decided to contact a 'friend' I have at NERV over a secure connection to check out if there was anything unusual reported about you two. I also asked to view the angel battle to see if anything happened to you guys, after which I watched the video recordings.** In actual fact I came here because I wanted to see if you were both ok, especially considering what I had seen" Kensuke answered.  
“好吧，我决定通过安全连接联系我在NERV的一位‘朋友’，看看你们两个有没有什么异常的报道。我还要求观看天使之战，看看你们有没有发生什么事情，之后事实上我来这里是因为我想看看你们俩是否还好，特别是考虑到我所看到的。”健介回答道。

_I originally had Kensuke hack into NERV but a reviewer mentioned how unlikely that was for Kensuke to be able to achieve such a feat and I agreed, so I replaced it with secret communication with a NERV employee instead.  
我最初让 Kensuke 侵入 NERV，但一位评论者提到 Kensuke 不太可能实现这样的壮举，我同意了，所以我用与 NERV 员工的秘密通信来代替它。_

_The only real difference in this chapter from the original was the added scene of Misato slapping him and informing him of a prison sentence. I felt that Shinji didn't receive enough of a punishment for what he did to Asuka and this somewhat rectifies that.  
这一章与原作的唯一真正区别是增加了美里扇他耳光并通知他入狱的场景。我觉得真嗣没有因为他对明日香所做的事情而受到足够的惩罚，这在一定程度上纠正了这一点。_

Chapter 7: 第7章：

_This chapter was actually a fanservice chapter. At the time I was writing this story for the first time, I had some avid readers that made all sorts of demands but also faithfully read through the chapters and gave reviews. As a reward I wrote this chapter for the readers and not to really progress the story. This chapter could basically be removed and the story remain intact. Although because of this, I wrote the famous waffle scene so I guess something interesting came of it.  
这一章其实是粉丝服务的一章。当我第一次写这个故事时，我有一些狂热的读者，他们提出了各种各样的要求，但也忠实地阅读了章节并给出了评论。作为奖励，我为读者写了这一章，而不是为了真正推进故事。这章基本上可以删掉，故事情节保持原样。虽然正因为如此，我写了著名的华夫饼场景，所以我想它会产生一些有趣的东西。_

Chapter 8: 第8章：

_This is practically a completely different chapter from the original one. Instead of him having spent weeks with Asuka in a relationship, he spent weeks in jail. I added a brief summary of his time there as well as the eventual meeting with Asuka and Misato when they release him. Plus the natural extension of his friends asking about his time there when he gets back to school. The day after he returns from prison where Asuka gives him his 'return present' was also added. I removed the brief sex scene after Asuka saves Shinji from drowning as it really seemed out of place and impractical. I removed the scene of Shinji hiding in the female changing room as it was pointless and made less sense without the sex scene. I also removed the scene where one of the boys that pushed Shinji into the pool gives Asuka some shit and Shinji defends her, it just seemed really silly.  
这实际上是与原始章节完全不同的章节。他没有和明日香一起度过几周的恋爱关系，而是在监狱里呆了几周。我添加了他在那里的时间的简短摘要，以及当明日香和美里释放他时最终与他们会面的情况。再加上当他回到学校时，他的朋友们自然会询问他在那里的时光。还添加了他从监狱回来后的第二天，明日香送给他的“回礼”。在明日香救掉溺水的真嗣后，我删除了简短的性爱场景，因为它看起来确实不合时宜且不切实际。我删除了真嗣躲在女更衣室里的场景，因为如果没有性爱场景，这毫无意义，也就没有意义。我还删除了其中一个将真嗣推入泳池的男孩给明日香一些粪便而真嗣为她辩护的场景，这看起来真的很愚蠢。_

Chapter 9: 第9章：

While Shinji was lost in thought, **a ragged man came up to where he was sitting. It would seem the man hadn't shaved for a while as his face was all covered in hair. The stranger had a sad look about him, his features indistinguishable in the darkness of the night.**  
就在真嗣陷入沉思的时候，一个衣衫褴褛的男人走到了他坐的地方。男人似乎有一段时间没有刮胡子了，满脸都是毛发。陌生人面容悲伤，他的面容在夜色中难以辨认。

_You later on find out this man is actually Kaji in disguise as he doesn't want to reveal himself yet.  
后来你发现这个男人实际上是乔装的加持，因为他还不想暴露自己。_

Chapter 10: 第10章：

Shinji felt relief wash over him as he saw the redhead with her back turned towards him next to the counter and he quickly went up to her, grabbed her shoulders and turned her around.  
当真嗣看到柜台旁边背对着他的红发女郎时，他感到如释重负，他迅速走到她身边，抓住她的肩膀，将她转了过来。

**"Hey Asu-" he started, before stopping when he noticed the shocked expression on the girl's face.  
“嘿阿苏——”他开口说道，但当他注意到女孩脸上震惊的表情时停了下来。**

**"I'm very sorry" he said bowing to her, "I thought you were someone else, I'm sorry"  
“非常抱歉，”他向她鞠躬，“我以为你是别人，对不起。”**

_This is the new character Aria, but you don't meet her properly till Chapter 14.  
这是新角色 Aria，但直到第 14 章你才能正式见到她。_

Chapter 11 & 12: 第 11 章和第 12 章：

_There's not much to say about these chapters, they're pretty straightforward.  
这几章没什么好说的，很简单。_

Chapter 13: 第13章：

The older man allowed a small smile to form on his usually cold expression. "It has come to my attention that the relationship between you and the second child has ended due to her loss of memory" he commented.  
年长的男人一向冷漠的表情上露出一丝微笑。 “我注意到，你和老二之间的关系已经结束，因为她失去了记忆。”他评论道。

"That is correct sir" Shinji responded, wondering how he had found out.  
“是的，先生。”真嗣回答道，想知道他是怎么发现的。

**"However, your sync ratios are still high at the moment and I have decided on a course of action that should prove to be beneficial" the Commander continued.  
“然而，目前你们的同步率仍然很高，我已经决定了一个应该被证明是有益的行动方针，”指挥官继续说道。**

"I'm listening" Shinji replied.  
“我在听。”真嗣回答道。

_This is where the Commander advises Shinji to make Asuka jealous.  
在这里，指挥官建议真嗣让明日香嫉妒。_

Though he knew she had warmed up to him a bit, this was only due to a little more courage and confidence and therefore less of the wimpy Shinji she disliked. Other than that, she still behaved as usual and any effort to crack her defences were met with equal force. **Reaching this conclusion and additionally considering the advice he was given, Shinji decided to take on a different and risky approach which would hopefully start tomorrow.**  
虽然他知道她对他有了一些好感，但这只是因为多了一点勇气和自信，因此也少了她不喜欢的懦弱的真嗣。除此之外，她的表现还是一如既往，任何想要破解她防御的努力都会受到同样的力量。得出这个结论并考虑到他得到的建议后，真嗣决定采取一种不同的、冒险的方法，希望从明天开始。

_This is referring to Shinji beginning his plan to make Asuka jealous.  
这是指真嗣开始了他让明日香嫉妒的计划。_

Chapter 14: 第14章：

"Yes, I play the cello" he answered. "Why do you ask?"  
“是的，我拉大提琴”他回答。 “你为什么要问？”

**"Because I think music is good. Music brings joy and revitalises the soul. I think that music is the greatest achievement of human culture.** I'd love to hear you play one day" she replied.  
“因为我认为音乐是好的。音乐带来欢乐，重振灵魂。我认为音乐是人类文化最伟大的成就。我很高兴有一天能听到你演奏。”她回答道。

_Hint number one that Aria is an angel. This is what Kaworu says to Shinji when they first meet in NGE.  
第一提示：阿丽亚是天使。这是薰在 NGE 第一次见面时对真嗣说的话。_

Aria was certainly a great girl; Shinji couldn't deny he liked her cheerful attitude and she was beautiful. **It also seemed that she was fond of him, which made it perfect.**  
阿丽亚无疑是一个很棒的女孩。真嗣无法否认他喜欢她开朗的态度，而且她很漂亮。看来她也喜欢他，这就完美了。

_Perfect to use as a girl to make Asuka jealous with.  
非常适合用作让明日香嫉妒的女孩。_

"…**However, there are many methods to achieve this and for a case such as Asuka, we might have to use the more extreme ones"** he said with a glint in his eye.  
“……不过，实现这一目标的方法有很多种，对于明日香这样的情况，我们可能不得不使用更极端的方法。”他眼中闪烁着光芒说道。

"I'm open to all suggestions" Shinji replied.  
“我愿意接受所有建议”真嗣回答道。

"Then listen carefully…" Kaji started.  
“那你仔细听……”加治开口道。

_This is Kaji informing Shinji about a plan to fake his death.  
这是梶告诉真嗣一个假死的计划。_

"You know we can't do this! I don't love you, so just stop it already" Anna objected.  
“你知道我们不能这样做！我不爱你，所以就停止吧”安娜反对。

**"Enough Anna! Do I have to die for you to realise your feelings for me?" Richard refuted.  
“够了，安娜！我必须死才能让你体会到你对我的感情吗？”理查德反驳道。**

_This soap opera is the only hint about what Kaji's plan was.  
这部肥皂剧是关于加持计划的唯一暗示。_

With that, the two eva pilots sat down at the dining table, eating their late-night meal. **Shinji looked at Asuka warily; sometimes the situation just seemed so hopeless, many times he thought that perhaps he should just give up on her. It's not like she was the only girl in the world… maybe in time he would be able to fall in love again with someone else. Having finished her meal, Asuka got up and left the table without a word, leaving Shinji alone. He heard the door close and he began to sob quietly, the toll of everything weighing down on him.**  
说完，两名EVA飞行员就坐到了餐桌前，吃着夜宵。真嗣警惕地看着明日香。有时情况看起来是如此绝望，很多时候他想也许他应该放弃她。她并不是世界上唯一的女孩……也许有一天，他能够再次爱上别人。吃完饭后，明日香起身离开餐桌，留下真嗣一人。他听到门关上的声音，开始小声抽泣，所有的事情都压在他身上。

_Shinji is definitely feeling like shit, especially if he has to pretend to go out with a girl to get Asuka jealous. This is doubly used to throw the readers off, making them think that he might give up on Asuka.  
真嗣肯定感觉很糟糕，尤其是如果他必须假装和一个女孩出去让明日香嫉妒的话。这双重地让读者感到困惑，让他们认为他可能会放弃明日香。_

Chapter 15: 第15章：

The boy couldn't afford to make Asuka angry and so he forced himself up and out of the bed. He walked unsteadily to the door, his nausea improving slightly. **His injured hand cramped slightly but it had gone as quickly as it came.**  
男孩不能让明日香生气，所以他强迫自己从床上爬起来。他摇摇晃晃地走到门口，恶心感稍稍好转。他受伤的手微微抽筋，但来得快，去得也快。

_Hint number 1 that there's an issue with his hand injury.  
第一个提示是他的手部受伤了。_

He pulled up the redhead. "You ok Asu-… Aria?" he asked.  
他拉起红发女郎。 “你还好吗阿苏……阿莉亚？”他问。

The small girl giggled as Shinji helped her stand, **though Shinji noticed she didn't seem too affected by the impact**. "I'm ok Shinji, you should go help Asuka" Aria suggested.  
当真嗣帮助她站起来时，小女孩咯咯地笑起来，尽管真嗣注意到她似乎并没有受到撞击的太大影响。 “我没事，真嗣，你应该去帮助明日香。”阿丽亚提议道。

_Hint number 2 that Aria is an angel, she erected her AT-Field to prevent her taking damage.  
提示 2，Aria 是天使，她竖立了 AT 场以防止受到伤害。_

Shinji was still nursing his poor cheek; he had almost passed out from the slap too. **Furthermore, his injured hand was starting to hurt again for some reason.**  
真嗣仍在抚摸着他那可怜的脸颊。他也差点被这一巴掌打昏过去。而且，他受伤的手不知为何又开始疼痛了。

_Hint number 2 that there's an issue with his hand injury.  
第二个提示是他的手受伤了。_

Shinji paused to think about it, maybe he should do as Touji suggested. It wasn't that bad an idea; she was a nice girl and it was pretty obvious she showed some interest in him. **Maybe she was exactly what he needed.**  
真嗣停下来想了想，也许他应该按照东次的建议去做。这是一个不错的主意。她是一个好女孩，很明显她对他表现出了一些兴趣。也许她正是他所需要的。

_This is Shinji confirming in his head that he can use Aria to make Asuka jealous.  
这是真嗣在心里确认他可以利用阿莉亚让明日香嫉妒。_

Asuka couldn't understand why seeing Aria kiss him pissed her off. "Who would have thought you would go after easy girls Shinji?" she said viciously.  
明日香不明白为什么看到亚莉亚亲吻他会让她生气。 “谁会想到你会去追求简单的女孩真嗣呢？”她恶狠狠地说。

Once again, Shinji made no response to indicate he had heard the female eva pilot. **Though inside he was boiling with rage and not just because she had insulted Aria.**  
真嗣再一次没有做出任何回应，表明他听到了女EVA飞行员的声音。但他内心却怒火中烧，而不仅仅是因为她侮辱了阿丽亚。

_Shinji is enraged because he is only doing this precisely because he's going after Asuka, arguably one of the most difficult girls to go after.  
真嗣很生气，因为他这样做只是因为他在追求明日香，可以说是最难追求的女孩之一。_

Shinji pondered Asuka's unusual behaviour today and wondered if it had anything to do with Aria. **Then he smiled upon realising what was happening.**  
真嗣思考着明日香今天的反常行为，不知道这是否与亚莉亚有关。然后他意识到发生了什么后笑了。

_Shinji is supposing Asuka is actually getting jealous.  
真嗣认为明日香实际上是在嫉妒。_

"One more thing… something happened at NERV" Ritsuko recalled.  
“还有一件事……NERV 发生了一些事情”Ritsuko 回忆道。

"What happened?" he asked.  
“发生了什么？”他问。

"**We momentarily detected an AT-field this morning. It was too small and too short to determine where, but we know it was in Tokyo-3.** Did you happen to notice anything at all?" the doctor explained.  
“今天早上我们暂时检测到了一个 AT 场。它太小而且太短，无法确定在哪里，但我们知道它在第三东京。你碰巧注意到什么了吗？”医生解释道。

_Hint Number 3 that Aria is an angel, this is tying back to the earlier event when they hit Aria and she was unaffected.  
提示 3，阿丽亚是天使，这与之前的事件有关，当时他们袭击了阿丽亚，而她没有受到影响。_

Rei was leaving school when someone approached her.  
当丽离开学校时，有人走近她。

**"You're the first child aren't you, Rei Ayanami?" the person asked.  
「绫波丽，你是第一个孩子吧？」那人问道。**

**Rei looked at the person, unable to recognise them.  
雷看着这个人，有些认不出他们来了。**

**"You're the same as I am" the person continued.  
“你和我一样。”那人继续说道。**

**"Who are you?" Rei asked.  
“你是谁？”雷问道。**

**The person just smiled. 那人只是微笑。**

_Hint number 4 that Aria is an angel. This is the interaction between Kaworu and Rei in NGE when he first sees her. You don't know it's Aria per se, but the only person Rei wouldn't recognise is Aria because Rei was absent the day before.  
提示 4：阿丽亚是天使。这是NGE里薰和丽第一次见到她时的互动。你不知道这是 Aria 本身，但 Rei 唯一不认识的人是 Aria，因为 Rei 前一天缺席。_

Chapter 16: 第16章：

"…**Fourth child, Suzuhara Touji. He is in perfect health. His eva Unit 03 has been fully repaired and all angel contaminants removed.** Latest sync ratio unknown as he has resigned from piloting, however it is believed he would achieve a sync ratio of 40…"  
“……第四个孩子，铃原东司。他健康状况良好。他的 eva Unit 03 已完全修复，所有天使污染物均已清除。最新的同步比未知，因为他已辞去飞行员职务，但相信他将达到40……”

_Foreshadowing that Touji will pilot.  
预示着东司将进行试航。_

However, his worry and concern were still there; **Shinji had noticed her drop in sync ratio and he was wondering if it was all a good idea after all. He silently prayed for the strength to continue on.**  
但他的担心和担忧依然存在；真嗣注意到她的同步率下降了，他想知道这到底是不是一个好主意。他默默祈祷，祈求有力量继续前行。

_Shinji is having second thoughts about using Aria to make Asuka jealous.  
真嗣正在重新考虑是否要利用亚莉亚来让明日香嫉妒。_

For the first time, he saw Aria's face sadden. **"I don't have any parents…" she replied.**  
他第一次看到阿莉亚脸上露出悲伤的表情。 “我没有父母……”她回答道。

_Hint number 5 that Aria is an angel. She has no family.  
提示 5：阿丽亚是天使。她没有家人。_

The redhead lay on her bed sobbing uncontrollably. _'How did this happen?'_ she thought. Unable to come up with an answer, she just cried even more.  
红发女郎躺在床上，无法控制地抽泣。 '这怎么发生的？'她想。她想不出答案，只能哭得更厉害。

**"I…love him" she said out loud. "I love him, I can't believe it but I love him. I fell for him, Shinji…"  
“我……爱他”她大声说道。 “我爱他，我不敢相信，但我爱他。我爱上了他，真嗣……”**

The moonlight shone down on her, making her glistening tears sparkle and her red hair shine.  
月光洒落在她的身上，映得她晶莹的泪光，红发闪闪发亮。

_This is initially meant to throw off readers into thinking this is Asuka, but it's actually Aria.  
最初是为了让读者误以为这是明日香，但实际上是阿丽亚。_

Suddenly, her face became emotionless and she looked up at her ceiling blankly. The girl sat up, remembering her mission.  
突然，她的脸色变得毫无表情，茫然地抬头看着天花板。女孩坐了起来，想起了自己的使命。

**"Adam's call has become too strong to resist anymore, it is time"** she declared, moving off her bed.  
“亚当的呼唤已经变得太强烈，无法再抗拒，是时候了，”她宣布，从床上爬起来。

_Final hint that Aria is an angel. The only other redhead in this story is Asuka, and this girl can't be Asuka.  
最后暗示阿丽亚是天使。这个故事中唯一的红发女郎是明日香，而这个女孩不可能是明日香。_

Chapter 17: 第17章：

**"No, it's not true, it was** _**I**_ **who became her boyfriend to use her. Aria I must tell you that-" Shinji started.**  
“不，这不是真的，是我成为了她的男朋友来利用她。阿丽亚，我必须告诉你——”真嗣开始说道。

_Another giveaway before the big reveal that Shinji was trying to make Asuka jealous.  
在真嗣试图让明日香嫉妒的重大事件曝光之前，又一个泄露的消息。_

**Asuka, the reason this had all started, what was he going to say to her now? His plan had failed and there was no way he was going to do it again. He felt so horrible; he had been so angry at Aria for betraying him, but Aria had forgiven him for betraying her.  
明日香，这一切开始的原因，他现在要对她说什么？他的计划失败了，他不可能再这么做了。他感觉太可怕了；他对阿丽亚背叛他感到非常愤怒，但阿丽亚却原谅了他背叛她。**

_Final giveaway about Shinji's plan to make Asuka jealous.  
关于真嗣让明日香嫉妒的计划的最终揭秘。_

With this, Shinji continued on to the elevator. The boy pressed the button and waited for the lift to come up. _**'Why is it coming up? Didn't I use this same lift before?'**_ he thought.  
说完，真嗣继续往电梯走去。男孩按下按钮，等待电梯上来。 ‘为什么会出现？我以前不是也用过同样的电梯吗？他以为。

As the elevator door opened, he was met with the sight of the first child.  
电梯门一打开，他就看到了第一个孩子。

_Although it's probably obvious to the reader that Rei was down with them earlier and had neutralised Aria's AT-Field, Shinji doesn't know.  
虽然读者可能很明显丽早些时候已经打败了他们并压制了阿丽亚的 AT-Field，但真嗣并不知道。_

_Lastly, the only real difference in the rewrite of this chapter is that I added Shinji's explanation to Rei of him raping Asuka. I found it odd that Rei didn't find out, so I addressed that by adding this conversation.  
最后，本章重写中唯一真正的区别是我添加了真嗣对丽强奸明日香的解释。我发现丽没有发现很奇怪，所以我通过添加这段对话来解决这个问题。_

Chapter 18: 第18章：

"Hello this is Ryouji Kaji speaking" Kaji greeted.  
“大家好，我是梶良司”梶打招呼。

**"Yes, hello Kaji this is Shinji. I would like to tell you something before I go" Shinji started.  
“是的，你好，加持，我是真嗣。在我走之前，我想告诉你一些事情。”真嗣开始说道。**

**"Hey Shinji! What do you mean?" Kaji asked, confused.  
“嘿真嗣！你什么意思？”卡吉疑惑地问道。**

**"It's about Asuka…" “是关于明日香的事……”**

_Here the fraudulent death starts!  
欺诈死亡就此开始！_

Chapter 19 & 20: 第 19 章和第 20 章：

_There's not much to say about these chapters, they're pretty straightforward.  
这几章没什么好说的，很简单。_

Chapter 21: 第21章：

Stopping for a moment, Misato took in where she was to work out how close she was. **It would seem she was undecided about where she should go; the second place she needed to go to was closer, but she also promised Shinji and Asuka she would come to them as soon as possible.** She shook her head and went off in the direction of her and her children's apartment.  
美里停了一会儿，观察了她所在的位置，以确定距离有多近。她似乎还没有决定该去哪里；第二个要去的地方比较近，但她也向真嗣和明日香保证，她会尽快赶到他们那里。她摇摇头，朝她和孩子们的公寓方向走去。

_Misato was wondering if she should go get Rei first.  
美里在想要不要先去找丽。_

Upon Asuka's return, the trio started moving with Misato in the lead again. **At one point, they started to veer away from NERV and the two pilots were confused at Misato's directions; the two teens thought that perhaps maybe in her current state, the Major was confusing the way to NERV.**  
明日香回来后，三人再次开始移动，美里再次领先。有一次，他们开始偏离 NERV，两名飞行员对美里的指示感到困惑；两个少年心想，也许少校现在的状态，正在混淆通往NERV的道路。

_Shinji and Asuka don't yet realise Misato wants to get Rei as well.  
真嗣和明日香还没有意识到美里也想得到丽。_

The sound of several machine guns firing went off and a hail of bullets were shot in the direction of the three escapees. **In the final milliseconds before the bullets reached them, Misato moved behind the two children making sure to give them cover. She prayed that Shinji and Asuka would be safe, just before she received several bullets in the back and fell to the ground lifeless, covered in bullet wounds.** The two teens had run on and made it behind the building just in time before the next hail of bullets.  
几挺机枪开火的声音响起，弹雨向三名逃亡者的方向射来。在子弹到达他们之前的最后几毫秒，美里走到两个孩子身后，确保给他们提供掩护。她祈祷着真嗣和明日香能够平安，就在她背部中了几枪，浑身是枪伤倒在地上毫无生气的时候。两名青少年在下一场枪林弹雨之前及时跑到了大楼后面。

_I wanted to make a note of this part. This story has been edited several times and small changes added or removed, many coming as suggestions from readers. None of those tweaks really changed the core story though, they mostly made things more in character or flow better. However, Misato was originally supposed to die here. But after several mentions from readers about being sad for not having any further chapters with her, plus without her, the final chapter would be a lot more sombre, I begrudgingly added a Deus Ex Machina and she survives in the next chapter. I still kinda wonder if this was the right decision and how the last chapter would have been without her. As it stands, the only main character that ends up dying is just Gendo.  
我想把这部分记录下来。这个故事已被编辑多次，并添加或删除了一些小改动，其中许多改动来自读者的建议。不过，这些调整都没有真正改变核心故事，它们主要是让事情更有特色或更流畅。然而，美里原本是应该死在这里的。但在读者多次提到因为没有她的更多章节而感到难过，加上没有她，最后一章会更加阴沉之后，我不情愿地添加了一个杀出重围的机器，她在下一章中幸存下来。我仍然有点想知道这是否是正确的决定，如果没有她，最后一章会是什么样子。就目前而言，唯一最终死亡的主角只有源堂。_

Chapter 22: 第22章：

_N/A_

Chapter 23: 第23章：

The redhead refused to let out a moan and kept her body stoic and unmoving. As always, Asuka's breasts felt wonderful, soft and firm and they were a generous size. _**'I swear they seem bigger than last time'**_ Shinji thought to himself.  
红发不肯发出一声呻吟，身体保持着坚忍，一动不动。和往常一样，明日香的胸部感觉美妙、柔软、坚挺，而且尺寸很大。 “我发誓它们看起来比上次更大”真嗣心里想。

_Actually this breast 'competition' was quite silly in hindsight, but it's there for humour mostly. This is the first hint that Asuka is pregnant though.  
事实上，事后看来，这场乳房“竞赛”相当愚蠢，但主要是为了幽默。这是明日香怀孕的第一个迹象。_

"You better not forget to make breakfast or our lunches" Asuka remarked, standing up.  
“你最好不要忘记做早餐或我们的午餐”明日香站起来说道。

**As the girl took a step, she felt dizzy for a moment, almost causing her to trip over.** Immediately, Shinji had moved over to her. "Are you alright Asuka?" he asked, concerned.  
女孩刚迈出一步，就感觉一阵头晕，险些摔倒。真嗣立刻走到她身边。 “明日香你还好吗？”他关切地问道。

_Second hint Asuka is pregnant.  
第二个暗示明日香怀孕了。_

"You can just go to hell Ikari!" she shouted at him, turning around and walking off to Hikari.  
“碇你就见鬼去吧！”她对他喊道，转身朝光走去。

**Shinji usually wouldn't pay heed to her bad temper, but she looked like she was about to cry. Something was strange about her today; did something happen to upset her? Was this morning's incident the cause? The male eva pilot couldn't really think of what would put her into her current mood and resolved to ask her at the lunchbreak.  
真嗣平时不会理会她的坏脾气，但她看起来却快要哭了。今天她有些奇怪。是不是发生什么事让她不高兴了？是今天早上发生的事情吗？男EVA飞行员实在想不出什么会让她陷入现在的心情，并决定在午休时问她。**

_Her current moodiness is hinting at hormonal anger, third hint Asuka is pregnant.  
她目前的情绪低落暗示着荷尔蒙的愤怒，这是明日香怀孕的第三个暗示。_

All was silent for a moment as Shinji stood there patiently. Suddenly, he heard Asuka running and the sound of a door slamming open. Alarmed, the male eva pilot opened the door and entered the bathroom. **He soon heard the sound of retching coming from one of the cubicles and headed over to it. Inside the cubicle, the sight of Asuka hunched over the toilet came into view.**  
真嗣耐心地站在那里，一时间鸦雀无声。突然，他听到明日香奔跑的声音和关门的声音。男EVA飞行员惊慌失措，打开门进入浴室。很快他就听到一间隔间里传来干呕的声音，于是他朝那间隔间走去。隔间内，映入眼帘的是明日香弯腰坐在马桶上的样子。

_Fourth hint Asuka is pregnant, the fact she has morning sickness.  
第四个暗示明日香怀孕了，事实上她有孕吐。_

"Are you trying to piss me off you baka? **For your information, I still haven't had my period yet** and besides if I did, there's no way in hell I'd let you fuck me" Asuka shouted at him angrily.  
“你想惹怒我吗？顺便说一句，我还没有来月经，而且如果来了，我绝对不会让你操我。”明日香愤怒地对他喊道。

_Final hint Asuka is pregnant, it's hinted here she hasn't had her period for a while.  
最后提示明日香怀孕了，这里暗示她已经有一段时间没有来月经了。_

---

And now a reflection of how this story came about and what I myself think of the end product.  
现在谈谈这个故事是如何发生的以及我自己对最终产品的看法。

Self-Reflection 自我反省

I'm sure quite a few people wonder why I decided to write such a story to begin with, especially beginning with Shinji raping Asuka. Before I get to the actual reason, there is a bit of context needed. I was a young hormone filled teenage boy and I had very little idea about what I was writing about. I had only been in one relationship, I hadn't had sex nor did I comprehend the true seriousness of rape, or of life in general nor the real sufferings people go through and things like that.  
我确信很多人想知道为什么我决定开始写这样一个故事，特别是从真嗣强奸明日香开始。在了解实际原因之前，需要了解一些背景信息。我是一个充满荷尔蒙的十几岁男孩，我对自己在写的东西知之甚少。我只经历过一段关系，没有发生过性行为，也不理解强奸或一般生活的真正严重性，也不理解人们经历的真正痛苦以及类似的事情。

I also loved the show Evangelion and I really liked the characters, especially Shinji and Asuka. I always thought that they should have ended up together. I had read quite a few fanfics around that time (I started writing in 2007!) and fanfics like Scar Tissue hadn't even been started by the time I finished the first write up of "Shinji and Asuka", Genocide probably had only a few chapters (and I didn't even know of its existence). Furthermore, many fanfics of the time were about shipping and how to get your two favourite characters together – rather than an extension to the Evangelion universe (if that makes sense).  
我也很喜欢《新世纪福音战士》，我真的很喜欢其中的角色，尤其是真嗣和明日香。我一直以为他们最终应该在一起。那时我读了很多同人小说（我从 2007 年开始写作！），当我完成第一篇《真嗣与明日香》的文章时，像《疤痕组织》这样的同人小说甚至还没有开始，《种族灭绝》可能只有一个几章（我什至不知道它的存在）。此外，当时的许多同人小说都是关于运输以及如何将你最喜欢的两个角色放在一起 - 而不是《新世纪福音战士》宇宙的延伸（如果这有意义的话）。

This is all to explain what got me started on this path to actually write some fanfiction, I just wanted to write a fanfic about Evangelion and I also had a hormone filled desire to write some lemon content. Why did I choose rape? When I was first conceiving the idea of how to get Shinji and Asuka together, I wanted to write something original, something that hadn't been done before and get Shinji and Asuka together in a non-conventional way (as far as I know there wasn't an Evangelion fanfic where Shinji rapes Asuka and ends up together with her). I also wanted the fic to be somewhat dark to represent the fact that Evangelion wasn't all sunshine and roses as the anime had its fair share of dark moments. I also had this strange question in my head at the time; if a man raped a woman, would it be possible for them to end up in a loving relationship afterwards? Obviously that wouldn't happen normally, but I wondered if I could write such a story. There were a lot of waffy fics at the time I began writing and I didn't want to follow that sort of style. So with all that combined… "Shinji and Asuka" was born. It was an ill-conceived beginning, but that's how it occurred. I knew the characters and universe pretty well at the time, so to me "it made sense" to use Evangelion to answer that question. Plus, don't forget I was extremely immature haha, you can see from how much lemon content there was.  
这一切都是为了解释是什么让我开始走上这条实际写一些同人小说的道路，我只是想写一篇关于新世纪福音战士的同人小说，而且我也有一种充满荷尔蒙的渴望写一些柠檬内容。我为什么选择强奸？当我第一次构思如何让真嗣和明日香在一起的想法时，我想写一些原创的东西，一些以前没有做过的东西，以一种非传统的方式让真嗣和明日香在一起（据我所知）不是新世纪福音战士的同人小说，其中真嗣强奸明日香并最终与她在一起）。我还希望这部小说有点黑暗，以代表新世纪福音战士并不全是阳光和玫瑰，因为动画也有相当多的黑暗时刻。当时我脑子里也有这个奇怪的问题；如果一个男人强奸了一个女人，他们之后有可能发展成爱情关系吗？显然这通常不会发生，但我想知道我是否可以写这样一个故事。我开始写作时有很多荒唐的小说，我不想遵循那种风格。因此，所有这些结合在一起......“真嗣和明日香”诞生了。这是一个考虑不周的开始，但事情就是这样发生的。我当时非常了解角色和宇宙，所以对我来说，用《新世纪福音战士》来回答这个问题“很有意义”。另外，别忘了我还很不成熟哈哈，看柠檬含量就知道了。

So from there I go writing up the first chapter and publishing it, waiting to see the initial response. Interestingly, at the time I had quite a few readers interested in the story. I won't claim to know why but many of them followed me as I wrote the story and continued to review and communicate with me. This is where I first interacted with the Evangelion community and made some online friends there. Many of the readers also gave good tips on how to improve the story. Ignoring the shitty premise of my story, if you think the writing quality is good that's because of one particular reader "Darknemo2000" that gave me a lot of good writing advice. Without him, I imagine the story would never have become as popular as it eventually did. Many of my readers at the time did like the story and did ask for more lemon content and I certainly felt I owed it to them haha. Don't get me wrong, my readers are not to blame for any of the faults of my story except maybe perhaps the quantity of smut haha.  
因此，从那里我开始写第一章并发布它，等待看到最初的回应。有趣的是，当时有不少读者对这个故事感兴趣。我不会声称知道为什么，但当我写这个故事时，他们中的许多人都在关注我，并继续审查和与我交流。这是我第一次与新世纪福音战士社区互动并在那里结识了一些网上朋友的地方。许多读者还就如何改进故事提出了很好的建议。忽略我故事的糟糕前提，如果你认为写作质量很好，那是因为一位特定的读者“Darknemo2000”给了我很多很好的写作建议。如果没有他，我想这个故事永远不会像最终那样受欢迎。当时我的许多读者确实喜欢这个故事，并要求提供更多柠檬内容，我当然觉得我欠他们哈哈。别误会我的意思，我的读者不应该为我的故事的任何错误负责，除了污秽的数量，哈哈。

In any case, once I finished writing the story I realised that my earlier chapters were not written as well as the later ones so I went back on a quest to rewrite Chapters 1-8, but funnily enough, I only managed to rewrite Chapters 1-7 before life came along and I became extremely busy with study, friends, work etc. At that point the story was neglected and I lost interest in reading fanfiction for a time.  
无论如何，当我写完这个故事时，我意识到我前面的章节写得不如后面的章节，所以我又回去寻求重写第1章到第8章，但有趣的是，我只重写了第1章-7 生命到来之前，我变得非常忙于学习、交友、工作等。那时故事就被忽视了，我有一段时间失去了阅读同人小说的兴趣。

I didn't tell anyone that knows me in person about the story I wrote except for a girlfriend I started dating not long after finishing the story. She even read the story and loved it. She had her critiques but for the most part she liked it; it kept her hooked and she found many parts quite funny. I suppose it helped that she knew me and thus knew the author wasn't some creep!  
我没有告诉任何认识我的人我写的故事，除了我在完成故事后不久开始约会的女朋友。她甚至读了这个故事并且喜欢它。她有自己的批评，但大多数情况下她很喜欢。这让她着迷，她发现很多部分都很有趣。我想这有助于她认识我，从而知道作者不是个怪人！

Other than the reviews I received over the years I didn't really know the extent of how well received the story was or not. The people leaving reviews mostly liked the story, and the rest generally flat out hated it. It was particularly funny seeing my critics leaving reviews calling me an asshole and what not to which I reacted at first like haha whatever. But as I grew older, I've come to realise that their reaction to the story is probably the more correct one! Not to diss those who like my story of course!  
除了多年来我收到的评论之外，我真的不知道这个故事的受欢迎程度。留下评论的人大多喜欢这个故事，而其余的人则普遍讨厌它。特别有趣的是看到我的批评者留下评论说我是混蛋，而我一开始的反应就像哈哈什么的。但随着年龄的增长，我开始意识到他们对这个故事的反应可能是更正确的！当然不是为了diss那些喜欢我的故事的人！

After several years I was curious about the legacy of the story and began to investigate. I quickly found out I had quite a mix of views in the online world, but predominantly that it was a disaster. Essentially a story that was trying to be written well, but still turned out badly. Certainly, it was not the legacy I was hoping; the story became famous for all the wrong reasons, infamous as it were. It was a bit disheartening considering that I did put a lot of time and effort into the story, but it was completely valid criticism. I did laugh at quite a few of the online reviews though!  
几年后，我对这个故事的遗产感到好奇并开始调查。我很快发现我对网络世界的看法很复杂，但主要是这是一场灾难。本质上是一个试图写得好的故事，但结果仍然很糟糕。当然，这不是我所希望的遗产。这个故事因各种错误的原因而出名，尽管它是臭名昭著的。考虑到我确实在这个故事上投入了大量的时间和精力，这有点令人沮丧，但这是完全正确的批评。不过，我确实笑了很多网上评论！

_Behold, the worst Evangelion fanfiction of all time!  
看哪，有史以来最糟糕的新世纪福音战士同人小说！_

_[link to this story] [链接到这个故事]_

_This story starts with Shinji getting really pissed off at Asuka.  
这个故事是从真嗣对明日香非常生气开始的。_

_So pissed off he rapes her.  
他非常生气，强奸了她。_

_Yes, this fanfic author thought it was completely In Character for Shinji to rape Asuka. It actually gets pretty fucking funny as you read, due to how OOC it gets. Worth a read for the laughs!  
是的，这位同人作者认为真嗣强奸明日香完全符合他的性格。当你读到它的时候，它实际上会变得非常有趣，因为它变得 OOC 了。值得一读，笑一笑！_

_Edit: Also, LCL is a contraceptive. Who knew?

_Shinji and Asuka by DeadlyPole (0/10)  
DeadlyPole 的真嗣和明日香 (0/10)_

_This is 250,000 words of smut. Seriously. Two hundred. Fifty. Thousand words. Of smut. That is as much as the first three Harry Potter books COMBINED. It is as if the author took the worst Hentai EVA Doujins available and decided to write a novel based on that. To the user who linked me this: I HATE YOU. You know who you are. Despite saying that, there is actually a semblance of a okay plotline somewhere under that mess after the shock of the first few chapters, with some good character development from Ch.10 onwards. Just... mileage will vary. Reading this was like watching a train wreck, it is horrifying yet fascinating.  
这是25万字的污言秽语。严重地。二百。五十。千言万语。污迹。这相当于《哈利·波特》前三本书的总和。就好像作者选择了最糟糕的 Hentai EVA 同人并决定以此为基础写一本小说。对于链接我的用户：我恨你。你知道你是谁。尽管这么说，但在前几章的震撼之后，在混乱的某个地方实际上有一个看似不错的情节主线，从第 10 章开始有一些良好的角色发展。只是...里程会有所不同。读这篇文章就像观看火车失事一样，既可怕又令人着迷。_

The story is more than 250K now, but I still laughed at the comparison. Even though obviously the story isn't 100% smut, his opinion is certainly valid in some ways haha.  
现在故事已经超过250K了，但对比起来我还是笑了。尽管显然这个故事并不是100%的色情内容，但他的观点在某些方面肯定是正确的哈哈。

_Aside from the obvious trollfics like Shinji's Nightmare Cataclysm and the barely comprehensible drivels anyone can weed out from first two paragraphs (well, I guess that doesn't really count by "having read" criteria) I'll kinda have to say the worst fic I've ever read that ostensibly was meant to be serious fanfic was... "Shinji and Asuka" by DeadlyPole.  
除了像真嗣的噩梦大灾变这样明显的恶作剧和几乎无法理解的胡言乱语，任何人都可以从前两段中剔除（嗯，我想这并不能真正算作“读过”的标准）我不得不说最糟糕的小说我曾经读过，表面上是严肃的同人小说是……DeadlyPole 的《真嗣与明日香》。_

_And it's not actually the rape itself in first chapter (although it doesn't really help with the sheer OOC of it all - especially as this was action arc territory) but the fact that every single character in the fic seems to be a mentally handicapped idiot (even moreso than is expected from NGE) judging by their actions all through the fic.  
事实上，这并不是第一章中的强奸本身（尽管它对于纯粹的OOC并没有真正的帮助——尤其是因为这是动作弧领域），但事实上，小说中的每个角色似乎都是一个弱智者从他们在整个小说中的行为来看，他们是白痴（甚至比 NGE 的预期还要白痴）。_

_Yet I had this sickening fascination like watching a train wreck in slow motion and read it all the way to the end. I still want those hours of my life back.  
然而我有一种令人作呕的着迷，就像慢动作地观看火车失事一样，并从头到尾读完它。我仍然想要回到生命中的那些时光。_

_You know what made me even more angry about the fic? It goes from attempted rape in the first chapter to just plain rape in the next chapter. The mere existence of rape fics piss me off to no end.  
你知道是什么让我对这部小说更加愤怒吗？它从第一章中的未遂强奸变成了下一章中的普通强奸。仅仅强奸小说的存在就让我恼火不已。_

_I always picture rapefic authors as lonely neckbeards. They're the sort of sad fucks who see (apparently) strong female characters as a sort of proxy for the women who've spurned their advances.  
我总是把强奸作家想象成孤独的颈胡子。他们是那种可悲的混蛋，他们将（显然）坚强的女性角色视为拒绝她们求爱的女性的代表。_

_Or the pretty girls who wouldn't give them the time of day in school (most likely because they're creepy as fuck and the girls have better things to do with their time). Asuka gets that a lot.  
或者那些漂亮的女孩不愿意花时间在学校（很可能是因为她们太他妈的令人毛骨悚然，而女孩们有更好的事情可以做）。明日香对此深有体会。_

No one should compare my fic to SNC!  
没有人应该将我的小说与 SNC 进行比较！

And number one goes to the most brilliant, hilarious one, which got me laughing so hard. It was a fanfic review on the site sith-droideka, I have no clue who these people are but it was so entertaining reading their analysis of my first chapter (the first rewrite), they used the following aliases Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, Fallen, Aziz. I'm sure googling some keywords will get you to their site, their review is a commentary of the chapter so it's way too long for me to post here.  
第一个是最精彩、最搞笑的一个，它让我笑得很厉害。这是 sith-droideka 网站上的同人评论，我不知道这些人是谁，但阅读他们对我的第一章（第一次重写）的分析非常有趣，他们使用了以下别名 Quetzalcoatl、Tlaloc、Fallen、Aziz 。我确信谷歌搜索一些关键字会让你到达他们的网站，他们的评论是对本章的评论，所以我在这里发布的内容太长了。

I kinda feel like all of this is the universe telling me not to write again ;). So what did I myself actually think of the story? Well at the time I was writing it, I felt like I had achieved something. It had quite a number of reviews and favourites etc. Plus, actually sitting down and finishing a story is a feat in and of itself. As I grew older, I realised that the story I wrote had many more flaws than I first thought, but mainly that the premise of the story itself had been a seriously bad idea.  
我有点觉得这一切都是宇宙告诉我不要再写了;)。那么我自己对这个故事的真实看法是什么呢？好吧，当我写这篇文章的时候，我觉得我已经取得了一些成就。它有相当多的评论和收藏夹等。另外，真正坐下来完成一个故事本身就是一项壮举。随着年龄的增长，我意识到我写的故事比我最初想象的有更多缺陷，但主要是故事本身的前提是一个非常糟糕的主意。

My biggest regrets in this story are as follows:  
在这个故事中，我最大的遗憾是：

1. The story being based on Shinji raping Asuka. This story would never have gotten so much flak if not for this. But then again, maybe this would have just been another fic everyone forgot. Who knows, history is what it is and we can't predict the future. Even so, this is certainly my biggest regret in this story, there are so many other things I could have done to progress the story.  
1.故事以真嗣强奸明日香为背景。如果不是因为这个，这个故事永远不会受到如此多的批评。但话又说回来，也许这只是另一部被大家遗忘的小说。谁知道呢，历史就是这样，我们无法预测未来。即便如此，这无疑是我在这个故事中最大的遗憾，我可以做很多其他事情来推进这个故事。

2. All the lemon/smut. Like really, it was actually tiresome to write it, it wasn't written well, there was too much etc. But this is clearly the product of my teenage stupidity.  
2.所有的柠檬/黑粉病。确实，写起来很累，写得不好，太多等等。但这显然是我青少年时期愚蠢的产物。

3. Creating a fic that couldn't really decide what it was. One would think that it was supposed to be somewhat dark with the first chapter, but the story completely changes into almost a comedic story. I think I shoulda gone with comedic from the get go (with some drama here and there), or I dunno tbh. I had a lot of slapstick comedy in the story to keep the anime feel to it, but maybe it wasn't that funny either? My critics will probably know my strengths (if I had any) better than me.  
3.创作一部无法真正决定它是什么的小说。可能有人会觉得第一章应该有点黑暗，但故事完全变成了一个几乎是喜剧的故事。我想我应该从一开始就采用喜剧（到处都有一些戏剧），否则我不知道。我在故事中加入了很多闹剧，以保持动画的感觉，但也许它也没有那么有趣？我的批评者可能比我更了解我的优势（如果我有的话）。

So at some point I considered a) Removing the rape scene. But that's actually pretty difficult to do since so much of the story centres around that having happened that I might as well just write another fanfic or b) Removing the story from this website. But I figured there really wasn't much point for that anymore after already having been out on the internet for so long, someone else would just repost it somewhere else. I just need to live with the shame forever as a reminder of what not to write!  
所以在某个时候我考虑过a）删除强奸场景。但这实际上很难做到，因为故事的大部分内容都围绕着已经发生的事情展开，我不妨再写一篇同人小说，或者 b) 从这个网站上删除这个故事。但我认为，在已经在互联网上发布这么长时间之后，真的没有什么意义了，其他人只会将其重新发布到其他地方。我只需要永远生活在耻辱之中，以提醒我不要写什么！

But in any case, I enjoyed writing the fic, I liked many parts of the fic especially in the later chapters which I thought were quite funny. My favourite part of the story was the confrontation with Aria as an angel and Shinji finally revealing to Asuka that he loved her after the memory loss. Perhaps other readers could see the good parts of the story and hence why it became popular.  
但无论如何，我很喜欢写这部小说，我喜欢这部小说的很多部分，尤其是后面的章节，我觉得很有趣。这个故事中我最喜欢的部分是与作为天使的阿丽亚的对抗，真嗣最终在失忆后向明日香透露他爱她。也许其他读者可以看到这个故事的精彩部分，从而理解它为何如此受欢迎。

Much later on when COVID happened, I suddenly had a lot more free time so I decided to finish rewriting the story as I had planned to long ago. I'm not sure why I remembered this story or why I had the sudden urge to finish it off, but it just happened. After finally finishing the rewrite, I decided to do one last step and write an epilogue to address what I felt was the biggest loose end; Asuka never finding out the truth.  
很久以后，当新冠疫情发生时，我突然有了更多的空闲时间，所以我决定按照我很久以前的计划重写这个故事。我不知道为什么我会想起这个故事，也不知道为什么我突然有想要结束它的冲动，但它就这样发生了。最终完成重写后，我决定做最后一步，写一篇尾声来解决我认为最大的未解决问题；明日香始终没有发现真相。

As a consequence of updating the story, however, I was invited to an asushin discord server where many other authors and readers converse daily. I was welcomed openly and many people asked questions about the story (especially the waffles!) and I was pleased to see how friendly the people were, even those who didn't like my story. I wholeheartedly recommend joining the server if you like an interesting eva community, and especially if you like the Shinji x Asuka pairing. There are some great writers like deathbringer374, JimmyWolk, Rommel, Toasterman etc on there.  
然而，由于更新了故事，我被邀请到 asushin 不和谐服务器，许多其他作者和读者每天都在那里交谈。我受到了公开的欢迎，很多人问了有关这个故事的问题（尤其是华夫饼！），我很高兴看到人们如此友好，即使是那些不喜欢我的故事的人。如果您喜欢有趣的 eva 社区，特别是如果您喜欢真嗣 x 明日香配对，我衷心建议您加入服务器。那里有一些伟大的作家，如 Deathbringer374、JimmyWolk、Rommel、Toasterman 等。

And finally to finish off, I can't really see myself writing any more Evangelion fanfic – I think my time has passed and the new generations of writers are taking over. I at least hope you enjoyed the epilogue and my thoughts written out plainly for all to see. In any case, that's all from deadlypole!  
最后，我真的无法想象自己会再写新世纪福音战士同人小说了——我认为我的时代已经过去了，新一代作家正在接手。我至少希望你喜欢尾声和我的想法，这些想法被清楚地写出来让所有人都能看到。无论如何，这都是来自致命极的！
