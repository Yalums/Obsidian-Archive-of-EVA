*smile* Hi.  For those of you who don't know me, I'm Serena, and I want this to be love at first sight…
*微笑* 大家好。可能有些人还不太熟悉我，我是 Serena，希望我们能一见倾心……

Before I start, some things you should know—I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion.  This story is a parallel to Avarice's spectacular "Asuka's Smile", written with his consent, from Asuka's point of view.  So I'm going to set the interface headsets in my hair; it's up to you, the readers, to determine how high my synch ratio is. 
在开始之前，有几点需要说明——我并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》的版权。这篇故事是与 Avarice 的杰作《明日香的微笑》相呼应的，征得他的同意后，从明日香的角度进行创作。因此，我将把界面头盔戴在头发上，至于我的同步率有多高，就留给各位读者自行判断了。

Enough of me; they're all yours, Asuka…
我已经说够了；接下来都是你的，明日香……

Upside Down 上下颠倒

A parallel to Avarice's "Asuka's Smile"
与贪婪的“明日香的微笑”相呼应的平行对照

*****

The world was upside down.
世界变得颠倒错乱。

Again. 再来一次。

It was one of the reasons I felt right at home there.  I was used to having my world upside down.
这是我能在那里感到宾至如归的原因之一。我早已习惯了生活的颠倒无常。

The television had failed miserably to hold my attention.  The voices were fading in and out, from formless noise to a comfortable hum.  I blinked sleepily at the people on the screen; their upside-down faces, their silly, distorted features.  They were unrecognizable as human beings. 
电视节目根本无法吸引我的注意。声音忽强忽弱，从杂乱无章的噪音变成令人安心的嗡鸣。我半睡半醒地看着屏幕上的人物，他们的脸庞颠倒，表情滑稽且扭曲，完全失去了人的模样。

(Maybe I'm the one who's right side up,) I thought almost giddily.  (I'm right, and I've always been, and you're all wrong.)
（或许我才是那个正立的人，）我几乎兴奋地想。（我没错，我一直都是对的，而你们全都错了。）

I was used to being right, too.
我也习惯了总是正确的。

I could see my hair licking at the floor like flame, spreading like lava beneath me.  I reached above (below...?) my head and rubbed my fingers along the floor, remembering the texture not against my hands, but against my cheek.  I remembered wanting to huddle down on the floor, hold onto it until my world stopped spinning.
我仿佛能看到自己的头发如同火焰般轻触地板，又似熔岩在我脚下蔓延开来。我举手（或是俯身？）至头顶，手指摩挲着地面，记忆中的触感并非来自手掌，而是脸颊。那时，我渴望蜷缩于地，紧握着它，直至周遭的旋转世界归于平静。

Looking up (down, maybe) at it, I realized it wasn't enough.  It could never be enough.  The floor stretched flat and empty in front of me.  There was nothing to hold onto.  The floor would never hold me back, and it wouldn't keep the sky from falling on me.
抬头（或许是低头）凝视着它，我深感这远远不够。它永远都无法满足。地板在我面前平坦而空旷地延伸，没有任何东西可以依靠。地板不会成为我的阻碍，也不会阻止天空向我倾覆。

I felt suddenly nauseous with the thought, but it might have been the blood rushing to my head.  I turned the volume up on the television, a last desperate attempt to drown out the screaming in my head.  My eyes slid closed, and I didn't mind, because it felt as though my brains might leak out through them.
我突然感到一阵恶心，或许是血液涌上头部的缘故。我调大了电视音量，试图用这最后的努力掩盖脑海中的尖叫声。我的眼睛不由自主地闭上了，我并不介意，因为感觉我的思绪仿佛要从眼眶中溢出。

It could have been five minutes or forever that my eyes stayed closed, although my watch said twenty minutes.  The air around me was suddenly warm and heavy with the scent of food cooking.  It beckoned to me, promising good things, promising home.  I mistrusted the feelings immediately, but the clumsy sack of blood and bone that was my body believed the promises.  A growl sounded, not the beast that slept curled around my heart, but a lesser evil--hunger.
我的眼睛闭着，或许是五分钟，或许是永恒，尽管手表显示已过去二十分钟。四周的空气骤然温暖，弥漫着烹饪食物的香气。它向我招手，许诺美好与家的温馨。我立刻对这些感觉心生疑虑，然而我那笨拙的血肉之躯却轻易相信了这些许诺。一阵低沉的咕噜声传来，并非潜伏在我心底的野兽，而是另一个较小的恶魔——饥饿。

I mean, the scents were pleasing, but it was memory that tugged at me.  It was wishful thinking that tapped my shoulder and tried to make me remember what never was.  It was pleasing, but it did not make this place my home.
香气确实令人愉悦，然而真正触动我的是那些记忆。那种渴望的思绪轻拍我的肩膀，试图唤醒我那些从未发生的过往。尽管如此，这并未让我真正将这个地方当作自己的家。

My skin was still cool from the shower I'd taken when I'd gotten in.  I'd stood under the artificial rain until it ran cold, soaking my hair and skin.  It was a good place to hide.  The water had cascaded down my face, starred my eyelashes together.  If one cries in the shower, hidden beneath the spray, is one still crying? If no one can see it--if it's impossible to tell the difference between the water and the tears--is it still really happening?
我刚洗完澡，肌肤仍带着凉意。我站在人造雨下，直到水变冷，浸湿了我的头发和皮肤。这里是个藏身的好地方。水从我脸上倾泻而下，将我的睫毛粘在一起。如果在淋浴时哭泣，隐藏在喷头下，那还算是在哭泣吗？如果没有人能看到——如果无法分辨水和泪的区别——那它真的还在发生吗？

I'd scrubbed until my skin had turned red (they say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated...).  Not that it worked.  Not that it ever washed away.  I could still smell the metallic scent of the LCL, a sharp stinging in my nose.  Eau de Eva, the scent of failure, of everything I'd spent my whole life beating back.
我用力擦洗，直到皮肤发红（据说擦到出血就是去角质了...）。然而这并无效果，那些痕迹从未被洗去。我依旧能嗅到 LCL 的金属气息，鼻腔里一阵刺痛。那是 Eva 的气息，失败的象征，我一生都在竭力抵抗的一切。

And now I was back where I'd started, lying upside down on the loveseat, watching Japanese TV.
如今我又回到了原点，头朝下躺在长沙发上，看着日本的电视节目。

Welcome home, the hiss of the shower had said to me, and it hadn't been enough.  Welcome home, the blare of the TV had shouted, and I hadn't believed.  Welcome home, the scent of food cooking had whispered, but I did not follow its beckoning hand.
欢迎回家，淋浴的嘶嘶声曾向我传达，但这并不足以让我感到温暖。电视的喧闹声也曾大声宣告，但我并未因此而动容。烹饪食物的香气虽轻声细语，我却未曾被其吸引。

His steps were almost silent as he passed the loveseat, his eyes tracking the movement of my foot as I absently kept time to my heartbeat. 
他走过长沙发时，脚步轻得几乎听不见，眼睛却紧随着我无意识地随着心跳节奏移动的脚。

My world was upside down.
我的世界完全颠倒了。

(Maybe you're the one who's upside down, and I'm right...) I started to think again, but the words died on the way to my brain as a hand closed around my ankle.  The action made it awkward for me to continue keeping time with my foot, but my heart rate had accelerated, making it difficult for my foot to keep up anyway.
（或许你才是那个颠倒的人，而我才是对的……）我开始重新思考，但话未出口，一只手已紧紧抓住我的脚踝。这一动作使我难以继续用脚打节拍，而心跳的加速更让我的脚无法跟上节奏。

I realized that I'd been wrong.  It was I who was upside down, and it was my own doing.  He stood as he'd always stood, a scowl slashing his features, his eyebrows holding the frown, defiant and defensive.  Meeting his eyes was like watching obsidian shatter into pieces.
我恍然大悟，原来错的是我。是我自己颠倒了局面。他依旧站立，眉头紧锁，面带怒容，既挑衅又戒备。与他对视，仿佛目睹黑曜石破碎成片。

Deep in those troubled eyes, I saw the answer--not my own reflection, not who I was, but where I was.  Home.  Upside down.  At his feet.
在那双忧郁的眼眸深处，我找到了答案——那不是我的倒影，也不是我身份的体现，而是我所在的位置。家，颠倒了，就在他的脚下。

It was strangely familiar, almost as familiar as the sick thudding of my heart against my breastbone.  I wondered if he could see it pounding against my skin, trying to break free. 
这种感觉异常熟悉，几乎与我胸骨上心脏那病态的跳动一样熟悉。我不禁好奇，他是否能看到我的心跳在我皮肤下猛烈跳动，仿佛要挣脱束缚。

His own chest was rising and falling with his respiration, a steady, comfortable rhythm, lulling me into a slightly calmer state.  He looked like stone that could breathe.  I jerked my eyes back to his new-old face, but the rhythm of his breath swirled around me like the sea, slipped over me like the breakers would...I wondered irrationally if this was what it felt like to drown.  Being tossed around by an outside force, having no control over it.
他的胸膛随着呼吸平稳地起伏，这种舒适而有规律的节奏让我渐渐平静。他宛如一块有生命的石头。我急忙将视线移回他那张新旧交织的面孔，但他的呼吸如同海浪般环绕着我，又似碎浪轻抚...我无端地想，这或许就是溺水的感觉吧。被外力抛来抛去，完全无法掌控。

He was light and shadow, the most intricate, frustrating, interesting pattern.  I had worked my whole life to keep the light and darkness separate, but in him they came together and drew the eye.  I felt suddenly foolish, as if I'd been blind all my life and couldn't make use of the sight I'd been given.
他如同光与影的交织，构成了最复杂、令人沮丧却又无比迷人的图案。我一生都在努力区分光明与黑暗，但在他身上，这两者却和谐共存，引人注目。我突然感到自己很愚蠢，仿佛一直盲目，无法充分利用我所拥有的视力。

He was and wasn't the boy I'd known.  Every time he breathed in or out, my decision changed.  I couldn't make up my mind.
他既是又非我昔日所识之少年。每逢他呼吸之间，我心意便随之摇摆。我难以决断。

Three years.  What to say? What to do?
三年过去了。该说什么？该做什么？

(Shinji...I...) （真嗣...我...）

Angels and Eva, synch rates and test runs...
天使与伊娃，同步率与测试运行...

(Shinji, how have...?)
（真嗣，最近过得如何？）

Blood and bio-rhythms and soldiers and dolls...
血液、生物节奏、士兵与玩偶...

(Shinji...you know...) （真嗣...你明白的...）

His dark gaze seemed to dare me to speak, to beg me to speak, and to enjoy the silence, all at once.
他那深邃的目光仿佛在挑衅我开口，又像在恳求我打破沉默，同时享受着这份静谧。

"Shinji," I said aloud, my voice even and calm, "if you don't remove your hand from my leg in three seconds I'm going to kick your teeth in."
“真嗣，”我大声说道，语气平稳而冷静，“如果你不在三秒内把手从我的腿上拿开，我就要踢掉你的牙。”

He yanked his hand away from my leg as if he'd been scalded, his expression that of a waking sleeper.  "Huh? Oh, my bad!"
他突然把手从我腿上抽开，好像被烫到似的，脸上露出刚睡醒的神情。“啊？哦，怪我！”

And he was Shinji, again.
他再次成为了真嗣。

I couldn't help but smile, not to bare fangs, but just because he made it easy to smile.  Whether I was laughing with him or laughing at him, he made it easy to smile.
我不禁微笑，并非露出敌意，而是因为他让我感到微笑变得如此简单。无论是与他一同欢笑，还是因他而笑，他都让我觉得微笑是件轻松的事。

As I flipped to an upright position, I realized that this was going to be a double-edged sword.  I could get to my feet and look him over, but I'd have to allow him to look me over, too.  I couldn't have one without the other, but I wasn't expecting Shinji to be mature about it.  I swear, if there was one pervert in the world, he would find me.
当我翻身站稳时，我意识到这将是一把双刃剑。我可以起身审视他，但同时也要接受他的审视。两者缺一不可，但我没想到真嗣会对此表现得如此成熟。我敢肯定，如果世界上有一个变态，他一定会找到我。

Staring into those obsidian eyes, I realized that I could be defensive or I could be aggressive.  Guess which one I chose?
当我凝视着那双深邃如黑曜石的眼睛时，我意识到自己可以选择防御或攻击。你猜我选了哪一个？

I went up on my toes, turning slowly for him, feeling the welcome weight of my hair swing behind me, brushing my bare shoulders like fur.  If he was going to ogle me, I might as well look my absolute cutest. 
我踮起脚尖，慢慢地为他转了一圈，感受着头发甩在身后那令人愉悦的重量，轻拂着我裸露的肩膀，仿佛柔软的毛皮。既然他要盯着我看，我何不展现出最迷人的一面。

Upon completing the rotation, I fluttered my eyelashes at him.  "Like what you see?" I teased.
旋转结束后，我向他眨了眨眼睫毛，调皮地问：“喜欢你所看到的吗？”

I don't know why he nodded like a yes-man.  It was just a joke.
我不明白他为何像应声虫般点头，那不过是个玩笑而已。

I couldn't help but snicker at those saucer eyes.  I wanted a closer look at him, but I wasn't about to move.  Petty of me, I know, but I wanted to make him come to me.
我禁不住对那双圆睁的眼睛暗自发笑。我渴望更近地观察他，但我并不打算移动。虽然这显得有些小气，但我确实希望他能主动走向我。

When he didn't move closer I beckoned impatiently.  "Hey, get over here, baka! Lemme see the goods!"
他没走近，我便不耐烦地招手喊道：“嘿，快过来，笨蛋！让我瞧瞧东西！”

Shinji obeyed silently, and it amazed me that he could--that he could just stand there quietly and let someone look him over, slide their probing gaze anywhere, make silent judgments of him.  Why didn't it rip him up inside, the way it did me? What was wrong with him?
真嗣默默地服从了，这让我感到惊讶——他竟然能够如此安静地站在那里，任由别人审视他，用探询的目光在他身上游走，无声地对他做出评判。为什么这不会像对我那样撕裂他的内心？他有什么问题？

What was wrong with me?
我有什么问题吗？

He looked so solid standing before me that I felt I had to touch him to be sure he was real.  I slid my hands up his chest, marveling at how warm he was.  I could feel his heartbeat beneath my hands, the steady pulse of his life.  It should have made him fragile to me, but somehow I only saw him as stronger, so much stronger than before.  What had changed him?
他站在我面前，坚实得让我觉得必须伸手触摸才能确认他的真实存在。我双手轻抚他的胸膛，惊讶于他的体温。我能感受到他心跳在我手下的规律跳动，那是他生命的脉搏。按理说这应该让他显得脆弱，但不知为何，我只觉得他比以前更加强壮，强壮得多。究竟是什么改变了他？

"I see you've been a busy boy," I murmured, and Shinji shuddered, whether at my words or at having me touch him so, I'm not sure.  I felt the movement beneath my hands, felt his body heat rise under my touch.  There was power in that, that I could make him notice me, make him feel...
“看来你一直很忙碌啊，”我轻声说道，真嗣颤抖了一下，不知是因为我的话语还是因为我如此触碰他。我感受到手下的动静，察觉到他因我的触摸而体温上升。这种感觉中有一种力量，我能让他注意到我，让他感受到……

"So what're you doing here, Asuka? I thought you went back to Germany for good?" he asked.
“明日香，你怎么在这里？我还以为你回德国长住了呢？”他问道。

I let him go as if his skin had burned me, stepping back to put physical distance between us.  My hands remembered his heartbeat.  Everything cooled when I wasn't close to him.
我放他走，仿佛他的皮肤灼伤了我，后退一步以拉开我们之间的物理距离。我的手还记得他的心跳。当我不在他身边时，一切都冷却了。

Moron.  I'd been close enough to feel his heartbeat, and he had to go and ask me that?
真是傻瓜。我与他近得都能感受到他的心跳，他竟然还非要问我那个问题？

"I just went back for a bit more schooling.  I've already gotten another science degree," I said breezily, my tone not half as cold as my body had become.  I turned my head to the side, shrugging my shoulders, as if it didn't matter.  Maybe it didn't.  Nothing really mattered, except... "As for why I came back, you ought to know better than anyone why I came back."
“我刚回去继续深造了一段时间。现在我又获得了一个科学学位，”我轻描淡写地说道，语气远不及我身体的寒冷。我侧过头，耸了耸肩，仿佛这一切都无关痛痒。或许确实如此。除了……“至于我为何归来，你应该最清楚我回来的理由。”

He did.  "Eva."
他的确做了。“伊娃。”

I wanted to shudder at the word, as if just saying it out loud would bring a cloud of Angels descending upon our heads.  Instead I looked at Shinji's face.
我本想对这个词心生敬畏，仿佛只要大声说出，便会有一群天使从天而降，笼罩在我们头顶。然而，我却只是凝视着真嗣的脸庞。

He was smiling, but the smile didn't reach his eyes.  They'd gone dead, blank, a...a doll's eyes.  If I hadn't known it was manifestly impossible, I'd have said he had been disappointed by my answer.
他脸上挂着微笑，然而那笑容并未抵达眼底。他的眼神变得呆滞无光，宛如玩偶之眼。若非我深知那绝无可能，我几乎会以为他对我的回答感到失望。

Well, ask a silly question! What was he expecting me to say? That I'd come back to Japan because I loved the cuisine?
哎，真是问了个傻问题！他以为我会说什么？难道我会说是因为迷恋日本料理才回来的吗？

"Eva.  Exactly," I clarified, so that there might be no more mistakes.  But instead of the righteous anger that had once crept into my voice when I spoke of Eva, I simply recited the tired words again like a bratty child.  We'd been over this before.  "I am the best Eva pilot.  And I am going to prove it.  To everybody."
伊娃，确实如此，" 我明确地说，以防再有误解。然而，与过去提及伊娃时语气中隐含的正义愤怒不同，我现在只是像个耍脾气的孩子，再次重复了那些陈词滥调。我们之前已经讨论过这一点。"我是最优秀的伊娃驾驶员。我要向所有人证明这一点。

Same old, same old.
一如既往，没什么变化。

Leave it to Shinji to kill the moment.  He was staring into a middle distance, the weight of the world on his shoulders again.  Granted, those shoulders seemed a little stronger now than I'd remembered, but it was a very depressing sight, nonetheless.  Smoothly, I did what I do best, which was bring his attention back to me. 
真嗣总是有本事破坏气氛。他此刻正凝视着远方，仿佛肩负着全世界的重担。虽然他的肩膀似乎比记忆中更加坚实，但这一幕依旧让人感到压抑。我熟练地做了我最拿手的事，将他的注意力重新引回到我身上。

I tapped my fist against his chest gently.  "Hey, Shinji.  You look good.  I mean it.  I bet the girls at school try to cop a feel all the time now." I grinned slyly at him.  "I can think of several who wanted to back in Two-A."
我轻轻地用拳头敲了敲他的胸膛，说道：“嘿，真嗣，你看起来状态不错。我是说真的。我敢打赌，学校里的女生现在都想找机会摸你一下。”我狡黠地对他笑了笑，补充道：“我记得在二年级 A 班时，就有好几个女生对你有意思。”

No need to mention their names, or that I might have been one of the several.  I already planned to take that particular secret to my grave. 
不必提及他们的名字，也无需说明我可能是其中之一。我早已决定将那个特别的秘密永远埋藏。

Shinji averted his eyes, suddenly becoming fascinated with a crack in the ceiling.  "Well, maybe."
真嗣转移目光，突然对天花板的一条裂缝着了迷。"嗯，或许吧。"

Oh, really! Now I was curious, but I'd die before letting him know that.  I mean, he was Shinji.  It wasn't like we could sit in the kitchen, eat something sweet and bitch about our love lives. 
哦，真的吗！这让我产生了好奇心，但我绝不会让他察觉到。毕竟，他是真嗣。我们不可能像那样坐在厨房里，吃些甜点，然后闲聊彼此的感情生活。

Again, he caught me off-guard with his question.  "Well, what about you?  You look..."
他再次用问题让我猝不及防。“那么，你呢？你看起来……”

I waited, leaning forward slightly so as not to miss his answer.
我稍稍前倾身体，静静等待，生怕漏掉他的回答。

"...you look...absolutely..."
...你看起来...真是...

I couldn't help but smile.  He was babbling like an idiot.  I had to raise my head to look him in the face--when did he get so tall?
我不禁笑了起来。他像个傻瓜一样唠叨不停。我得抬起头才能看清他的脸——他何时变得这么高了？

"Ehh...I...well, I mean....y-you know..."
呃...我...嗯，就是说...你懂的...

As funny as this was, I couldn't stand there forever and wait for him to give birth to the syllables that would form his answer.  I decided to prompt him, once again fluttering my eyelashes.  Had there been any candles lit in the room, my lashes might have put them out.  "Why, no, Shinji, I don't.  What ever could you mean?"
虽然这一幕颇为滑稽，但我不能一直站在那儿等他把那些构成答案的音节慢慢吐出。我决定再次催促他，再次眨动我的睫毛。倘若房间里点着蜡烛，我的睫毛恐怕都能将它们熄灭。“不，真嗣，我不明白。你究竟想表达什么？”

Shinji had that classic deer-in-the-headlights look.  I wondered giddily if his life was passing before his eyes as I looked into them, and suddenly I felt the smile fade from my face.
真嗣脸上浮现出那种经典的惊慌失措的神情。我兴奋地猜测，当我凝视他的双眼时，他的一生是否正在眼前一幕幕闪过，而我的笑容也随之渐渐消失。

It wasn't that I had meant to stop smiling, nor had the apartment blown up or Shinji done anything aggravating.  It was just that looking into his eyes, I realized that it takes seventeen muscles to smile, and I suddenly didn't have the energy.
并非我有意停止微笑，也不是因为公寓爆炸或真嗣做了什么惹人生气的事。只是当我凝视他的双眼时，我突然意识到微笑需要调动十七块肌肉，而我此刻却感到力不从心。

His eyes were ordinary, as eyes go.  They weren't especially bright or some flashy color.  They were just....deep.  Deep as the ocean, and I knew that it might be dangerous to look into those eyes, to allow that deep, chill dark to touch me.  Dangerous, but worth it.
他的眼睛很普通，就眼睛而言。它们并不特别明亮或是什么炫目的颜色。它们只是......深邃。深如海洋，我知道凝视那双眼睛可能是危险的，让那深邃、冰冷的黑暗触及我。虽然危险，但值得一试。

A line from some book I'd once read in school ran on little cat feet through my mind--Nietzsche, maybe?
我曾在学校读过的一本书中有一句话，像小猫的脚一样轻盈地掠过我的脑海——或许是尼采的？

"As you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you..."
当你凝视深渊时，深渊同样在凝视着你……

I was warming my hands on his skin once again, and his strength lazily made itself known to me as he stood there, perfectly still and straight, as if I weren't leaning full-out against him.
我再次将双手贴在他的肌肤上取暖，他站立不动，笔直如松，仿佛我并未全力倚靠在他身上，他的力量却懒洋洋地向我展示着。

I raised my face, our breath mingling, and...and a thin stream of blood slipped from Shinji's nose.
我抬起头，我们的呼吸交织在一起，接着……一丝鲜血从真嗣的鼻中悄然滑落。

Strike two! Should I throw the ball one more time?
已经两次击中了！我还要再投一次球吗？

"Same old perverted Shinji." I couldn't help but laugh, pressing my hand to his cheek in a mock slap.  I could feel the burn of his blush under my touch.
“依旧是那个变态的真嗣。”我忍不住笑了起来，用手轻触他的脸颊，仿佛要给他一记耳光。我能感受到他因羞涩而泛起的红晕在我指尖下愈发炽热。

All right, enough games.  I was hungry, and I wasn't going to give any more freebies to a guy who'd had two perfect opportunities to make a move and didn't.  Do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dollars.
好了，游戏就玩到这里。我饿了，对于一个明明有两次完美机会却没采取行动的人，我不会再白白付出。别想着“Go”，也别想拿那两百美元。

"So what'd you fix me for dinner? I couldn't find anything to eat in the kitchen before." I'd ransacked the cabinets looking for those instant heatable eatables the apartment had once been stocked with, but hadn't found any.
“那你准备给我做什么晚饭呢？之前我在厨房里什么吃的都没找到。”我翻遍了橱柜，希望能找到公寓曾经备有的那些即热即食的方便食品，可惜一无所获。

"Nothing special.  Just some of your not-so-favorite bland Japanese food." Shinji's voice was muffled as he wiped his nose.
"没什么特别的，只是一些你不太喜欢的平淡日本料理。" 真嗣擦着鼻子，声音有些含糊。

"Oh, joy," I said, not bothering to pretend to be enthused.  Shinji would have known it was an act.  "I will admit I missed your cooking, but I hope you've improved these last few years.  I'm not as easy to impress as I used to be," I warned.
“哦，真高兴，”我淡淡地说，无需假装兴奋。真嗣一眼就能看穿那只是表演。“我得承认，我确实怀念你的厨艺，但愿这几年你有所长进。我可不像从前那样容易被取悦了，”我提醒道。

"Easy?" he exclaimed.  "I used to think it would take a Third and Fourth Impact to impress you.  Now I really am scared!"
“简单吗？”他喊道，“我曾以为只有第三次和第四次冲击才能让你动容。现在我真感到害怕了！”

I tapped my fist against his chest--not so gently this time, just to show him I meant business.  "Well, maybe I am a little easier to impress.  Don't forget, that was over three years ago.  I'm not such a little girl anymore," I finished haughtily, turning away from him.
我用手轻敲他的胸膛——这次没那么温柔，只是为了让他明白我的认真。“好吧，或许我确实更容易被打动。别忘了，那已经是三年多以前的事了。我不再是那个小女孩了。”我带着一丝傲慢说完，转身背对他。

Shinji seemed to have gotten smarter--he said nothing at all.
真嗣似乎变得更聪明了——他一言不发。

Turning back to face him, I stamped my foot impatiently.  "Come on, are you going to feed me or what? I haven't eaten since the flight; I feel like chewing the couch."
我转过身面对他，不耐烦地跺了跺脚，催促道：“快点，你到底要不要给我吃的？我从飞机上下来到现在都没吃东西，感觉自己饿得都能啃沙发了。”

The growl of my stomach was abnormally loud in the quiet of the room.  Oh, how embarrassing.  I clapped a hand over my abdomen.
我的肚子咕噜声在静谧的房间里显得格外响亮。哦，真是尴尬。我连忙用手捂住了腹部。

I raised my eyebrows at Shinji, in a "you see?" manner. 
我向真嗣扬了扬眉毛，仿佛在说：“你看，我说对了吧？”

He smiled at me, and you'd think an angel--a true angel--had eyes like that.  No one's eyes were that kind.
他朝我微笑，那眼神仿佛来自一位真正的天使。世间无人拥有如此善良的目光。

"Yeah, come on, before it gets cold." He led the way back to the kitchen.
“对，快来，趁热吃。”他带头回到厨房。

I had never been so happy to see food, even if it was Japanese food.  Of course, I was so hungry I probably could have eaten seaweed and rocks, but I digress...
我从未如此高兴见到食物，哪怕是日本料理。说真的，当时我饿得估计连海藻和石头都能吞下，不过这话题扯远了...

The food was actually pretty good.  Maybe I was getting easier to impress, but Shinji had done a pretty good job with dinner.  I popped the tab on one of the cans he had so thoughtfully placed on the table.  I was beginning to appreciate how Misato treated her problems with our good friend alcohol.  If my latest trip to Tokyo-3 was anything like the last one, I was going to station myself outside Misato's special fridge and not leave it till I was unconscious.
食物的味道确实不错。或许是我变得更容易满足了，但真嗣的晚餐准备得相当出色。我打开了他细心摆放在桌上的一个罐头。我开始体会到美里是如何借助我们这位好朋友——酒精——来应对问题的。如果我最近一次去东京-3 的经历和上次相似，我打算守在美里的特别冰箱旁，直到我醉得不省人事。

Shinji's eyes grew slowly wider as I ate and drank, until they looked like the empty plate in front of me.
随着我吃喝，真嗣的眼睛逐渐睁大，最后仿佛映照出我面前空荡荡的盘子。

I reached for his plate and he obliged me, sliding it across the table to me.  I was examining this delightful little sauce that had been set out when I realized the beer cans were empty.
我伸手去取他的盘子，他欣然应允，将盘子滑到我面前。我正细细品味着这美妙的小酱汁，却突然发现啤酒罐已经空空如也。

I debated over it for a second, but it was my first night back in Tokyo-3.  Didn't I deserve a lousy beer?
我对此犹豫了一下，但毕竟这是我回到第三新东京的第一个晚上。难道我不该享受一杯普通的啤酒吗？

" 'ey, Finji!" I said, my words muffled by food.  I could have waited to chew and swallow, but somehow I felt it would take too long.  There was still half a plate of food in front of me that was commanding my immediate attention.
“嘿，Finji！”我含着食物说道，声音有些模糊。我本可以等吃完再说话，但总觉得那样太慢。面前还有半盘食物，正牢牢抓住我的注意力。

Not wanting to waste any more words, I gestured at the empty cans.  Shinji understood perfectly and retrieved the rest of the six-pack from the fridge.  I rewarded him for his perceptiveness with a smile and twisted open the first beer.
不愿再多费唇舌，我示意了一下空罐子。真嗣立刻明白，从冰箱里取出了剩下的六罐啤酒。我因他的机敏而微笑，并旋开了第一罐啤酒。

I sighed happily once I'd drained the last of the can.  I couldn't stop a small belch from escaping me.  My compliments to the chef.
喝完最后一口罐装饮料后，我满足地叹了口气，忍不住打了个小嗝。向厨师表示敬意。

"Man, you did get better at cooking.  That actually hit the spot, Shinji," I said, amused by the way the empty cans would occasionally try to dance.  Or maybe I was more tipsy than I thought.
“真嗣，你的厨艺确实见长啊。那道菜真是恰到好处，”我笑着说，看着空罐子偶尔像是要跳舞的样子，不禁觉得有趣。或许，我比自己以为的还要醉意朦胧。

"Thanks," he said, in a soft voice that held a kind of quiet awe.  "Hey, Asuka?"
“谢谢，”他轻声说道，语气中流露出一种平静的敬意。“嘿，明日香？”

"Hmm?" I asked, trying to catch the cans in the act.  Seemed like every time I turned my head, they started whispering about me.
“嗯？”我疑惑地问，试图当场逮住那些罐子。好像每次我一转头，它们就开始对我窃窃私语。

"Since when did you take up drinking?" Shinji asked, looking a bit perplexed.  But who wouldn't, when the table was moving like that?
“你什么时候开始喝酒的？” 真嗣问道，显得有些困惑。毕竟桌子晃成那样，谁都会感到不解。

Oh, that.  I waved a hand dismissively.  "Oh, back in college...the second time...lots of parties, you know."
哦，那个啊。我随意地挥了挥手，说道：“哦，回到大学时……第二次……你知道的，有很多派对。”

Shinji smiled and nodded.  At least I think he nodded.
真嗣微笑着点了点头。至少我觉得他是点头了。

I heard the door open, and knew who it was before she yelled, "Shinji! I'm home! Is Asuka here yet?"
我听到门被打开的声音，还没等她喊出“真嗣！我回来了！明日香到了吗？”我就已经知道是谁了。

Of course I was here! I was home, too.  I smiled a little at the thought.
当然我在这里！我也在家。想到这一点，我不禁微微一笑。

I ran to greet Misato, too impatient to wait for her to get into the kitchen.  If I hugged her too hard, I hadn't meant to.  It was just that the familiarity made me smile.  And I kept smiling, as we sat and talked, while Shinji moved around the kitchen. 
我急忙跑去迎接美里，等不及她走进厨房。也许我抱她抱得太紧了，但这并非我的本意。只是那份熟悉的情感让我不由自主地微笑。我们坐下交谈时，我始终面带微笑，而真嗣则在厨房里忙来忙去。

"Asuka, are you still hungry?" he asked.
"明日香，你是不是还觉得饿？" 他问道。

I was glad he'd asked.  "Damn right I am.  And keep the beers coming," I directed, drawing a rousing affirmative from Misato.
我很高兴他问了。“当然是的。继续上啤酒，”我指示道，美里热情地表示赞同。

Shinji obliged, and I spent the next hours in contentment, surrounded by talk and food and alcohol.  Surrounded by my family.  The clink of dishes made me smile.  Misato was telling a story that I was sure would have been extremely obscene if she hadn't kept losing her train of thought and having to start over.  Shinji was chuckling softly at her silliness, and it was that sound that touched me through the noise of running water and clinking forks and beer cans against the table.  His soft laugh warmed me more than the alcohol that heated my blood.
真嗣欣然应允，接下来的几个小时我沉浸在满足中，被谈话、美食和酒精所包围，身边是我的家人。餐具的叮当声让我微笑。美里正在讲一个故事，我确信如果她没有不断失去思路并不得不重新开始的话，这个故事会非常下流。真嗣轻声笑着她的傻气，正是这个声音穿透了流水声、餐叉的叮当声和啤酒罐敲击桌面的噪音触动了我。他轻柔的笑声比加热我血液的酒精更让我感到温暖。

When he had finished the dishes, he turned in the doorway, his silhouette dark against the hall light streaming in behind him.  "I'm going to bed," he called softly.
洗完碗碟后，他站在门口转身，身影在身后倾泻的门厅灯光中显得暗淡。他轻声喊道：“我要去睡了。”

"G'night, Shinji," Misato chirped.
"晚安，真嗣。" 美里轻快地说道。

" 'Night, Shinji," I murmured.  Speaking suddenly seemed a chore.
'夜晚，真嗣，' 我轻声呢喃。一时间，开口说话竟变得如此费力。

"Goodnight, Misato.  Goodnight, Asuka," he said, and added, "It's good to have you back."
他对美里说：“晚安，美里。晚安，明日香。”接着又道：“很高兴你回来了。”

It was good to be back, I decided, watching his smoothly muscled form become smaller and smaller as he moved down the hallway, like an underwater swimmer in a darkening sea.
回到这里感觉真好，我心想。他那肌肉线条流畅的身影在走廊上渐行渐远，变得越来越小，宛如在逐渐暗淡的海水中潜游的泳者。

*****

I hadn't expected to fit back into the world of Tokyo-3 like...well, me into my plugsuit.  Instead of finding hurtful proof that Hikari's life had proceeded on without me, she welcomed me back into it with open arms.  I was only beginning to realize what an amazing thing true friendship was, to have a sort of power over time.
我原本没想过能像穿上驾驶服那样自然地重新融入东京-3 的生活。我以为会发现光的生活已经继续，没有我的痕迹，但她却热情地欢迎我回来。我开始明白，真正的友谊是多么神奇，它似乎能超越时间的限制。

Only one thing marred my passage back into Tokyo-3 life, but I was bound to see Wondergirl and Nagisa sooner or later.  There was just something about those two  that made the hackles on the back of my neck rise.  I felt very proud of myself for not doing violence to them.  Strangely, no one seemed to share my opinion, but I dismissed it as simply a show of solidarity to the preexisting group.  I was once again new in town, after all.
重返东京-3 的生活中，唯有一事令我不快，那就是我迟早要面对 Wondergirl 和 Nagisa。他们总让我感到不安。我为自己克制住没有对他们动粗而感到自豪。奇怪的是，周围人似乎并不认同我的看法，但我将其视为对原有群体的团结支持。毕竟，我又一次成了这座城市的新来者。

But oh, just to smash my fist against Wondergirl's bleached cheek--just once! Maybe THAT would bring some expression to that stone face!...
然而，真想一拳打在奇迹女孩那漂白的脸颊上——哪怕就一次！或许那样能让那张毫无表情的脸有所变化！...

Ah, I digress.
哎呀，我扯远了。

I had been in Tokyo-3 a week.  Nothing had exploded, and no one was dead.  I took it as a good sign. 
我在第三新东京市已度过一周，期间未有爆炸发生，也无人丧生。我视之为吉兆。

I was slightly disappointed to see Shinji wearing a loose t-shirt over his sweats when he walked into the room on Friday night, rather than the testosterone treat I had experienced on the day I'd arrived.
周五晚上，真嗣穿着宽松的 T 恤走进房间，而非我初来乍到时所见的那般充满男性魅力，这让我略感失望。

But first things first.  "What's for dinner?"
不过，先说正事。 "晚餐准备吃什么？"

"What do you want?" he asked, stopping in front of me.
他停在我面前，问道：“你想要什么？”

An interesting change of plans.  I sat up on the loveseat and gave him a smile.  "Well, it isn't fair for you to cook all the time.  How about you order a pizza tonight? Hikari told me about this new place she talked Touji into taking her to a couple weeks ago..."
计划突然有了有趣的转变。我坐直在双人沙发上，向他展露微笑。“总是让你做饭可不公平，今晚不如订个披萨吧？光之前跟我提过，几周前她让透司带她去了一家新开的店……”

Shinji laughed.  "My treat, I'm guessing?"
真嗣笑着说：“我猜是我请客吧？”

I chucked my beer can at him.  "You're a quick study.  Bring me another?"
我将啤酒罐朝他扔去，说道：“你学得真快。能再给我拿一瓶吗？”

He plucked the can out of the air easily and went into the kitchen.  He returned with the phone book, the portable phone, and another beer.  I gratefully accepted the beer while he dialed.
他轻松地从空中抓起罐子，走进厨房。回来时，手里多了电话簿、便携电话和另一罐啤酒。我感激地接过啤酒，而他开始拨号。

"Umm, Asuka?" he asked, the phone tucked between his shoulder and chin.
“呃，明日香？”他问道，手机正夹在肩颈之间。

I killed the last of the beer and scrunched the can in my hand before batting it in his direction.  "Yeah?"
我喝光了最后一罐啤酒，随手将空罐捏扁，朝他那边扔去，问道：“怎么？”

"What do you want on your pizza?"
您想在披萨上放些什么？

Shinji and I rarely agreed on anything.  I had a feeling pizza toppings wouldn't be any different.  "Just get one with everything on it."
我和真嗣很少有意见一致的时候。我想披萨配料也不会例外。“就点一个什么都加的吧。”

He repeated the order into the phone.  And I swear, that was the easiest time I ever had talking Shinji Ikari into anything.
他对着电话重复了命令。我敢说，那是我最轻松的一次说服碇真嗣做任何事。

After he hung up, he returned the phone book to the kitchen.  I was surprised and pleased to see him return with another beer without me having to ask for it.
挂断电话后，他将电话簿归还厨房。我惊喜地看到他主动拿了一瓶啤酒回来，无需我开口请求。

"Hey, Shinji?" I asked suddenly, squirming on the love seat that I had staked out as mine.  "When did Misato get rid of the couch and bean-bags in favor of this thing and...that thing?" I waved my hand at the recliner he was sitting in.
“嘿，真嗣？”我突然开口，在那个我专属的双人沙发上不安地挪动。“美里是什么时候把沙发和懒人沙发换成这个……还有那个的？”我指了指他坐着的躺椅。

Shinji smiled at me.  "Actually, that was my doing.  After you left..." He paused slightly but continued, "...I decided these would be a bit more practical, considering we stopped having guests of any sort, and Misato was rarely home.  These gave us a bit more floor space and they were easier to move around so I could clean underneath them.  Plus the couch smelled like beer from where Misato had spilled so many." He wrinkled his nose slightly and I quickly moved the beer in my hand to the floor, out of his line of sight.  "Oh."
真嗣对我微笑着说：“其实，那是我安排的。你走之后……”他稍作停顿，接着说，“……考虑到我们已经不再接待客人，美里又经常不在家，我觉得这些家具更实用。它们让空间显得更宽敞，也便于移动，方便我打扫底下。而且，沙发上满是啤酒味，因为美里洒得到处都是。”他微微皱了皱鼻子，我赶紧把手里的啤酒放到地上，不让真嗣看到。“哦。”

I looked up from hiding the beer and met his eyes.  He'd watched me the entire time.  So much for being inconspicuous.  I squirmed on the love seat under his scrutiny.
我从藏啤酒的地方抬头，正好与他目光相接。原来他一直盯着我看，想要不引人注意是不可能了。在他审视的目光下，我在沙发上感到局促不安。

"Hey," he said suddenly, as if the thought had just struck him.  "How come you're home tonight?"
“嘿，”他突然开口，好像刚想到似的。“你今晚怎么会在家呢？”

I breathed a sigh of relief.  (A small sigh.) He didn't care about the beer.  "No one to go out with tonight," I said with a shrug, lounging on the love seat.
我轻轻地松了口气。他对啤酒毫不在意。“今晚没人陪我出去，”我耸耸肩，慵懒地躺在双人沙发上说道。

There was no one else in the room with us, but even if there had been no one would have been more surprised than I at what Shinji said next.
房间里除了我们没有别人，但即便有旁人在场，也不会有人比我听到真嗣接下来那番话时更感震惊。

"Hey," he said suddenly, turning towards me.  "After we eat, you wanna go out? Like for a walk or a movie or something?"
“嘿，”他突然转过身来对我说，“吃完饭咱们出去走走怎么样？散个步或者看场电影什么的？”

The idea sounded almost as appealing as the pizza that was soon to arrive at our door, but I reminded myself that I had to play hard to get.  Considering that Shinji usually played easy to avoid, I was out of practice, but I had to make him come to me.
这个想法听起来几乎和即将送上门的披萨一样吸引人，但我提醒自己必须保持难以接近的姿态。由于真嗣通常采取容易回避的策略，我已经很久没有练习了，但我必须设法让他主动来找我。

"Well, normally I'd say sure--as long as you were paying, of course--but there's a movie I want to watch coming on tonight."
“一般来说，我会答应的——当然前提是你请客——不过今晚有部电影我想看。”

"Ah," he said, a flash behind his eyes betraying an emotion that I couldn't place.  Trying to read Shinji's thoughts was like looking at lights shining through wax paper--all I could see was color, not shape.
“啊，”他开口了，眼中闪过一抹难以捉摸的情绪。想要揣摩真嗣的心思，就如同透过蜡纸看灯光——我能感受到的只是斑斓色彩，却无法捕捉其具体形态。

He said nothing more.  He was making it very difficult to play hard to get--who gives up after the first try?! It looked like I was going to have to take over from here.  "I'll tell you what, though," I said, trying to bring his attention back on me and off the commercial for the mechanical hairbrush.
他没再多言。他这样让我很难继续装作难以接近——谁会在初次尝试后就放弃呢？！看来我得接手了。“不过，我可以告诉你，”我开口道，试图将他的注意力从那款机械发刷的广告上转移到我身上。

"Huh?" he said, mesmerized by the spinning brush.
“啊？”他目不转睛地盯着旋转的刷子，完全被吸引住了。

Well, close enough.  Time to move in for the kill.  "If you can manage to sit here and watch this scary movie with me without so much as TWITCHING--" I over-exaggerated the word "twitching", taking special care to pronounce each syllable.  "--I'll let you take me out tomorrow night.  Your treat, of course," I added silkily. 
好吧，差不多了。是时候发起攻势了。“如果你能坐在这儿陪我看这部恐怖片，连眼皮都不眨一下——”我特意夸张了“眨眼”这个词，每个音节都发得清清楚楚。“——那明天晚上我就让你带我出去。当然，你请客，”我柔声补充道。

I reclined on the loveseat, having thrown my bomb.  However, the explosion came from an unexpected corner.
我斜倚在长沙发上，炸弹已经出手。不料，爆炸声却从一处未曾预料的角落传来。

"What?!" Shinji's eyes spat angry sparks in my direction.  "You don't think I can sit through some stupid movie without wetting myself, do you?"
什么？！" 真嗣瞪着我，眼中闪烁着怒火。"你以为我连看个无聊电影都会尿裤子吗？

I couldn't help but smirk at his tone.  "Please.  You used to be afraid of your own shadow, and this movie is supposed to be pretty gory, so I'm going to have to go with 'no' on that one." I chuckled, which was like dousing Shinji's anger with gasoline.
我禁不住对他的语气嗤之以鼻。“得了吧。你以前连自己的影子都害怕，这部电影据说相当血腥，所以我只能回答‘不’。”我笑了，这无异于给真嗣的怒火浇上了汽油。

"All right, you're on! So what do I get if I win?"
好的，你来吧！要是我赢了，有什么奖励呢？

I sighed impatiently.  "I already told you that, stupid.  If you win, you get the privilege of taking the most beautiful girl in Tokyo-3 out to dinner, a movie, and a bit of shopping--all at your expense."
我有些不耐烦地叹了口气。“笨蛋，我不是早说过了吗？要是你赢了，就能带东京-3 最漂亮的女孩去吃晚餐、看电影，顺便逛逛街——所有开销都算你的。”

Shinji was no dope.  He shook his head at me.  "No way.  That'll be if I lose.  If win, you get to take me out to dinner and a movie and you pick up the tab."
真嗣并不傻。他向我摇头说：“没门儿。只有我输了才那样。要是我赢了，你就得请我吃晚饭看电影，账单你来结。”

The tables were turning so fast I was dizzy! "What?!" I shrieked, sitting bolt upright on the love seat.  "No way!"
桌子转得飞快，我感到一阵眩晕。“什么？！”我惊叫一声，猛地坐直在沙发上。“这怎么可能！”

Shinji also snapped to attention, the *clack* of the recliner's footrest snapping into place seeming as loud as a gunshot to me.  "Yes way! If I can make it through this movie without so much as yelping in surprise or getting up and leaving, you get to take me out to dinner and a movie.  If I lose, I'll take you out to whatever restaurant you want, to the most expensive theater in Tokyo-3, and on an all-night shopping trip!"
真嗣也突然挺直了身子，躺椅的脚托“咔嚓”一声弹回原位，在我听来响得像枪声。“当然可以！如果我能看完这部电影而不惊叫或起身离开，你就得请我吃饭看电影。如果我输了，我就带你去你想要的任何餐厅，去东京-3 最贵的影院，再进行一整晚的购物狂欢！”

We stared holes into each other as I weighed my options.  There was the slightest, smallest, almost nonexistent chance that I'd gotten in over my head here...
我们互相凝视，我在心中衡量着各种可能性。虽然我可能已经超出了自己的能力范围，但这种可能性极其微小，几乎可以忽略不计...

On the other hand, Shinji had never stood up to me like this before; he'd always had a pipe cleaner for a spine.  Only now he was glowering at me, his nostrils flaring slightly, as though any minute he'd start breathing fire.  Even though he was frowning, it changed his face wonderfully for the better in comparison to his usual blank, open, chalkboard expression.  The fire of feeling had heated his blood and lit him up from the inside out.  It was amazing to watch.
另一方面，真嗣以前从未这样顶撞过我；他总是显得软弱无力。但现在他正怒视着我，鼻孔微微张开，仿佛随时都会喷出火来。尽管他在皱眉，但与平时那种空白、开放、像粉笔板一样的表情相比，这让他看起来好多了。情感的火焰已经加热了他的血液，从内到外照亮了他。看着真是令人惊叹。

I smiled silkily.  We'd see if Shinji's new steel spine could hold him up against me.  "You've surprised me twice tonight, Third Child.  Let's see if you can make it three."
我狡猾地笑了笑。真嗣的新钢铁意志能否支撑他与我抗衡，我们拭目以待。“今晚你已让我惊讶两次，第三适格者。且看你能否再创奇迹。”

That fire reached his eyes, sparked in their dark depths, then flared into an answering smile, a challenging smile.  "I'm going to win."
那火焰点燃了他的眼眸，在深邃的暗处闪耀，随即绽放出回应的笑容，带着挑战的意味。“我会赢得胜利。”

I snorted.  "Please! I'll take the Vegas odds on that one.  Now, go get me another beer, will you? The movie starts in half an hour."
我轻蔑地哼了一声。“得了吧！我愿意赌拉斯维加斯的赔率。现在，去帮我再拿一瓶啤酒，好吗？电影还有半小时就开始了。”

The pizza looked like a deli display case, which was just the way I liked it.  I experienced a very rare feeling of contentment as the movie's opening credits started.  I couldn't quite place what was making me feel so, but I had a sneaking suspicion it had very little to do with either the pizza or the alcohol.
那披萨宛如熟食店的橱窗展示，正合我意。电影开场时，我感受到了一种难得的满足感。虽然说不清具体原因，但我隐约觉得这份感觉与披萨或酒精并无太大关联。

I wasn't entirely sure I understood movies, but I took comfort in the fact that you don't have to understand something to enjoy it.  For instance, I couldn't understand why actors and actresses got paid more money than teachers and police officers.  I also couldn't understand why people would watch movies full of blood, gore, and monsters when sudden instant death lurked right in their own backyards.  Perhaps a fictional story about a murdering psychopath was more palatable to people who lived in constant fear of bug-eyed, lance-wielding, geofront-drilling monsters dropping from the sky before they'd had their morning coffee.  Human opponents seemed slightly more defeatable next to the angels, I suppose.
我并非完全确定自己是否真正理解电影，但我从中找到了安慰，因为享受某物并不一定需要理解其内涵。比如，我不理解为何演员和女演员的收入会超过教师和警察。我也不理解为何人们会选择观看充斥着血腥、暴力和怪物的电影，而现实生活中突如其来的死亡威胁就潜伏在他们的后院。或许，对于那些时刻生活在对虫眼、持矛、地表钻探怪物从天而降的恐惧中的人来说，一个关于连环杀手的虚构故事更容易接受，尤其是在他们享用早晨咖啡之前。相较之下，人类对手似乎显得稍微更容易被打败，我想。

Shinji seemed rather bored with the whole affair, but it was difficult to watch the movie and him at the same time.  If I focused the majority of my attention on him, the movie would startle me with cheap special effects or creepy music.  If I kept the majority of my attention on the movie, I found my eyes wandering back to Shinji instead.  I was caught between a rock and a hard place.  A very hard place.
真嗣看起来对这一切颇为厌倦，然而要同时关注电影和他却颇为困难。若我将大部分注意力投向他，电影中的廉价特效或阴森音乐便会突然惊吓到我。而当我专注于电影时，我的视线又不由自主地飘回真嗣身上。我仿佛被夹在岩石与坚硬之地之间，处境十分艰难。

Shinji finally felt the weight of my stare after several minutes of me watching him watch the movie.
在凝视他看电影几分钟后，真嗣终于感受到了我目光的压力。

"What is it, Asuka?" he asked.
他问：“怎么了，明日香？”

Whoops.  I hadn't expected him to notice.  I groped for an excuse, seizing the lamest possible one I could come up with.
哎呀，我没想到他会注意到。我慌忙寻找借口，急中生智，却只想到一个最蹩脚的理由。

"Umm...you...err...ah..." I couldn't stop a nervous chuckle from bubbling in my throat and spilling out.  "D'you think you could...y'know, come sit by me? I'm a little bit...cold...and...and..." I rushed the last bit, having been inspired late.  "And I need help finishing these last two pieces of pizza."
嗯...你...呃...啊..." 我不禁发出了一阵紧张的笑声。 "你能...你知道，过来坐我旁边吗？我有点...冷...而且...而且..." 我急忙补充道，灵感来得有点晚。 "而且我需要帮忙解决这两片披萨。

Oh, lame.  Way to go, Sorhyu.  I should have just worn a pin that said, "I'm Captain Obvious.  Ask me how."
哎，真没劲。索赫尤，你真是绝了。我应该戴个徽章，上面写着：“我是奥布里队长，问我怎么回事。”

Shinji simply said, "Yeah, sure," and I squirmed as he moved closer.  I felt the need to make up for my faux pas, glaring at him as I said, "If you so much as think of touching me, pervert, I'll break every last one of your fingers and gouge your eyeballs from their sockets."
真嗣只是淡淡地回应：“嗯，当然。”他靠近时，我感到一阵不安。为了弥补刚才的失礼，我瞪着他，厉声警告：“你要是敢碰我，变态，我就把你每根手指都折断，把你的眼珠子从眼眶里挖出来。”

Shinji relaxed further, seeming not to have heard the threat.  He folded his hands behind his head and sighed, "Wouldn't dream of it, Asuka."
真嗣显得更加放松，仿佛没有听到那番威胁。他双手枕在脑后，叹息道：“我可没想过，明日香。”

I clamped my lips together, trying not to growl in frustration.  What the hell was wrong with him? I was flashing a green light right under his nose, and he looked like he was about to fall asleep!
我紧紧抿住嘴唇，竭力克制着不因挫败而低吼。他究竟出了什么问题？我明明就在他眼前给出了明确的信号，他却显得昏昏欲睡！

Somehow, it seemed that the more agitated I got, the more comatose Shinji became.  By now, I was a tightly leashed bundle of fury beside him.  I sat and stewed while he watched the movie.  I was just about to turn to him and give him a piece of my mind when the movie's soundtrack suddenly changed.
不知怎的，我越是激动，真嗣就越显得昏昏欲睡。此刻，我就像一团被紧紧束缚的怒火，坐在他身旁。他看电影时，我坐着生闷气。正当我准备转身向他发泄时，电影的配乐突然变了。

Okay, the monster was lame and looked like it was made of papier-mâché, and the acting was so wooden we could have started a fire with it, but I wasn't ready for it! It attacked the actors, dismembering one in a great gout of fake blood and other fluids, complete with creepy music.
好吧，那怪物制作粗糙，看起来像是用纸糊的，演员的表演也生硬到足以用来生火，但我还没准备好！它袭击了演员，将其中一个肢解，喷出大量假血和其他液体，伴随着诡异的音乐。

When I opened my eyes, which had been squeezed shut, I found myself huddling against something warm and impossibly solid.
当我睁开紧闭的双眼，发现自己正紧靠着某个温暖且异常坚实的物体。

A ripple coursed through the body beside me; a small laugh.  How dare he laugh at me? It was all his fault it startled me anyway! If he hadn't made me so mad...
我身旁的人身体微微一颤，发出了一声轻笑。他怎么敢嘲笑我？说到底，吓到我都是他的错！要不是他让我如此恼火...

I smacked my hand flat against his chest, open palm, feeling the sting shock my skin.  "What the hell are you laughing at, jerk? It just so happens that--"
我一巴掌重重地拍在他的胸前，掌心传来一阵刺痛。“你这个家伙，到底在笑什么？真是碰巧——”

Shinji's smile was wicked as he pointed to the screen.  I turned automatically, as anyone might when someone points at something.
真嗣指着屏幕，脸上带着邪恶的笑容，我自然而然地转过头去，就像任何人被指着什么时会做的那样。

I turned just in time to see someone's arm get ripped out of its socket by the pasted-together movie monstrosity.  I shrieked again, one of those embarrassing little yip screams that are so girly.  I instinctively curled almost into a ball, trying to hide against my only shield.  Laughter shook Shinji, shook us both.
我恰好转身，正好看到某人的手臂被那拼凑而成的电影怪物从关节处撕扯下来。我再次尖叫，发出那种令人尴尬的小声尖叫，显得非常女孩子气。我本能地蜷缩成一团，试图躲在我唯一的盾牌后面。笑声震撼了真嗣，也震撼了我们俩。

"You asshole," I growled through gritted teeth.  "You did that on purpose!"
“你这个混蛋，”我咬紧牙关低声怒斥，“你绝对是故意的！”

Shinji executed an almost perfect innocent face.  I could practically see the halo above his dark head, but the oily smile ruined it.  "What are you talking about?"
真嗣装出一副几乎无懈可击的无辜模样。我几乎能想象到他头顶那隐约的光环，然而那油滑的笑容却将其破坏殆尽。“你到底在说什么呢？”

I snorted and refused to look at him.  The only way to do that was to nestle against his chest and focus on the tv.  He didn't squirm away; rather he circled an arm around me, his hand lightly cupping my shoulder, as if he were afraid I'd get away from him.
我嗤之以鼻，不愿看他。唯一的方法是依偎在他胸前，专注于电视。他没有躲开；相反，他用一只手臂环抱着我，手轻轻搭在我的肩上，仿佛担心我会从他身边溜走。

My heart was knocking against my breastbone almost painfully.  I tried to slow it down by concentrating on it, but it was impossible to concentrate on my own heartbeat when Shinji's was so close and loud against me.  I found the rhythm soothing, almost like a lullaby.  When I tried to concentrate on my heart again, I found it had slowed to catch up to his. 
我的心跳剧烈地撞击着胸骨，几乎让我感到疼痛。我试图通过专注于此来减缓心跳，但当真嗣的心跳如此贴近且强烈地影响着我时，我无法专注于自己的心跳。我发现他的心跳节奏令人感到安慰，仿佛一首摇篮曲。当我再次尝试专注于自己的心跳时，我发现它已经自然地减缓，以适应他的节奏。

It was there, not in Eva, that I learned the true meaning of synchronization.
我在那里，而非伊娃之中，真正理解了同步的深刻含义。

The music changed again, building up to another suspenseful attack.  This time I vowed to be ready, eyes wide and focused intently on the screen.  I dared not even blink.  I studied every crawl space on the screen, searching for the monster.
音乐又一次转变，逐渐酝酿出新一轮的紧张气氛。这次我决心做好准备，双眼圆睁，全神贯注地凝视着屏幕。我连眨眼都不敢。我仔细观察屏幕上的每一处角落，搜寻着那个怪物的踪迹。

So of course I was caught completely off-guard when Shinji used the hand he'd cupped around my shoulder to shake me, his voice growling in a poor imitation of an already cheesy creature.
因此，当真嗣用他搭在我肩上的手摇晃我时，我完全出乎意料，他用声音模仿那种本就俗套的生物，却模仿得十分蹩脚。

I had never screamed so loudly in my life.  I could barely suck in enough breath to add, "Shinji, you ASSHOLE!" before I launched myself at him.  Our combined weight was too much for the love seat, and it teetered for a suspenseful second before tipping over and crashing to the floor.  I rode Shinji's body all the way down, and was straddling him when we landed.  I pinned him with my body, holding him down with one hand and wailing on him with the other, snarling obscenities the whole time.
我一生中从未如此大声尖叫过。我几乎无法吸入足够的空气来补充一句“真嗣，你这个混蛋！”就向他扑了过去。我们两人的重量对那张爱情沙发来说太重了，它在紧张的一秒钟内摇摇欲坠，然后翻倒在地。我骑在真嗣身上一起摔下，落地时跨坐在他身上。我用身体压住他，一只手按住他，另一只手猛击他，同时不停地咒骂。

It wasn't much of a fight.  Shinji wasn't really trying; he weakly attempted to fend me off, seizing my wrist before I could land another punch.  I felt the strength in that hand, an iron cuff around my wrist. 
那场战斗并不激烈。真嗣并未全力以赴，只是无力地试图抵挡我，在我打出下一拳之前抓住了我的手腕。我能感觉到那只手的力量，如同铁箍一般紧紧束缚着我的手腕。

Shinji was chuckling like a little kid, not even paying attention, and there I was, barely able to hold my own.  When had he become so strong? When had laughter come so easily to him? Had it always been that way, and I'd never noticed?
真嗣像个孩子般咯咯笑着，完全不在意，而我却几乎难以自持。他何时变得如此强大？何时开始如此轻松地笑出声？难道这一切一直都在，只是我未曾察觉？

Once again I was caught in that strange riptide he'd put me through the day I'd come back.  I tried to slow my breathing, suddenly realizing my position.  Shinji was lying flat on his back beneath me.  I was straddling his body, pinning him between my thighs.  I could feel his ribs move beneath me with his breathing.  If I stayed perfectly still, I could feel the rising and falling of his chest, and consequently my body, as he breathed, as if I weighed nothing at all.
再次陷入他那天让我经历的奇异激流中，我努力平复呼吸，突然意识到自己的姿势。真嗣平躺在我身下，而我跨坐在他身上，用双腿紧紧夹住他。我能感受到他的肋骨随着呼吸在我身下轻轻移动。若我保持完全静止，便能清晰地感受到他的胸膛随着呼吸的起伏，带动我的身体，仿佛我轻若无物。

Shinji's lips were parted, his eyes dew-bright beneath half-mast lids.  He'd been laughing so hard tears had begun to trickle down his cheeks.  He was slightly flushed from the effort, and I was so suddenly aware of his breath pushing past his lips to cloud hotly against my skin.  I wanted desperately to wrench my hands from his grip and slide them up his chest to feel his heart hammering.  Such exertion would make it race, I could almost feel it beating against my palms...but I was afraid to move, as if some spell would break.
真嗣的唇瓣微启，眼眸在半垂的眼睑下闪烁着泪光。他笑得如此剧烈，泪水开始顺着脸颊滑落。由于用力，他的脸颊微微泛红，我突然意识到他的呼吸热切地穿过双唇，在我的皮肤上形成雾气。我迫切地想要挣脱他的握手，将双手滑向他胸前，感受他心脏的剧烈跳动。这样的努力会让心跳加速，我几乎能感觉到它在我手掌下跳动……但我害怕移动，仿佛某种咒语会被打破。

My stomach fell, the way it would in an elevator.  Every muscle in my body was as weak as water.  His hands still clutched my wrists.  I was held completely captive by that simple, gentle touch.  The only sound was the rhythm of his breathing, slowing finally as we stared at one another.
我的胃部如同在电梯中失重般下沉，全身肌肉软弱无力。他的双手依旧紧握我的手腕，我完全被这简单却温柔的触碰所俘获。四周一片寂静，唯有他呼吸的节奏在我们对视中逐渐放缓。

Shinji's eyes searched me as he lay beneath me, completely vulnerable, completely fearless.  No man's eyes had ever rested quite like that on me before.  They darkened so with pure desire.
真嗣躺在我身下，他的目光紧紧锁定我，显得如此脆弱却又毫无畏惧。从未有人以这样的眼神注视过我，那双眼眸因纯粹的渴望而变得深邃。

I couldn't move, couldn't speak.  All I could do was wait, helpless, so helpless in his hands. 
我无法动弹，也无法言语。只能无助地等待，在他掌控下显得如此无力。

A smile spread slowly across his face.  Those heated onyx eyes fixed right on mine...and one closed briefly in a wink.
他的脸上慢慢绽开一抹微笑。那双炽热如黑曜石的眼睛直勾勾地盯着我……随即他眨了一下眼。

"Gotcha," Shinji said, his voice surprisingly bass with something other than laughter.
‘抓到你了，’真嗣说道，他的声音出乎意料地低沉，并非仅因笑声。

This wasn't how it was supposed to go at all! A million emotions flitted inside me like startled birds, brushing my heart with their wings.  Confused.  Wanting.  Needing.  Afraid to need.
这一切完全出乎意料！无数情感在我心中如惊鸟般掠过，轻触我的心弦。我感到困惑、渴望、需要，却又害怕这种需要。

I decided to go safe--with angry.
我决定选择稳妥的方式——带着怒气。

"Jerk," I hissed, wrenching my arm from his grip and using it to pound on his chest, that heated cavity which housed his fragile heart.  I slid off him, making myself as heavy as possible, my thighs sliding against the fabric of his shirt, the heat of his skin beneath like a distant memory.
“混蛋，”我低声骂道，用力从他手中抽出手臂，并用它捶打他的胸膛，那个炽热的腔室里藏着他脆弱的心。我滑下他的身体，尽可能让自己变得沉重，我的大腿在他衬衫的布料上滑动，他皮肤下的热度如同遥远的记忆。

Shinji immediately rolled over, his body liquid grace against the floor.  Not looking at me, he proceeded to return the loveseat to its original position, his face as blank as a refrigerator door.
真嗣立刻翻了个身，身体如水般流畅地贴着地板。他并未看向我，而是继续将双人沙发恢复到原位，脸上表情一片空白，仿佛冰箱门一般无表情。

The moron was cleaning.  As if I weren't even there, as if nothing had happened at all! He was cleaning the living room.  I sat in absolute silence for a minute, unable to believe it.
那个傻瓜在打扫卫生。好像我根本不在场，好像什么都没发生过似的！他正在清理客厅。我静静地坐了一分钟，难以置信。

As soon as the loveseat was righted, I returned to it.  I was unable to help curling up into a ball, my arms locked around my knees, my chin propped on my arms. Shinji did not join me; he returned to the recliner he'd been camped in earlier.  I felt the disappointment blaze inside me, hot and bright.  I hid my face; he must not see.
双人沙发一扶正，我立刻回到原位。我不由自主地蜷缩成球状，双臂环绕着膝盖，下巴搁在手臂上。真嗣并未与我同坐，而是回到了他之前一直占据的躺椅。我感到失望之情如烈焰般在心中熊熊燃烧，炽热而耀眼。我掩面不让他看见。

The movie droned on.  I'd forgotten all about it; I was no longer interested in it.  The television was once again as I'd seen it a week ago, while lying upside down--comical, ridiculous, unrecognizable.  It failed completely to hold my attention.  I could not stop my mind, my eyes, from wandering back over to him.
电影冗长乏味，我早已对其失去兴趣，忘得一干二净。电视画面再次变得滑稽可笑，荒诞不经，与我一周前倒着看时一样难以辨认。它完全无法吸引我的注意力。我的思绪和目光总是不由自主地飘向他那边。

I jabbed my thumb almost desperately onto the remote control buttons, changing the channels.  I fiercely needed the control over what I was watching.  It wasn't like I could change the channel, flip a switch, and Shinji would go away.  It wasn't like I could press a button and these feelings would go away.  I hated it, having no control over it.
我近乎绝望地用拇指猛戳遥控器按钮，不停地换台。我迫切需要掌控自己正在观看的内容。但这不像换个频道或拨个开关就能让真嗣消失，也不像按个按钮就能让这些感觉烟消云散。我痛恨这种无法掌控的感觉。

Shinji turned to walk out of the room, and my whole body froze.  He couldn't get out fast enough! Couldn't wait to be away from me. 
真嗣转身准备离开房间，我整个人仿佛被冻住了一般。他急切地想要离开，一刻也不想多待在我身边。

In retaliation, I refused to look at him as I addressed him.  "Hey, Shinji."
出于报复，我与他交谈时故意不看他，只是冷冷地叫了一声：“嘿，真嗣。”

He might have stopped, but I didn't see--I was still stubbornly refusing to look at him.  He said, "Yeah?"
他或许已经停下了，但我并未察觉——我依旧固执地不愿看向他。他问道：“是吗？”

I felt a sense of deja vu as I said, "I'm bored."
当我开口说“我感到无聊”时，心中涌起一种似曾相识的感觉。

"So?" he asked slowly.
“那又怎样？”他慢悠悠地问。

Gott! Did I have to lead him by the hand through everything?! "So come here," I said, trying not to grit my teeth, not to growl it. 
天哪！我是不是得事事都带着他做？！“过来这里，”我说，尽量不咬牙切齿，不咆哮。

Shinji returned to the recliner, and my movements were quick and jerky with frustration as I patted the loveseat cushion beside me.  Shinji followed, but practically hugged the side of the loveseat, putting cold distance between us.  I huddled away from him.  Fine.  
真嗣回到躺椅上，我因沮丧而动作迅速且生硬地拍了拍身旁的沙发垫。真嗣跟了过来，却几乎紧贴着沙发的边缘，刻意在我们之间制造了冰冷的距离。我蜷缩着身体，远离了他。好吧，随他去吧。

The silence clawed at me until I couldn't take it any more.  I shut the television off with a sharp *click*.  Shinji turned to me, smiling slightly.  It was nothing like the laughter of before; just a ghost of his real smile.  
寂静如利爪般侵袭，令我难以承受。我猛然关掉电视，发出一声清脆的*咔嚓*声。真嗣转头看向我，嘴角微微上扬。这笑容与往日的欢笑大相径庭；仅是他真挚笑容的一抹虚影。

"I'm bored," I repeated softly.  
“我感到无聊，”我轻声地重复了一遍。

"You've said as much already," Shinji said calmly.  It infuriated me.  All these new feelings were cooking my insides into a fine hot boiling kettle of Asuka, and he sat there looking frostier than even Ayanami--a feat if there ever was one!  
“你已经多次提到这一点了，”真嗣平静地说道。这让我感到极度愤怒。所有这些新涌现的情感仿佛将我的内心煮成了一壶滚烫的明日香，而他却坐在那里，表情比绫波还要冷淡——这确实是一项了不起的成就！

Shinji sat there, looking at me, as if he were patiently waiting for me to do something he wanted.   
真嗣坐在那儿，目光投向我，似乎在耐心等待我去做他期望的事情。

All right, I told myself.  You've faced death with this boy.  You've lived life with this boy.  It's time to be honest with him.  
好吧，我暗自下定决心。你曾与这个男孩共同面对死亡，共同体验生活。现在，是时候对他坦诚相待了。

I opened my mouth to say any one of a million things, but something entirely surprising came out.  I was afraid of how small and scared my voice sounded to my own ears.  
我张开嘴，本想说无数件事中的一件，却意外地脱口而出一句完全意想不到的话。我害怕自己的声音听起来是多么的微弱和胆怯。

"Do you think I'm pretty?"  
你觉得我长得好看吗？

Shinji's expression stung me.  His eyebrows met over his nose as he snorted.  "Do I think you're pretty? What kind of question is that?"  
真嗣的表情让我感到刺痛。他皱起眉头，鼻梁上的眉毛紧锁，哼了一声。“你觉得我漂亮吗？这是什么问题？”

A very good one?  
非常好的一个吗？

I felt myself floundering, uneasy with how curious I was to hear his answer.  I answered his question by repeating the first one.  "I asked you first! Do you?"  
我感到自己有些手足无措，对于内心如此急切地想要听到他的回答感到不安。我通过重复第一个问题来回应他的提问：“是我先问你的！你又是怎么想的呢？”

Shinji smiled softly again, that true angel's smile.  (You're safe here,) that smile promised.  It was a lie...wasn't it? It _had_ to be a lie...  
真嗣再次露出温柔的微笑，那是真正的天使般的微笑。（你在这里很安全，）那个微笑仿佛在承诺。但这一定是个谎言……不是吗？它肯定是个谎言……

Safe here... 这里很安全……

"You've said as much yourself.  You're the prettiest girl in Tokyo-3...or all of Japan for that matter."  
“你自己也这么说过。你是第三新东京市最漂亮的女孩……或者说整个日本都是如此。”

Nice answer, but he was just repeating what I'd said, neatly sidestepping the question.  Not a yes.  But not a no, either.  I took it as a good sign, venturing timidly further.  
回答虽好，但他只是重复了我之前的话，巧妙地避开了问题核心。既非肯定，也非否定。我将其视作一个积极的信号，继续谨慎地深入。

"Do you like spending time with me?"  
你愿意和我共度时光吗？

I felt more than saw him flinch.  My heart fell.  What a stupid question.  Of course he didn't enjoy spending time with me.  I'd spent the whole of our time together making him miserable, shrieking and insulting him, using my hands, my feet, my words as weapons against him.  Why would he like spending time with me? Why would anyone?  
我不仅看到，更感受到了他的退缩。我的心顿时沉了下去。问出这样的问题，真是太愚蠢了。他当然不会享受与我共度的时光。在我们相处的每一刻，我都在让他痛苦不堪，尖叫、辱骂，甚至用我的手、脚和言语当作攻击他的武器。他怎么可能喜欢和我在一起？又有谁会喜欢呢？

"More than anything else." The conviction in his voice rung like a great heavy bell.  
“最重要的是这一点。”他语气中的坚定，宛如一口沉甸甸的大钟在回荡。

My hair swung heavily behind me as I turned toward him.  I was afraid if I took my eyes off him, he'd run away, disappear.  Leave me.  Had he really just said what he'd said?  
我转身面向他时，头发沉重地甩在身后。我担心一旦移开视线，他就会跑掉，消失不见。留下我一个人。他真的说了那些话吗？

I was suddenly aware of the weight of the remote control in my hand.  I hated the feel of it, the stickiness of the Scotch tape used to hold the battery case together.  I dropped it as though it were hot, almost threw it away from me in disgust.  My hands were suddenly empty, a feeling that almost physically hurt me.  How to fix that?  
我突然意识到手中遥控器的重量。我讨厌它的触感，尤其是用来固定电池盒的透明胶带的粘性。我像扔掉烫手山芋一样把它丢开，几乎出于厌恶而将它甩离我。我的手突然空了，这种感觉几乎让我感到身体上的疼痛。该如何解决呢？

There was a way.  I just wasn't sure I could do it.  I'd dived into that volcano eagerly, triumphantly after that Angel embryo.  Why was I so nervous now?  
曾经有一条路摆在我面前，但我并不确定自己是否能走下去。我曾满怀热情和胜利的喜悦，潜入那座火山去追寻天使胚胎。为何现在我却如此紧张不安？

What if I didn't ask him? What if he asked me? I could do that--make him say it.  Then I wouldn't be saying it, it would all be him.  
如果我没有主动问他呢？如果他反过来问我呢？我可以引导他说出来。这样一来，我就没有直接说出口，所有的话都是他自己的表达。

"Do you wanna hold my hand?" I slid my hand towards him, my suddenly clammy skin sticking to the loveseat's upholstery.  
"你想握住我的手吗？" 我把手缓缓伸向他，手掌因紧张而变得潮湿，黏在了沙发套上。

Shinji's reply was immediate this time.  "Yeah..."  
这次，真嗣的回应非常迅速。 "嗯..."

Helplessly, I reached my hand out to him, a drowning swimmer.  He gently held it in both of his, as if it were something precious and fine, something to be treasured.  That feeling of safety washed over me again--would never hurt me, never ever--as he caressed my palm with his thumb, those soft circles putting me on slow burn.  I felt he somehow knew every inch of my hand, the loops and whorls of my fingerprints, the veins thudding nervously beneath my skin.  
我无助地向他伸出手，宛如一名溺水者。他温柔地用双手握住，仿佛那是珍贵而精致之物，值得珍藏。那种安全感再次涌上心头——他绝不会伤害我，永远不会——当他用拇指轻抚我的手掌，那些轻柔的圆圈让我慢慢燃烧。我感觉他似乎熟知我手掌的每一寸，指纹的环和涡，以及皮肤下紧张跳动的血管。

A fine trembling thrilled through me.  I drew a deep breath, and leaned in closer.  Could I do this? Could I ask for something I wanted and not be rebuffed with laughter? Could I want something without having to demand it?  
一阵细微的颤抖传遍全身。我深吸一口气，更加贴近。我能否做到这一点？我能否请求自己渴望的事物而不被嘲笑所拒？我能否心有所愿而不必强求？

"Shinji...kiss me?" 真嗣...可以吻我吗？

His breath flowed across my lips as he brought his own to them.  "Yeah," he murmured, no hesitation, no fear.  It was soft and questioning, clumsy as first kisses tend to be.  A kiss that demanded nothing, except another kiss, which he eagerly gave.  My eyes slid closed, his mouth a warm softness against mine.  
他的呼吸轻轻掠过我的唇瓣，当他将自己的唇贴近时。“嗯，”他低声呢喃，毫无犹豫，毫无畏惧。那吻轻柔且带着疑问，笨拙得如同初吻一般。这是一个不求任何回报的吻，只期待着另一个吻，而他热切地回应了。我的眼睛缓缓闭上，他的唇在我唇上带来温暖而柔软的触感。

That drowning feeling was back again, but this time I welcomed it with open arms.  I was awed by the intimacy of the kiss--it seemed so simple, but was so much more than that.  There was nothing quite like tasting another person; a closeness that couldn't be duplicated even though ninety-five percent of our bodies were still apart.  
那种溺水般的感觉再次袭来，这次我却欣然拥抱。这个吻的亲密程度让我惊叹——看似简单，实则蕴含深远。没有什么比与他人共享这份滋味更让人感到亲近的了；即便我们身体仍有百分之九十五的距离，这种亲密感却是无法复制的。

Eighty-five percent--I had cuddled closer to Shinji, and he'd wrapped me in his arms as the kisses deepened.  I slid my tongue past his lips, exploring, tasting him.  So much stronger than the alcohol...It was almost like being in Eva, letting my lungs fill up with LCL, only this was so much nicer, so much better.  When he caressed my tongue with his, I opened my lips to his kiss.  
百分之八十五——我紧紧依偎在真嗣身旁，随着吻的加深，他拥我入怀。我探出舌尖，越过他的唇，细细品味。这感觉比酒精更为强烈……仿佛置身于 EVA 驾驶舱中，肺部充盈着 LCL，但此刻的体验更为美妙，更加令人陶醉。当他温柔地以舌尖触碰我的舌时，我便张开双唇，深情回应他的吻。

My body ached with a desperate need to be closer to him, to touch him anywhere, everywhere.  I settled for sliding one leg across his thighs, straddling him.  This made me taller; I fisted some of his hair and kissed him fiercely, as if I'd eat him from the mouth down.  I'd always imagined Shinji as having coarse hair, but this was like the silky pelt of an animal, dark against my milk-pale hand.  
我全身因渴望更贴近他、触碰他而感到痛苦，无论何处。我最终选择将一条腿跨过他的大腿，骑坐在他身上。这让我显得更高；我紧握他的一些头发，激烈地吻他，仿佛要从他的嘴开始吞噬他。我一直以为新治的头发粗糙，但此刻却像动物的丝滑毛皮，深色映衬在我奶白色的手上。

Shinji's tongue stroked mine as I continued my assault, but he couldn't hold out forever against the power of my kiss.  He released my bruised lips slowly, touching his mouth to mine lightly every so often as if he weren't quite ready to let go.  
我的舌头轻抚着真嗣的舌头，我持续着我的攻势，但他终究无法永远抵挡我这深情一吻的力量。他缓缓地松开了我那被吻得有些红肿的唇，不时轻轻地触碰我的唇瓣，仿佛他还未完全准备好放手。

My smile leapt like a flame, but I didn't get to enjoy the upper hand for long.  Shinji gently tugged on my lower lip with his teeth, thus distracting me from his hands--one was sliding beneath my top to stroke up my back, while the other caressed my bare thigh.  Fine tremors shook my senses; I seized Shinji's head in both my hands and cuddled against him, a boneless mass of desire that fit comfortably into his embrace.  
我的笑容如火焰般跃动，然而这份得意并未持续太久。真嗣轻柔地用牙齿牵引我的下唇，巧妙地转移了我的注意力，他的其中一只手悄然探入我的上衣，沿着我的背部轻抚而上，另一只手则在我裸露的大腿上温柔摩挲。一阵阵细微的颤栗穿透我的感官；我双手紧握真嗣的头部，全身无力地依偎在他怀中，那份渴望如此自然地融入了他的拥抱。

"Shinji..." I surfaced from that riptide of desire enough to gasp his name.  There was no longer any such thing as shame as I pleaded for his touch.  "Put your hands on me...kiss me...I want..." I was unsure if I was speaking German or Japanese—unsure if I was speaking at all.  
"真嗣..." 我从那汹涌的欲望之潮中探出头来，得以喘息着呼唤他的名字。此刻，羞耻已荡然无存，我迫切地恳求他的抚摸。"把手放在我身上...吻我...我渴望..." 我分不清自己说的是德语还是日语，甚至不确定自己是否真的发出了声音。

His nose touched against my neck, his breath a warm cloud against my skin.  I was suddenly aware of how ill-fitting Misato's borrowed cutoffs were as Shinji's hand slid beneath them.  He pressed tiny kisses to whichever skin was closest as his hands stroked me, stirred me.   
他的鼻尖轻触我的颈项，呼吸温暖如云，轻拂我的肌肤。我骤然察觉到美里借给我的短裤是多么不合身，真嗣的手悄然滑入其下。他轻柔地吻着离他最近的皮肤，双手温柔地抚摸，激起了我的感触。

"Make me feel wanted..." I murmured, the ring of truth bringing a blush to my cheeks.  Embarrassed at last; I turned away from him.  His breath tickled my ear, and suddenly his warm, wet tongue was exploring the shell.  I hissed in a breath as he scored my ear gently with his teeth.   
"让我感到被需要……" 我低声说道，那份真实感让我的脸颊不由自主地泛起红晕。终于感到一丝尴尬，我转过身去避开他。他的呼吸轻柔地拂过我的耳边，紧接着，他温暖湿润的舌头开始探索我的耳廓。当他用牙齿轻轻地在我耳边划过时，我不禁倒吸了一口气。

"Oh..." Almost without my conscious control, I rolled my hips against Shinji's body, dizzy with the heat we were making together.  When I couldn't control the shudders racking my body, I turned my head towards where I thought Shinji's mouth would be.  Caught off-guard, his tongue caressed the side of my face.  I captured the wet pink muscle in my mouth and sucked on it, hard.  
"哦..." 我几乎不自觉地扭动臀部，紧贴着真嗣的身体，被我们共同产生的热度弄得头晕目眩。当我无法控制身体的颤抖时，我转头寻找真嗣的嘴唇。他猝不及防，舌头轻抚我的脸颊。我捕捉到那湿润的粉红色舌头，用力吸吮。

Shinji made a sound that could have been my name.  I felt him stretched hard and firm beneath his pants, and I was unable to help grinding my body down against his, which intensified rather than alleviated the ache that burned within me.  "It's about damned time," I growled, or tried to growl, not really having enough air to do so.  
真嗣发出一声，听起来像是在叫我的名字。我能感觉到他紧绷而坚实的身体在他裤子下，我忍不住将身体压向他，这反而加剧了而不是缓解了我内心的灼热痛楚。“真是该死的时间”，我咆哮着，或者说试图咆哮，实际上并没有足够的空气来这样做。

His hands turned my blood to rain, leaving shivers in their wake as they slid over me.  They were restless, unsure of where to hold me, where to linger, finally finding their way easily down the back of the cutoffs I'd borrowed from Misato.  I'd never been more happy to be too small for her clothes.   
他的双手仿佛将我的血液化作雨滴，滑过我时留下阵阵颤栗。它们似乎不安分，不确定该抓住哪里，该在哪里停留，最终轻易地找到了路径，沿着我从美里那里借来的短裤背面滑下。我从未如此庆幸自己穿不上她的衣服。

A purr trickled past my lips at Shinji's touch, and then my breath was torn from me as he pulled me almost roughly against him, moving us both to some unheard rhythm.  Memory flashed behind my suddenly closed eyes, a dance routine, two bodies moving as one, one mind, one heart.   
真嗣的触碰让我不由自主地发出呼噜声，紧接着他用力将我拉向他，我们随着一种无形的节奏摇摆。闭上眼的瞬间，记忆如电光火石般闪现——那是一场双人舞，两个身体和谐共舞，心意相通，心心相印。

"Shinji..." I kneaded the back of his neck, needing to hold on to something, anything.  There were so many things to say--love me, want me, stop, and never stop--but my lips would only form his name, over and over again.  
"真嗣..." 我轻揉他的后颈，急切地想要抓住些什么，任何东西都好。心中有千言万语——爱我，渴望我，停下来，永远不要停——然而我的唇却只能反复呼唤他的名字。

That wicked rhythm he was moving us to was threatening to drown me.  I drew my body out of Shinji's grasp, with only a fine sheen of sweat between his hands and my skin.  His touch became light and teasing as he traced his tongue down between my breasts, his mouth warm and demanding.  I was unable to help pressing myself closer, offering myself to him as he bathed my hot skin with soft kisses and gentle strokes of his tongue.   
他那诱人堕落的节奏几乎要将我吞噬。我挣脱了真嗣的怀抱，只留下一层细密的汗珠在他手心与我的肌肤之间。他的抚摸变得轻柔而挑逗，舌尖沿着我胸间缓缓下滑，他的吻既温暖又充满渴望。我无法抗拒地向他靠近，将自己奉献给他，任由他用温柔的吻和细腻的舌尖轻抚我滚烫的肌肤。

Shinji's arms slid around me, bringing me down against him once more.  His lips roamed over my skin almost languidly, threatening to lull me to sleep.  He touched his lips to mine gently, murmuring my name through the kiss.   
真嗣的双臂环绕着我，再次将我拥入怀中。他的唇在我肌肤上缓缓游移，几乎带着慵懒，仿佛要将我引入梦乡。他温柔地吻上我的唇，在亲吻间轻声呼唤我的名字。

I blinked confusedly.  This was all wrong.  The kisses should have been heating up now, harder, faster.  He should be panting in my ear, growling my name, taking my clothes off...what was wrong?  
我困惑地眨了眨眼。这一切都不对劲。亲吻本该现在变得更加热烈，更强烈，更迅速。他应该在我耳边喘息，低吼我的名字，脱掉我的衣服……哪里出了问题？

He swallowed my puzzled question with a kiss, an almost chaste kiss, the warmth of his mouth against mine.  Our eyes met, and I was suddenly so aware of his arms around me, tight around me, not to hurt me but because he wanted me near.  He wanted me near...  
他用一个吻回应了我困惑的问题，那吻纯净而温柔，他的唇温热地贴在我的唇上。我们的视线交汇，我突然间强烈地感受到他的双臂紧紧环绕着我，并非为了束缚，而是因为他渴望我近在咫尺。他渴望我近在咫尺...

The world trembled in a sudden wash of tears, but I blinked them away, afraid he might see.  Instead I touched my nose against his, soft and questioning as a first kiss, and he answered me with a light touch of lips.  
世界在突如其来的泪水中颤抖，我迅速眨眼将泪水抹去，唯恐被他察觉。取而代之的是，我温柔地用鼻尖轻触他的鼻尖，宛如初吻般带着疑问，而他则以轻柔的唇触回应我的试探。

"I'm sorry," he murmured, and I felt my heart sink.  He was doing what he always did--running away and then apologizing.  I opened my mouth to reprimand him, but he cut me off.  
“对不起，”他轻声说道，我感到心情沉重。他总是这样——先逃避，再道歉。我正要开口责备，他却抢先一步打断了我。

"No, wait.  I'm not sorry." I almost felt his grin as he wound me hopelessly in his arms.  I snuggled into that delicious place where his neck and shoulder met, smelling his scent--so warm and clean, a hint of the soap he used--suddenly exhausted.  
“不，等等。我并不感到抱歉。”我几乎能感受到他怀抱中的微笑，无助地被他拥入怀中。我蜷缩在他颈肩交汇的温馨之地，嗅着他温暖而清新的气息，夹杂着一丝他所用肥皂的香味，突然间感到无比疲惫。

"I _want_ you, idiot," I protested almost exasperatedly, pressing kisses to whatever skin I could reach, needing to be as close as I could.  
“我要你，傻瓜，”我几乎恼怒地抗议，不停地亲吻着能触及的每一寸肌肤，渴望尽可能地贴近。

My body was tense until he gave the response I was aching for.  "I want you too, Asuka.  More than even I can understand.  But I don't think I have to understand.  I don't even care if I do or not.  I just know that I want you."  
我的身体一直紧绷着，直到他给出了我渴望已久的回应。“我也想要你，Asuka。这种渴望甚至超出了我自己的理解。但我并不觉得我必须去理解它。我甚至不在乎自己是否理解。我只知道我深深地想要你。”

A small smile found its way to my eyes.  "I know."  
一丝微笑不经意间爬上了我的眼角。“我明白。”

Shinji returned my smile.  
真嗣回应了我的微笑。

"You've surprised me once again, Shinji Ikari," I teased.  "I can't believe you actually knew what you were doing.  Do I need to send that pervert Aida a thank-you note? "  
你又让我刮目相看了，碇真嗣，"我打趣地说。"真没想到你竟然知道自己在做什么。我是不是得给那个变态相田写封感谢信呢？

Shinji chuckled, the sound rumbling through me.  "He's not _that_ bad, Asuka.  Besides, I was the one that actually sat down and watched those videos."  
真嗣轻声笑了起来，那笑声在我心中回荡。“他没那么糟糕，明日香。毕竟，是我真的坐下来观看了那些视频。”

I couldn't help but laugh.  "Only you would actually sit down and _watch_ porn.  Actually _watch_ it."  
我忍不住笑出声来。“只有你才会真的坐下来认真看色情片。”

Shinji's smile warmed me to my toes.  I licked delicately at the outer shell of his ear, nibbling gently on the lobe.  "You've made me proud, Shinji, not running away from the sight of wild sex.  A pervert to the core."  
真嗣的笑容让我感到由内而外的温暖。我轻柔地舔舐着他耳朵的外缘，小心翼翼地咬着耳垂。“真嗣，你没有逃避这激烈的性爱场面，让我感到非常骄傲。你真是个不折不扣的变态。”

"I--am not!" The smile ruined his attempted indignance.  
“我——才不是呢！”他的笑容破坏了试图表现出的愤怒。

My own smile was marred by a very unladylike but very happy snort.  "Do you really expect me to believe that? You seemed to enjoy having your hair yanked on--" I slid one hand through his dark hair.  "--and your tongue sucked..." I lifted my other hand to his face to stroke his lips.  
我的笑容中夹杂了一声非常不淑女却异常开心的哼声。“你真以为我会相信那套说辞？你明明很享受被人拽头发——”我一只手轻抚他深邃的发丝。“——还有你的舌头被吸吮……”我另一只手轻触他的唇瓣。

Shinji returned my snort.  "You were the one _pulling_ my hair and _sucking_ my tongue.  _You_ seemed rather excited when I got...um, excited!"  
真嗣回敬了我的嗤笑。“是你一直在拽我的头发，还吸我的舌头。当我...呃，兴奋的时候，你看起来也很兴奋！”

I laughed, but heat rushed to my face.  I cuddled against him to hide the blush, rolling my hips against his once more.  His body reacted against mine, rekindling that ache in me.  When I was sure my blush had cooled, I speared him with my eyes, rolling my hips against him again.  "So you _do_ like that..."  
我笑了，但脸上不禁发热。为了掩饰脸红，我紧贴着他，再次扭动臀部。他的身体回应着我，重新唤起了我内心的渴望。确认脸红已消退后，我凝视着他，再次扭动臀部，挑逗地说：“看来你确实喜欢这样……”

Caught, he cuddled me closer.  "As if that's some great discovery." His hand found its way to my hair, stroking, tugging gently.  The touch was comforting.  I wasn't sure I understood how his hands could move me so, bring me to the heights of passion, warm me in his safe embrace.  
他抓住我，紧紧拥入怀中。“仿佛那是多么重大的发现。”他的手轻柔地抚摸我的头发，时而温柔地拉扯。这种触感让我感到安心。我不太明白，他的双手是如何如此轻易地引领我达到激情的巅峰，又在他的怀抱中给予我温暖与安全感。

"Shinji..." 真嗣……

He massaged my back, those hands, so strong in a fight, so skilled with a progressive knife, so soft on my body.  "What is it, Asuka?"  
他轻柔地为我按摩背部，那双在战斗中强劲有力、使用渐进式刀具时技艺高超的手，此刻在我身上却是如此温柔。“怎么了，明日香？”

I hadn't meant to ask the question, but my masks had dropped away.  There were no shields left to hide behind.  "Why did you stop?"  
我原本没打算问这个问题，但我的伪装已经消失。再也没有任何屏障可以让我隐藏。“你为何停下？”

Shinji waited before answering.  Every passing heartbeat thunked hollowly against my breastbone till he tightened our embrace once more.  I felt the tension in him ease suddenly, and he said it very simply, perfectly clearly, so that I might make no mistake.  
真嗣在回答前稍作停顿。每一声心跳都空洞地敲打着我的胸骨，直到他再次紧紧拥抱我。我感觉到他的紧张突然缓解，他简单明了地说出来，确保我不会误解。

"I love you, Asuka.  That's why I stopped."  
“我爱你，明日香。所以我才停下。”

The world was upside down.  
世界仿佛颠倒了过来。

It came to me suddenly, on a wave of clarity that one usually needs to meditate to have.  I knew exactly where I was, where I belonged.  I was home in his embrace.  
那种清晰感突然涌上心头，通常需要冥想才能达到这种境界。我清楚地知道自己的位置，明白自己属于何方。在他的怀抱中，我感受到了家的温暖。

I could not look at him.  My eyes were warm and wet with tears, and I hid in his shoulder as they caught on my lashes, spilled down my cheek.  Shinji's breathing was a slow, steady rhythm against me.  His hand tangled in my hair, solid and warm, stroking as I wept.  We didn't speak, but that strong hand said the words I'd wanted to hear my whole life.  
我无法直视他。泪水让我的双眼温热湿润，我躲在他的肩膀上，泪水沾湿了睫毛，滑过脸颊。真嗣的呼吸在我耳边缓慢而稳定。他的手缠绕在我的发丝中，坚实而温暖，轻抚着我哭泣的脸庞。我们没有说话，但那只强有力的手传达了我一生中渴望听到的那些话语。

(I'm here.) （我在这儿。）

In the dream, I was a child who had fallen asleep on the sofa.  My father was carrying me to my room...  
梦中，我仿佛变回了那个在沙发上熟睡的孩子，而父亲正温柔地将我抱向卧室...

Even as I realized it was a dream, the strong arms were carefully depositing me onto a warm bed in a safe place, ever so gently tucking the sheets around me.  I felt the heat of his body so close to mine, one hand tucking a lock of hair behind my ear as he knelt at my bedside.  The brief warmth I felt on my forehead must have been a kiss, his lips soft as a whisper, as if he were bestowing a blessing on me.  
尽管我意识到那是一场梦，那双有力的手臂依然小心翼翼地将我安置在一个安全地方的温暖床上，轻柔地为我盖上被子。我能感受到他紧贴着我的身体的温暖，他跪在床边，一只手将我耳边的一缕头发轻轻拨到后面。我额头上那短暂的温暖，必定是一个吻，他的唇轻柔如耳语，仿佛在赐予我祝福。

My eyes were closed, but still I felt his warmth nearby, as if he were watching over me.  Like...an angel.  He said nothing at all, but he didn't need to.  I felt my lips curl into a smile.  There was only one person who made me feel this way.  
我闭着眼睛，却能感受到他近在咫尺的温暖，仿佛他在默默守护着我，宛如一位天使。他一言不发，却无需多言。我情不自禁地微笑起来，因为我知道，能让我如此心安的，只有他一人。

"Shinji..." 真嗣……

Avarice, you got me back into the entry plug, and I couldn't be more grateful.  Thank you so much for honoring me with the request to write this.  I loved every minute of it.  I only hope it does "Asuka's Smile" justice.  Please accept my humble offering and have pity on me. *smile*  
贪婪，是你让我重返驾驶舱，我感激涕零。非常感谢你给予我撰写此文的机会，我乐在其中。只愿这篇文字能不负“明日香的微笑”之美誉。请接受我这份微不足道的礼物，并请多多包涵。*微笑*

I haven't been in an Eva in a while! I hope that anyone who reads this enjoys reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it--although that might be tough, I had a great time writing it! I accept reviews of all kinds; my email is shapeshifter883@netzero.net.

**Notes from Avarice: 《贪婪笔记》摘录：**

Well, there you have it, ladies and germs.  The by-far-more-talented and absolutely wonderful Serena.  It took awhile to get here, but the end results are so marvelous I feel like I'm going to burst at the seams in pride.  
好了，各位女士先生，你们看到了，才华横溢且绝对出色的塞雷娜。虽然过程有些漫长，但最终的结果如此美妙，我感到自豪得快要溢出来了。

Now, as I've tried to tell everyone I've talked with thus far, check out this splendid young lady's other works.  They're all extremely well done, but I'll warn you that every one of them will leave you craving for more.  
现在，我想告诉所有我交谈过的人，去欣赏这位杰出年轻女士的其他作品吧。它们都极为精彩，但我要提醒你，每一部都会让你意犹未尽，渴望更多。

He is entirely too kind to me.  I am not more talented than he.  If not for him, I'd never have written this in the first place! *smile*  
他对我的好真是无以复加。我的才华并不比他高。要不是有他，我根本就不会开始写这个！*微笑*
