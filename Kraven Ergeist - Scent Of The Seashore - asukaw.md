[Kraven Ergeist](https://fanfiction.net/u/647188/)
The war of the angels was merciless. It had taken its toll on the soldiers of Earth. Shinji knew not the meaning of friendship, Rei knew not the meaning of self, and Asuka knew not the meaning of love.  
天使间的战争残酷无情，地球的战士们深受其害。真嗣未曾理解友谊的真谛，绫波未曾认识自我，而明日香则未曾体会爱的深意。

The arrival of another signaled a change, however, as he stood as no mere human.  
另一个信号的出现标志了转变，他站在那里，显然不是凡人。

"So, this is the fabled Soryu Asuka Langley," Kaworu said, glancing down at the sleeping form.  
"原来，这就是传说中的惣流·明日香·兰格雷啊，"薰低头凝视着沉睡中的她。

The hospital wing was usually empty at this time of night. Shinji and his other were asleep, as Kaworu checked on the last of the fighters for the side of Earth.  
医院侧翼在深夜时分通常空无一人。碇真嗣和他的同伴都已进入梦乡，此时渚薰正在查看地球阵营最后几位战士的状况。

"Pathetic," he huffed, and turned around.  
"真可悲，"他气愤地说着，转身就走。

A hand clutched the back of his shirt. "You wanna repeat that?"  
一只手紧紧抓住了他的衬衫后背。"你确定要再说一次吗？"

Kaworu turned around, facing the girl staring coldly back at him. "I said 'pathetic.' To be honest, you're hardly in a position to argue."  
薰转过身来，直面那冷眼相看的女孩。“我刚才说的是‘可悲’。说实话，你并没有争论的余地。”

Asuka responded by yanking him off to the side, before sitting up to give him a good stare down. "I am sick and tired of washed up nobodies making judgments about me!"  
明日香猛地将他拉到一旁，坐直身子，目光锐利地盯着他。"我真是受够了那些过气的小人物对我评头论足！"

Kaworu shrugged, looking away. "Well, then, I guess you're fed up with being a human, then. Human beings judge all around them, it's their nature. You, Ms. Soryu, are guilty of judging everyone you meet."  
薰耸耸肩，目光移向别处。“看来，你已经厌倦了作为人类的生活。人类习惯于评判周围的一切，这是他们的天性。而你，惣流小姐，对每个遇见的人都有所评判。”

"You don't know anything about me!" Asuka yelled. "And I have every right to judge those lesser than me!"  
你根本不了解我！" 明日香大声说道。"我完全有资格评判那些不如我的人！

Kaworu blinked. "Oh, really? Who died and made you queen? Just like any other human, when faced with their own weakness, they invent some irrefutable nonsense to prove their own existence."  
薰眨了眨眼，反问道：“哦，是吗？谁去世了让你成了女王？和所有人类一样，面对自身的软肋，他们总会捏造些不容置疑的荒谬之词，以此来证明自己的存在。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Whatever that means."  
明日香不以为然地翻了个白眼。“随你怎么解释吧。”

Kaworu smiled. "It means you're making excuses. If you're so brilliant, prove it. If you're so talented, prove it. If the rest of us are so inferior to you, then be superior, don't just act it."  
薰微笑着说：“你这是在找借口。既然你自诩聪明绝顶，那就拿出真本事来证明。既然你才华横溢，那就展现出来。如果你认为我们都不如你，那就用行动证明你的优越，别光说不练。”

Asuka glared at him. "I don't need to prove anything!"  
明日香怒视着他，说：“我没什么好证明的！”

Kaworu sighed. "And why not? If I were to judge you based off NERV's record of your accomplishments, what am I to believe?" He then removed a list from his pocket, and began pacing around the perimeter of the hospital room. "Campaign against the 6th angel, assisted by pilot Ikari. Campaign against the 7th, assisted by Ikari. 8th, you were rescued by Ikari, 9th, three pilot co-op. 10th, three pilot co-op, 11th, the Eva's weren't even involved. 12th, defeated by pilot Ikari, 13th, defeated by the dummy plug system. 14th, defeated by Ikari, 15th, your one solo mission, you failed miserably. Defeated by pilot Ayanami. 16th, defeated by pilot Ayanami."  
薰叹了口气。“为何不呢？若我依据 NERV 记录的你的战绩来评断，我该作何感想？”他随即从口袋中取出一张清单，开始在病房四周徘徊。“对抗第 6 使徒，碇真嗣协助。对抗第 7 使徒，碇真嗣协助。第 8 使徒，你被碇真嗣救出，第 9 使徒，三名驾驶员协同作战。第 10 使徒，三名驾驶员协同作战，第 11 使徒，EVA 甚至未曾参战。第 12 使徒，被碇真嗣击败，第 13 使徒，被 Dummy Plug 系统击败。第 14 使徒，被碇真嗣击败，第 15 使徒，你唯一的单人任务，以惨败告终。被绫波丽击败。第 16 使徒，被绫波丽击败。”

Kaworu returned to Asuka's bedside. "Now, you tell me, what does it sound like you've accomplished? You were never even an asset to NERV once, Ms. Soryu! Not _once_!"  
薰回到明日香的床边，质问道：“那么，你告诉我，你究竟有什么成就？你从未对 NERV 有过任何贡献，Soryu 小姐！一次也没有！”

Asuka returned a cold glare at the stranger. "Who the hell are you, anyway? What the hell do you want? What are you trying to prove, anyway? Is this some sort of psychological trip or something?"  
明日香冷冷地瞪了陌生人一眼。“你究竟是谁？你到底有何企图？你想证明什么？这是在玩心理游戏吗？”

Kaworu sighed. "Ms. Soryu, I'm here to give you a perspective on things. Both the First and Third Child are still going about their duties here at NERV, and while it's as difficult for them as it is for you, and don't even try to deny it, they're sticking to it, while you're here, in a hospital bed, feeling sorry for yourself. Who's the better person for that?"  
薰叹息道：“惣流小姐，我来此是想让你换个角度看问题。第一适格者和第三适格者依旧在 NERV 坚守岗位，尽管他们面临的困难不亚于你，这点你无需否认。他们选择了坚持，而你却躺在医院里自怜自艾。相比之下，谁更值得尊敬呢？”

Asuka clenched her fists into tight balls. "I'm going to say this once, you asshole. Get out. Right now."  
明日香紧握拳头，厉声道：“我只说一遍，混蛋，马上给我滚出去。”

Kaworu smirked. "Or you'll what? Hit me? That's seems to be your solution to every social problem you run into, now doesn't it? Ms. Soryu, I don't see how you possibly can justify hurting other people the way you do. As much as you claim otherwise, you of all people have no right to-"  
薰冷笑道：“不然呢？你要打我吗？这似乎是你解决所有社交问题的惯用手段，不是吗？Soryu 小姐，我不明白你如何能证明自己伤害他人的行为是合理的。尽管你极力否认，但你这样的人根本没有资格去——”

SMACK! 啪的一声！

"-Assume any authority in other people's business when you haven't even solved your own. Now you can hit me as much as you like, but that doesn't change the fact-"  
-在解决自身问题之前，切勿妄自干预他人事务。尽管你可随意指责我，但事实终究无法改变。-

WHUMP! 轰隆！

"-That you're simply running away, just as you claim everyone else does."  
-你不过是在逃避，正如你所指责别人那样。

While Asuka's palm and knuckles stung like nothing else, Kaworu's face seemed spotless. What was this kid _made_ of, Asuka wondered?  
尽管明日香的手掌和指关节痛得厉害，但薰的脸却似乎毫发无伤。这孩子到底是什么做的，明日香心中疑惑不已。

Kaworu turned to go. "You can sit and think it over as much as you want, Ms. Soryu, but it seems to be you've had all the time in the world to do that. Now, either shape up your act, or give it all up. You can linger as long as you want, but you're just going to end up right back where you started."  
薰转身准备离开。“早濑小姐，你大可坐下来慢慢思考，但似乎你已有充足的时间来考虑这一切。现在，要么改变态度，要么就此放弃。你尽可以徘徊不前，但最终只会回到起点。”

Asuka just sat there, pretending to ignore the jabs from this complete stranger. Who the hell was he? Who did he think he was? What right did he have to talk to her like that?  
明日香静静地坐着，装作没听见那个陌生人的嘲讽。这家伙究竟是谁？他凭什么觉得自己有资格这样对她说话？

Fed up, feeling angrier than before, she rolled over and went back to bed.  
极度厌倦，怒气比以往更甚，她翻了个身，重新躺回床上。

It was later, much later, when Asuka decided to get up and stop moping around. Trying to kill herself via malnutrition didn't seem to be working – thank God for the feeding tube.  
许久之后，明日香终于决定振作起来，不再自暴自弃。她试图通过绝食来结束生命，但显然未能如愿——幸好有那根喂食管。

Venting her anger on others seemed to be the only outlet she really had. It had proven effective in the past, until the people she brutalized started becoming unresponsive. Piloting Eva for a ruthless megalomaniac does that to you. But this newcomer, this pale-faced boy from God knows where, seemed like a decent enough recipient.  
向他人宣泄怒火似乎是她唯一的真正发泄方式。过去这招屡试不爽，直到她伤害的人开始变得麻木不仁。为冷酷的独裁者驾驶 Eva，这便是后果。而这个新来的，这个来自不知何方的苍白少年，似乎是个不错的发泄对象。

God, she just wanted to punch his lights out!  
哎呀，她真想狠狠揍他一顿，让他晕头转向！

The logic center of her brain kicked in and reminded her that she had tried that already, and aside from a sore fist, she had gained nothing from the act. The guy didn't even flinch. That just made her hate him even more.  
她大脑的逻辑中枢开始运作，提醒她之前已经尝试过同样的举动，结果除了拳头疼痛外一无所获。那人甚至纹丝不动。这让她对他的厌恶更甚。

Her fist made contact with one of NERV's steel walls. She could have sworn it hurt less than that boy's face.  
她一拳砸在 NERV 的钢墙上，感觉比打在那男孩脸上还要不痛。

Deep down, she knew she was losing it. Letting herself slip away into delirium, and falling into malnutrition were hardly sane qualities, and she knew it even in her possessed state. Deep down, she also knew that everything the boy had said to her was true.  
内心深处，她明白自己正逐渐失控。放任自己滑向谵妄，陷入营养不良，这显然不是清醒的行为，即便在心智被占据的状态下，她也心知肚明。同时，她深知那个男孩对她说的每一句话都是事实。

Which made her hate him even more.  
这使她对他的恨意更深了。

"Good morning, Ms. Soryu," Kaworu said, causing said girl to jerk away. "Feeling better?"  
早上好，索龙小姐，"卡瓦鲁的话让那女孩不由得一缩。"现在感觉好些了吗？

Asuka recoiled at the sudden breach of silence, giving the boy a harsh glare. "Mother fucker! Why the hell do you keep stalking me?"  
明日香被这突如其来的声响吓了一跳，狠狠地瞪了那男孩一眼。“你这混蛋！为什么老跟着我？”

Kaworu shook his head. "Such language, Ms. Soryu. I haven't been stalking you, Ms. Soryu. It's been three days since our last encounter. Since then, I have been conversing with the other staff members of NERV. I believe you lost consciousness again and have remained there for the past 80 hours or so."  
薰摇了摇头，说道：“Soryu 小姐，您的言辞真是尖锐。我并非在跟踪您，自从我们上次相遇已过去三天。这段时间，我一直在与 NERV 的其他同事交流。我猜您再次昏迷了，而且已经持续了大约 80 个小时。”

Asuka turned and walked away. "Whatever, just leave me the hell alone!"  
明日香转过身，快步离开，"无所谓了，让我清静会儿！"

Kaworu shrugged. "I will in a moment, but I have to ask you – have you given any thought to my advice the other night?"  
薰耸耸肩。“我稍后就去，不过我想问你——你考虑过我那天晚上的建议吗？”

"Advice?" Asuka gawked. "You basically told me that I was worthless! I'd hardly call that advice!"  
建议？" 明日香愕然道。"你分明是在说我毫无价值！这怎么能算作建议呢！

"I'd call it constructive criticism."  
我会称之为具有建设性的批评。

"_Constructive_?" 有建设性吗？

"You got up, didn't you?"  
你已经起床了，是吧？

Asuka walked away. 明日香离开了。

"You haven't answered my que-"  
你还没回答我的问题呢-

"I _said_ leave me the fuck alone!"  
我说了，别来烦我！

"I believe the expletive you used before was 'hell' if I'm not mistaken-"  
如果我没记错，您之前用的那个词应该是'地狱'吧？

"Shut up!" Asuka was screaming now. "Shut up, shut _up_!"  
别说了！" 明日香此刻尖叫道。"别说了，别说了！

Kaworu just stared back at her. "No. You see, Ms. Soryu, and it hasn't taken me long to notice this…you're more lost than anyone around you. When you look at the world around, you don't see what's actually there – instead, you see the illusions that you've constructed out of an entire life's worth of isolation, dedication, and most of all, fear. Isolation from human compassion…dedication to an ideal that is ultimately just as unattainable as it is to the rest of the world…and fear that, despite all your hard work, you still might fail. After all the time and effort you put into building yourself, you're more afraid than anything else that you might still be just as helpless as the rest of us."  
薰只是静静地回望着她。“不，索尔尤小姐，我很快就察觉到了……你比周围任何人都更迷失。当你审视这个世界时，你看到的并非真实，而是你用一生的孤寂、执着和恐惧编织出的幻影。与人类的温情隔绝……执着于一个理想，这个理想和世上其他事物一样遥不可及……以及害怕，尽管你倾尽全力，你仍可能失败。毕竟你投入了那么多心血来塑造自己，你最害怕的是，你可能依然和我们其他人一样无助。”

Asuka blinked. She stood still for a long time, not doing anything. Kaworu had hit a mark, and he knew it. At long last, the shell had cracked, and Asuka was ready to come out.  
明日香眨了眨眼，久久地站在原地，一动不动。薰的话正中要害，他自己也心知肚明。最终，那层外壳裂开了，明日香准备展露真我。

"Who…who in God's name are you?"  
你…你究竟是谁？

Kaworu smiled. 薰露出了微笑。

"My name is Kaworu Nagisa."  
我叫渚薰。

xxxxx

Too tired to talk, though I will say this: In my experience, if you want to break a tough nut, there's only one solution - Get a tougher nut.  
虽然疲惫得不想多言，但根据我的经验，要解决棘手问题，唯一的策略就是——寻找一个更棘手的挑战。

---
Asuka glared out at the water. A lake of sorts was all that was left of most of Tokyo-3 after Unit 00 went boom not long ago. Not that Asuka really gave a damn.  
明日香怒视着湖面。零号机不久前的爆炸使得东京-3 大部分地区沦为一片湖泊。然而，明日香对此并不关心。

"Yes, it's a really nice lake," Asuka snorted. "Are we done now?"  
没错，这湖真的很美，" 飞鸟不以为然地说。"我们可以结束了吗？

Kaworu, seated atop an assortment of rocks, just sighed. "Ms. Soryu, your tastes for the beauty of nature aside, what else do you have planned? NERV doesn't plan on using you at all soon-"  
薰坐在岩石堆上，轻叹一声。“Soryu 小姐，除了你对自然之美的欣赏，你还有何打算？NERV 近期似乎并无启用你的计划——”

"Which is your fault, by the way."  
顺便提一下，这是你的责任。

"Not my fault," Kaworu shook his head. "I am merely the result. Anyhow, is there anything else you would rather be doing? Or anyone else to do anything with? Most of the people in the city have left, and judging by your sobriquets of your fellow pilots…what names did you use again?"  
这并非我的过错，" 薰摇头说道，"我不过是结果而已。话说回来，你还有其他更想做的事吗？或者想和别人一起做些什么？城里的人大多已离去，从你对其他飞行员起的绰号来看……你刚才是怎么称呼他们的？

"Baka-hentai and Wondergirl?" Asuka offered.  
"笨蛋变态和神奇女孩？" 明日香提议说。

"Those were them," Kaworu snapped his fingers. "Anyhow, judging from that, your fellow pilots are unsuitable company for you either. Whom else would you be spending your time with?"  
那些确实是他们，"薰打了个响指，"总之，从那情形判断，你的其他驾驶员同伴也不适合与你相处。你还能和谁共度时光呢？

"Anyone but you," Asuka glared.  
"除了你，谁都行," 明日香瞪着眼睛说。

Kaworu smiled. "Should I have left you in the hospital room then?"  
薰微笑着问道：“那我是不是该让你留在病房里呢？”

Asuka turned away, reality wearing her down. There was a long pause, before she sat on her haunches and muttered. "What good is doing anything with no one to appreciate you doing it?"  
明日香转过身，现实的沉重让她疲惫。她沉默了一会儿，蹲下身来低声道：“无人欣赏，做再多又有何用？”

Kaworu blinked. "I'm sorry?"  
薰眨了眨眼，问道：“您说什么？”

Asuka shook her head. "It's nothing. I was just-"  
明日香摇摇头说：“没什么，我只是……”

"Asuka," Kaworu said. "May I call you that?"  
Asuka，" Kaworu 问道，"我能否这样称呼你？

Asuka blinked. "What? Sure, do whatever you want."  
明日香眨了眨眼，说：“什么？随便你，想干嘛就干嘛。”

Kaworu smiled. "Well then, Asuka…hold still for a moment."  
薰微笑着说：“那么，明日香……稍微保持一下别动。”

Asuka stood rigid. "What? Is there a bug in my hair or something?"  
明日香僵直地站着，问道：“怎么了？我头发里有虫子吗？”

Kaworu chuckled. "No, no…just…don't move for a minute…"  
薰轻声笑道：“别，别动……就一会儿……”

She did, suspiciously, looking around to see if she could find some sort of hidden camera or anything else that would confirm her suspicions. About a minute and a half passed, and nothing happened. The subtle drone of the cicadas, relentlessly buzzing away the afternoon mixed with the gentle, repetitive sloshing of the wake of the water were the only sounds heard for that still moment.  
她确实心生疑窦，环顾四周，寻找可能存在的隐藏摄像头或其他能证实她疑虑的迹象。大约一分半钟过去了，毫无动静。唯有蝉鸣不绝于耳，与水波轻柔、有节奏的拍打声交织，构成了那一刻静谧的背景音。

"And?" Asuka muttered. "Am I waiting for something?"  
然后呢？" 明日香喃喃自语。"我是在等什么吗？

Kaworu sighed. "Clearly, the value of patience is lost on you."  
渚薰轻叹一声。“看来，你还没领悟到耐心的重要性。”

Asuka crossed her arms. "Patience for an expected outcome is one thing. Patience in ignorance is something else entirely, and it's not something I do."  
明日香双臂交叉，说道：“对预期结果保持耐心是一回事，而在一无所知中耐心等待则截然不同，这可不是我的作风。”

Kaworu sighed. "The true mentality of an Eva pilot. There always has to be _something_ going on. Can't you just once appreciate a moment of tranquility? I think if you do, you'll at least feel a little better."  
薰叹息道：“这便是 Eva 驾驶员的真实写照。总是风波不断。你就不能偶尔沉浸于片刻的宁静之中吗？我相信，若能如此，你至少会感到些许宽慰。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "What are you, my therapist?"  
明日香白了一眼，说：“怎么，你成我心理医生了？”

Kaworu shrugged. "A doctor isn't what you need, Asuka."  
薰耸耸肩说：“明日香，你需要的不该是医生。”

"Then what _do_ I need?" the redhead harrumphed.  
"那我还缺什么？"红发女子嘟囔着。

Kaworu shrugged. "You could just stay still for a few moments like I suggested. Come now, what's the harm? A few moments of stillness won't kill you."  
薰耸耸肩说：“你只需按我说的，静止片刻即可。来吧，这有何妨？短暂的静止又不会伤到你。”

Asuka sighed. "I've had a lot more than "a few moments of stillness" back the hospital."  
明日香叹息道：“我在医院里体验到的‘片刻宁静’可不止一两次。”

Kaworu smiled. "That's not the same thing, and you know it."  
薰微笑道：“这可不一样，你心里明白。”

"Hey, I'm trying to take your advice here," Asuka griped, eyes closed. "How can I be tranquil if you won't shut up?"  
嘿，我正努力按你说的做，" 明日香闭着眼睛抱怨。"你不停下来，我怎么保持心平气和？

Kaworu nodded, but didn't disturb the silent air. Once again, the scents and sounds of nature began to pervade, from the chirping cicadas, to the cascading tide, to the soft gentle scent of the seashore. In a mind that knew only anger and drive, the calm was an alien feeling to Asuka, a feeling of peace that washed over her, making her both comfortable and uneasy all at once.  
薰轻轻点头，未曾打破这份静谧。自然的气息与声响再次悄然弥漫，蝉鸣、潮涌，以及海边那淡淡的清香。对于内心充满愤怒与冲动的明日香来说，这份宁静显得格格不入，一种平和之感笼罩着她，既带来舒适，又隐隐不安。

So amidst, Asuka hardly even noticed Kaworu's soft humming. When she did, however, she didn't ask him to stop. Instead, she joined in, humming the world famous verse in harmony with the other, a gentle reverberation across effervescent horizons,  
在这般氛围中，明日香几乎未曾察觉到薰那轻柔的哼唱。然而，一旦她留意到，她并未要求他停止。反而，她加入了，与薰和谐地哼唱着那首举世闻名的旋律，温柔的回音在生机勃勃的天际间荡漾。

Asuka opened her eyes. "Well…that was…ok…"  
明日香睁开双眼，喃喃自语：“嗯……感觉还可以……”

Kaworu smiled. "I knew you'd enjoy it."  
薰笑着说：“我就知道你会喜欢。”

Asuka shrugged, stiffly getting to her feet. "It's not it's solved all my problems anyway."  
明日香耸耸肩，吃力地站起身来。“说到底，它也没能解决我所有的问题。”

Kaworu nodded, returning to his own. "But don't they feel a bit less of a burden?"  
薰点头，回到自己的座位。“但这样他们不就感觉负担减轻了一些吗？”

Asuka remained silent, debating with herself what sort of answer to give the pale boy. Finally, resigning to honesty, she sighed.  
明日香沉默不语，内心纠结着该给那个面色苍白的男孩怎样的答复。最终，她选择了诚实，轻叹一声。

"Yeah…" 嗯…

Kaworu nodded, smiling, but otherwise remained where he was. Confident that he had given her a push in the right direction, he waited for her to make the next move.  
薰微笑着点了点头，依旧站在原地。他确信自己已为她指明了正确的方向，于是静候她迈出下一步。

Asuka turned to him nodded. "Walk with me."  
明日香朝他转过身，点头示意。"陪我走走。"

"…And when I opened the door, she was hanging from the ceiling."  
…当我打开门，发现她悬挂在天花板上。

Kaworu listened intently as Asuka released memories of a scarred childhood, of a tormenting parentage, and of a decision that set her life on the hard road of unyielding perfection.  
薰专注地倾听着，明日香述说着她那充满伤痕的童年、痛苦的家族背景，以及那个让她踏上追求完美无瑕之路的决定。

"You're the first person I've ever told that to," Asuka admitted, after catching her breath. She was sweating hard, air coming out of her lungs in slow, laborious drags. "I don't know why I'm letting this out. It feels…wrong…to…"  
你是第一个听我说这件事的人，" 明日香喘息着承认。她满头大汗，呼吸沉重而艰难。"我不明白自己为何要说出来。这感觉……很不对劲……

"It's alright," Kaworu assured. "Such a dark secret, buried under so many years of devotion and isolation…I know it must be hard to simply retell it to a total stranger."  
没关系，" 薰安慰说，"这样一个深埋多年的秘密，隐藏在多年的奉献与孤独之中……我明白要向一个陌生人讲述它，确实不易。

Asuka nodded. "Yeah…" Still panting, she shrugged. "But for some reason, I don't really see you as a stranger any more."  
明日香点头道：“嗯……”她依旧喘息未定，耸了耸肩。“可不知怎的，我不再把你当外人看了。”

Kaworu smiled, eyes closed. "I'm glad. It's good to know that you find me worthy of your trust."  
薰微笑着，双眼轻闭。“我感到很高兴。得知你认为我值得信赖，这感觉真好。”

Asuka bit her lip. "Now…why don't you tell me something about yourself?"  
明日香轻咬下唇，问道："那么…不妨说说你自己，如何？"

Kaworu nodded. "Fair. I was raised in a lab, very similar to the one at NERV. The one who raised me is very much like your commander is: controlling. I was taught to believe that I existed for a single purpose."  
薰点头表示认同：“确实如此。我自幼在实验室中成长，那里的环境与 NERV 的颇为相似。抚养我的人控制欲极强，与你们的指挥官如出一辙。我从小被灌输的观念是，我生来只为一个目的。”

Asuka frowned. "You were taught to believe? Or you _do_ believe?"  
明日香皱起眉头：“你是被灌输的信仰？还是你内心真的相信？”

Kaworu smiled. "You recognize the distinction. Very good. I was taught to believe. So long as you recognize the means by which someone tries to manipulate you…you at very least can be honest with yourself. Even if you're forced to do something you don't want to do…you can at least acknowledge that, if it were your choice, the outcome would be different."  
薰微笑着说：“你能看出这其中的差别，真是不错。我学到的信念是，只要你察觉到他人操纵你的伎俩……至少你能对自己坦诚。即便被迫去做不愿做的事……你也能明白，若由自己选择，结果定会不同。”

Kaworu smiled as Asuka digested that. For someone who could be as honest as she had just been with him, he felt that she deserved the same honesty in return. It was risky, however. Taking into account Asuka's intelligence, she might very well decipher his true nature from that comment.  
薰微笑着，注视着明日香消化这一信息。既然她能如此坦率地对他，他认为她也应得到同样的真诚回应。不过，这确实有风险。以明日香的聪慧，她很可能从那句话中洞悉他的真实身份。

If she had divined any truths from his statement, however, she did not show it. "So…you were raised like Wondergirl, huh?"  
如果她从他的话中领悟到了什么真相，她并未表露出来。"这么说……你就像神奇女侠那样被养大的，是吧？"

Kaworu nodded. "You might say that."  
薰点头说：“你这么说也没错。”

Asuka snorted. "I think I just did."  
明日香哼了一声。"我觉得我刚才已经表达得很清楚了。"

Kaworu smiled. "Touché. Yes, I was raised like the First Child."  
薰微笑道：“确实如此。没错，我被培养得如同第一适格者。”

Asuka sighed. "I see…now, if only she would show the level of free will that you do."  
明日香叹息道：“我懂了……真希望她也能像你这样，展现出自己的自由意志。”

Kaworu frowned, turning his eyes away. "I'm not as free as you think…"  
薰皱着眉，将视线移开。“我并没有你以为的那么自由……”

No matter how hard Asuka pestered the boy, he would not reveal anything further on his comment. And many would affirm that the Second Child's ability to pester measured to the astronomic level.  
无论明日香怎样纠缠，那男孩始终不肯透露更多关于他评论的信息。不少人都会证实，第二适格者的纠缠功夫堪称天文级。

"So, how do you feel, now that you got all that off your chest?" Kaworu muttered, walking Asuka back to Misato's apartment. It was unlikely that either occupant was there at the moment, but that was probably a good thing.  
"现在你把心里话都倾诉出来了，感觉怎么样？" 薰低声说着，陪着明日香返回美里的住处。此时屋内多半无人，这或许倒是个好情况。

"And what would you know about my chest?" Asuka leered, smartly.  
"那么，你又对我胸口了解多少呢？" 明日香机智地反问道。

"Flattering to say the least," Kaworu nodded, his eyes not moving a fraction of an inch from where they should have been. "Though, your best feature by far is your eyes. True blue like yours, Asuka, is a rarity for most, and few ever really notice such nuances in favor of…other assets."  
至少可以说是在恭维，" 薰点头说道，目光坚定不移。"不过，你最吸引人的无疑是你的眼睛。像你这样纯正的蓝色，明日香，实属难得，大多数人往往忽略了这些细节，而更关注其他方面。

Asuka grinned. "I didn't expect you to recover from that bit."  
明日香咧嘴笑道：“真没想到你能从那一段缓过来。”

Kaworu smiled. "I don't falter easily."  
薰微笑道：“我可不是轻易就会动摇的。”

There was a moment of pause.  
那一刻，时间仿佛静止了。

"Thanks for the compliment, by the way," Asuka muttered.  
"对了，谢谢你的夸奖，" 明日香低声说道。

Kaworu nodded, smiling at her, kindly. "I give credit where credit's due. Is this the spot?"  
薰微笑着点了点头，目光温和地看着她。“该赞扬的我不会吝啬。就是这里吗？”

Asuka hadn't even noticed that she had stopped outside of the apartment door. "Oh. Yes, it is."  
明日香竟未察觉自己已驻足于公寓门前。"哦，确实如此。"

Kaworu nodded. "Very well, then. Sleep soundly, Asuka. I hope to see you in the morning."  
薰点头说：“那就好。好好睡一觉，明日香。期待明早与你相见。”

Asuka nodded, trying to return his kind face. All she could manage was a weak look of confusion. The door closed, and Kaworu's fox-like smile disappeared behind a metal plate.  
明日香点头回应，却只能流露出困惑的神情。随着门的关闭，薰那狡黠的笑容也被金属板遮挡。

Asuka stood still, facing her door for several minutes. Not long ago (though it may very well have been, she wasn't conscious to experience it) she had absolutely hated the boy she just said goodnight to. And now…  
明日香静立门前，凝视良久。不久前（尽管那时光或许已逝，她当时并未清醒感知），她对刚道过晚安的男孩深恶痛绝。然而此刻……

Asuka trembled, more confused than she had ever been. What the hell was she feeling anymore? She was so used to hating those around her, how the hell was she supposed to act when someone actually didn't get on her nerves? When someone made her, honestly and truthfully, made her feel like the whole world wasn't out to get her? How the hell was she supposed to understand emotions that she had denied herself since the age of seven?  
明日香颤抖着，内心比以往任何时候都更加迷茫。她现在究竟是什么感觉？她早已习惯了憎恨周围的人，当有人真的不触怒她时，她该如何应对？当有人让她真实地感受到整个世界并非与她为敌时，她该如何是好？她该如何理解那些自七岁起就拒绝承认的情感？

Asuka flicked the light switch on and threw her third houseguest a stern glare. "And what do you want?"  
明日香啪的一声打开灯，对第三位客人投以严厉的目光。“你有什么事？”

A loud 'wark' sounded, reiterating a fact that should have, in all fairness, been self-evident.  
一声响亮的“呱”响起，强调了一个本应显而易见的事实。

"Yeah, well, we don't always get what we want, do we?" Asuka muttered, ignoring the warm water penguin as she made her way to the kitchen and threw an instant meal tray into the microwave.  
"是啊，我们并非总能如愿以偿，对吧？" 明日香低声自语，对那只温暖的水企鹅视而不见，径直走进厨房，将一份即食餐盒塞进微波炉。

Another 'wark' broke the stillness.  
又一声“wark”打破了宁静。

Asuka removed the tray, and sat at the table, shoving the lumps of meat and tofu into her mouth. It couldn't have been any worse than the food the hospital gave her, and she hadn't eaten all day.  
明日香撤掉托盘，坐到桌前，大口吃着肉块和豆腐。这至少比医院的食物强，她已经一整天没进食了。

Apparently, neither had Pen-pen.  
看来 Pen-pen 也没有。

"Look, I'm not in the mood right now, okay?" Asuka grumbled. "Now shoo!"  
听着，我现在心情不好，明白吗？" 明日香嘟囔道。"快走开！

The bird's squawking and fluttering finally got the better of her, as she pulled a can of sardines from the fridge, tossing one to the bird, who gobbled up the morsel in haste, flapping and squawking gleefully.  
鸟儿的叫声和扑腾最终让她招架不住，她从冰箱里取出一罐沙丁鱼，扔了一条给鸟儿，鸟儿急忙吞下，欢快地拍翅鸣叫。

"Now are you gonna do a trick for me?" Asuka sighed, making light of the situation.  
"现在你打算给我露一手吗？" 明日香叹了口气，试图缓和一下气氛。

Pen-pen's definition of a trick seemed to be synonymous with the phrase "more food."  
Pen-pen 眼中的“trick”，似乎就是“再来点吃的”。

"Whatever, if it will at least keep you quiet."  
随便吧，只要能让你安静就行。

Staring down at her meal tray, she huffed, tossing the plate along with its half-eaten meal in the trash. "Oh, for God's sake, he's just some guy! Why the hell am I getting all worked up?"  
她低头盯着餐盘，气愤地将盘子和吃剩一半的饭菜一并丢入垃圾桶。“天哪，他不就是个普通人嘛！我这是在瞎激动什么？”

Pen-pen, currently focused on his meal, offered little advice.  
彭彭正专心致志地吃着饭，几乎没有提供任何建议。

"I mean, sure, he wasn't bad looking, but compared to Kaji, he…"  
我的意思是，他虽然长得不错，但与卡吉相比，还是……

She shut herself, angry that there was no one to blame for bringing him up but herself.  
她独自生闷气，意识到除了自己，无人该为抚养他长大负责。

Asuka sat back down at the table, laying her head down. "What am I supposed to do? How the hell am I supposed to react? Why can't I just shrug this guy off like I do everything else!"  
明日香再次坐下，头枕在桌上，自问：“我该如何是好？面对这种情况，我该如何反应？为何我不能像对待其他事那样，对这个家伙视而不见！”

She crumbled when she realized, that even that last claim was a lie. Despite her sincere efforts, she had broken. After years of perseverance, dedication, devotion, she was still, somehow, damn it all, still beaten by that wimp! And then, to top it off, that God Damn Doll went and beat the angel that fucking _raped_ her! It was no wonder her resolution against the male sex was weakening. God knows, everything _else_ about her was!  
当她发现连那最后的说辞都是谎言时，她彻底崩溃了。尽管她付出了真挚的努力，最终还是垮了。历经多年的坚持、奉献与忠诚，她竟然，该死的，还是败给了那个懦夫！更令人愤慨的是，那个该死的玩偶居然打败了那个强奸她的天使！难怪她对男性的决心开始动摇。天晓得，她的一切都在动摇！

Her heart, no less heavy than before, began to cry.  
她的心情依旧沉重，泪水开始涌出。

_No! Damn it, no! Don't you dare cry, Asuka!  
不行！该死，绝对不行！明日香，你敢哭试试！_

Yet she couldn't. Somehow, the tears just came. Something inside herself finally just relaxed.  
但她就是做不到。不知为何，泪水不由自主地流了出来。心底的某种东西终于释然了。

She couldn't do it anymore! She couldn't go through life pretending that nothing hurt! Why the hell was she supposed to be so perfect? Why had she been burdened with the task of being better than everyone else?  
她再也撑不下去了！她无法继续假装生活中一切安好，毫无痛楚！凭什么她非得追求完美？为何她要背负比他人更出色的重担？

_No one forced you to be perfect, dummkopf! You did that to yourself!  
追求完美是你自己的选择，没人强迫你，傻瓜！_

The fact that the apartment was devoid of any other human life undoing her final shield, she barred her teeth, letting the tears come freely.  
公寓空无一人，这摧毁了她最后的防线，她咬牙忍泪，任由泪水肆意流淌。

She cried for the life she refused to live. She cried because of the unnecessary grief she had put herself and everyone else through. She cried because it had taken her seven years to realize it.  
她为那个她不愿涉足的生活泪流满面。她哭泣，因为自己给所有人，包括自己，带来了无谓的痛苦。她哭泣，因为直到七年之后，她才恍然大悟。

She cried for her mother. She cried for Kaji.  
她为母亲哭泣，也为卡吉哭泣。

And she cried because, after everyone else in her life had said their piece, the one who showed her the true light had been a complete stranger.  
她泪流满面，因为在她生命中的每个人都已各抒己见后，指引她看到真正光明的人，竟是一个素未谋面的陌生人。

"I hope to see you too…Kaworu…"  
我也希望能见到你，渚薰…

A/N: Well, hopefully Asuka's recovery won't make her seem too OOC, you have to realize that in order for Asuka to even be _involved_ in a relationship at the stage in the series where Kaworu even becomes a character, she has to go through _some_ level of character change.  
希望明日香的恢复不会让她显得过于偏离原角色。要知道，在系列中卡瓦鲁出现时，为了让明日香能参与一段关系，她必须经历一些角色上的变化。

If the first chapter lacked any real hint of a relationship forming, I hope this one did a better job of making up for it. You have to understand, even though they look good together, Kaworu x Asuka is pretty hard to pull off the right way. It's difficult to not make Kaworu into a condescending bastard, because, like I said at the end of the first chapter, if you want to crack a tough nut, get a tougher nut.  
若第一章未能透露出两人关系发展的明显迹象，我期望本章能有所弥补。要知道，尽管薰和明日香看起来很搭，但要恰到好处地发展他们的关系实属不易。很容易让薰显得傲慢自大，正如我在首章末尾所言，若要解开一个硬壳，需用更坚硬之物。

Oh, and thanks for pointing out the misusage of the "Mrs." and "Ms." titles. I guess that's why using the "-san" suffix is so much easier. Also, Kaworu addressed her as Soryu Asuka Langley because, to me at least, that is the way her name is formed that would be known throughout the First Branch as the famous Second Child. It was a title to connote the implication of admiration, to which Kaworu is disappointed. I did it that way on purpose because, at that point, the name is all he knows – and thus, the name has to connote more gravity than it actually possesses. Just trying to explain that.  
哦，感谢你指出“Mrs.”和“Ms.”称呼的误用。或许这就是为何使用“-san”后缀更为简便。另外，薰称她为惣流·明日香·兰格雷，至少在我看来，这是她在第一支部广为人知的全名，作为备受瞩目的第二适格者。这样的称呼蕴含着敬意，而薰对此感到失望。我特意如此设定，因为在那时，这个名字是他所知的全部——因此，它必须承载比实际更重的意义。仅此说明。

Anyway, thanks for reading. Will post more soon.  
不管怎样，谢谢您的阅读。不久后将发布更多内容。
