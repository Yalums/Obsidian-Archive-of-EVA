Summary: Sohryu Asuka-Langley's heart was beyond mere bruise and break. That was true, until the day she finds Ikari Shinji pining for an unresponsive Rei. This was the event that she had to examine her whole persona and learn what it was like to have her heart squashed, and, worse than that, to have it done to her by no one else but herself.  
概要：Sohryu Asuka-Langley 的心灵创伤远不止表面的瘀伤和破碎。直到她目睹 Ikari Shinji 对冷漠的 Rei 深情款款的那一刻，她才不得不重新审视自己的内心世界。这一刻让她深刻体会到心被碾压的痛苦，更甚者，这种痛苦竟是由她自己亲手造成的。

It's pitiful, the way _Dummkopf_ goes on, as if the whole world depended on this, whatever this was, the way he's pacing around now, looking as if he were on the verge of something very big, so big in fact that he would burst if he couldn't spit it out. Because, really.  
可怜的 Dummkopf，他那副模样，仿佛整个世界的命运都系于此，无论这“此”为何物。他此刻来回踱步，神情紧张，似乎即将迎来一场重大事件，重大到他若不吐露心声，便会崩溃。说真的，这情景实在令人同情。

I know what this is about. It's always about this—it's been about this the last thirty-eight times. It's about Wonderdoll and it's about mundane, maudlin emotions like 'love' and 'devotion'. As if Wonderdoll could even feel emotion, because from the looks of that girl she could get hit by a speeding train and nothing would change from her expression.  
我清楚这是什么话题。总是离不开这个——过去三十八次讨论的都是这个。话题围绕着 Wonderdoll，以及那些平凡且多愁善感的情绪，比如“爱”和“忠诚”。好像 Wonderdoll 真能体会情感一样，从那女孩的表情来看，即使她被飞驰的列车撞到，她的表情也不会有丝毫改变。

But that's not the point. If _Dummkopf_ keeps pacing that way I swear I'm going to push him over the balcony rail. Seriously. I can see his lips moving, I know he's rehearsing this whole big speech for his confession extravaganza. Gag me. I don't even want to see this.  
但这并非关键。倘若那蠢货还那样来回踱步，我真想把他推下阳台栏杆。说真的，我看得出他在默念，显然是在为即将到来的忏悔盛会准备长篇大论。简直让人作呕，我连看都不想看。

But I'm here, aren't I?  
我在这里，对吧？

…

He's stopped pacing now, well, not in front of me anyway. He's broadened his horizons to the perimeter of the apartment. I marvel, really. Considering the mere amount of clutter in this place, it's a wonder how he manages to go around, and around. And around. And around some more.  
他现在不再在我面前踱步了。他的视野已经扩展到了整个公寓的周边。我真的很惊讶，考虑到这个地方的杂乱程度，真不知道他是怎么绕来绕去，不停地绕圈的。

Okay, this is getting really annoying, now. It's even more annoying than the last time.  
好吧，现在这种情况真的很让人恼火。比上次还要让人心烦。

The last time he went into these sorts he wore almost half the apartment floor. Then he wouldn't talk for hours, just staring into space or stuffing his ears with those earphones of his, listening to music that I'll bet he doesn't even really hear. When we were in school, he stutters at the mere sight of her. And when she walks by, he stops breathing. I know, I checked. And half the time he looked a pale shade of blue, as if he was about to explode, or implode, because it also looked like he was keeping whatever it was inside.  
上次他陷入这种状态时，几乎占据了半个公寓的地面。随后他几个小时都不说话，只是盯着空中或者塞着耳机听音乐，我敢打赌他甚至根本没在听。上学时，他一看到她就结巴。而当她走过时，他屏住呼吸。我知道，我检查过。而且有一半时间他脸色苍白，像是快要爆炸或内爆，因为他似乎也在压抑着内心的某种情绪。

This time is just far, far worse than that. I can hear him trying to mutter 'suki' and 'Ayanami' in the same sentence under his breath. He wishes; he's loud enough to wake anyone in a mile's radius. I roll my eyes. What am I doing here?  
这次的情况远比那次糟糕。我甚至能听到他在低声尝试把“喜欢”和“绫波”连在一起说。他真是异想天开；他的声音大到足以吵醒方圆一英里内的任何人。我无奈地翻了个白眼。我到底在这里做什么呢？

…

Please don't answer that.  
请别回答那个问题。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
Today's the day. I know because I can hear him through the wall, trying to pep himself up like a boxer getting ready for a match. He's even bouncing, 'cause I can feel it from the floor. Oh, _susser Gott._  
今天就是那个日子。我之所以知道，是因为我能听到他在隔壁，像一个即将上场的拳击手一样自我激励。他甚至在跳跃，因为我能从地板的震动中感受到。哦，天哪。

We get to school and Wonderdoll's there, sitting in the bench, reading her NERV manual. I swear, the girl's been through it forty times and she's still rereading it. Must lead a pretty boring life. Anyway, beside me—  
我们抵达学校时，Wonderdoll 正坐在长椅上，埋头阅读她的 NERV 手册。我敢说，她已经反复读了不下四十遍，却还在一遍遍地看。她的生活想必相当乏味。话说回来，我身边——

I can feel _Dummkopf_ stiffening. Oh, _scheisse._  
我能感觉到 Dummkopf 变得僵硬。哦，糟糕。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
It's really annoying to get the truth thrown in your face at the most inopportune times. Especially if the truth involves life-changing decisions that you have to decide on in a fraction of a second. I hate those. I can think fast, sure, but for something that'll change my life?  
在最不恰当的时刻被真相直击，确实令人烦恼。尤其是当真相牵扯到需要在刹那间做出的人生重大抉择时。我对此深恶痛绝。虽说我反应迅速，但对于那些能彻底改变我命运的事情，我又能如何应对呢？

I know what he feels for Ayanami. It's real. So real in fact that it scares even me sometimes. There is just something about the way he looks at her, something in his eyes, or the way his whole face lights up when he sees her, like a godforsaken Christmas tree in Plaza Berlin. It's just not normal. I know that a lot of boys find Ayanami pretty (ha.), and the way they stare is just different from Ikari's.  
我深知他对绫波的感情是真挚的。这种真挚到有时连我都感到心悸。他凝视她的方式，那眼神中的深意，或是他见到她时脸上绽放的光彩，宛如柏林广场上那棵被遗忘的圣诞树，熠熠生辉。这确实非同寻常。我明白许多男生都觉得绫波美丽（呵），但他们注视她的方式与碇截然不同。

And I know that if I do this, if I just give him one infinitesimal push, he will be happy for the rest of his life. Wait, that's rather optimistic. He'll be really happy, then. I know that. Just one little tug in the right direction and he won't only be happy, he'll be at peace, and I'll have peace back. It's a win-win situation.  
我明白，只要我稍加推动，哪怕只是微不足道的助力，他就能终身幸福。不过，这样说或许过于乐观。他会非常快乐，这一点我确信无疑。只需在正确方向上轻轻一拉，他不仅会快乐，还会心安理得，而我也能重获内心的平静。这无疑是个双赢的局面。

Yep, maybe if I tell myself a few more times it'll come true.  
是的，或许我再多对自己说几遍，它就会变成现实。

I wonder when I got this selfless streak, really. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a very selfish bitch, and that I'd put myself before others, and I know that in the same way a right push can make him a king, the wrong pull can destroy him, destroy them.  
我确实好奇自己何时养成了这种无私的倾向。我坦然承认自己是个极度自私的人，总是优先考虑自己，我也明白，正如一次正确的推动能让他登上王位，一次错误的抉择也能彻底摧毁他，甚至更多人。

It's what I want. I want to wreck this, muck it up. I want this thing to fail. I want him for myself, dammit! And I can make it happen, all I have to do is make one little move and she will turn away. He will be mad, sure, but I'm not afraid of him—what matters is that he's not hers.  
这正是我渴望的。我想要破坏这一切，把它搞得一团糟。我盼望这件事失败。我想要他完全属于我，天哪！我能实现这个愿望，只需一个小小的举动，她就会转身离去。他当然会生气，但我并不畏惧他——关键在于他不再属于她。

But I can't do it, this time.  
但这次我确实做不到。

Because he deserves to be happy, this time.  
因为他值得拥有这份幸福，就在此刻。
<p align="center">~*~</p>
I take one hand and connect it to _Dummkopf_'s shoulder. Then I give him one forceful push towards Wonderdoll.  
我抓住一只手，搭在笨蛋的肩上，然后用力将他推向奇迹娃娃。

"Oh, do it already," I holler. "You've been driving me insane! Now she can have you all to herself!"  
“哎，赶紧的，”我嚷嚷着，“你简直让我抓狂！这下她可以独占你了！”  

He turns to me with the most shocked face he has ever put on in his life. I wink at him. "Ha, ha, go get 'em, tiger."  
他转过身来，脸上挂着他这辈子最震惊的表情。我向他眨了眨眼，说：“哈哈，加油，老虎。”

He smiles back. "Thanks.. Asuka."  
他微笑着回应。“谢谢你，明日香。”

Then he turns and runs to her.  
随后，他转身奔向她。

"It's no problem," I whisper. "Not a problem at all."  
这完全不是问题，" 我轻声说道。"根本没有任何问题。

I know he can't hear me.  
我明白他听不到我的声音。

It is a problem, that I know I'll have to live with this for the rest of my known life. That I'll have to live with the knowledge that I could have stopped this and didn't, that I had a hand in this.  
这是一个难题，我明白自己将不得不在余生中与之共处。我必须承受这样的认知：我本可以阻止这一切却未能做到，我在这件事上有所牵涉。

The tears sting. I don't cry.  
泪水刺痛了双眼，但我没有哭泣。

But there's a first time for everything.  
但万事总有开端。

*This is the feeling of your heart being broken— 
这就是心碎的感觉——
It squeezes in your chest, trying to gouge out that last drop of blood to sustain you. Then it stops. And then you feel something blocking the veins in your chest and a lump forms in your throat and it's not budging. You feel an empty pit in your stomach. You feel spent, used, fatigued. And in the face of all this pain and emptiness, your blood flows from your eyes down your face in the form of tears.  
那种感觉紧紧压迫在胸口，仿佛要榨干最后一滴血来维持生命。随后，它突然停止。紧接着，你感到胸部的血管被某种东西堵塞，喉咙里形成了一个硬块，无法移动。胃里空荡荡的，你感到精疲力竭，被耗尽，极度疲倦。在这一切痛苦和空虚面前，泪水从眼中涌出，顺着脸颊流淌。
I know because I feel it.  
我之所以知道，是因为我有所感觉。
And worse, I did it to myself.  
更糟的是，我这是自找的。*
