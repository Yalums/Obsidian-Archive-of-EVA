Rain pours down in sheets, hammering against the red umbrella in Asuka's hand and making it waver- or that's what she tells herself. Water splashes against the toes of her shoes and slides off the slick black surfaces, rejoining the larger puddles congregating on the ground. The slap of soles against damp concrete echoes through the empty street, devoid of life save for the one soaked silhouette passing by the street lamps.  
雨如倾盆，重重敲打在明日香手中的红色雨伞上，令其摇摆不定——至少她是这么告诉自己的。水花溅在她鞋尖，顺着光滑的黑色表面滑落，汇入地面聚集的更大水洼。湿漉漉的混凝土上，鞋底拍打的声音在空荡的街道回响，除了路灯下匆匆掠过的那道湿透的身影，整条街再无生机。

"Why doesn't it stop?" Asuka hisses, her knuckles paling around the handle of her umbrella. Her lowered eyes catch a pool of light being cast from above, and her pace slows as she slowly navigates around it, the angry flick of her feet throwing down circles within circles. She eyes the silver shadows of the raindrops, briefly illuminated in the artificial light before pattering against the sidewalk. "Hah!" Asuka mutters, and she stomps away from the street lamp, umbrella shaking harder than before.  
"为什么不停下来？" 明日香低声咆哮，她的手指紧紧抓住雨伞柄，指节发白。她低垂的目光捕捉到一束从上方投下的光，她的步伐随之放缓，小心翼翼地绕过那片光亮，愤怒的脚步在地上划出一圈又一圈。她注视着雨滴的银色影子，在人造光中短暂闪耀，随即啪嗒啪嗒地落在人行道上。"哈！" 明日香咕哝着，她从路灯下大步走开，雨伞摇晃得比之前更厉害。

"I don't understand why it had to be _her_," she continues. "They could've sent out that idiot Shinji; he could've killed that damn Angel just as well. Probably would've done a better job of it, too!" She skirts another lamppost, her entire arm trembling now. "Or they-" Her breath hitches and she stumbles to a stop at the end of the street, doubling over and pressing her free hand to her stomach.  
"我不明白为什么非得是她，" 她继续说道。"他们本可以派那个白痴真嗣去；他也能干掉那个该死的天使。说不定还能做得更好！" 她绕过另一根灯柱，整条手臂现在都在颤抖。"或者他们——" 她的呼吸一窒，在街道尽头踉跄停下，弯下腰，用空着的手按住腹部。

"Why did it have to be her? Why didn't he do anything? Why didn't you just let me _die_!?" The umbrella bounces into a puddle and rolls briefly before beginning to fill up with rainwater. Asuka grabs at the collar of her tank top, her harsh panting sending out small puffs of vapor to be perforated by the rain.  
“为什么非得是她？他为什么什么都没做？为什么不让我去死！？”伞弹进了一个水坑，滚动了一会儿就开始积满雨水。明日香抓住自己的背心领口，急促的呼吸喷出细小的蒸汽，被雨水穿透。

"I didn't want to be saved," Asuka whimpers as her drenched tank top begins to cling to her skin. "Didn't need to... I hate her, I hate _her,_ I-" The Second Child shivers, her limbs numbing, and slowly she straightens herself and retrieves her umbrella. A quick shake empties it of water, and it takes its place back above her head, a shaky parody of a halo.  
“我不想被救，”明日香哽咽着，湿透的背心开始紧贴她的肌肤。“不需要……我恨她，我恨她，我——”第二适格者颤抖着，四肢麻木，她慢慢挺直身体，捡起伞。快速一抖，水珠四溅，伞重新回到她头顶，像是一个摇摇欲坠的光环。

Cold blue eyes survey the street and the shaded apartments above, as if ensuring no one else saw her moment of weakness. There is nothing, not even a shadow, to mark what transpired. Gathering up the last of her fury, Asuka expels it all in one final, spiteful, "I hate her."  
冰冷的蓝眼睛扫视着街道和上方遮蔽的公寓，仿佛在确认没有人看到她的脆弱时刻。没有任何痕迹，甚至连影子都没有，来标记所发生的一切。明日香聚集起最后的怒火，在一声最后的、充满怨恨的“我恨她”中将其全部释放。

And she moves on. 而她继续前行。

The melody of falling rain is one that Rei Ayanami has rarely heard, but it drowns out the humming and banging of her faulty apartment, and thus it is normally agreeable. On this day, though, Rei finds herself sitting on her bed, which she has pushed so it lies under the lone window in her small dwelling. She stares out at the rain pelting her window; notes how similar in appearance it is to the splattering of rain against Unit-00's optic visor. Her hands flex involuntarily.  
落雨的旋律是绫波零鲜少听闻的，但它淹没了她破旧公寓的嗡鸣和撞击声，因此通常是悦耳的。然而今天，零发现自己坐在床边，这张床已被她推至小屋内唯一一扇窗下。她凝视着雨水敲打窗户的景象；注意到它与雨水溅在零号机光学护目镜上的样子何其相似。她的手不由自主地弯曲。

Surely the death of the Fifteenth Angel would have caused the rain to vanish, yet Rei knows this is not true. She is aware, nearly painfully so, of the Angel's effect on her fellow pilot. She knows the Second Child's hatred of her has probably increased in magnitude, and though it should not, it disturbs her. "That was not my intention," she whispers, attempting to ease the pressure building in her chest.  
第十五使徒的死亡本应让雨水消失，但零知道这并非事实。她几乎痛苦地意识到使徒对她同僚驾驶员的影响。她知道二号驾驶员对她的憎恨可能加剧了，尽管这不应如此，却令她不安。“那并非我的本意，”她低语，试图缓解胸中积聚的压力。

The wandering of her mind leads her to a memory of another day, long before the Angels began their assault, a day when the skies had opened up and poured rain on the city. One of her classmates had said, rather loudly, that raindrops were really the falling tears of a god: but there were no gods; only men and Angels.  
她的思绪飘荡，让她回忆起另一个日子，那是在使徒开始攻击之前很久的一天，那天天空敞开，大雨倾盆而下。她的一个同学大声说道，雨滴其实是神明落下的泪水：但世上没有神明，只有人类和使徒。

_I wonder if Angels can cry_, Rei thinks, then amends herself: _The Lilim can, but do all Lilim cry? Did Pilot Sohryu cry? If I am made in the image of the Lilim, am I able to cry?_  
丽想，不知道使徒会不会哭泣，随即修正自己的想法：莉莉姆会哭，但所有的莉莉姆都会哭吗？飞行员惣流会哭吗？如果我是按照莉莉姆的形象创造的，我能哭吗？

A rumble of thunder shakes the window, the rattling of glass shattering Rei's train of thought. More light flashes in the distance, and Rei squints through the streaked glass. For a moment she thinks Arael has returned, and her pulse quickens; there is another rolling of thunder, and Rei slouches back down on her bed.  
一阵雷声震动窗户，玻璃的颤动打断了丽的思绪。远处又有闪电闪烁，丽透过模糊的玻璃眯眼望去。一时间她以为亚拉尔回来了，心跳加速；又是一阵雷声滚滚，丽又颓然坐回床上。

"The scenario will be completed soon," she whispers, gently resting one hand atop the other and squeezing it. "I will fulfill my purpose, and then there will be no more Angels. Perhaps no more suffering." She pauses, the corners of her mouth curving downwards. "Before I do, though, I should apologize to Pilot Sohryu. Perhaps the next time I see her." Rei nods to herself and resumes her vigil at the window, gazing out at the city with its crumbled buildings, lying untouched from battles with the Twelfth and Fourteenth Angels.  
“场景即将完成，”她轻声细语，温柔地将一只手放在另一只手上并紧握。“我将履行我的使命，之后将不再有使徒。或许也不会再有苦难。”她顿了顿，嘴角微微下垂。“但在那之前，我应该向惣流驾驶员道歉。也许下次见到她时。”绫波点点头，继续在窗边守望，凝视着那座城市，其破碎的建筑在第十二和第十四使徒的战斗后依旧未被触碰。

Lightning and thunder rock the apartment again, closer this time. A single droplet of water traces its way down Rei's cheek. She makes a mental note to ask NERV to repair the leaks.  
雷电再次震撼了公寓，这次更近了。一滴水珠顺着绫波的脸颊滑落。她在心里记下，要向 NERV 请求修补漏水的地方。

---

Asuka sighs as she walks down the street, her umbrella in one hand and her schoolbag in the other. "Stupid Shinji, getting me detention," she growls, kicking at a puddle. "That's the last time I ask him for help with kanji. The idiot can't even write in his first language! So of course _he_ gets to walk home while it's only drizzling, and as soon as I'm done, what happens? The damn sky decides to take a dump on me! Oh, when I get home I'm going to-"  
明日香叹息着走在街上，一手撑着伞，另一手提着书包。“笨蛋真嗣，害我被留堂，”她咕哝着，踢了一脚水坑。“这是我最后一次请他帮忙写汉字了。那白痴连自己的母语都不会写！所以他可以淋着毛毛雨回家，而我一结束，天就怎样？老天爷决定给我来场倾盆大雨！哦，等我回家后，我一定要——”

Exactly what Asuka had planned for Shinji is lost in the roar of the rain and the sudden shock that flits across her face. She narrows her eyes, squints, shakes her head and rubs her eyes, but no matter what she does she cannot shake the image of Ayanami Rei from her mind. "Great, I must be sick," Asuka says, stomping over. "I'm hallucinating!" She swings her schoolbag forward, intent on dispelling the image and going on with her day. Instead her bag bounces off solid flesh, and Rei turns, her wide red eyes showing the faintest hint of surprise.  
究竟明日香为真嗣策划了什么，已被雨声的轰鸣和突然掠过她脸上的震惊所掩盖。她眯起眼睛，摇摇头，揉了揉眼睛，但无论她怎么做，都无法从脑海中抹去绫波零的形象。“太好了，我一定是病了，”明日香一边说着，一边跺着脚走过去。“我出现幻觉了！”她挥动书包，试图驱散那影像，继续过她的日子。然而她的书包却撞上了坚实的肉体，零转过身来，她那双大大的红眼睛里流露出一丝微弱的惊讶。

"Pilot Sohryu. You are out late."  
“碇君。你这么晚还在外面。”

"_I'm_ out late?! I had detention, you idiot; you saw me get it! I should ask why you're out here in the rain, not the other way around. You don't even have an umbrella. Look at you, you're drenched!"  
“我晚？我被留堂了，你这白痴；你亲眼看见的！我该问你为什么在这雨中，而不是反过来。你连伞都没有。看看你，浑身湿透了！”

Rei looks down, as if only just noticing the state of her school uniform. Asuka sighs and extends her umbrella a short distance, so the canopy covers Rei as well. "Are you going to just stand there? What are you doing, anyway?!"  
丽低头看着，仿佛刚刚才注意到自己的校服状态。明日香叹了口气，将伞稍微伸远一些，让伞篷也能遮住丽。“你就打算这么站着吗？你到底在干什么？！”

"I..." Rei looks around, then reaches into her schoolbag and produces a small plastic card. Asuka recognizes it as one of NERV's ID cards right away, only this one has Shinji's name and face plastered onto it. "I was asked to give this to Pilot Ikari after school... but I had forgotten, so I attempted to follow him to give it to him. I lost him shortly after, and it had begun to rain, so I decided I would go home... except I do not know where home is."  
“我……”丽环顾四周，然后从书包里拿出一张小塑料卡片。明日香立刻认出这是 NERV 的 ID 卡，只是这张上面贴着真嗣的名字和照片。“有人让我放学后把这张卡交给碇真嗣……但我忘了，所以我试图跟着他交给他。不久后我就跟丢了，然后开始下雨，所以我决定回家……只是我不知道家在哪里。”

"You don't know?!" Asuka shrieks, growing increasingly disbelieving by the second. "What kind of an answer is that?"  
“你不知道？！”明日香尖叫起来，越来越难以置信。“这是什么回答？”

"I am used to commuting directly to and from NERV Headquarters and the school. I do not see any reason to memorize alternate routes."  
"我习惯于直接往返于 NERV 总部和学校之间。我不认为有必要记住其他路线。"

"Useless! Sometimes I wonder how you even get your EVA to move. Give me that." Asuka tucks her bag under one arm and snatches the ID card away from Rei, muttering about NERV choosing some impossibly dense girl over her as the First Child. She doesn't catch Rei's brief downward glance, or the slight narrowing of her eyes. "So if I take you back to the school, can you find your way back?"  
"没用！有时候我真怀疑你是怎么让 EVA 动起来的。把那个给我。" 明日香将她的包夹在腋下，从绫波手中夺过 ID 卡，低声抱怨 NERV 居然选了一个如此迟钝的女孩而不是她作为第一适格者。她没有注意到绫波短暂的目光下垂，以及眼中微微的收紧。"如果我带你回学校，你能找到回来的路吗？"

Rei blinks. "Why would you want to accompany me when you can simply give me directions?"  
绫波眨了眨眼。"为什么你想陪我回去，而不是直接给我指路呢？"

"It's raining, stupid, and you don't have an umbrella! And if you didn't have the idea to use your bag to cover your head, how am I supposed to trust you to follow simple instructions?"  
"下雨了，笨蛋，你还没带伞！而且如果你连用包遮头的想法都没有，我怎么相信你能听从简单的指示？"

"Those are unrelated-" "这两者无关-"

"Just shut up and start walking, Wondergirl. The sooner we get there, the sooner I can go home." Asuka motions toward the direction she had just come from with a jerk of her head, and she feels Rei fall in beside her, a constant but silent presence. The redhead scrunches her eyes shut and begins to run numbers in her mind. She can be rid of Rei in as short a time as fifteen minutes, maybe ten if she's smart enough to know how to 'go straight'. If that's the case, she can abandon her at the street corner, and-  
"闭嘴，快走吧，奇迹少女。我们越早到那儿，我就能越早回家。" 明日香用头示意向她刚来的方向，感觉到绫波在她身边跟上，始终沉默但如影随形。红发少女紧闭双眼，开始在脑海中计算。她可以在短短十五分钟内摆脱绫波，如果她足够聪明知道如何'直走'，甚至可能只需十分钟。如果是那样的话，她可以在街角把她丢下，然后-

"Would you like me to hold the umbrella, Pilot Sohryu?" asks Rei, jerking Asuka out of her calculations.  
"你要我帮你撑伞吗，惣流·明日香·兰格雷？" 绫波的话语将明日香从计算中拉回现实。

"_Scheisse!_" Asuka shouts, and almost staggers off the curb. Rei stares at her, a few strands of wet hair trailing in front of her eyes. "Haven't you ever heard of personal space, Wondergirl? And to answer your question, no way! What if you take it and run off with it, huh?"  
"该死！" 明日香大喊一声，差点从路边跌落。绫波盯着她，几缕湿发垂在眼前。"你没听说过个人空间吗，三无少女？至于你的问题，想都别想！万一你拿着伞跑掉了怎么办？"

"I would not do that to you, Pilot Sohryu."  
"我不会那样对你的，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。"

"I think _I'll_ keep a handle on it, thanks," Asuka says, straightening her shoulders. "And can you please stop calling me that? It's getting on my nerves."  
"我想我还是自己拿着吧，谢谢。" 明日香挺直了肩膀说，"还有，你能别再那样叫我了吗？我快烦死了。"

"Pilot Sohryu?" "草薙驾驶员？"

"Yes, that!" "对，就是那个！"

"But that is who you are, is it not?"  
"但那就是你的本质，不是吗？"

"My name is Asuka, get it? Look, how about this. If you call me Asuka, I'll stop calling you Wondergirl and First, alright?"  
"我的名字是明日香，明白吗？听着，这样吧。如果你叫我明日香，我就不再叫你奇迹女孩和第一了，好吗？"

Rei stops in her tracks, briefly exposing herself to the rain as Asuka rolls her eyes and backtracks to keep her covered. "That is... agreeable," she says at last. "Asuka."  
绫波零停下脚步，短暂地暴露在雨中，明日香翻了个白眼，退回去继续为她遮雨。“那……可以接受，”她最终说道，“明日香。”

A small, wry smile spreads across Asuka's face. "You're getting there. Rei."  
一个略带嘲讽的微笑在明日香脸上展开。“你快明白了，绫波。”

The rushing of waves are the only soundtrack to be had in the ruins of Tokyo-3. Not even the wind dares disturb the stygian landscape, and what purplish clouds remain hang deathly still in the silence. It is under this violet sky with its red perversion of a halo that Asuka picks her way through the bits of concrete and steel.  
海浪的奔涌是东京-3 废墟中唯一的背景音乐。连风都不敢打扰这阴沉的景象，残留的紫云在死寂中静止不动。在这紫色的天幕下，带着一圈红色扭曲光环的背景下，明日香小心翼翼地穿过混凝土和钢铁的碎片。

She doesn't know exactly what she's looking for; she only knows that she left Shinji, the only other living soul she's seen so far, on that pristine beach with its white, soulless sands, that she's hungry, and that she feels like she's being watched.  
她并不确切知道自己寻找的是什么；她只知道她把真嗣，她迄今为止见到的唯一另一个活人，留在了那片洁白无魂的沙滩上，她感到饥饿，而且觉得有人在窥视她。

The first thing is perhaps the easiest to address of her worries. When she awoke, it was only because her lungs were screaming for air and her throat felt like it was on fire. In her deluded state of mind, she had raised her hand to the Third Child's cheek- to slap him, perhaps- but instead all she felt was the gentle gliding of skin against her fingertips. It made her sick, and once he had finished his pitiful bout of crying, he had curled up in a little ball on the beach. In fact, he was probably still there, an empty shell of a body in a world where shells were priceless and souls were a dime a dozen.  
她最先想到的或许是她忧虑中最容易解决的。当她醒来时，只是因为她的肺部急需空气，喉咙像着了火一样。在她迷糊的意识中，她曾举手去触碰第三适格者的脸颊——或许是想扇他一巴掌——但结果她只感受到了指尖轻柔的肌肤触感。这让她感到恶心，而他哭完那场可怜的哭泣后，便蜷缩成一个小球躺在沙滩上。事实上，他可能还在那里，在这个贝壳珍贵、灵魂廉价的世界上，他就像一个空壳。

What a waste. 真是浪费。

Now, the second thing- Asuka grimaces as her stomach twists in on itself- she's hungry. She doesn't know how much time has passed between Third Impact and her surfacing on the beach, or even if there's any food left in the rubble of the Fortress City. Briefly she wonders if that bloody sea would provide any sustenance, and if it did, if it would be considered cannibalism. Then she thought, if _mother_ is in that sea with everyone else, it would be both sinful and shameful to partake of it, and crossed that thought off the list.  
现在，第二件事——明日香皱起眉头，她的胃在翻腾——她饿了。她不知道第三次冲击和她出现在海滩之间过去了多久，甚至不知道堡垒城市废墟中是否还有食物。她短暂地想那片血海是否能提供营养，如果是的话，这是否算作同类相食。然后她想到，如果母亲和其他人一起在那片海中，食用它既罪恶又可耻，于是她打消了这个念头。

Instead, the broken pilot forces her legs and arms to carry her through mountains of gravel and ruin in search of food that is probably as devoid of nutrition as everything else. She'll be damned if she lays down and dies like the idiot she left on the beach, though.  
相反，这位受伤的飞行员强迫自己的双腿和双臂，穿越堆积如山的碎石和废墟，寻找可能和其它一切一样缺乏营养的食物。但她绝不会像那个她在海滩上留下的傻瓜一样躺下等死。

Then there's the last thing. She hasn't checked since she sat up on the beach, but the head of Lilith-Rei-Adam-Another is probably still sitting on the horizon, grinning like a gargoyle. She doesn't want to turn and look again. The last time she did, she had to look away before it drove her mad. Time has passed now, how much she does not know, but the shattered remnants of her pride burn in her heart and tell her to look, to look back, even though she does not want to.  
最后还有一件事。自从她在海滩上坐起来后，她就没再检查过，但莉莉丝-丽-亚当-另一个的头颅可能还挂在天边，像石像鬼一样咧嘴笑着。她不想再回头看。上次她这么做时，还没等那景象逼疯她，她就不得不移开了视线。现在时间已经过去，具体多久她不知道，但她心中破碎的自尊在燃烧，告诉她要看，要回头看，尽管她并不想这么做。

She does. 她还是看了。

That horrible half-head is still looming in the distance with its wide eyes and vacant smile. It looks like Rei, it looks like Shinji, it looks like someone she's never met in this life but perhaps in another; it looks like love and hate and it makes her _sick._  
那个可怕的半头怪物依旧在远处徘徊，瞪着大眼，挂着空洞的微笑。它看起来像丽，像真嗣，像她此生未曾谋面但在另一世或许相识的人；它像是爱与恨的化身，让她感到恶心。

So then, she asks herself, why does it make her want to cry?  
于是，她问自己，为何它又让她想要哭泣？

---

The beach is empty, and the ocean washes away her footsteps. The beach is only empty because she has cleaned it out herself, picked up the only two things that dared show their faces, and now she has taken it upon herself to canvass the entire length of sand to see if anyone else has come ashore.  
海滩空无一人，海浪冲刷掉了她的足迹。海滩之所以空旷，是因为她亲自清理了它，捡起了仅有的两个敢露面的东西，现在她决定亲自巡视整片沙滩，看看是否还有其他人上岸。

Rei keeps her two tokens on her person at all times, unwilling to leave them behind, as they are precious to her. The first is a pale white cross, like bone but not, on a black string. It calls to her heart, to avenge- but there is no one left alive to avenge nor to wreak vengeance upon, and if something were to strike her dead, no one would avenge Rei. Even if there were, no one would care.  
绫波始终将她的两枚信物随身携带，不愿遗留，因为它们对她来说极为珍贵。第一枚是一个苍白的白色十字架，似骨非骨，系在黑色细绳上。它唤起了她的复仇之心——但已无人可复仇，也无人可施以报复，若有什么能将她击倒，也不会有人为绫波复仇。即便有人，也无人会在意。

The second is a black plastic rectangle, its bulk circumnavigated multiple times by two thin strands of wire; an SDAT player. Shinji's. Though Rei takes this to mean he has survived Third Impact and is now adrift in the sea of souls, she is unsure of this: the last she saw of Unit-01 was its prone form on the floor of the Geofront, being torn into by the Mass-Produced Evangelions.  
第二枚是一个黑色塑料矩形，其周围被两根细线缠绕多次；这是一个 SDAT 播放器，是真嗣的。尽管绫波认为这意味着他已从第三次冲击中幸存，并漂流在灵魂之海中，但她对此并不确定：她最后一次见到初号机时，它正躺在地底空间的地上，被量产型使徒撕裂。

The sight of something red against the white sands jerks Rei out of her reminisces. At first she thinks it's a wave, but it's too stationary; no sea life can survive in a sea not meant for the living, and so there is only one thing that it can be. A vanishing trail of footprints forms against the sands as Rei runs with all her might at the mysterious object, hoping it is not an illusion of her own despair that will vanish as soon as she arrives.  
白色沙滩上那一抹红色突然打断了丽回忆的思绪。起初她以为是海浪，但它太过静止；这片不属于活物的海域中不可能有生物存活，因此它只可能是唯一的东西。丽全力奔跑，脚印在沙滩上形成一条逐渐消失的轨迹，她心中暗自祈祷，希望这神秘物体不是自己绝望中产生的幻觉，不会在她抵达时消失无踪。

The object does not vanish, and as Rei looks down upon the red plugsuit and the Second Child, she feels something in her chest swell at the revelation that someone else has made it back from Third Impact. She kneels by the girl's side and takes one limp hand in both of hers to feel for a pulse. It's there; the barely visible rise and fall of Asuka's chest tell Rei that she is, indeed, alive. Yet though her eyes are open and staring at the sky, she does not react.  
那物体并未消失，当丽俯视着红色插入栓服和第二适格者时，她心中涌起一股暖流，得知还有人从第三次冲击中生还。她跪在女孩身边，双手握住她无力的手，探寻脉搏。确实存在；明日香胸口微弱的起伏告诉丽，她确实还活着。然而，尽管她的眼睛睁开着凝视天空，却毫无反应。

"Pilot Sohryu?" Rei asks, gently lowering Asuka's hand and grasping her by the shoulders. "Pilot Sohryu? Are you awake?" Something nudges her thigh, and Rei looks down hopefully, only to notice a small cream-colored teacup rolling away with the tide. She grabs at it, raises it out of the water, and eyes it critically. Yes, she recognizes this object as well; it used to be hers. There's a chip and a large crack, fixed with hot glue and tape, and Rei gasps as the memory of that object floods her mind.  
“Sohryu 驾驶员？”丽轻声问道，轻轻放下明日香的手，扶住她的肩膀。“Sohryu 驾驶员？你醒着吗？”有什么东西轻触她的大腿，丽满怀希望地低头看去，却只见到一只小巧的奶油色茶杯随着潮水滚开。她伸手抓住它，从水中举起，仔细打量。是的，她也认得这个物品；它曾经是她的。杯子上有一个缺口和一道大裂痕，用热熔胶和胶带修补过，丽倒吸一口气，记忆如潮水般涌入脑海。

_I don't need your pity, First! I hate you! I hate everyone, I hate myself, I hate that idiot Shinji, but most of all I hate_ you!  
我不需要你的怜悯，第一！我恨你！我恨所有人，我恨我自己，我恨那个白痴真嗣，但最恨的就是你！

_A hand brushes against hers, harsh and unyielding, knocking the teacup from her hand. Hot liquid spills against the floor as the cup shatters into two pieces. The redhead whirls, the faintest of sobs escaping her throat, and slams the door to Rei's apartment behind her.  
一只手猛地拂过她的手，粗暴而坚定，将茶杯从她手中击落。滚烫的液体洒在地板上，茶杯碎成两半。红发少女转身，喉咙里逸出一丝微弱的呜咽，砰地一声关上了绫波的公寓门。_

_Rei watches her go with emotionless eyes, knows she should probably go after her, but she cannot find anything within her to say that would make the situation better. Instead she kneels, gathering the broken pieces in her hand._ This can be repaired, _she thinks._  
丽用无情的眼神目送她离去，知道或许应该追上去，但她内心找不到任何能改善局势的话语。于是她跪下，将破碎的碎片握在手中。她想，这可以修复。

"Pilot Sohryu..." Rei whispers, feeling her eyes sting. She looks down again. The teacup has found its way to a niche in the sand a small distance away from Asuka's head, and Rei notices she has Asuka's hand clasped between hers. It's cold. "A-Asuka, wake up," she pleads.  
“惣流驾驶员……”丽低声呢喃，感到眼睛刺痛。她再次低头。茶杯已经滚到了离明日香头部不远处的沙坑里，丽注意到自己正紧紧握着明日香的手。冰冷无比。“明日香，醒醒。”她恳求道。

Nothing. 毫无反应。

"I'm sorry, Asuka." “对不起，明日香。”

Nothing. 没什么。

---

The gates of the First Municipal Junior High School come into view, but Asuka finds herself keeping pace with Rei as they grow closer and closer. In what seems like no time at all, they arrive at the front gate. Rei takes a few steps away, turns, and bows to Asuka. "Thank you, Pilo- Asuka," she says. "I can find my way from here."  
第一市立中学的大门映入眼帘，但明日香发现自己正与丽并肩而行，距离越来越近。仿佛转眼间，她们就到了校门口。丽走了几步，转身向明日香鞠了一躬。“谢谢你，Pilo——明日香，”她说，“我可以从这里找到路。”

"What are you, stupid? I'm going with you!" Rei tilts her head in confusion, and Asuka elaborates: "It might be dangerous, you idiot! A-and this doesn't mean we're friends or anything, alright? I just don't want Misato to chew me out for letting you get hurt!" Her outburst fades away, and Asuka bites her lip, wondering why her face suddenly feels heated. She's probably sick. Definitely getting sick. She'll give Shinji hell over this once she gets home.  
"“你是不是傻？我要跟你一起去！” 丽困惑地歪着头，明日香进一步解释道：“可能很危险，你这个白痴！而且这不代表我们是朋友什么的，好吗？我只是不想让美里因为我让你受伤而骂我！” 她的爆发渐渐消退，明日香咬着嘴唇，不明白为什么她的脸突然感觉发热。她可能生病了。绝对是生病了。等她回家后，她一定要为此狠狠教训真嗣一顿。”

Rei doesn't protest, and once again she walks beside Asuka as they begin the journey to the train station. For several blocks, only the symphony of the rain accompanies the tapping of their shoes on concrete. Then, Rei speaks. "Do you find any of this familiar, Asuka?"  
丽没有反对，又一次，她走在明日香身边，开始了前往火车站的旅程。几条街区里，只有雨的交响乐伴随着她们的鞋子敲击混凝土的声音。然后，丽开口了。“你觉得这些熟悉吗，明日香？”

Asuka scoffs. "Why would I? This is the first time it's rained since I've gotten here, silly!"  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“我怎么会觉得熟悉？这是我来到这里后第一次下雨，傻瓜！”

"I see." Another block later, she stops them both. "Asuka, your hand is shaking."  
"我明白了。" 过了一会儿，她让他们俩都停了下来。"明日香，你的手在抖。"

The redhead looks at Rei, surprised, and true to the albino's observation, her hand has begin to quiver. "I..." Asuka begins, stunned, and wills her hand to stop moving. Anger surges in her as her hand disobeys her, unceasing in its trembling, and she moves to grab it when there is a cool, light touch of another's skin on hers. Asuka stares at the pale hand resting atop hers, helping her hold the umbrella steady, and she swears the First Child is smiling. "Let's go," Asuka mutters, and continues walking.  
红发女孩惊讶地看着绫波，正如白发女孩所观察到的那样，她的手开始颤抖。"我..." 明日香开始说道，震惊之余，她试图控制自己的手停止颤动。愤怒在她心中涌起，因为她的手不听使唤，颤抖不止，她正要伸手去抓时，却感觉到另一只皮肤凉爽、轻盈的手触碰到了她的手。明日香盯着那只苍白的手放在她的手上，帮她稳住雨伞，她发誓第一适格者是在微笑。"我们走吧，"明日香低声说道，继续前行。

Rei doesn't let go until they get to the train station.  
直到他们到达火车站，绫波才松开手。

"It's tomorrow, isn't it. The day of the battle." Asuka shivers in her night clothes and turns on her cot to face her roommate. "We've done all we can. You'd better not mess up, you hear me, Ayanami?"  
"就是明天了，对吧。决战的日子。" 明日香穿着睡衣，在床上颤抖着转身面对室友。"我们已经尽了全力。你可别搞砸了，听到没有，绫波？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"If only the stupid Third Child hadn't gotten himself killed facing the Fifth Angel... this could be different."  
"要不是那个笨蛋第三适格者在面对第五使徒时丧命……情况可能会有所不同。"

"Ikari was not stupid. He held the heat shield in place longer than I could have hoped to do so."  
"碇真嗣并不愚蠢。他比我能希望的更久地固定住了热盾。"

"Yeah, and now look! We're short one pilot, Evangelion Unit-01 is a huge heap of melted metal, and if we screw up tomorrow that's it!" Asuka sighs and rolls again, facing the wall. "I'm going to sleep, Ayanami. Don't wake me up unless that damn Angel's right at our front door, you hear me?"  
"是啊，现在看看！我们少了一个驾驶员，初号机成了一堆熔化的金属，如果明天我们搞砸了，那就完了！" 明日香叹了口气，再次翻身，面向墙壁。"我要睡觉了，绫波。除非那个该死的天使就在我们门口，否则别叫醒我，听到了吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Good." Asuka reaches out with a hand and flicks off the lights; within minutes her breaths begin to slow, and sleep takes her. Rei remains awake, staring at the ceiling, the images of her most recent battle still burned into her mind.  
“好。” 明日香伸出手，啪的一声关掉了灯；几分钟后，她的呼吸开始放缓，沉入了梦乡。绫波仍醒着，凝视着天花板，最近战斗的画面依旧烙印在她的脑海中。

Unit-00, sighting down the barrel of the positron rifle. The Angel, undamaged despite Rei firing with a perfect targeting solution. Unit-01, burning in the light of the Angel's fury, its heels dug in and its pilot shouting his defiance even as he and his Unit began to crumble.  
零号机，透过阳电子步枪的瞄准镜。使徒，尽管绫波精确瞄准射击却毫发无损。初号机，在使徒的怒火中燃烧，它的后跟深陷地面，驾驶员即便与机体一同崩解，仍高声呐喊着他的反抗。

Two seconds too long. 迟了两秒。

The Angel had perished, but at too high a cost. She had been taught from her creation that attachment to anything other than the scenario was not to be tolerated, and yet Ikari had managed to connect with her in a way no one else had before. Perhaps it was because he looked like his father. Perhaps it was because he actually cared. Now that was gone, and Rei was left with a blank slate. "_Ikari_," she sighs, not sure if she is remembering a lost friend or damning the father that sent his son to die.  
天使已经消逝，但代价过于高昂。自她被创造之初，便被告知不可对任何事物产生依恋，然而碇却以一种前所未有的方式与她建立了联系。或许是因为他长得像他的父亲，又或许是因为他真的在乎。如今这一切都已逝去，绫波只剩下一片空白。“碇，”她叹息道，不确定自己是在怀念一位失去的朋友，还是在诅咒那个让儿子赴死的父亲。

"_Mama_," comes the whispered reply. Rei sits up, startled, just in time to see one of Asuka's legs kick its way out from under the blankets. "_Mama_..." The sheets by Asuka's neck bunch and wrinkle as her shoulder shift up, her hands finding the sleeves of her nightshirt and clenching them tightly.  
“妈妈，”传来低语的回应。绫波坐起身，惊愕地看到明日香的一条腿从被子下踢了出来。“妈妈……”明日香脖子旁的床单随着肩膀的移动而皱起，她的手找到了睡衣的袖子，紧紧地握住。

Commander Ikari had briefed her extensively on how to interact with the Second Child, and yet in the wake of the battle against the Fifth Angel, Rei is unsure if the Commander's orders have her best interests at heart. At this moment, they certainly do not hold any regard for Asuka's needs, and whether the head of NERV will acknowledge it or not, Rei needs Asuka at her best for the coming battle.  
碇司令曾详细地向她讲解如何与第二适格者相处，然而在对抗第五使徒的战斗之后，绫波不确定司令的命令是否真的为她着想。此刻，这些命令显然没有考虑到明日香的需求，无论 NERV 的负责人是否承认，绫波需要明日香在即将到来的战斗中保持最佳状态。

Blankets and carpet rustle as Rei pushes her cot over to Asuka's and climbs back under the sheets. Slowly, almost as if she is being given something immensely fragile and delicate to hold, Rei encircles her arms around Asuka's and pulls her closer. The other girl curls around her, drawing her in, and over the shaking of the cot Rei hears her say, "_Don't leave me_."  
毯子和地毯沙沙作响，丽将她的床推到明日香旁边，重新钻回被窝。她缓缓地，仿佛接过一件极其脆弱精致的物品，用双臂环抱住明日香，将她拉近。另一个女孩蜷缩在她怀里，紧紧依偎，在床铺的摇晃中，丽听到她说：“别离开我。”

Rei leans forward, bringing her mouth next to Asuka's ear, and rests her head against Asuka's shoulder. "I will not."  
丽向前倾身，将嘴贴近明日香的耳边，头靠在明日香的肩上。“我不会的。”

The walk from the train station to Rei's apartment is a short one, only five minutes and a shoddy elevator ride up. Asuka spends most of that ride clinging to the rusted railings in the elevator, praying to a nonexistent god that it won't fail and send her plummeting to her death. Rei, by contrast, is a motionless statue in the center of the lift, her eyes focused on a small nick on the metal doors.  
从火车站到丽公寓的路程很短，只需五分钟和一次摇摇欲坠的电梯之旅。明日香大部分时间都紧抓着电梯里生锈的栏杆，向不存在的神明祈祷电梯不会失灵，让她坠落而亡。相比之下，丽在电梯中央一动不动，宛如一尊雕像，目光聚焦在金属门上的一个小缺口上。

The elevator shudders to a stop several floors later, and Asuka leaps out, swearing never to do that again, while Rei brushes past her silently and moves to her door. She pushes it open, deposits her bag in the entry hall, and turns to face Asuka. "Thank you for keeping me company," she says, bowing again.  
电梯在几层楼后颤抖着停了下来，明日香跳出来，发誓再也不这么做了，而绫波则默默地从她身边走过，走向自己的房门。她推开门，将包放在门厅，然后转身面对明日香。“谢谢你陪我，”她说着，再次鞠躬。

"I-it wasn't a big dea-" Asuka begins, then falls silent as Rei closes the distance between them with two short steps and presses their lips together. Her eyes go wide; her schoolbag and umbrella hit the floor, and she swears her heart just skipped a beat because _Rei Ayanami is kissing her_ and she doesn't know how to react.  
“我——这不是什么大事——”明日香刚开口，就沉默了，因为绫波用两步缩短了他们之间的距离，并亲吻了她的嘴唇。她的眼睛瞪得大大的；书包和雨伞掉在地上，她发誓自己的心跳都停了一拍，因为绫波丽在吻她，而她不知道该如何反应。

They part some brief seconds later, Rei retreating back into her doorway and Asuka seemingly staring off into space, stunned. She runs her fingers over her lips as the door to Rei's apartment begins to close, and it's not disgust or shock that wells up in her at that moment, but a sense of familiarity that propels her into motion. She manages to get her foot in the door before Rei closes it, and those crimson eyes hold her in regard as she stammers to get the words out. "I- Rei, what... that-"  
几秒钟后，他们分开了，绫波退回到自己的门口，而明日香似乎呆呆地望着远方，震惊不已。她用手指抚摸着自己的嘴唇，当绫波的公寓门开始关闭时，涌上心头的不是厌恶或震惊，而是一种熟悉感，促使她行动起来。她设法在绫波关门之前把脚伸进门缝，那双深红色的眼睛注视着她，她结结巴巴地试图说出话来。“我——绫波，什么……那——”

"I am sorry if I was too forward," says Rei, her eyes shadowed by her bangs, which have dried and clumped together. "I apologize-" And this time it's Asuka's turn to cut her off, to grasp Rei gently but firmly by the chin and bring their mouths together. Asuka's tongue traces its way around Rei's soft lips, drawing a gasp from the albino. The pair stagger into the hall, where Asuka presses Rei up against the wall, their tongues meeting, and all Asuka can think of is how this is so right, so familiar.  
"如果我太冒失了，我很抱歉，"丽说，她的眼睛被刘海遮住，刘海已经干了，纠结在一起。"我道歉——"这次轮到明日香打断她，轻轻但坚定地抓住丽的下巴，将她们的嘴唇贴在一起。明日香的舌头在丽柔软的唇边游走，让白发少女倒吸一口气。两人踉跄着走进走廊，明日香将丽按在墙上，她们的舌头相遇，明日香满脑子都是这一切多么正确，多么熟悉。

A need for air makes them separate, breathing heavily, and Rei is smiling and Asuka feels her heart stutter again. "Do you think you would like to spend the night here, Asuka?" Rei asks. "It is late and it does not look like the rain will stop soon."  
需要呼吸的空气使她们分开，喘着粗气，丽在微笑，明日香感到自己的心跳再次停滞。"你愿意今晚留在这里吗，明日香？"丽问道。"已经很晚了，看起来雨也不会很快停。"

"I... sure. Let me call Misato and get my stuff."  
"我...当然。让我给美里打电话，拿我的东西。"

"I will prepare some hot tea, then," says Rei, retreating into the apartment. Asuka stares at her receding back, and only when it has vanished from sight does she walk back to the entrance and collect her things. Her cell phone and Shinji's ID card have spilled from her bag; she picks up the first and stows away the second.  
"我去准备些热茶，"丽说着，退回到公寓里。明日香盯着她逐渐消失的背影，直到看不见了，才走回门口收拾自己的东西。她的手机和真嗣的身份证从包里掉了出来；她捡起手机，把身份证收好。

The call goes straight to voice mail, so Asuka doesn't resist the chance to leave a scathing message for Shinji about how it was his fault that she found the First Child wandering around Tokyo-3, soaked to the bone, that she had taken Rei home and would be staying there for the night, and how he was so very dead the next time she saw him. She hangs up with a vindictive sort of pleasure, only to find Rei standing behind her with an amused expression on her face.  
电话直接转到了语音信箱，于是明日香毫不犹豫地给真嗣留下了一条尖刻的留言，告诉他都是他的错，她才会在东京-3 发现第一适格者浑身湿透地游荡，她把丽带回了家，并且今晚将留在这里，还警告他下次见面时他死定了。她挂断电话时带着一种报复的快感，却发现丽站在她身后，脸上带着一丝戏谑的微笑。

"The water is boiling," Rei remarks. "Your message for Ikari was very... interesting. I did not realize I had gotten sick from our adventure."  
"水开了，"丽说道。"你对碇的留言很有趣。我没想到我们的冒险让我生病了。"

"S-shut up! It's to make him feel bad, alright?"  
"闭嘴！这是为了让他感觉不好，明白吗？"

"You should be nicer to him. After all, he is only trying to help."  
"你应该对他好一点。毕竟，他只是想帮忙。"

"Yeah, yeah, I'll consider it." Asuka places her belongings next to Rei's and shuts the door behind her, a faint smile dancing across her lips. "So, how much time do we have until the water's boiled?"  
"是啊，是啊，我会考虑的。" 明日香把她的东西放在丽旁边，关上门，嘴角掠过一丝淡淡的微笑。"那么，水烧开还要多久？"

"Enough," Rei replies, stepping closer to Asuka. The German all but envelops Rei in her arms, their lips meet, and there is nothing else to be said.  
"够了，" 丽回答道，向明日香走近一步。德国少女几乎将丽拥入怀中，她们的唇相触，无需多言。

[The-Mrning-Star](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3171691/The-Mrning-Star): Ugh right in the feels so you feel you could expand on this a bit.  Kind of choppy in the transition from time to time had to go back once or twice but a enjoyable read thank you for the update
唉，就在这种感觉中，所以你觉得你可以再扩展一下。过渡有点不流畅，时不时要回头看一两次，但读起来很愉快，谢谢你的更新

[The Pyromancer](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4191283/The-Pyromancer): Very good story, I'm always glad to see another Asuka/Rei fic.I would suggest that for transitions between point of views or events in time that you add obvious dividers. allows the option of inserting a horizontal line break and I've found that works very well and would help the reader keep track of things. This is Evangelion and a little mind screw is necessary but if the reader can't follow it most of the way, then it's not going to matter.Keep up the good work.
非常好的故事，我总是很高兴看到另一部明日香/蕾的小说。我建议在观点或时间事件之间的过渡处添加明显的分隔线。 可以选择插入水平分隔线，我发现效果很好，可以帮助读者跟踪事物。这是《新世纪福音战士》，有点头脑风暴是必要的，但如果读者在大部分时间里都无法跟上，那就无所谓了。
