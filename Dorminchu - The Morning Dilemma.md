Shinji and Asuka have to go to school. Misato is asleep. Something has to give. (A light-hearted character study.)  
真嗣和明日香必须去上学。美里还在睡觉。总得有个解决办法。（一部轻松的人物研究作品。）

_a/n: I recently finished NGE & The End of Evangelion. Given how there was a demand for an original concept in my first fic, **Decay**, I couldn't resist the idea.  
作者注：我最近刚看完《新世纪福音战士》与《新世纪福音战士剧场版：THE END OF EVANGELION》。鉴于我的第一篇小说《Decay》中有读者希望看到原创概念，我便忍不住动笔了。_

Shinji woke up first to the sound of the door opening. Two voices conversed, muted through the thin walls. He could not decipher the words, only the tenor of the speakers. A man and a woman. Misato and Kaji, perhaps. He frowned in the darkness, ears peeled for further information. Muffled laughter. A second later the door closed and there was a dull flump, footsteps puttering around the kitchen area.  
真嗣最先醒来，听到门打开的声音。两个声音在薄薄的墙壁间低声交谈。他无法分辨话语，只能听出说话者的音调。一男一女。或许是美里和加持。他在黑暗中皱眉，竖起耳朵等待更多信息。隐约的笑声。片刻后门关上了，接着是沉闷的扑通声，脚步声在厨房区域徘徊。

_That's Misato,_ he thought groggily_._ His earbuds were quickly becoming a painful distraction with the way he was lying down, one digging into the soft, thin flesh of his left ear, so he took them out. Eventually the sounds from the kitchen ceased. Shinji blinked, disentangling himself from the electronic cords in order to sit up. The little clock on his Walkman read 5:32. He had half an hour before he was supposed to be up, but Shinji knew he would not be able to sleep. He'd gotten seven hours of rest, then. It had been an early night yesterday, but at least he'd gotten his homework done. _Besides,_ Shinji thought, _that's what coffee is for._  
那是美里，他迷迷糊糊地想。耳塞因躺着的姿势而迅速成为痛苦的干扰，其中一个压进了他左耳柔软纤薄的肉里，于是他取出了耳塞。最终厨房的声响停止了。真嗣眨了眨眼，解开身上的电子线缆坐了起来。随身听上的小闹钟显示 5:32。他本应在半小时后起床，但真嗣知道他无法再入睡。他已经休息了七个小时。昨晚睡得早，至少作业完成了。此外，真嗣想，咖啡就是为此而存在的。

He sighed. _Time to get moving._  
他叹了口气。该行动了。

Asuka wasn't up yet as he shuffled to the bathroom and groped for the light. Still groggy as he did his business, Shinji checked his face in the mirror once he was finished washing his hands, picking at his eyelids. Pressed his face into his cupped palms, filled with water, flinching at the coldness of it. Maybe he could take a shower; that usually woke him up. Before he could give this idea more consideration, there was an aggressive rapping at the door.  
明日香还没起床，他拖着脚步走向浴室，摸索着开灯。解决生理需求时依旧昏昏沉沉，洗完手后，真嗣对着镜子检查自己的脸，拨弄着眼皮。他将脸埋进捧着的水中，因冰冷而微微一颤。或许可以冲个澡；那通常能让他清醒过来。还没等他进一步考虑这个想法，门外就传来了急促的敲门声。

"I'm in here," he said, faintly irritated. He had an inkling of who was waiting on the other side of the bathroom door, and he was not at all in the mood to deal with it this early in the morning. It wasn't like he had much of a choice, though. He walked over and opened the door, steeling himself.  
“我在里面，”他有些不悦地说。他隐约猜到门外等着的是谁，而且他完全没有心情一大早就应付这些。不过，他也没什么选择。他走过去打开门，做好了心理准备。

"Oi, Ikari," said Asuka shortly, as way of a morning greeting.  
“喂，碇，”明日香简短地说道，算是早上的问候。

"You're up already? I didn't want to bother you," Shinji said dryly.  
"你已经起来了？我不想打扰你。" 真嗣干巴巴地说道。

Asuka grunted. "_You_ didn't wake me up." She glanced in the direction of the kitchen area, then huffed. "Whatever. Are you finished in here or what?"  
明日香咕哝了一声。"你没吵醒我。" 她朝厨房方向瞥了一眼，然后哼了一声。"随便了。你在这儿弄完了没有？"

Shinji shrugged. "I guess."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。"大概吧。"

"Then let me in already, I have to pee."  
"那就让我进去吧，我得去洗手间。"

Shinji left her to it. On the way back to his room he noticed Misato sprawled out on the floor in front of the table, out cold. She'd left the lights on. He stood there a moment, staring bleary-eyed at the adult of the house, unsure what it was that compelled him to stay put. He was brought back to reality when Asuka bumped his shoulder none-too lightly with hers.  
真嗣让她自己处理。在回房间的路上，他注意到美里瘫倒在桌子前的地板上，不省人事。她忘了关灯。他站在那里片刻，睡眼惺忪地盯着家里的成年人，不确定是什么让他停下脚步。直到明日香不轻不重地用肩膀撞了他一下，他才回过神来。

"So what are we gonna do about her?" she asked curtly.  
"那我们拿她怎么办？" 她简短地问道。

"Misato? She's okay. Just leave her alone."  
“美里？她没事。别管她了。”

Asuka made a subtle sound of disgust before she stepped carefully over Misato's crumpled body. Shinji retreated to his room to get dressed for the day. Ten minutes later he came back out. Misato was still motionless, snoring quietly. Asuka was rooting through the pantry with a careful eye and deft hands, taking down boxes here and there. Misato's empty beer cans were pushed haphazardly to the side.  
明日香发出一声轻微的厌恶声，然后小心翼翼地跨过美里蜷缩的身体。真嗣回到房间换衣服。十分钟后，他再次出来。美里依旧一动不动，轻声打鼾。明日香正仔细地翻找着食品储藏室，灵巧地取下这里那里的盒子。美里喝空的啤酒罐被随意地推到一边。

Shinji joined her, careful not to get too close, avoiding eye contact. He found a glass on the counter-top, unsure if it was clean or not, too tired to care, and filled it with tap water. Turning on the coffee maker, he poured the contents of the glass into the reservoir and a packet of grounds into the second aperture, pressing the red switch at the base. _That usually takes a few minutes. I should make some breakfast._  
真嗣加入她，小心地保持距离，避免眼神接触。他在台面上找到一个玻璃杯，不确定是否干净，但太累了，不在乎这些，于是装满了自来水。他打开咖啡机，将杯子里的水倒入储水槽，又往第二个孔里倒了一包咖啡粉，按下底部的红色开关。这通常需要几分钟。我应该做点早餐。

"So what's the deal with the penguin?" Asuka asked, breaking the stilted silence with little preamble. "I didn't want to ask _her_." She shot a funny look at Misato as she said this.  
"那企鹅是怎么回事？" 明日香问道，打破了僵硬的沉默，没有太多铺垫。"我不想问她。" 她说这话时，向美里投去了一个奇怪的眼神。

"Pen-Pen?" Shinji muttered, taken aback by Asuka's uncharacteristic lack of vitriol.  
"Pen-Pen？" 真嗣喃喃自语，对明日香出乎意料的没有恶言相向感到惊讶。

"Yeah," said Asuka tersely. "It smells like shit."  
"是啊，" 明日香简短地说。"闻起来像屎一样。"

"Well, it's a penguin," said Shinji measuredly, watching his coffee bubble up in the glass container and trying not to think about how tired he was. "Penguins don't use the toilet."  
"嗯，这是一只企鹅，" 真嗣有条不紊地说道，看着咖啡在玻璃容器中冒泡，尽量不去想自己有多疲惫。"企鹅不用上厕所。"

"Okay, smartass. I get that," Asuka said, eyes a bit sharper and nostrils flaring, familiarly aggressive. "But how come the stupid penguin gets a locked room and we don't? That's what I want to know."  
"好吧，聪明鬼。我明白了，" 明日香说道，眼神更加锐利，鼻孔微微张开，一如既往地好斗。"但为什么那只愚蠢的企鹅能有一个上锁的房间，而我们没有？这就是我想知道的。"

"Dunno." Shinji looked away, making very little effort to hide his disinterest. "Hey, do you like cereal or oatmeal?"  
"不知道。" 真嗣移开视线，几乎毫不掩饰自己的不感兴趣。"嘿，你喜欢麦片还是燕麦粥？"

Asuka stared blankly at him. "Uh. What?"  
明日香茫然地盯着他。“呃。什么？”

"Because I think we're out of both. I hope you don't mind toast."  
“因为我觉得我们两种都没了。希望你不介意吃吐司。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "God, do you know if she keeps anything in the refrigerator besides beer?"  
明日香翻了个白眼。“天啊，你知道她冰箱里除了啤酒还有什么吗？”

"No," said Shinji. "You could check, I guess."  
"不，" 真嗣说。"你可以检查一下，我想。"

Asuka muttered something under her breath that sounded a lot like _prick,_ but the coffee-maker beeped and Shinji didn't hear it clearly. He made his cup in silence while Asuka opened the cooler.  
明日香低声咕哝了一句，听起来很像“混蛋”，但咖啡机这时响了起来，真嗣没听清楚。他默默地泡着自己的咖啡，而明日香则打开了冰箱。

"Damn it, Ikari," she said. "There's stuff in here, you just have to move her cans." She came out with a packaged microwaveable meal. "See?"  
"该死，碇，" 她说。"这里面有东西，你只需要挪开她的罐头。" 她拿出了一包微波炉加热餐。"看吧？"

"I wouldn't do that," Shinji said.  
"我不会那么做的，" 真嗣说。

"Why? It's right here." "为什么？它就在这儿。"

"It might be for our dinner."  
"可能是给我们晚餐准备的。"

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Then I'll drag your ass to the store with me and we'll get some more groceries, it's not that complicated."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“那我就拽你一起去商店，我们再买点杂货，没那么复杂。”

"Fine," Shinji relented, feeling bitter and in no mood to argue, "just hurry it up, will you? We have twenty minutes."  
“好吧，”真嗣让步了，心情苦涩且无意争论，“快点行吗？我们只有二十分钟。”

Asuka _hmph_ed, but didn't protest. She put the package in the microwave and punched in the time with a few jarring beeps that made them both recoil. While it was cooking, she retreated to her room. Shinji regarded the boxes she'd left on the counter. Three were empty, but in the fourth there was a little cereal left. He'd take it if Asuka wouldn't.  
明日香哼了一声，但没有抗议。她把包裹放进微波炉，按下时间，几声刺耳的哔哔声让他们都退缩了一下。加热期间，她回到自己的房间。真嗣看着她留在台面上的几个盒子。三个是空的，但第四个里还剩一点麦片。如果明日香不要，他就打算吃掉。

The microwave beeped loudly, disrupting his thoughts. Misato grunted. Heart hammering wildly, Shinji slammed his hand on the _CANCEL_ button so fast that he was momentarily scared he had broken his fingers. He bit back a curse, staring at Misato in a panic. She rolled over and huffed, but did not address him or the disturbance. Soon enough she was snoring again. Shinji released the breath he'd been holding.  
微波炉大声哔哔作响，打断了他的思绪。美里咕哝了一声。心狂跳不已，真嗣猛地一掌拍在取消按钮上，快得让他一时担心自己会弄断手指。他咬紧牙关，忍住咒骂，惊慌地盯着美里。她翻了个身，哼了一声，但没有理会他或这场骚动。很快，她又打起了呼噜。真嗣这才松了口气。

It was at this point that Asuka came back, dressed and eyeing him suspiciously.  
就在这时，明日香回来了，穿戴整齐，用怀疑的眼神打量着他。

"I leave for two minutes and you get into trouble," she sighed, joining him again. "God, Ikari, you're really skittish."  
“我离开两分钟你就惹麻烦，”她叹了口气，再次走到他身边。“天啊，真嗣，你真是胆小。”

Shinji ignored her comment. "Your food is ready, I think."  
真嗣没有理会她的评论。“我想你的食物已经好了。”

Asuka took her cue from him and did not acknowledge this. She opened the microwave and cursed.  
明日香从他那里得到暗示，没有对此做出回应。她打开微波炉，咒骂了一声。

"What?" said Shinji. “什么？”真嗣问道。

"The dumb plastic's still on. Can I even eat this?" She tried peeling away the melted plastic to little effect. "_Scheisse_. Where does Katsuragi keep her forks, Ikari?"  
“这层傻塑料还裹着呢。我真能吃吗？”她试图剥开那层已经融化的塑料，但效果甚微。“该死。葛城小姐的叉子放哪儿了，碇？”

"Take this one," said Shinji, handing her a fork from the counter that was probably dirty anyway. Asuka took it from him and turned the meal over, smirking at her own ingenuity. "See, _this_ side is good."  
“用这个吧，”真嗣说着，从柜台上递给她一把叉子，反正多半也是脏的。明日香从他手中接过叉子，翻转了餐盘，对自己的机智微微一笑。“看，这边是好的。”

She fell upon the good part of her meal with a vicious efficiency. Shinji ate his dry cereal with significantly less enthusiasm.  
她以一种凶猛的效率扑向餐盘完好的一侧。真嗣则相对无精打采地吃着他的干麦片。

"Ten minutes," he told her.  
"十分钟," 他告诉她。

"Yeah, yeah, I know. Hey, doesn't she take you to class or something?" Asuka indicated Misato with her fork.  
"是啊，是啊，我知道。嘿，她不是会带你去上课什么的吗？" 明日香用叉子指了指美里。

"Sometimes, yes." "有时候，是的。"

Asuka raised her eyebrows. "You should probably wake her up."  
明日香挑了挑眉。“你或许该叫醒她。”

"You wake her up," Shinji said. "I'll take the bus."  
“你叫醒她，”真嗣说。“我坐公交去。”

"What? You said she's the one that gives you a ride, Ikari. You do it."  
“什么？你说她才是载你的人，一尕。你来吧。”

"You're the one who brought it up," Shinji retorted, never once raising his voice, eyes on his partially empty bowl.  
"是你先提起的，" 真嗣反驳道，声音始终平静，目光停留在半空的碗里。

"Jeez, you're such a pissant," Asuka sighed. "Are you scared of everyone _except_ Ayanami?"  
"天啊，你真是个小气鬼，" 明日香叹了口气。"除了绫波，你是不是怕所有人？"

"No. I just don't feel like dealing with vomit in the toilet first thing in the morning," Shinji said. "Or vomit anywhere. I was having a very pleasant breakfast without your help."  
"不。我只是不想一大早就在厕所里处理呕吐物，" 真嗣说。"或者任何地方的呕吐物。没有你的帮忙，我正享受着非常愉快的早餐。"

"Asshole," Asuka snapped. "You're just saying that because she's asleep."  
"混蛋," 明日香厉声说道。"你这么说只是因为她睡着了。"

Shinji hummed in agreement while he took a long swig of coffee. Asuka bit her tongue, but said nothing.  
真嗣哼了一声表示同意，同时喝了一大口咖啡。明日香咬住舌头，但什么也没说。

"So do you take the subway by yourself?" he asked, bringing his bowl and cup to the counter.  
"那你是一个人坐地铁吗？" 他问道，把碗和杯子拿到柜台上。

Asuka wrinkled her nose and responded imperiously: "I can get around by myself, thank you very much." She dropped her container in the trash-bin and stood.  
明日香皱了皱鼻子，傲慢地回应道：“我自己能行，非常感谢。”她将容器丢进垃圾桶，站了起来。

"Fine," said Shinji wearily. "We'll go together."  
“好吧，”真嗣疲惫地说，“我们一起走。”

"What?" Asuka snapped, as though he had just insulted her. "If you think I'm just going to let you mooch off MY subway pass, you can—"  
“什么？”明日香厉声道，仿佛他刚刚侮辱了她。“如果你以为我会让你蹭我的地铁卡，那你可——”

Misato snuffled in her sleep. Asuka and Shinji froze, both bug-eyed and petrified. They looked at each other, thinking the same thing: _I really don't want to be here when Ms. Katsuragi wakes up._  
美里在睡梦中抽了抽鼻子。明日香和真嗣都僵住了，两人瞪大眼睛，吓得魂不附体。他们互相对视，心里想的是同一件事：我真不想在葛城小姐醒来时还在这里。

"Okay," Asuka relented under her breath. "Okay, Ikari, you win. JUST this once," she added haughtily. "And if you try and tell any of your stupid friends that I'm going easy on you, you'll regret it, understand?"  
“好吧，”明日香压低声音让步道，“好吧，碇，你赢了。就这一次，”她傲慢地补充道，“如果你敢告诉你的那些蠢朋友我对你手下留情，你会后悔的，明白吗？”

Shinji grinned weakly. "It's a deal."  
真嗣虚弱地笑了笑。“成交。”

### Comment
[Marcondes Mesquita](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7668456/Marcondes-Mesquita): This fanfic is so cute and funny. From a simple happening, you portrayed very well how Shinji deals with odd habits of Misato and the complicated mood of Asuka. This is great.  
这篇同人小说既可爱又有趣。从一个简单的情节出发，你很好地描绘了真嗣如何应对美里古怪的习惯和明日香复杂的情绪。非常棒。

[I'm the map](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7660640/I-m-the-map): The scene here is "mundane" enough - a morning routine. But Shinji and Asuka's interaction is what makes the fic come to life, drawing the reader in. Characterization was vivid and spot on. Love how Asuka complained that Pen-Pen stinks, and then you realize what she's truly bitter about is how well he's treated (compared to how she expects to be treated herself). Hence the insults. I never liked Asuka much, but you're now helping me see her in a more attentive, appreciative light. Thank you for that.  
这里的场景足够“平凡”——一个早晨的日常。但正是真嗣和明日香之间的互动让这篇同人文生动起来，吸引着读者。人物刻画生动且精准。喜欢明日香抱怨 Pen-Pen 臭烘烘的那段，随后你意识到她真正不满的是他受到的优待（与她预期自己会受到的待遇相比）。因此有了那些侮辱。我以前并不太喜欢明日香，但你现在正帮助我以更专注、欣赏的目光看待她。为此感谢你。

[GottaGoBuyCheese](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6474987/GottaGoBuyCheese): Aw, what a fun slice-of-like thing in the midst of all the psychological turmoil! I really liked it—short and sweet! And great job with the dialogue and stuff! It all felt really natural. But seriously, this was such a nice break from all the psychological angst that usually comes with NGE fics, so thanks!  
啊，在所有的心理纷扰中，这真是一个有趣的日常生活片段！我真的很喜欢——简短而甜蜜！对话等方面做得很好！一切都感觉非常自然。但说真的，这是对通常伴随《新世纪福音战士》同人文的心理煎熬的一个很好的调剂，所以谢谢！

miguelangel: nice little piece well written both were in character enjoyed it thanks  
写得真好，角色把握到位，两人都很贴合原作，读得很开心，谢谢
