Shortly after Third Impact, people returned from the LCL, and Tokyo-3's residents worked together to rebuild the city.  
第三次冲击后不久，人们从 LCL 中归来，东京-3 的居民齐心协力重建城市。

Shinji and Asuka remained close, even living with Misato once again, as soon as they were able to reclaim their apartment. She spent a lot of time apologizing to the two of them, and vowing to truly make amends for the events before impact. It would never be perfect, but it was the closest thing to family for the three of them. They spent a few years of relative peace together, before Shinji realized he saw Asuka as more than a roommate and a close friend.  
真嗣和明日香关系依旧亲密，一旦能够收回他们的公寓，便再次与美里同住。美里花了很多时间向他们两人道歉，并发誓要真正弥补冲击前的事件。虽然一切无法完美，但这对于他们三人来说，是最接近家庭的存在。在相对平静的几年后，真嗣意识到他对明日香的感情超越了室友和亲密朋友的范畴。

After tiptoeing around, Shinji finally found the words to open his heart and ask Asuka out. They talked for a long time, but she reciprocated. For the first time in their lives, they found true happiness in each other. Misato was relieved that they finally figured things out and let them move into an adjacent apartment.  
经过一番踌躇，真嗣终于找到表达心声的勇气，向明日香表白。他们长谈许久，而她亦有所回应。这是他们生命中第一次在彼此身上找到了真正的幸福。美里为他们终于明白彼此心意而感到欣慰，并让他们搬进了隔壁的公寓。

But real life came at them in the form of education. School had re-started quickly after reconstruction, and the two of them made things official right before graduation. Afterwards, Shinji intended to apply to university and get a degree.  
然而，现实生活的挑战随之而来——教育。重建后学校迅速复课，两人在毕业前正式确立了关系。之后，真嗣打算申请大学并获得学位。

Asuka decided to go back and pursue a different diploma than the one she received as a pre-teen. The only problem: the program she was in required her to be in Germany for the first year.  
明日香决定回去攻读一个与她少年时期所获文凭不同的学位。唯一的问题是：她所在的课程要求她第一年在德国学习。

The day she told him, the two of them were sitting on her bed. "...So, yeah. The biology program is only offered in Germany for first year. If I want to do it, I have to fly out-of-country."  
她告诉他那天，两人正坐在她的床上。“……所以，是的。生物学课程第一年只在德国开设。如果我想读，就必须出国。”

For the first time since she brought up the topic, Asuka looked up from her bed at Shinji's face; He looked sad. His eyes darted around a little before he spoke. "Are you serious? There's no other way for you to do this?"  
自从提起这个话题以来，明日香第一次从床上抬头看向真嗣的脸；他看起来很难过。他的眼神四处游移了一会儿才开口：“你是认真的吗？没有其他办法让你完成这个学业吗？”

She sighed. "You know how hard the government is pushing everyone towards programs that help with the reconstruction efforts, the loans and grants are ridiculous. Germany is offering to pay for everything, they want me back, and the offer is a solo one, no matter how hard I've tried. Misato can't hold both of us up forever."  
她叹了口气。“你知道政府正大力推动大家参与那些有助于重建工作的项目，贷款和奖学金多得惊人。德国愿意承担所有费用，他们希望我回去，而且这个机会是单独给我的，无论我怎么努力。美里也不能一直支持我们两个人。”

"But..." Shinji began. "But what about everything we've worked up to? We've always done stuff together, haven't we?"  
但是..." 真嗣开口道。"但是，我们之前一起努力的一切呢？我们不是一直都在一起做事吗？

"Yes, we have." Asuka decided to let him talk  
"是的，我们确实如此。" 明日香决定让他继续说。

"After Third Impact, we were on our own together. We survived until Misato got back."  
第三次冲击后，我们相依为命。直到美里回来，我们才得以生存。

"Yup. We were damn good at it too."  
没错。我们做得相当出色。

Shinji continued. "Yeah, and when things went back to normal, we were still a team." Asuka nodded. "And then… And then I realized how much I liked you. Do you know how long I kept that to myself?"  
真嗣继续说道：“是啊，当一切恢复正常后，我们还是一支团队。”明日香点头道：“然后……然后我意识到我有多喜欢你。你知道我独自保守这个秘密多久了吗？”

Asuka liked when he told this story, even if he had only told it a few times. "Two years."  
明日香喜欢听他讲这个故事，尽管他只讲过几次。“两年。”

"Two years. It just… it hurt to look at you and not be able to say how I felt."  
“两年。只是……看着你却不能表达我的感情，这让我心痛。”

"Well, thank God you finally did. And you did a damn good job too."  
“嗯，感谢上帝你终于说了出来。而且你做得非常棒。”

That made Shinji blush. "Ah, well, it was okay."  
这让真嗣脸红了。“啊，嗯，还可以吧。”

"Save it, Ikari. You took me to that one spot on the hill and gave me that speech. I'd never forget that. And I hope you wouldn't, either."  
“别说了，碇。你带我去了山上的那个地方，还对我说了那番话。我永远不会忘记。我希望你也不会。”

"Of course not," he said. "Especially not after the long talk we had."  
“当然不会，”他说。“尤其是在我们那次长谈之后。”

"Hey, we had a lot to talk about. Before the angels, after the angels, all that instrumentality crap," said Asuka. "There was something else too. What did I make you promise?"  
"嘿，我们有好多要聊的。天使出现前，天使出现后，还有那些工具性废话，"明日香说，"还有别的。我让你承诺了什么？"

Shinji's expression lightened a little as he recalled. "I promised that I'd never leave you, and that I'd always be by your side."  
真嗣的表情稍微缓和了一些，他回忆道：“我承诺过，永远不会离开你，会一直陪在你身边。”

"And…?" 然后…？

"And you promised the same."  
而你也承诺了同样的事。

"Right! Just because I'm not gonna physically be here, doesn't mean that I'm not by your side. We literally went through the end of the world together, Shinji. I think we can handle this like it's nothing!"  
对！即使我不能亲自在这里，也不代表我不在你身边。我们可是共同经历了世界末日，真嗣。我想，这点小事我们完全可以轻松应对！

The worry returned to his face "You're right. It's just gonna feel so empty without you here." Asuka looked in his eyes. She didn't see ill intent, but sadness. There was a hint of a tear in the corner of his eye. He was being a bit of an idiot, but it was coming from a place of honesty.  
忧虑再次爬上他的脸庞，“你说得对。没有你在这儿，感觉会空荡荡的。”明日香凝视着他的眼睛。她没有看到恶意，只有悲伤。他的眼角隐约闪着泪光。他虽然有些犯傻，但这份情感却是真挚的。

Asuka put a hand under Shinji's chin. "It's not like that stuff is gonna go away. You think I'd just pack my things, go to Germany, and leave you in the dark? Come on now!" He didn't say anything, but he looked off to the side.  
明日香将手放在真嗣的下巴下。“那些事情不会就这样消失的。你以为我会收拾行李，去德国，然后让你一无所知吗？拜托了！”他没有说话，只是把目光移向了一旁。

"Well, can we talk every day?" he asked, looking at her again.  
"嗯，我们能每天聊天吗？" 他再次看向她问道。

"Yes." “是。”

"Phone each other?" 互相打电话？

"Of course." "当然。"

"And... Oh! Maybe I could send you a recipe when you get homesick! I know the food that they serve people is brutal. Sometimes I see classmates bring food to class, and it's just the worst." He dabbed at his eye with his hand.  
还有...哦！或许当你想家时，我可以给你寄个食谱！我知道他们给人们提供的食物实在糟糕。有时我看到同学带食物来上课，那简直是糟透了。" 他用手轻拭了一下眼角。

Asuka smiled. "I like that idea."  
明日香微笑道：“我喜欢这个主意。”

---

The semester began okay enough at first. Shinji kept himself busy in his studies, seeing his friends, making meals for Misato, and even going for walks around the reconstructed Tokyo-3. Near the end, however, one thing in the back of his head became more prominent: He missed Asuka. He missed having her sleep next to him, or playfully chide him while he made breakfast, or any of the other small things that her presence brought to the apartment.  
学期伊始，一切还算顺利。真嗣忙于学业，与朋友相聚，为美里准备餐食，甚至在新建的第三新东京市四处散步。然而，随着时间推移，他脑海中有一件事愈发凸显：他想念明日香。他怀念她睡在身旁，或是他在做早餐时她俏皮地责备他，还有她在家中带来的那些点点滴滴。

After a few days of it being far too quiet, he knocked on Misato's door and asked if he could stay with her for the time being, which she graciously accepted.  
在连续几日异常寂静之后，他敲响了葛城美里的门，询问是否能暂时与她同住，她欣然同意了。

December arrived around soon after. While the holiday had become a little more popular in Japan, Asuka was always the one to drum up Christmas enthusiasm. Her lack of presence was known, but they still tried, decorating the apartment. They took some photos and sent them to her, which was met with enthusiasm.  
十二月很快到来了。尽管圣诞节在日本变得稍受欢迎，但总是明日香在鼓动大家对圣诞节的热情。虽然她不在，大家还是努力装饰了公寓。他们拍了些照片发给她，得到了她热烈的回应。

Still, Shinji wanted something more out of the holiday. To him, Christmas was less about presents and more about the time spent with family. It didn't stop him from splurging on gifts for the two ladies, but there was something distinctly missing: his girlfriend.  
尽管如此，真嗣对假期仍有所期待。对他而言，圣诞节的意义不在于礼物，而在于与家人共度的时光。他并未因此吝啬为两位女士购买礼物，但总感觉少了些什么——他的女朋友。

Soon enough, he hatched a plan to surprise Asuka with a great gift: himself. With help from Misato, he would fly to Germany and show up on Asuka's doorstep just in time for Christmas.  
不久，他酝酿了一个给明日香惊喜的大礼：他自己。在美里帮助下，他将飞往德国，在圣诞节之际准时出现在明日香的家门口。

Thus, three days before the festivity, Misato drove Shinji to the airport and helped him check in for his flight. Right when he got to the gate, he received a text.  
因此，在庆典前三天，美里驾车送真嗣前往机场，并协助他办理了登机手续。就在他抵达登机口时，收到了一条短信。

**Soryu, Asuka: Heyyy idiot it's super late here so I'm gonna sleep.  
惣流·明日香：嘿，笨蛋，这里已经很晚了，我要睡了。**

Shinji smiled at the way she texted.  
真嗣对她发短信的方式微笑了。

**Ikari, Shinji: Alright. Goodnight, Asuka. I'll talk to you soon. Love you.  
碇真嗣：好的。晚安，明日香。很快再聊。爱你。**

Asuka sent back a heart.  
明日香回了一个心形表情。

---

Asuka put her phone on her seat. She stowed away her carry-on, then got settled into her plane seat. "This is gonna be fun," she whispered, grinning to herself. Grabbing her phone, she unlocked it and navigated to Misato's contact.  
明日香将手机放在座位上，收好随身行李，然后安顿在飞机座位里。“这一定会很有趣，”她低声自语，嘴角勾起一抹微笑。拿起手机，解锁屏幕，她点开了与美里小姐的联系界面。

---

Shinji put his phone away and turned to Misato. She offered him a smile. "You're a real romantic, Shinji. Just promise me something."  
真嗣收起手机，转向美里。她向他露出了微笑。“真嗣，你真是个浪漫的人。只要答应我一件事。”

"Yeah?" "是吗？"

"Be safe, and don't do anything stupid."  
注意安全，别做傻事。

"I will, and, uh, I won't?"  
我会，呃，我不会？

She wrapped him in a hug, which he hesitantly reciprocated. Pulling away, she kissed the top of his head. "See you soon. I better get a call when you land!"  
她紧紧拥抱了他，他犹豫着回抱了她。松开后，她亲吻了他的头顶。“很快见。你落地后最好给我来个电话！”

Shinji blushed a little. "I'll remember!" He grabbed his suitcase and began to roll it to the terminal.  
真嗣脸上微微泛红，“我会记住的！”他抓起行李箱，开始向航站楼推去。

Misato watched him disappear out of sight. When he was gone, she turned to walk away, but was interrupted by the buzz of her phone.  
碇真嗣的身影消失在视线之外后，葛城美里正欲转身离去，却被手机的震动声打断了。

**Soryu, Asuka: Hey Misato I'm coming to surprise Shinji, please keep him chained down or something. Thanks  
惣流·明日香：嘿，美里，我要来给真嗣一个惊喜，请把他拴住或用什么方法固定住。谢谢。**

She put a palm to her forehead. "Oh god damn it!" she whispered. She started to turn back towards the terminal, but Shinji was too far gone. She called him a few times, but it went straight to voicemail. Misato cursed again. He was about to fly to Germany and she couldn't stop him. Defeated, she began to trudge back to the apartment.  
她将手掌贴在额头上，低声咒骂：“哦，该死！”她转身朝向航站楼，但真嗣已经走得太远。她呼唤了他几次，却直接转到了语音信箱。美里再次咒骂。他即将飞往德国，而她无法阻止。无奈之下，她开始拖着沉重的步伐返回公寓。

---

Shinji had never flown before. He had piloted an Eva, but being higher than the clouds was a little jarring to him. The drinks were in tiny cans and the food was Misato-tier. The seats hardly reclined. The in-flight entertainment was okay, at least. He put on some movies that Asuka showed him as he oscillated in and out of sleep.  
真嗣从未飞过。他驾驶过 Eva，但比云层还高对他来说还是有些震撼。饮料装在小小的罐子里，食物则是美里级别的。座椅几乎无法后仰。至少机上娱乐还算可以。他播放了明日香推荐的几部电影，在半梦半醒间摇摆不定。

Before he knew it, he was being told to put his seat upright and his tray table up. He opened the window to see his flight rapidly descending on Mumbai. The view was fascinating.  
不知不觉间，他被告知要将座椅调直，小桌板收起。他打开窗户，只见飞机正迅速降落于孟买上空。那景色令人着迷。

After a short wait, the captain thanked the passengers for flying, and he slowly made his way off of the plane.  
短暂等待后，机长感谢乘客们的搭乘，并缓缓走下飞机。

Since he had a carry-on, there was no need to wait for additional luggage, so he resolved to walk around the airport while he waited for his next flight.  
由于他只带了随身行李，无需等待其他行李，于是决定在机场内四处走走，打发等待下一班飞机的时间。

He went and sat down at an airport café, enjoying a quick meal before paying and deciding to do some shopping. Asuka would likely appreciate some perfume from the duty-free.  
他走进机场咖啡馆，享用了一顿简餐后结账，决定去逛逛商店。免税店里的香水或许能让明日香喜欢。

Shinji grabbed his suitcase and started to walk towards the shops. An expensive-looking store caught his eye and made him turn his head as he walked past.  
真嗣抓起行李箱，开始朝商店走去。一家外观昂贵的店铺吸引了他的目光，使他在经过时忍不住转头望去。

Because he wasn't focused on what was ahead of him, Shinji failed to see the incoming person.  
因为心思未集中在前方，真嗣未能察觉到迎面而来的人。

The two people collided, and Shinji was sent onto his backside. "Oh my god! I'm so sorry!" he said in broken English. His eyes were fixed on the ground.  
两人相撞，真嗣一屁股坐在地上。“哦，天哪！真对不起！”他用蹩脚的英语说道，目光紧盯着地面。

The person he bumped into was livid. "You idiot!" they said, in somewhat-less-broken English. "Can't you look where you're going!?" That person proceeded to launch into a flurry of angry German. It was almost too recognizable.  
他撞上的那人满脸怒气。“你个白痴！”对方用略显生硬的英语说道，“你就不能看着点路吗？！”接着，那人便开始连珠炮似地用愤怒的德语斥责起来，那口音几乎是一听便知。

Shinji felt a familiar excitement bubble in his chest. He was smiling before he even looked up. His eyes travelled slowly, taking in the image: Same red hair, same striking personality. She was wearing a long, black coat and a pair of boots. "Asuka?" he said, getting to his feet.  
真嗣感到一股熟悉的兴奋在胸中涌动。他甚至还没抬头就已经露出了笑容。他的目光缓缓上移，打量着眼前的人：一样的红发，一样的鲜明个性。她穿着一件长长的黑色大衣和一双靴子。“明日香？”他站起身来，试探性地问道。

"Honestly! It's like nobody knows how to treat a lady these day- Shinji?" All of her wrath dropped in seconds as she took in his image. In an instant, the two rushed together, sharing a tight hug, before pulling away and loosing themselves into a long, tender kiss. She ran a hand through his hair, letting it come to rest at the back of his neck.  
老实说！现在好像没人懂得如何对待一位女士了——真嗣？"她所有的怒气在看到他的瞬间烟消云散。刹那间，两人紧紧相拥，随后分开，陷入一个漫长而温柔的吻中。她伸手轻抚他的发丝，最终手停留在他的后颈。

The two of them separated, and Shinji couldn't resist letting a grin spread across his face. "Hi."  
两人分开后，真嗣忍不住露出了笑容，轻声道：“嗨。”

"Hello," she said sweetly, before raising an eyebrow. "What are you doing here!?"  
"你好呀，"她甜甜地说道，随即挑了挑眉，"你在这儿干嘛呢！？"

"Well, I was supposed to be surprising you. What are _you_ doing here?"  
“哎，我本想给你个惊喜的。你怎么在这儿？”

Asuka laughed. "The same thing. I was supposed to fly to Japan to surprise you. Why didn't Misato stop you from going anywhere!?"  
明日香笑了起来。“同样的事。我本打算飞往日本给你一个惊喜。为什么美里没有阻止你去任何地方呢？！”

He scratched his head. "Uh, I dunno. She didn't stop me at all."  
他挠了挠头。“呃，我不知道。她根本没拦我。”

"Dammit, must've sent it too late," said Asuka. She shrugged, grabbing her carry-on in one hand and snaking her other around Shinji's free arm.  
"该死，肯定是发得太晚了。" 明日香说道。她耸了耸肩，一手抓起随身行李，另一手则缠上了真嗣空着的手臂。

"So, what now?" he asked.  
"那么，现在怎么办？" 他问道。

"For starters, we need to get you a ticket back to Japan. Then, we're gonna get back on a plane and go home. We're overdue for spending a day doing nothing together."  
首先，我们得给你弄张回日本的机票。然后，我们再坐飞机回家。我们早就该一起无所事事地度过一天了。

Shinji liked that idea. 真嗣喜欢这个主意。
