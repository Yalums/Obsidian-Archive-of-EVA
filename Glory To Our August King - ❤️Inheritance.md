There are some wounds not even time can heal. Some that just cut too deep. The Angel War came to an end 39 years ago with Third Impact, but for Asuka and Shinji, the war will never end – and their son is just another one of its veterans.  
有些创伤，即使时间也无法愈合，它们伤得太深。天使之战在 39 年前以第三次冲击结束，但对明日香和真嗣来说，这场战争永无止境——他们的儿子只是其中的另一名老兵。

### Chapter 1: November 28

The hospital is quiet, taking the confidence from my stride as I near room 222. The metal of the door handle is cool against my sweaty palm, and I wish that my stomach would stop quivering. It's threatening to eat me from the inside. Maybe it was the four cups of coffee before I came here, or something about the soup Marina made, Jesus just _open the door_.  
医院里静悄悄的，我走近 222 病房时，步伐中的自信也随之消散。门把手上的金属触感冰凉，贴着我汗湿的掌心，我真希望自己的胃能停止颤抖。它似乎要从内部把我吞噬。也许是来之前喝的那四杯咖啡，或是 Marina 做的那碗汤，天哪，快开门吧。

It creaks on the hinges, the only damn sound in the entire building. My boots squeak as my heels scuff against the linoleum, why the hell did I wear these things?  
门在铰链上吱吱作响，是整栋楼里唯一的声音。我的靴子在油毡地板上发出吱吱声，为什么我非要穿这双鞋？

_Because they make you tall.  
因为它们让你显得高挑。_

The air is chilling. A newspaper shifts and a nylon jacket screeches. Deep, cloudy blue eyes stop my heart – just a moment before it kicks into overdrive, and the boots don't make me feel so tall anymore. I swallow, trying not to think about how terrified I am of this man sitting across the room from me. That's when I realize I've stopped in the doorway. I look away, to the floor, to the T.V. in the upper left corner, wherever, and I close the door. I can still feel his eyes on me – dark with a hidden horror I've heard in screams and quiet sobs as a child.  
空气冷冽。一份报纸轻轻移动，尼龙夹克发出刺耳声。深邃、阴郁的蓝眼睛让我心跳骤停——就在它即将加速之前，那双靴子也不再让我感觉那么高大了。我咽了咽口水，努力不去想对面房间里这个男人让我有多害怕。就在这时，我意识到自己停在门口。我移开视线，看向地板，看向左上角的电视机，无论哪里，然后关上门。我仍能感觉到他的目光在我身上——深邃中藏着孩提时在尖叫和低泣中听过的恐怖。

The room that was just a second ago too cold is pulsing with a warmth that's choking me. I wait for him to say something. His gaze leaves me as he stands, making it to the side of the lone bed with a barely noticeable limp.  
刚才还过于寒冷的房间此刻涌动着令人窒息的温暖。我等待他说些什么。他站起身，目光从我身上移开，走到那张孤零零的床边，步伐中带着几乎察觉不到的跛行。

My heart swells, and the breath is gone from my lungs. She's hooked up to an IV, screens and monitors humming and beeping over her head. Strands of gray I don't remember streak their way down her faded orange-red hair. My mother was always a pretty woman, hard to miss in a full room, always sure and confident in presence. Not this time though, where the crows feet edging from the corners of her eyes seem deeper and her skin paler. Some part of me wants to rush to her side and touch her, hold her hand or hug her or–  
我的心膨胀起来，呼吸从肺中消失。她连接着静脉注射，屏幕和监测器在她头顶嗡嗡作响，发出哔哔声。我记忆中没有的灰白发丝，沿着她褪色的橙红色头发蔓延。我的母亲一直是个漂亮的女人，在满屋子人中难以忽视，总是自信满满。但这次不同，眼角的鱼尾纹似乎更深了，皮肤也更苍白。我内心的一部分想要冲到她身边，触摸她，握住她的手或拥抱她，或者——

I take a step back. That would mean forgiving her – and I don't know if I can do that.  
我后退了一步。那意味着原谅她——我不知道我是否能做到。

My father takes her hand in his, a thumb brushing over her knuckles. "He came, Asuka... he's here," my dad whispers, and he sounds... excited? Relieved? I don't know, maybe I'm hearing things. I'm glued to her every movement, the subtle twitch of her left hand and the way her eyelids flutter open, weakly. A soft noise hums from her throat and her eyes punch a hole through my chest when they find me, unfocused and far away. I remember them being so bright and sharp.  
我父亲握住她的手，拇指轻抚过她的指节。“他来了，明日香...他在这里，”我爸爸低声说，他的声音听起来...兴奋？松了口气？我不知道，也许我听错了。我紧盯着她的每一个动作，左手微妙的抽动，眼睑微弱地颤动睁开。她喉咙里发出柔和的声音，当她的眼睛找到我时，它们穿透了我的胸膛，模糊而遥远。我记得它们曾经是那么明亮和锐利。

"Kazuya..." she croaks and her lips twitch in an almost-smile.  
"和也..." 她嘶哑地说道，嘴唇微微抽动，几乎要露出笑容。

It's too much. My head is spinning and my stomach is twisting in a knot – I think it's going to explode.  
这太过了。我的头在旋转，胃里纠结成一团——我感觉它快要爆炸了。

"I have to use the bathroom," the words spill out in a rush and the next second I'm out the door, slamming it shut behind me. My shoulders jump, shit, hadn't meant to pull so hard. I can't walk fast enough down the hall towards the restrooms. Can't just stand in the hallway until my nerves stop screaming, have to keep up appearances – might have to puke too.  
"我得去洗手间，" 话一出口就急匆匆地，下一秒我已经冲出门外，砰地一声关上门。我的肩膀一抖，该死，没想用力过猛。我沿着走廊快步走向洗手间，无法在走廊里站着等神经平静下来，必须保持镇定——可能还得吐出来。

The door cracks into the tiled wall as I stumble in, and I'm hunched over a sink. My right hand fishes through the pockets of my brown overcoat. _Dammit, dammit, dammit where is it?_ A smooth cylinder brushes my finger tips. I almost rip the pocket yanking it out, muttering a curse as I fiddle with unscrewing the cap. Pills pour into my palm, but my hands are shaking. Some clatter to the floor.  
门砰地一声撞在瓷砖墙上，我踉跄着走进来，弯腰伏在洗手池上。我的右手在棕色大衣口袋里摸索。该死，该死，该死，它在哪儿？一个光滑的圆柱体触到了我的指尖。我几乎撕破了口袋才把它拽出来，一边拧开盖子一边低声咒骂。药片倒进手掌，但我的手在颤抖。有些叮叮当当地掉在了地上。

Throwing my head back, I dry swallow three of the tablets, allowing my system to bathe in sweet, sweet benzodiazepines. They wouldn't really start to kick in for another few minutes, but just knowing I've taken them is bringing me down.  
我猛地向后仰头，干吞下三片药片，让我的身体沐浴在甜美甘甜的苯二氮平中。它们还要过几分钟才会真正起效，但光是知道我已经服下它们，就让我感到些许安慰。

I throw the faucet on, splashing scalding water over my face. Hate it when it's cold.  
我打开水龙头，用滚烫的水泼在脸上。不喜欢冷水。

I shouldn't have come. Why did I come?  
我不该来的。我为什么要来？

_Because you'd be an awful person if you didn't. They're still your parents, even if you haven't talked to them in 8 years. You can stand to show them your face for a few minutes when your mom is hospitalized after a heart attack – it's just a routine visit. "Hey, doing well? Fantastic! What's that? You'll be out of the hospital in no time? Me? Oh, yes, I've been doing great, mother – take care now!" Then I walk out those front doors and we go our separate ways again.  
因为如果你不来，你就太无情了。他们毕竟还是你的父母，即使你已经八年没和他们说话了。你妈妈心脏病发作住院了，你总得露个面，哪怕只是几分钟的例行探望。“嘿，还好吗？太好了！什么？你很快就能出院了？我？哦，是的，我一直都很好，妈妈——保重啊！”然后我就走出那扇大门，我们再次各走各的路。_

God, what the hell is wrong with me?  
天啊，我到底是怎么了？

It takes a while before I feel up to stepping out into the hallway again. I have to go back into that room and say... something. I thought I'd planned this so well in my head. _It's alright, Kazu – you've taken your pills, you can face your parents for a few measly minutes_.  
过了好一阵子，我才鼓起勇气再次踏出房门。我必须回到那个房间，说些什么。我以为自己已经在脑海中计划得如此周详。没关系，和也——你已经吃了药，面对父母几分钟不成问题。

"You hungry?" a quiet, but gravely voice asks.  
“你饿了吗？”一个低沉但沙哑的声音问道。

Normally, I might have jumped finding my father leaning on the wall beside the bathroom door. I just sort of turn, the world is moving in slow motion a bit, head feels fuzzy. Good, the meds are kicking in. Still, I can make out that hard stare from behind his glasses, the big kind that might be more suitable for a 90 year old man. I catch the shadow of stubble over his jaw and chin too. Dad's never liked keeping facial hair, he must have been staying at the hospital the past few days.  
通常情况下，发现父亲靠在浴室门旁的墙上，我可能会吓一跳。我只是缓缓转身，周围的一切似乎都慢了下来，头感觉有些模糊。很好，药物开始起作用了。尽管如此，我仍能透过他的眼镜看到那锐利的目光，那种大号眼镜或许更适合九十岁的老人。我还注意到他下巴和脸颊上的胡茬阴影。爸爸从不留胡须，他一定是过去几天都待在医院里。

I give a half-shrug. "Not really."  
我耸了耸肩。"不是特别在意。"

His eyes dart downward, locked onto something. "What's that?"  
他的目光迅速下移，锁定在某样东西上。"那是什么？"

"Nothing," I say, stuffing the bottle back in my coat.  
“没什么，”我说着，把瓶子塞回外套里。

Those blues come back up to pin me with a level stare and I can't hold it, never could. His hands slide into the pockets of his dull sky blue nylon jacket and he turns around. "Come on, let's get something to eat."  
那些蓝眼睛又回过头来，用一种平静的目光盯着我，我无法承受，从来都做不到。他的手滑进他那件暗淡天蓝色尼龙夹克的口袋里，转身说道：“走吧，我们去吃点东西。”

My right hand squeezes into a fist and I want to tell him off. I end up following him after another beat, biting my tongue. _You're here to see your mother in the hospital. Be diplomatic._  
我的右手紧握成拳，真想对他发火。但最终还是在片刻后跟上了他，咬紧牙关。你是来医院看望母亲的。要圆滑些。

The elevator ride down is tense, awkward and mercifully short. As we're walking into the food court, I have to blink several times to make sure I'm not hallucinating. I've gotten taller than my dad. Or it's the boots. My chest is still quivering and I find myself looking for the exits and making mental note of them. It's a weird habit, I can't really control it.  
电梯下行时气氛紧张而尴尬，所幸时间很短。当我们走进美食广场时，我不得不眨了几次眼，以确认自己没有出现幻觉。我居然比爸爸高了。或许是靴子的缘故。我的胸口仍在颤抖，发现自己不由自主地寻找着出口，并在心里记下它们的位置。这是个奇怪的习惯，我实在控制不了。

I should be panicking that we're even in public, and at a hospital no less – where there's bound to be a spill of blood _somewhere_. What if my dad has an episode? What the hell am I going to do? I should be terrified. The wonders of modern science are making it all the more manageable, however.  
我本该因为我们在公共场合，还是在医院这种地方——到处都可能溅上血迹——而感到恐慌。万一我爸突然发作怎么办？我到底该怎么办？我应该感到害怕。然而，现代医学的奇迹让这一切变得更加可控。

He finds us a spot in the corner of the room, by the windows. I take a seat with my back to the wall, giving myself a clear view of the rest of the room. I lean forward on the table so I don't sway in my chair. Might fall off.  
他在房间的角落里找到了一个位置，靠着窗户。我背对着墙坐下，这样就能清楚地看到房间的其他部分。我向前倾靠在桌子上，以免在椅子上摇晃。可能会摔下来。

I don't remember him leaving for food, yet he comes back with a tray of beef stew and a side of mashed potatoes. The pungent smell of his orange juice makes my nose twitch. In my head, I know I'm just killing time – stalling to see my mother that much longer. The realization makes my vision fuzz out a little. Has it gotten that bad? Would I really rather risk sitting down with my father, who could explode at the drop of a hat, than just sit in the same damn room as my mother?  
我不记得他去拿食物了，但他却带着一盘牛肉炖菜和一份土豆泥回来了。他橙汁的刺鼻气味让我鼻子发痒。在我心里，我知道我只是在消磨时间——拖延着与母亲见面的时间。这个念头让我的视线有些模糊。情况已经这么糟糕了吗？我真的宁愿冒着和我父亲坐在一起的风险，他随时可能爆发，也不愿只是坐在我母亲所在的同一个房间里吗？

Maybe I need more pills.  
也许我需要更多的药片。

My father's voice brings that particular line of thought to a screeching halt. "She hasn't woken up for anything the past fourteen hours," he says, spoon swirling his stew. His eyes shoot up to mine and I look out the window. "Not even to eat."  
父亲的声音让这种特定的思绪戛然而止。“过去十四小时她什么也没醒过来，”他说着，用勺子搅动着炖菜。他的目光突然投向我，我则望向窗外。“连吃饭都没醒。”

I try not to let it show, but that rips barbed wire through my heart and I don't know why. It wasn't my fault she was here.  
我尽量不让这表现出来，但它像带刺的铁丝一样撕扯着我的心，我不知道为什么。她在这里并不是我的错。

"She asks about you, while they've got her all hopped up on medication. Asks where you are."  
"她在药物作用下神志不清时，还问起你。问你在哪里。"

I sigh, a hand sliding through my black hair. "I didn't come here for a guilt trip."  
我叹了口气，一只手穿过我的黑发。"我不是来这里自责的。"

"She misses you." "她想念你。"

_Looks like you're getting one anyway.  
看来你无论如何都要得到一个了。_

"Tough," I snap, "she made sure I wasn't welcome back home."  
"没办法，" 我厉声道，"她确保我不再被欢迎回家。"

My father grimaces. "That's not true. If you–"  
我父亲皱起眉头。"那不是真的。如果你——"

"We've already talked about this, dad. I'm not moving back down to Arizona. Transfer department would throw a fit anyway."  
"我们已经讨论过这个了，爸爸。我不会搬回亚利桑那的。转部门的话他们肯定会大发雷霆的。"

"You could at least visit every once in a while, or even call."  
"你至少可以偶尔来访，或者打个电话。"

"I'm too busy." "我太忙了。"

"Right..." he sighs, a bit more life leaving his face. His shoulders sag. "Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, you're very occupied with your work as, a... what was it again?"  
"好吧..." 他叹了口气，脸上又少了几分生气。他的肩膀垂了下来。"是的，你说得对。对不起，你工作很忙，是...那个职位叫什么来着？"

"Information Management Officer." pretty much a fancy title for someone who deciphers paperwork and figures out where it gets filed.  
"信息管理官。" 基本上就是个花哨的头衔，专门负责解读文件并决定它们的归档位置。

This is the longest conversation we've had in maybe a year or two. It's mostly emails I pass back and forth with my dad – and those are downright skeletal. It was just another report I had to write, like I was working back at the office. Just a routine communication. But hey, look at this, we're talking! We're almost normal!  
这可能是我们一两年以来最长的一次对话了。我主要是和我爸来回发邮件——那些邮件简直简略得像骨架。这只是我不得不写的一份报告，就像我在办公室工作时一样。只是例行公事。但嘿，看啊，我们在聊天！我们几乎恢复正常了！

"Right. It's been a long time, Kazuya... can't you–"  
"对。已经很久了，和也...你就不能——"

"Uh-huh, we done?" I say before I can stop myself. I try not to cringe, waiting for the anger to come.  
"嗯哼，说完了吗？"我不由自主地说出口。我尽量不露出尴尬的表情，等待着他的怒火。

It doesn't. Instead, he puts his spoon down, wipes his mouth with a napkin and folds his arms on the table, staring down at it. "You should talk to her Kazuya. Just..." he lifts his eyes and mine turn to the window. "Just think about it, okay?"  
然而，怒火并未降临。相反，他放下勺子，用餐巾擦了擦嘴，然后将双臂交叉放在桌上，低头凝视着桌面。“你应该和她谈谈，和也。只是...”他抬起眼，我的目光转向窗外。“只是考虑一下，好吗？”

There it is. That tone again – trying its damnedest to hide how scared he is. That's the only reason I flew down here after he called me, which isn't normal for him to do to begin with. I've never heard him like this before, not even after he breaks down during one of his episodes. So I had to come. I had to see mom. If she was going to...  
就在那里。那种语气又来了——竭尽全力掩饰他有多害怕。这就是为什么他在打电话给我后，我会飞奔下来，这本身对他来说就不寻常。我从未听过他这样，即使在他发作时崩溃之后也没有。所以我必须来。我必须见妈妈。如果她要……

Did I want my scathing words to her 8 years ago to be my last? Wouldn't I want to be there if she passed? As much as I want to hate her, the thought of her going while we're holding this cold-shoulder grudge, well... it frightens me. For a moment, my chest is wound tight and it doesn't feel like my anxiety pills are working so well anymore. I don't _want_ her to die. I've never wanted that.  
八年前我对她说的那些尖刻的话，难道要成为最后的告别吗？如果她离世，我不希望自己在场吗？尽管我多么想恨她，想到她在我们的冷战期间离去，这让我感到恐惧。有那么一刻，我的胸口紧绷，感觉焦虑药片似乎不再那么有效了。我不希望她死。我从未希望那样。

I definitely don't want "I have to go to the bathroom" to be my last words to her.  
我绝对不希望“我得去洗手间”成为我对她说的最后一句话。

My shoulders touch the backrest, and between a tsunami of emotions, the meds, my queasy stomach and a dozen other things I can't even process – a headache starts trying to pound its way out of my skull.  
我的肩膀靠在椅背上，在情绪的海啸、药物、翻腾的胃以及一堆我甚至无法处理的其他事情之间——头痛开始试图从我的头骨中敲打出来。

A puff of air escapes my lips. "You're buying lunch, right?"  
我轻轻呼出一口气。“你请吃午饭，对吧？”

**Author's Notes:** Submitting this thing now so I can't chicken out later. Not too long ago, I mentioned to another author here, Folk Devil, during a discussion that I didn't think Asuka and Shinji having a child was very plausible. Not impossible, just something I found very hard to imagine actually happening. I don't feel either of them would make particularly good parents (If their own parents, or lack thereof, are anything to go by). Since then, I've thought about it quite a bit, and the more I think about it, the more the idea of them being parents actually appeals to me.  
作者笔记：现在提交这个作品，以免我之后退缩。不久前，我和这里的另一位作者 Folk Devil 在讨论时提到，我不认为明日香和真嗣有孩子是很有可能的。不是不可能，只是我觉得很难想象这种事真的会发生。我不认为他们中的任何一个会成为特别好的父母（如果从他们自己的父母，或缺乏父母的角度来看）。从那以后，我对此想了很多，而且我越想越觉得他们成为父母这个想法其实很吸引我。

This is mostly an excuse to stretch my creative legs – experiment with my writing, particularly learning to rely on similes and metaphors waaaay less. Also challenging myself to write a chapter a week, nothing pre-written, just to get into the practice of finishing something in a timely manner. One day, I'll probably come back and rewrite some of this stuff.  
这主要是为了伸展我的创造力——尝试我的写作，特别是学会更少依赖明喻和暗喻。同时挑战自己每周写一章，没有任何预写内容，只是为了养成及时完成作品的习惯。有一天，我可能会回来重写其中的一些内容。

On that note, I've never really written a story from the POV of an OC. Let me know how that's going.  
说到这个，我从未真正从原创角色的视角写过一个故事。告诉我进展如何。

Oh, borrowed ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ _a lot_ of background stuff from Folk Devil's post-Third Impact story _The Creative Principle_, 'cause it's my headcanon. If you haven't read it yet, do it up. It's freakin' amazing.  
哦，借用了s̶o̶m̶e̶很多背景设定来自 Folk Devil 的第三冲击后故事《The Creative Principle》，因为这是我的个人设定。如果你还没读过，赶紧去读吧。它非常精彩。

### Interlude I

I remember being six the first time my dad snapped. The waning sun was setting the clouds ablaze with firelight, and the buzzing cicada bugs were restless.  
我记得第一次看到父亲爆发是在我六岁那年。夕阳渐沉，将云彩点燃成火光，蝉鸣声不绝于耳，显得格外焦躁。

We lived in Florida at the time, what was left of it at least. In school I learned the rising sea levels had consumed most of the land mass under water, leaving behind a hundred large islands and most of the panhandle. Our home was on the outskirts of Panama City, most of which had been swallowed by the sea. From the beaches I could see the tops of the old skyscrapers jutting out of the water. Most of the buildings along the shoreline had been abandoned long ago and left to rust and decay. Our house sat beyond the loose, sandy dunes overgrown with saw palmettos and waist-high grass.  
那时我们住在佛罗里达，至少是它残存的部分。在学校里我了解到，海平面上升已经淹没了大部分陆地，只剩下百余个大大小小的岛屿和大部分狭长地带。我们的家在巴拿马城郊外，那里大部分地区已被海水吞噬。从海滩上，我能看到旧时摩天大楼的顶端从水中冒出。沿岸的许多建筑早已被遗弃，任由其生锈腐朽。我们的房子坐落在松散的沙丘之外，那里长满了锯棕榈和齐腰高的野草。

I race down the street, the heat of the sand burning the bottoms of my feet. My tiny lungs are desperately trying to keep up, but the blood spilling from the long tear down my forearm is making it all the more difficult. I've taken off my shirt to wrap it around the wound and keep it from bleeding so much, or something like that, I was six and it hurt like hell. The chain-link fence, half-buried and lop-sided in the coastal sands, had finally had enough of this boy stepping over it day after day to get to the windy beaches, snagging my arm with one of its barbed edges.  
我沿着街道狂奔，沙子的热气灼烧着脚底。我那小小的肺拼命跟上节奏，但前臂上那道长长的撕裂伤口涌出的鲜血让一切变得更加艰难。我脱下衬衫，将其缠绕在伤口上，试图减少出血，或者类似的事情，毕竟那时我才六岁，痛得要命。那半埋在海岸沙地中、歪斜的铁丝网栅栏，终于受够了这孩子日复一日地跨过它去往风大的海滩，用它带刺的边缘钩住了我的手臂。

It takes me only ten minutes to reach our house, way past the edge of the suburbs. The plants are overgrown and crawl over eachother for sunlight, the roads made with packed white sand from the beaches. Rogue shells stab at my toes as a two story house steadily grows larger. Looking at it from far away, you'd think no one lived there and that it was just some long forgotten pre-Second Impact relic. Vines cling to its frame, wrapping possessively around every inch of chipped white-painted wood. It's raised up on small stilts, two stories high with steep black-shingled roofs, patches of them missing from the rank and file. It's a house too big for just three people.  
我只需十分钟就能到达我们的房子，远远超出郊区的边缘。植物肆意生长，争相攀爬以获取阳光，道路由海滩的白沙压实而成。散落的贝壳刺痛我的脚趾，一栋两层楼的房子逐渐变大。从远处看，你会以为那里无人居住，只是某个被遗忘的前第二次冲击遗迹。藤蔓紧贴其框架，贪婪地缠绕着每一寸剥落的白色油漆木头。它建在小小的木桩上，两层楼高，陡峭的黑瓦屋顶上有些地方已经破损。这房子对于三个人来说太大了。

I thunder up the worn wooden steps along the side of the house, barreling inside – the door smacks into the drywall. A heavy oak scent spears into my nostrils, mingled with the alluring smell of sizzling red meats lathered in butter and olive oil.  
我猛地冲上房子侧面的破旧木楼梯，冲进屋内——门重重地撞在干墙上。一股浓重的橡木香气刺入我的鼻孔，混合着诱人的煎红肉香味，涂满了黄油和橄榄油。

Dad turns from the stove. "Kazuya? What's wrong?" he asks, a hand adjusting his glasses. Then he sees the shirt over my arm, splotched with red. Concern folds his brow and he mutters a curse, kneeling in front of me and taking the shirt away. He drapes it over a knee, one hand clasping my bicep while the other gently takes my forearm to inspect the wound. It's stopped bleeding, mostly.  
爸爸从炉子前转过身来。“和也？怎么了？”他问道，一只手调整着眼镜。随后他看到了我手臂上沾满红色斑点的衬衫。担忧在他眉间凝聚，他低声咒骂了一句，跪在我面前，拿走了衬衫。他将衬衫搭在膝盖上，一只手握住我的二头肌，另一只手轻轻握住我的前臂检查伤口。血已经基本止住了。

Crimson smears over the palm of his right hand and he goes stiff. He turns it up and stares down at it, utterly still. I can smell the steaks starting to burn in the pan.  
鲜红的血迹沾满了他的右手掌，他整个人僵住了。他翻转手掌，凝视着它，一动不动。我闻到了平底锅里牛排开始烧焦的味道。

"Dad?" I ask as his jaw tightens from clenched teeth.  
“爸爸？”我轻声问道，他的下巴因紧咬的牙齿而绷紧。

The corded muscles of his neck tense and his nostrils flare, eyelids fluttering as his breathing becomes labored. I can feel him trembling as his other hand squeezes my arm so hard I'm sure the bone will break.  
他脖颈上的肌肉紧绷，鼻孔扩张，眼睑颤动，呼吸变得急促。我能感觉到他在颤抖，另一只手紧紧抓住我的手臂，力度之大让我确信骨头都要断了。

"Dad, that hurts!" I yell, but he isn't listening. He can't even hear me as I tug and scream, "let go!"  
“爸爸，好疼！”我大喊，但他充耳不闻。我拉扯着，尖叫着“放开我！”，可他根本听不见。

His gaze snaps up, and there's a wild look in his eyes – wide and scared – that pierces straight through me. There's something else he's looking at. Something only he can see. He releases my arm and I fall backwards, skull thwacking against the rim of the dinner table as I tumble under it. Dad staggers back, holding the hand with my blood on it, and I hope those frenzied eyes don't find me again. I cower under the table as he stumbles over to the sink, throwing the faucet on and scrubbing his hands with jerky motions. Steam starts to rise and I know it has to be burning hot. He just keeps scrubbing, muttering under his breath. The blood's been washed off minutes ago and he's rubbing his palms raw.  
他的目光猛地抬起，眼中闪烁着狂乱的光芒——睁大且充满恐惧——直直穿透了我。他在看别的东西，只有他能看见的东西。他松开了我的手臂，我向后倒去，后脑勺重重地撞在餐桌边缘，随即滚到了桌子底下。爸爸踉跄后退，手里还沾着我的血，我祈祷他那狂乱的眼睛不要再找到我。我蜷缩在桌子下，看着他蹒跚走向水槽，猛地打开水龙头，用急促的动作搓洗双手。蒸汽开始升腾，我知道水一定很烫。他不停地搓洗，嘴里喃喃自语。血迹早已被冲走，他的手掌也被搓得通红。

"Dammit, dammit, _dammit_," he hisses, hands weaving up into his hair and pulling as he starts to pace, water still running. His hip knocks into the table as he marches by, gone around the corner.  
"该死，该死，该死，" 他低声咒骂，双手插入发间，用力拉扯，开始来回踱步，水仍在流淌。他走过时，臀部撞到了桌子，消失在转角处。

A door slams shut – and I run, leaving a few red splotches in my wake. Down the hall and to the right. I scramble under my bed, scuffing my arm across the carpet and leaving a red streak.  
一扇门砰然关闭——我拔腿就跑，身后留下几处红色斑点。沿着走廊向右，我慌忙钻到床下，手臂在地板上擦过，留下一道红色痕迹。

Back then, my mother was driving all around the panhandle giving lectures at state colleges and universities, so she'd be gone on weekends and often get home late. Curled up under my bed, I hope and plea this won't be one of those nights.  
那时，我母亲在州立学院和大学间奔波演讲，周末常常不在家，晚上也很晚才回来。蜷缩在床下，我祈祷并恳求今晚不要是那样的夜晚。

The time bleeds out for what feels like hours, filled with the running water in the kitchen and the sour, choking smell of burnt meat. I hear her enter through the door I left open. I can't get up from under my bed though, I can't even call for her. All I can do is lie there and shiver.  
时间仿佛流逝了数小时，厨房里水流不息，烧焦的肉散发着酸涩而令人窒息的气味。我听见她从我留着的门进来。尽管如此，我却无法从床底下起身，甚至连呼唤她都做不到。我只能躺在那里颤抖。

"Shinji? Kazuya?" my mother calls, exhaustion in her voice. Several heartbeats go by, and she shouts my name. I hear something drop and shatter, and the clicking of her heels echoing down the hall.  
“真嗣？和也？”母亲呼唤着，声音中透着疲惫。几下心跳的时间过去，她大声喊出我的名字。我听到有什么东西掉落并破碎，还有她的高跟鞋在走廊里回响的咔嗒声。

Her legs appear, she gasps and falls to her knees, concern etched face peering under my bed. "Kazuya?!"  
她的双腿出现在视线中，她倒抽一口气跪了下来，脸上刻着关切，朝床底下张望。“和也？！”

She reaches for me, half dragging me out as I try to crawl into her arms.  
她伸手拉我，半拖着我离开，而我试图爬进她的怀抱。

"What happened? Where's your father?" I'll never forget how frightened she sounded. I shake my head and point down the hall.  
“发生了什么？你父亲呢？”我永远不会忘记她那惊恐的声音。我摇摇头，指向走廊的另一端。

She squeezes me tight, kisses the top of my head. "Stay here," she says, pulling me from her embrace and standing.  
她紧紧地抱住我，亲吻我的头顶。“待在这里，”她说着，将我从她的怀抱中拉出并站起身来。

"No, don't leave!" I cry.  
“不，别走！”我喊道。

She's already out of my room. I follow, at a distance, just in case that strange man wearing my father's skin appears around the corner. The door to my parents room is slightly ajar when I reach it. The tile is cold, sending chills crawling up my legs as I creep up, peering through the crack with a single brown eye. Dad is curled up on the bed with his legs hugged to his chest, shaking – sweat stains darkening his clothes. My mother has his head in her lap, bent over him, long red hair concealing both of their faces. I can hear her whispering softly to him, fingers gliding through his hair.  
她已经离开了我的房间。我远远地跟在后面，以防那个穿着我父亲皮囊的陌生男人突然出现在转角。当我走到父母房间的门口时，门微微开着。瓷砖冰冷，寒意沿着我的双腿爬升，我蹑手蹑脚地靠近，透过缝隙用一只棕色的眼睛窥视。爸爸蜷缩在床上，双腿紧抱在胸前，颤抖着——汗水浸湿了他的衣服。妈妈把他的头放在她的腿上，弯腰俯向他，长长的红发遮住了他们的脸。我能听到她轻声细语地安慰他，手指轻轻滑过他的头发。

I hide under the bed again, arm stinging with fire. The blood has at least dried, crusting around the wrist-to-elbow gash.  
我又一次躲在床下，手臂火辣辣地疼。至少血已经凝固，手腕到肘部的伤口周围结了痂。

My mother holds me in my room that night, clutching me like she's got nothing else in the world while rocking us gently. I'm hugging her just as tight. My arm's been dressed, dad's long since been locked away in their room. I can't sleep and we stay like that for a long time.  
那晚，母亲在我房间里紧紧抱着我，仿佛她是世界上唯一剩下的东西，轻轻地摇晃着我们。我也同样紧紧地拥抱着她。我的手臂已经包扎好了，爸爸早已被锁在他们的房间里。我无法入睡，我们就这样待了很久。

"It's not him," she whispers to me, repeating it over and over, "it's not him. It's the Eva. It's the _Eva._"  
“不是他，”她对我低声说，一遍又一遍地重复，“不是他。是 Eva。是 Eva。”

Whenever dad would slip, whenever that darkness took him – it was always the Eva. They never told me what that was. But I started to hate the Eva.  
每当爸爸失控，每当那黑暗吞噬他——总是因为 Eva。他们从未告诉我 Eva 是什么。但我开始憎恨 Eva。

After a while, I started to hate my dad too.  
过了一段时间，我也开始讨厌我爸爸了。

At first, I felt bad for him. Mom said he was sick, but wouldn't say how or with what. When I ask her why we don't take him to the doctor, she tells me there's no cure. I didn't know what flashbacks were back then. Couldn't possibly fathom how they could turn my dad into a completely different person in an instant. Mom said I couldn't ever tell anyone, or else people would come to take me away and I would never see them again.  
起初，我为他感到难过。妈妈说他病了，但不愿说是什么病。当我问她为什么不带他去看医生时，她告诉我这病无药可治。那时候我不知道什么是闪回。无法想象它们如何能让我爸爸瞬间变成另一个人。妈妈说，我绝不能告诉任何人，否则人们会来把我带走，我就再也见不到他们了。

There was a big white church down in the suburbs, four miles from home. I'd run there every day after school, though it would always be closed when I arrived. I'd sneak in through the back and kneel at the alter like I'd seen other people do, praying to God so he would fix my dad. A kid at school said if you prayed enough, he could make miracles happen. It was the only way I knew how to help him.  
在郊区有一座很大的白色教堂，离我家四英里。我每天放学后都会跑去那里，尽管每次到达时它总是关着门。我会从后门溜进去，像我见过的其他人一样跪在祭坛前，向神祈祷，希望他能治好我爸爸。学校里有个孩子说，如果你祈祷得足够多，他就能创造奇迹。这是我唯一知道的帮助他的方法。

I think the old pastor that owned the church knew about it, but he must have pitied me, assuming I was some sort of homeless street urchin. There was no shortage of those in the south. I never caused trouble for him, so he left me alone. I couldn't go to the regular worships. May parents didn't believe in it and I had to keep my dad's condition a secret.  
我想那位老牧师应该知道这件事，但他一定是对我心生怜悯，以为我是那种无家可归的街头流浪儿。在南方，这样的人并不少见。我从未给他添过麻烦，所以他也就任由我自在了。我不能去参加常规的礼拜活动。我父母不信教，而且我还得对我父亲的病情保密。

I just wanted him to get better. Since that night, we always had to worry if something would set him off, bring back the man who came from the crater in Japan with an unknown war in his eyes. Mom started smoking again, even though she said she hated the damn things. She had quit around the time I was born. Always told me, half-joking, that she would disown me if I ever touched one when I got older. Even as a six year old, I knew there was some truth to that. My hot-tempered mother wasn't one to make threats lightly. I'd watch her stand out by the street from my window, a small red glow pinched between her fingers. She tried to keep it from me, but the nostril burning scent wove into her clothes and stained itself in her hair.  
我只希望他能好起来。自从那个夜晚之后，我们总是担心有什么会刺激到他，让他变回那个从日本火山口出来的男人，眼中藏着一场未知的战争。妈妈又开始抽烟了，尽管她曾说过她讨厌那些该死的东西。她在我出生前后戒过烟。她总是半开玩笑地告诉我，如果我长大后碰了烟，她会把我赶出家门。即使我才六岁，我也知道这话里有些真实成分。我那脾气火爆的母亲可不是轻易说威胁的人。我会从窗户看着她站在街边，指间夹着一抹微弱的红色光芒。她试图瞒着我，但那股刺鼻的烟味已经渗透进她的衣服，染进了她的头发。

Dad barely went outside and when he did, it was usually just to do yard work, never to spend time with his son. More often than not he would lock himself away in his room. To the point where I might not see him for days, sometimes weeks.  
爸爸几乎不出门，即使出去，通常也只是做些园艺工作，从未是为了和儿子共度时光。他更多时候会把自己锁在房间里。以至于我可能几天，甚至几周都见不到他。

"Is dad coming out today?" I would ask.  
“爸爸今天会出来吗？”我会问。

"No," mother would answer, shaking her head and trying to put on a brave face for me. "Not today sweetheart."  
“不会，”妈妈会回答，摇着头，努力在我面前装出勇敢的样子。“今天不会，亲爱的。”

Some nights, I would lie by his door and listen to the clacking of his computer keys. He was always typing something. I'd be in the same spot when mom got home, fast asleep, and she'd cradle me up in her arms and tuck me into bed.  
有些夜晚，我会躺在他房门口，听着他电脑键盘的敲击声。他总是在打字。当妈妈回家时，我已经在同一个地方熟睡了，她会把我抱在怀里，轻轻地放进被窝。

We just went on pretending everything was normal.  
我们只是继续假装一切正常。

Meanwhile, I kept praying.  
与此同时，我一直在祈祷。

No one ever answered, my father never got better, and I eventually stopped going to the church four miles down the road.  
从未有人回应，我父亲也未见好转，我最终不再前往四英里外的那座教堂。

### Chapter 2: November 28 (II)

The burger was a bad idea.  
那个汉堡真是个糟糕的主意。

I can feel it in my stomach, rolling in on itself and making very questionable gurgles. I pray I'm able to keep it down. All the same, it was free, so it's hard to complain. I'll just have to deal with it. A hand twitches towards the pocket with my anxiety meds – I stop, balling it into a fist instead. _You've taken more than you should've already. You don't need those._  
我能感觉到它在胃里翻滚，发出令人不安的咕噜声。我祈祷自己能把它压下去。尽管如此，它是免费的，所以很难抱怨。我只能忍受。一只手不由自主地伸向装有焦虑药物的口袋——我停住了，握紧成拳。你已经吃得够多了。你不需要那些。

But I really, really do.  
但我真的，真的需要。

That's when I realize I'm stuck at this door again.  
就在那时，我意识到自己又卡在这扇门前了。

Room 222. 222 号房间。

I think I'm still having trouble believing I just made it through a whole conversation with my father.  
我仍然难以置信，刚刚居然和我父亲进行了一场完整的对话。

Hell, if I can stand to sit at the same table with that man for more than five minutes, I can talk to my own mother, who I can honestly say I care for far more than the old man anyway. Even if we didn't part with kinder words.  
见鬼，如果我能忍受和那个男人同桌超过五分钟，那我就能和我自己的母亲交谈，说实话，我关心她的程度远超过那老头。即便我们分别时没有说出更温和的话语。

I suck in a deep breath through my nose, filling my lungs with cold, bleach-scented air. The door creaks on its hinges. A golden glow spills in from the window, bathing the entire room in warmth. She's sitting up against the pillows, staring beyond the glass when I step in. She isn't actually in the hospital room with me, but somewhere far away, with glassy eyes and a face unburdened by the weight of a mask.  
我用力从鼻孔吸入一口气，让冰冷且带有漂白剂气味的空气充满肺部。门在铰链上吱吱作响。一束金色的光芒从窗户倾泻而入，温暖了整个房间。她靠在枕头上，凝视着窗外，当我走进来时。她并不真正在这个病房里，而是身处远方，眼神空洞，脸上没有戴着面具的重负。

She looks at me. Light fills her gaze and her expression hardens as the mold returns. My nerves are dancing on edge before I can even think, though I keep from slamming the door shut, seething. I don't know why that manages to get such a rise out of me. What else was I expecting? Certainly not a welcome with open arms. Or maybe I'd slipped and gotten my hopes up when she whispered my name with that almost-smile.  
她看着我。光芒填满了她的目光，她的表情随着霉菌的回归而变得坚硬。在我能思考之前，我的神经已经紧张到了极点，尽管我忍住了没有用力关上门，内心愤怒。我不知道为什么这会让我如此激动。我还能期待什么呢？当然不是热情的欢迎。或者也许在她用那种几乎微笑的方式轻声呼唤我的名字时，我无意中抱有了希望。

The muscles in my cheek go taut, a sullen look coming to precedence without my consent. I glance to the TV again, a hand swiping over my chin as if to wipe the expression off. She just keeps staring at me. I almost chuff a weak laugh, but a smirk pokes at my cheek and I just barely keep from shaking my head. Of course she wouldn't say anything first. She hasn't changed a goddamn bit.  
我脸颊上的肌肉紧绷，一副阴沉的表情未经我同意就占据了上风。我又瞥了一眼电视，一只手拂过下巴，仿佛要擦掉这表情。她只是继续盯着我。我几乎要发出一声虚弱的笑声，但嘴角微微上扬，我勉强忍住没有摇头。当然，她不会先开口。她一点都没变。

"Hey, mom." I sigh, hand falling. I glance up, but it's hard to meet her eyes. I might as well be looking at a brick wall, void of anything warm or welcoming.  
“嘿，妈妈。”我叹了口气，手垂了下来。我抬头看去，但很难直视她的眼睛。我简直像是在看一堵砖墙，空洞无物，没有一丝温暖或欢迎。

My hands wiggle their way into the pockets of my overcoat. Somehow it's colder in here than outside. I bounce on my heels, taking in another deep breath and releasing it through my nose. Should I step closer to the bed? No, this is a good distance, comfortable. Sit down? No, that would mean I intend to stay for a while, and I'm not doing that. Just going to throw around some small talk, make sure everything's okay, then leave.  
我的手不自觉地伸进了大衣口袋。不知怎的，这里比外面还冷。我踮起脚尖跳了跳，深吸一口气，然后从鼻子里呼出。我应该靠近床边吗？不，这个距离正好，舒适。坐下？不，那意味着我打算待一会儿，而我并不打算那样。只是随便聊聊，确保一切都好，然后离开。

My mother doesn't say anything for a long time, a silence building itself between us – only chipped away at by the EKG and low voices from the T.V., flicked to some news channel. Her eyes fall and she leans back into the pillows, appearing to contemplate the hands resting in her lap.  
我母亲沉默了许久，我们之间仿佛筑起了一堵沉默的墙——只有心电图的滴答声和电视上低沉的新闻播报声在一点点打破这寂静。她的目光低垂，靠回枕头上，似乎在沉思着放在膝上的双手。

"You didn't have to fly down here. Doctor says I'll be fine," she says, quiet, yet firm. Her voice is rich, but there's age in it. A weariness that comes with getting older, I guess. Even though she's only 52.  
“你不必特意飞过来。医生说我没事的，”她轻声却坚定地说。她的声音浑厚，却带着岁月的痕迹。我想，那是随着年龄增长而来的疲惫。尽管她才 52 岁。

Something snares my shoulders, slipping inbetween my ribs and tugging me down to an anchor at the bottom of the world. "Little late for that," I say, so low my voice comes out scratchy.  
某种情绪攫住了我的肩膀，钻进我的肋骨之间，将我拽向世界的最深处。“现在说这个有点晚了，”我低声说道，声音沙哑。

She hums, but her lips don't move and for a moment her eyes close, finding the window again when she opens them.  
她轻哼着，但嘴唇并未动弹，片刻间双眼闭合，再次睁开时又找到了那扇窗。

"Talk to your father?" “和你父亲说话了？”

My right shoulder attempts a shrug. "He bought me a burger."  
我的右肩试图耸了耸。“他给我买了个汉堡。”

Her body barely moves as she huffs. _Sounds like him._ She seems to say.  
她的身体几乎不动，只是哼了一声。听起来像他。她似乎在说。

A brown, hard cover book sits in the chair my father was using earlier, the edges worn and frayed. There's no title or any outward markings. Next to my mother's bed is a bouquet of flowers, assorted in yellows and pinks and reds, a few dashes of purple here and there. I think about asking who got them for her, just to get her to say something.  
一把棕色硬皮书放在我父亲之前坐的椅子上，边缘磨损，毛边明显。没有标题或任何外部标记。我母亲床边有一束花，黄色、粉色和红色混杂，偶尔点缀几抹紫色。我想问她是谁送的花，只是为了让她说些什么。

I wish she'd be angry. I wish she'd yell at me – say something she knows'll piss me off and make me snap. I know that battlefield, it's familiar and I've fought it more times than I can count. Against that, my anger is justified. I don't know how to fight _this_. She's really dedicated to the act – so I have to be too. No matter what, I won't be the one that breaks anymore. To my left, on the wall just under the T.V. is a dry-erase board, marked with precise and sharp handwriting.  
我希望她能生气。我希望她能对我大喊大叫——说些她知道会激怒我、让我爆发的话。我知道那个战场，它很熟悉，我与之战斗的次数多到数不清。相比之下，我的愤怒是合理的。我不知道如何应对这种情况。她真的全身心投入了这个角色——所以我也不得不如此。无论如何，我不会再成为那个先崩溃的人。在我左边，电视下方的墙上挂着一块干擦板，上面用精确而锐利的笔迹标记着。

_Plan for the Day: 今日计划：_

_Tests/Procedures 检查/程序_

_Echocardiogram! 超声心动图！_

Next to it there's a little check mark.  
旁边有一个小小的勾选标记。

"It's so stupid," she says, just barely concealing the hurt beneath, hiding behind a hollow chuckle. "A heart attack..."  
“这太蠢了，”她说，勉强掩饰着下面的伤痛，躲在空洞的轻笑声后。“心脏病发作……”

My head swivels back to her, even though she still isn't looking at me. In my fantasies, I imagine that I say words that will cut and wound – puncture her so deep she cries and begs for my forgiveness. I dream that, for once, I get to hurt her just as much as she's hurt me. Standing here, watching it actually happen without having to say anything at all – just seeing her slowly crumble while I do nothing but look on in forced apathy.  
我的头转回她那边，尽管她仍然没有看我。在我的幻想中，我设想说出一些能刺痛和伤害她的话——深深刺穿她，让她哭泣并乞求我的原谅。我梦想着，就这一次，我能让她感受到她给我带来的同样多的痛苦。站在这里，看着这一切真的发生，而我却什么也没说——只是看着她慢慢崩溃，而我只能假装冷漠地旁观。

It makes me feel disgusting.  
这让我感到恶心。

She's trying so hard to not let me see, but she's fighting a frown and her eyes are glassy. A hand doesn't reach up to try and wipe them clear, my mother is too proud for that. Or maybe she just doesn't care anymore. She sniffs, nose now puffy and red. She's still staring off towards the window, just so she doesn't have to look at me. She's waiting for me to leave, like I always do.  
她努力不让我看到，但她正努力抑制着皱眉，眼睛也变得模糊。一只手没有抬起试图擦干它们，我的母亲太骄傲了，不会这样做。或者也许她已经不在乎了。她吸了吸鼻子，鼻子现在又红又肿。她仍然盯着窗外，只是为了不看着我。她在等我离开，就像我总是做的那样。

I try to swallow the brick in my throat, fighting a frown of my own. "I... I got bumped up a pay grade – earlier this year."  
我试图咽下喉咙里的那块砖，努力抑制自己的皱眉。“我……我今年提前晋升了工资等级。”

She sniffs again, wriggling to sit up straighter against the pillows. Her arms fold over her chest, bitterness creeping back into her expression, eyes resolutely turned to the floor. There's a chair in the left corner under the T.V., I drag it over and hunch forward by her bed with my elbows on my knees. A thumb swipes at the corners of my eyes, just to make sure there aren't any tears. She doesn't say anything, but she doesn't have to. Her pale sapphire eyes settle on me, so I continue.  
她再次抽了抽鼻子，扭动身体更笔直地靠着枕头坐起来。双臂交叉在胸前，苦涩再次爬上她的表情，眼睛坚决地转向地板。电视左下角有一把椅子，我把它拖过来，弯腰坐在她的床边，双肘撑在膝盖上。用拇指抹去眼角的泪水，只是为了确认没有眼泪。她什么也没说，但也不必说。她那淡蓝色的眼睛落在我身上，于是我继续说下去。

"Uh... Section Chief made me Department Manager. I– I can't really talk about the specifics. CIA stuff, and all that." I force a chuckle. It's hard to talk when an invisible vice is squeezing your windpipe shut. "Basically, I get ten-thousand more dollars a year for twice the workload."  
“呃...科长让我当部门经理了。我——我不能详细说。中情局的那些事。”我勉强笑了笑。当一个无形的钳子紧紧夹住你的气管时，说话变得很困难。“基本上，我每年多拿一万美元，工作量翻倍。”

I brace myself. I wait for her to reject me. A part of me wants her to, just so I can keep convincing myself that I hate her. Yet, no matter how much her words pummel me, or how many times I say it to myself, I don't think I'll ever be able to truly hate my mother.  
我做好准备。等待她拒绝我。我内心的一部分希望她这样做，这样我就可以继续说服自己恨她。然而，无论她的言语如何打击我，或者我对自己说多少次，我都不认为我能够真正恨我的母亲。

"Came all this way just to tell me that, hm?" she asks after a while, trying and failing to project a light tone.  
"大老远跑来就为了告诉我这个，嗯？" 她过了一会儿问道，试图用轻松的语气却未能成功。

A crooked smile quirks my lips. "Yeah. Mostly came for the hospital burgers, though."  
我嘴角勾起一抹歪斜的微笑。"是啊。不过主要是为了医院的汉堡来的。"

"You're such a pain," she says, and I think there's an endearment I've longed for there. She relaxes, resting her left hand on the bed with it overturned, fingers open.  
"你真是个麻烦，" 她说，我想那里藏着一份我渴望已久的温情。她放松下来，左手搁在翻倒的床上，手指张开。

Begrudgingly, my hand slides up to join hers. "So are you."  
不情愿地，我的手滑上去与她相握。“你也是。”

A smirk makes a chink in her armor. She squeezes my hand. "Guess you had to get it from somewhere. Couldn't have taken after your dad and been all quiet."  
她嘴角露出一丝得意的笑。她握紧我的手。“猜你总得从哪儿学来这些。没像你爸那样沉默寡言。”

I grunt, taking my hand away, folding my fingers together. I bite the inside of my cheek when I hear her sigh, the way she used to when I was being difficult as a child. I'm surprised when she doesn't start lecturing me about dad, like she always does, used to at least. Maybe she understands we're both pushing it even talking to one another right now.  
我咕哝一声，抽回手，手指交叠。听到她叹气，那熟悉的、像我小时候调皮时她常有的叹息声，我不禁咬了咬内颊。她没有像往常那样开始唠叨爸爸，这让我有些惊讶，至少以前她会这么做。也许她明白，我们现在能彼此交谈已经是在勉强了。

"So what'd the doctors say?" I ask, trying to get us as far away from the subject of my father as possible.  
"医生们怎么说？" 我问道，试图让我们远离我父亲的话题。

"I'll be out sometime tomorrow afternoon. It wasn't as bad as they first suspected. Likely stress induced."  
"我明天下午就能出院了。情况没有他们最初怀疑的那么严重。可能是压力引起的。"

Another forced laugh. "Couldn't _possibly_ be the cigarettes..."  
又是一声勉强的笑。"不可能是香烟的问题吧..."

"I quit two years ago, jerk," she says, though I imagine I hear warmth in it. Should I tell her that's not how cigarettes work? No, she's always been a little disgusted with the habit. I think she's trying to joke with me, anyway.  
"我两年前就戒了，混蛋，"她说，虽然我猜想我能从中听出一丝暖意。我该告诉她这不是抽烟的正确方式吗？不，她一直对这种习惯有点反感。我想她只是在试图和我开玩笑，无论如何。

We've never been very good at this part.  
我们从来都不擅长这部分。

She claws for a little more conversation, asking, "How long are you in town?"  
她试图再多聊几句，问道："你在城里待多久？"

"I put in for the next couple of days."  
"我申请了接下来几天的假期。"

"You should visit your Aunt Misato."  
"你应该去看看你姑姑美里。"

"I'm surprised she isn't here," I say, remembering whenever it used to get bad over at our third home up in Flagstaff, Misato would be there, sitting in the kitchen with my mom and a six pack or two. I haven't been back to Arizona since I stopped talking with my mother – which was when I started working with the CIA. I've talked with Misato a bit here and there online, but it's been just as long since I've seen her. It hits me now just how much I've missed her.  
"我有点惊讶她不在这里，" 我说，回想起每当我们在弗拉格斯塔夫的第三个家情况变得糟糕时，美里总会出现在厨房里，和我妈妈一起喝着一两打啤酒。自从我停止与母亲交流——也就是我开始为中央情报局工作的时候——我就再也没有回过亚利桑那州。虽然我在网上偶尔会和美里聊几句，但自从上次见面以来，时间也差不多一样长。现在我才意识到我有多么想念她。

"She was this morning," mom says, "had a shift at the bar this evening."  
“她今早还在，”妈妈说，“今晚在酒吧有班。”

I hum, the quiet blanketing over us again. I know we haven't really forgiven one another. This isn't really making amends. It won't be for either of us 'till someone mutters 'I'm sorry' – and that is something my mother will never do, no matter how wrong she is or how hurt I am over it. She's always right and I know deep down that it's going to be me that says it. I'm going to convince myself that I'm being mature, that I'm being the bigger person by sucking up my pride, while my mother gets to sit in the right.  
我轻声哼着，四周再次陷入静默。我知道我们并未真正原谅对方。这算不上真正的和解。对我们俩来说，除非有人低声说出“对不起”——而我母亲无论如何都不会这么做，无论她错得多离谱或我为此多受伤。她总是对的，我内心深处明白，最终说出口的会是我。我会说服自己这是成熟的表现，是我放下自尊、展现大度的方式，而母亲则可以安然坐在正确的一方。

That just makes me hate the idea of it even more. But that's just how things have always been between me and my mother, and it'll never change. I'll end up making some sort of personal vow later on. I'll swear that this is the last time I'll ever forgive her. One way or another, I always do.  
这让我更加厌恶这种局面。但这就是我和母亲之间一直以来的相处模式，永远不会改变。我会在心里暗自发誓，这将是最后一次原谅她。无论以何种方式，我总是会这么做。

"Well, I– um... I gotta' go." I stand, returning the chair to the corner. She doesn't protest, but her expression seems to ask me to stay longer. My headache is pulsing, driving huge, cracking fissures into my skull and ripping my brain in half. Didn't think I would need the pain meds. Feels like the tension here is starting to choke me.  
“呃，我...我得走了。”我站起身，把椅子放回角落。她没有反对，但她的表情似乎在请求我多留一会儿。我的头痛在跳动，像是要把我的头骨撕裂成巨大的裂缝，将我的大脑一分为二。没想到我会需要止痛药。这里的紧张气氛开始让我感到窒息。

I turn halfway, risking a glance up to that face that makes me feel so guilty. "I'll... I'll see you tomorrow."  
我半转过身，冒着风险抬头看向那张让我感到内疚的脸。“我...我明天再来看你。”

I step out of the room before she has time to say anything, or am I trying to leave before I realize she won't say what I want to hear? My father is sitting in one of the seats along the wall. I turn as his eyes catch me, trying not to break into a speed-walk as I march down the hall.  
我走出房间，没等她有机会说什么，还是说我在试图离开，以免意识到她不会说出我想听的话？我父亲坐在墙边的一个座位上。我转身时他的目光捕捉到了我，尽量不加快步伐，沿着走廊快步走去。

I take a bus to my hotel down West Saint Mary's road. A squat, three story building flanked by tall palm trees. My parents live just outside of Phoenix in Tucson and the whole place, like every other habitable settlement left in Arizona, gives off the feeling being stuck in the 1920s. No matter how many modern buildings crop up around the bigger cities, time has it at a stand still. Down the block there's the old Congress Hotel, big tourist attraction. Always packed with vacationers looking for a drink.  
我乘坐公交车沿着西圣玛丽路前往酒店。那是一栋矮小的三层建筑，两侧高耸着棕榈树。我的父母住在凤凰城外的图森，整个地方，就像亚利桑那州其他所有宜居的聚居地一样，给人一种停留在 20 世纪 20 年代的感觉。无论周边大城市建起多少现代建筑，时间仿佛在这里停滞不前。街区的另一头是古老的国会酒店，一个热门的旅游景点。总是挤满了寻找一杯酒的度假者。

The lobby of the cheap, sixty-five dollar a night InnSuites I'm staying at is uncomfortably quiet. The Colombian clerk looks up, mildly interested, before realizing it's a face he's seen before and putting on a polite smile. I shrug my coat off, draping it over an arm as I make my way to the second floor. The air is fresh, but not cold. I jab the key card in and push my shoulder against the heavy door. The only light is from the thin curtains, the smallest sliver left open. Everything else is neat and ordered, untouched. My suitcase stands vigilant by the air vent.  
我入住的这家每晚六十五美元的 InnSuites 酒店大堂异常安静。哥伦比亚籍的前台抬头看了看，略感兴趣，随即认出是我这张熟悉的面孔，便礼貌地笑了笑。我脱下外套，搭在手臂上，走向二楼。空气清新，但不冷。我插入房卡，用肩膀推开沉重的门。唯一的光线来自薄薄的窗帘，只留下一条细缝。其他一切都整洁有序，未曾动过。我的行李箱静静地立在通风口旁。

I toss my overcoat on the bed, which creaks as I plop down. Color swirls around my vision, electric fireflies buzzing about. I can't stop seeing my mother's face. That defeated look that finally shattered her mask, spinning up in my head over and over and over.  
我将大衣扔在床上，床板在我重重坐下时吱嘎作响。眼前色彩旋涡般流转，电光萤火虫般嗡嗡飞舞。我无法停止回想母亲的脸庞。那最终击碎她面具的挫败表情，一遍又一遍在我脑海中回旋。

Getting dizzy. Is it my anxiety or the pills wearing off? Can't be sure. I took more didn't I?  
感到头晕目眩。是焦虑发作还是药效消退？无法确定。我是不是又多吃了几片？

Something punches my stomach from the inside – and starts to rise.  
有什么东西从内部猛击我的胃——并开始上升。

I all but fall into the bathroom, spilling my guts and bits of burger into the toilet bowl. I'm exhausted before I even finish retching, only strength of will keeping me up at this point. The hot, sticky tar of bile burns my mouth and makes escaping the sour, rotting stench impossible.  
我几乎是跌进洗手间的，将胃里的东西和一些汉堡残渣吐进了马桶。还没吐完就已经筋疲力尽，全凭意志力支撑着不倒下。那滚烫、粘稠的胆汁灼烧着我的口腔，让我无法摆脱那股酸臭腐烂的气味。

I sit back against the wall, a hand weaving into my hair.  
我靠墙坐下，一只手插进头发里。

"What the fuck is wrong with me?"  
“我他妈到底怎么了？”

### Interlude II

"Your father was in a war a long time ago," my mother says, a cool evening breeze rushing through the trees above us. Our bare feet crunch along the white seashell riddled road as we walk hand-in-hand. I'm eight years old, keeping a sharp eye out for any of the bigger, curling snail shells to add to our collection in the garden at home. Even with the setting sun, it's too humid for anything else but a sleeveless T and shorts. For once, my mother has shed her business attire, settling for a shirt and capris.  
"你父亲很久以前参加过一场战争，" 妈妈说道，凉爽的晚风穿过我们头顶的树梢。我们赤脚走在满是白色贝壳的小路上，手牵手。我八岁，目光锐利地寻找着任何可以加入家中花园收藏的大卷螺壳。尽管夕阳西下，天气依然闷热，只适合穿无袖 T 恤和短裤。这一次，妈妈脱下了她的职业装，换上了一件衬衫和七分裤。

"Why?" I ask, looking up at her. She's staring down the jagged path, the wind upsetting her long hair.  
"为什么？" 我问，抬头看着她。她凝视着那条崎岖的小径，风吹乱了她的长发。

"To protect people," she says after a time.  
"为了保护人们，" 她过了一会儿回答道。

"From who?" "从谁那里？"

"Creatures we called Angels."  
"我们称之为天使的生物。"

"Like the ones from God?"  
"像上帝身边的那种吗？"

She smiles. "No. That's just what we called them."  
她微笑着说：“不，那只是我们怎么称呼它们。”

White from the street scuffs my feet, a big toe smacking into the edge of a curved carapace. I let go of her hand, fingers ripping at the dirt to free the snail shell jutting out of the sand, a crumbling monument to a long dead traveler. Mother bends her knees, helping me clear some of it away before I'm able to tug the artifact free. It's rough and gray on the outside, making wide spirals towards the top where the inside is as smooth as glass.  
街道上的尘土弄脏了我的脚，一个大脚趾撞到了一个弯曲的甲壳边缘。我松开了她的手，手指扒拉着泥土，试图从沙子中拔出那个突出的蜗牛壳，它像是一座早已逝去的旅人的风化纪念碑。母亲弯下膝盖，帮我清理掉一些沙土，直到我能将这件遗物拔出来。它外表粗糙灰暗，螺旋向上，内部却光滑如玻璃。

"Is that why dad acts crazy?" I ask, quieter than I mean to. She doesn't answer and stands. I bang the shell on the ground to jostle the dirt free. The rustling of the leaves whispers over us, a crane crying in the distance, my eyes finding the way back home. He used to walk with us, hawkish eyes finding the biggest shells while I could only ever stumble over them. He never laughed at me for it, tapping the shell on the concrete just right to get all the sand out without breaking it. We found a shell the size of his head once, and he held it up to my ear so I could listen to the crash of the ocean.  
"“这就是为什么爸爸行为古怪吗？”我小声问道，声音比我想象的要轻。她没有回答，只是站了起来。我用力敲打壳体，想把泥土震出来。树叶的沙沙声在我们周围低语，远处传来鹤的鸣叫，我的眼睛找到了回家的路。他曾经和我们一起散步，锐利的眼睛总能找到最大的壳，而我却总是被它们绊倒。他从没因此笑过我，只是恰到好处地敲打壳体，把沙子全部震出来而不损坏它。有一次，我们找到了一个和他头一样大的壳，他把壳举到我耳边，让我聆听海浪的轰鸣。”

"It's not his fault," mother says, a hand finding its way into my hair. "Your father loves you, Kazuya."  
"这不是他的错，" 妈妈说，一只手伸进了我的头发。"你爸爸爱你，和也。"

It didn't matter how many times she said it. Those words were always the greatest lie to me. If my dad loved me, he would get better. If he loved me, he wouldn't have dragged the war back with him. What my mother never told me was that she had been in a war a long time ago too. I found that out from Aunt Misato much later. In a quiet way, when one too many drinks had loosened her lips.  
无论她说多少次，这些话对我来说始终是最大的谎言。如果我爸爸爱我，他会好起来的。如果他爱我，他就不会把战争带回家。我妈妈从未告诉我的是，很久以前她也经历过战争。很久以后，我从美里阿姨那里得知了这一点。在一个安静的时刻，当她喝得太多，嘴巴松了。

I had caught on long before that, though. Mother would always worry where I was, fret over every little thing. Normal behavior for any mom most would say. From her, it was heightened somehow. I explored a lot, often without telling anyone where I was going or how long I'd be gone, and like any good adventurer I came home with a proud menagerie of scrapes and bruises. I can't count how many times she yelled at me or grounded me for it. "What were you thinking? Do you have any idea how worried I was? What if it had been more serious?" she would say, sounding furious, but with a scared look her eyes – like my dad.  
不过，我早就注意到了。妈妈总是担心我在哪里，对每一件小事都焦虑不安。大多数人会说，这是任何妈妈的正常行为。但从她那里，不知为何变得更加强烈。我经常不告诉任何人我去哪里或我会离开多久，像任何好的冒险家一样，我带着自豪的擦伤和瘀伤回家。我数不清她为此对我大喊大叫或禁足我多少次。"你当时在想什么？你知道我有多担心吗？如果情况更严重怎么办？"她会说，听起来很愤怒，但眼神中带着恐惧——就像我爸爸一样。

It was the scars that really made me wonder. Some had faded, while others dipped in shallow fissures, healed over with pale white skin. Most of them you couldn't see when she was dressed, but I'd gotten to know them whenever we went for a swim out in the pool or by the beach. They stretched over her stomach and reached up to her neck in ripping, jagged tears. I remember asking about them once and she made up some story about a car accident when she was younger. I'll probably never know what really caused them.  
真正让我感到好奇的是那些伤疤。有些已经淡去，而另一些则陷入了浅浅的裂缝，愈合后留下了苍白的皮肤。大多数时候，当她穿着衣服时，你根本看不到这些伤疤，但每当我们去游泳池或海边时，我就会注意到它们。它们横亘在她的腹部，一直延伸到颈部，形成撕裂般的锯齿状痕迹。我记得有一次问起这些伤疤的来历，她编了个故事，说是年轻时的一场车祸造成的。我可能永远也不会知道真正的原因。

Then there were the night terrors that lasted for days, sometimes weeks – usually after one of dad's episodes. A shriek would echo across the house, bolting me awake. I'd bury myself under the covers, eyes squeezed shut while I pressed the pillows over my head so I wouldn't have to hear her crying in the living room.  
然后就是那些持续数日甚至数周的夜惊，通常发生在爸爸发作之后。一声尖叫会在屋子里回荡，把我从睡梦中惊醒。我会把自己埋在被子下，紧闭双眼，用枕头压住头部，以免听到她在客厅里的哭泣声。

Other times, when she was quieter, my body could still sense it. My legs stung, muscles aching with a restless need to be elsewhere. It would be in the middle of the night, and I'd find her sitting on the couch in the illuminating glow of the television. It was too dark to really see the red around her eyes from rubbing them dry. I'd shuffle over and she'd bring me up between her legs and hold me close until we both fell asleep.  
有时，当她安静下来，我的身体仍能感受到那种不安。我的双腿刺痛，肌肉因渴望离开此地而隐隐作痛。常常是深夜时分，我会发现她坐在沙发上，电视机的荧光照亮她的身影。光线太暗，看不清她因揉搓而红肿的眼睛。我会悄悄走过去，她便将我揽入怀中，双腿夹着我，紧紧拥抱，直到我们双双入睡。

During the day, a collection of pills decorated our kitchen counter, stored in a plastic container with just the right amount for each day of the week. The words on the pill bottles next to it were long and nonsensical, to a kid at least. My father took at least seven a day. It wasn't long before mom started taking pills of her own. She'd scratch at the scars on her arms until they were angry and red, or grab at her left eye and hold her stomach, stifling pained grunts by biting the inside of her cheek.  
白天，厨房台面上摆放着一周剂量的药丸，整齐地装在一个塑料容器里。药瓶上的标签文字冗长且对小孩来说毫无意义。我父亲每天至少服用七粒。不久后，妈妈也开始服用自己的药丸。她会抓挠手臂上的伤疤，直到它们变得红肿刺痛，或是紧抓左眼，捂着肚子，咬紧脸颊内侧以压抑痛苦的呻吟。

I knew that, somehow, the Eva had done this to her too.  
我知道，不知怎的，Eva 也对她造成了这样的影响。

It was always the Eva.  
总是那个 Eva。

She tried hard to hide her nightmares from me, working 12 hour days so I wouldn't see just how much they wore her down. Leaving me at home with a father I had to worry might change because of a loud noise or the mere sight of blood. I used to hide in the closet and draw up plans of how I would escape my house if he ever came after me. I was terrified that one day mother would leave for work and never come back. I couldn't stand the thought of being left to face my father alone.  
她努力向我隐瞒她的噩梦，每天工作 12 小时，以免我看到它们对她造成的巨大影响。让我独自在家，面对一个可能因为一声巨响或仅仅是血的景象而改变的父亲。我曾躲在衣橱里，画出如果他来追我时如何逃离家的计划。我害怕有一天妈妈去上班后就再也不会回来。我无法忍受被留下独自面对父亲的想法。

Yet she always returned. It became a bit of a routine: She'd step through the door, set her briefcase down, take off the jacket of her suit and drape it over the backrest of the couch. Then it was a handful of pills and she was off to bed – though not before stopping by my room to kiss me goodnight. If I was still awake, I'd beg her to stay – and she would silently oblige, lying with me until I fell asleep.  
然而她总是回来。这逐渐变成了一种惯例：她会走进门，放下公文包，脱下西装外套，搭在沙发背上。然后是一把药片，她就上床睡觉了——尽管在此之前会来我的房间亲吻我晚安。如果我还没睡，我会求她留下——她会默默地答应，躺在我身边直到我入睡。

"Don't leave me," I'd say. "Promise you won't ever leave me."  
"别离开我，"我会说，"答应我你永远不会离开我。"

She never promised. But she never left, either.  
她从未承诺过。但她也没有离开过。

### Chapter 3: November 29

_An ocean of golden grass ripples around a white house with a black shingled roof. There's a man in the doorway, with a face that echoes the youth of an older and jaded man with haunting blue eyes.  
一片金黄的草海在白色房屋周围泛起波澜，屋顶覆盖着黑色木瓦。门口站着一个人，他的面容映射出一个年长而疲惫的男人，拥有一双令人难忘的蓝色眼睛。_

_"Dad?" I ask, stumbling forward in a body I don't remember being so little. My father smiles and it's warm and full of pride. A giant shadow falls over us and the house bursts in a storm of splinters and dust. They bite and dig into my skin, a hand too big for anything in this world digging into the dirt inches from me. The thing hunches over the ruins of my home, sharp, soulless eyes staring down at me, its mouth stuck in a rictus grin.  
“爸爸？”我试探地问道，踉跄着向前，感觉这副身体变得如此陌生。父亲微笑着，温暖而充满自豪。巨大的阴影笼罩了我们，房屋在一阵木屑和尘土的风暴中崩塌。碎片刺入我的皮肤，一只不属于这个世界的巨手在离我几英寸的泥土中挖掘。那东西弯腰俯视着我家废墟，尖锐、无魂的眼睛盯着我，嘴角挂着僵硬的狞笑。_

_The giant shadow takes my father in one of its massive hands – joints crunching and muscles groaning as it stands. Those eyes, red eyes, glow brighter with anticipation, saliva spilling free as its teeth part_ _– and it chomps down on him with a wet crunch._  
巨大的阴影用它那庞大的手抓住了我的父亲——关节嘎吱作响，肌肉在站立时发出呻吟。那双红色的眼睛因期待而更加明亮，唾液随着牙齿的分开而溢出——它带着湿漉漉的碎裂声咬住了他。

Everything stops with the sound of distant traffic, heavy eyelids trying to open.  
一切随着远处交通的喧嚣声而静止，沉重的眼皮试图睁开。

There's a bed under me. The field is gone. The shadow is gone. I know, somewhere in the back of my mind, that this is right and real. My brain can't quite seem to convince my heart of that, which is certain it can escape if it beats fast enough.  
我身下有一张床。田野消失了。阴影也消失了。我内心深处某个角落知道这是对的，是真实的。但我的大脑似乎无法说服我的心，它坚信只要跳得足够快就能逃脱。

I imagine that if someone had launched a thousand pound anvil on me from orbit, it would feel a lot like this. The thought almost makes me laugh and I mutter something into my pillow, the light stabbing into my hotel room is just so bright and... there. Too much light. I groan, making an attempt at sitting up. My brain, despite the bolt-gun headache, is trying to run and process about a million different things I'm not awake enough for. Wearing too many clothes. Shoes are still on. Covers on the floor. When and why did I crank the A/C down to 68?  
我想象如果有人从轨道上向我发射了一千磅的铁砧，那感觉大概就是这样。这个念头几乎让我笑出声来，我对着枕头喃喃自语，酒店房间里的光线刺眼得让人难以忍受……太亮了。我呻吟着，试图坐起来。尽管头痛欲裂，我的大脑仍在努力处理那些我尚未清醒到足以应对的无数事情。穿了太多衣服。鞋子还穿着。被子掉在地上。我什么时候把空调调到了 68 度？

There are proper words for this sort of thing, but I don't have them. What was it mom used to call it? _Einen kater haben_? _Katzenjammer_? Can't remember, it was for hangovers anyway. I don't think I did any drinking last night, but this feels very reminiscent of those rum and tequila driven escapades in dingy apartments or smoke-filled night clubs.  
这种事有专门的词汇，但我一时想不起来。妈妈以前是怎么称呼它的？Einen kater haben？Katzenjammer？记不清了，反正都是用来形容宿醉的。我不记得昨晚有喝酒，但这种感觉让我回想起那些在昏暗公寓或烟雾缭绕的夜店里，被朗姆酒和龙舌兰支配的疯狂夜晚。

Phone. 手机。

I glance to the nightstand, and sure enough it's sitting just where I left it. The digital clock reads 9:54. I struggle to sit at the edge of the bed, rubbing my eyes so everything stops blurring together. Dreams of nourishment and hydration seem all the more real now.  
我瞥向床头柜，果然它就放在我昨晚放置的地方。电子钟显示 9:54。我挣扎着坐到床边，揉揉眼睛，试图让视线不再模糊。梦中的滋养和补水此刻显得愈发真实。

**Phone**. My brain shouts this time. I don't know why, but I panic. I snatch it from the nightstand and flick it on. There are thirty-one missed calls and half as many text messages. All of them from Marina.  
电话。这次我的大脑喊了出来。我不知道为什么，但我慌了。我从床头柜上抓起手机，啪地打开。有三十一个未接来电和同样数量的短信。全都是玛丽娜打来的。

Fuck, I was supposed to call her last night.  
该死，我昨晚本该给她打电话的。

"Jesus Christ..." I sigh. Who the hell calls somebody thirty-one times? If I didn't answer the first two times, what makes the other twenty-nine consecutive calls more likely? But that's Marina. I don't read the texts or listen to the seven voice mails. I already know what they say. I stare down at my phone for a while, giving in and dialing her number. No sense in putting it off, she'll just be twice as pissed and try calling me when I really don't want to talk.  
“天哪……”我叹了口气。谁会连续打三十一次电话啊？如果我前两次没接，那接下来的二十九次又有什么意义呢？但这就是玛丽娜。我没有读那些短信，也没有听那七个语音留言。我已经知道它们会说些什么。我盯着手机看了一会儿，最终还是拨了她的号码。拖着没用，她只会更生气，然后在我真的不想说话的时候打给我。

The ringer purrs once, then clicks– "Hello?"  
铃声响了一声，随后咔哒一声——“喂？”

I try and smile. "Hey, sweetheart."  
我试着微笑。“嘿，亲爱的。”

"Thanks for answering my calls, asshole."  
“谢谢你接我电话，混蛋。”

I sigh before I can think to hold it in, dropping all hopes of us having a normal, loving conversation. "I was asleep."  
我不由自主地叹了口气，放弃了我们能进行一场正常、温馨对话的所有希望。“我刚才睡着了。”

"So why didn't you call me before you went to bed?"  
“那你为什么睡觉前不给我打电话？”

"I was really tired, and I forgot. I'm sorry."  
“我真的很累，忘记了。对不起。”

A pause, resignation in her voice as she says, "No you're not."  
她顿了顿，语气中带着无奈：“不，你不是。”

"I am. I was just... dealing with a lot yesterday," I say. It isn't like she doesn't know why I'm down here. But I have to be calm, I have to be patient. If I call her out or accuse her of acting childish, well, that'll pretty much guarantee a steady flow of texts about how I'm a lousy boyfriend and that I don't actually care about her for the next two days. She doesn't respond though, just making me sit here, listening to the soft whisper of her breathing on the other end before the tension sends my nerves skyrocketing. "Look, I don't know what you want me to say – I'm sorry you couldn't go more than sixteen hours without a goddamn phone call."  
“我是。我只是……昨天有很多事要处理，”我说。她不可能不知道我为什么在这里。但我必须保持冷静，必须有耐心。如果我指责她或说她幼稚，那几乎可以肯定接下来两天她会不停地发信息说我是个糟糕的男朋友，根本不在乎她。她没有回应，只是让我坐在这里，听着电话那头她轻柔的呼吸声，紧张感让我的神经紧绷到极点。“听着，我不知道你想让我说什么——抱歉你连十六个小时都忍不住不打电话。”

The phone clicks as she hangs up.  
电话在她挂断时发出咔嗒声。

She _knows_ that just pisses me off.  
她知道这只会让我恼火。

A moment later I get a text message that reads: jerk :(  
片刻后，我收到一条短信，内容是：混蛋 :(

I consider ignoring her, again. I also realize that's just avoiding the inevitable, so I spend the next thirty minutes trading texts with her. She lets the accusations fly, a prosecutor putting me on trial while I scramble to form a defense. I shouldn't even have to be going through this crap with her. Still, I tell her I love her, that I need her. I try to make her understand. She never does, but like always, after I've groveled enough, she accepts my apology in her typical standoffish way. I promise to call her tonight.  
我考虑再次无视她。同时我也意识到这只是逃避现实，于是接下来的三十分钟里，我与她互发短信。她像检察官一样对我提出指控，让我忙于辩护。我本不该和她经历这些破事。尽管如此，我还是告诉她我爱她，我需要她。我试图让她理解。她从未真正理解，但像往常一样，在我足够卑微之后，她以她典型的冷淡方式接受了我的道歉。我承诺今晚给她打电话。

This is all just a part of the routine, and we'll wind up doing the same thing again next week.  
这一切不过是例行公事，下周我们又会重复同样的事情。

I shower and dress, business attire left behind for the most part. It's chilly outside, but not enough to warrant the thick, weighty overcoat I arrived in. So I throw on one of my old jackets from home. Olive green military wear, the outside made up of some kind of cotton and nylon blend. Can't really say for sure. The lining is pure cotton though, fuzzy and warm as hell.  
我洗了个澡，换上衣服，大部分时间都把正装抛在脑后。外面很冷，但还不至于需要我那件厚重的毛呢大衣。于是我穿上了一件旧夹克，橄榄绿的军装风格，外面是某种棉和尼龙的混纺材质，具体说不准。但内衬是纯棉的，毛茸茸的，暖和极了。

Before heading out, I take stock. Mood stabilizers, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and anti-nightmare pills, the last of which I apparently forgot to take. It's a nice little collection I've got. I _do_ take one of the stabilizers, pocketing the anxiety meds just in case. The bottle feels lighter than I would like.  
出门前，我检查了一下药品。情绪稳定剂、抗抑郁药、抗焦虑药和抗噩梦药，最后那种我显然忘了吃。我有一小堆不错的药。我吃了一颗稳定剂，把抗焦虑药装进口袋以防万一。药瓶感觉比我希望的要轻。

Aunt Misato probably still lives at the same house out in the Catalina Foothills. Mostly gated communities with big, ritzy homes separated by acres of cacti, shrubs and bushy heads of grass. Sunlight touches the rolling mountains in the distance, still creeping upon the city down in the valley. Patches of white cover the red dirt and layer the rooftops.  
米佐阿姨可能还住在卡塔利娜山麓的那栋房子里。这里大多是带有大门的高档社区，宏伟的豪宅之间隔着数英亩的仙人掌、灌木和茂密的草丛。阳光轻抚着远处的连绵山脉，缓缓蔓延至山谷中的城市。红色的泥土上点缀着片片白色，覆盖在屋顶之上。

I arrive at a house fashioned in the Spanish style typical of south Arizona, though there's a Japanese garden I don't remember being there. I wonder if she's finally feeling homesick.  
我来到一栋典型的南亚利桑那西班牙风格住宅前，尽管那里有一个我不记得存在的日式花园。我在想，她是否终于开始想家了。

The woman who answers the door is wearing a black turtleneck, an amber colored drink in her right hand. The sour scent of Whiskey swirls into my nose and gives my stomach flashbacks of being twelve and vomiting on her carpet. The color in her hair has faded, though there isn't a touch of gray in it. She's got it tied back in a loose tail, which hugs her neck and drapes over her left shoulder. Her laugh lines are more pronounced than the memory in my head and the wrinkles around her eyes are deeper. Still, she doesn't look a day over fifty.  
开门的女人身穿黑色高领衫，右手端着一杯琥珀色的饮料。威士忌的酸涩气息扑鼻而来，让我胃里一阵翻腾，仿佛回到了十二岁那年在她地毯上呕吐的情景。她头发的颜色已经褪去，却没有一丝灰白。她将头发松松地束成马尾，紧贴着颈部，垂落在左肩上。她眼角的笑纹比记忆中更为明显，眼周的皱纹也更深了。不过，她看起来依然不过五十岁左右。

"Well, well, Kazuya Langley Soryu," she says. Her neutral expression comes so easily, giving nothing away. She leans against the door frame, ice bouncing in her glass. "You've got a lot of nerve showing your face at my door."  
“哎呀，这不是和也·兰利·索吕荣吗，”她说道。她那波澜不惊的表情如此自然，丝毫不露声色。她斜靠在门框上，玻璃杯中的冰块叮当作响。“你还真有胆量出现在我家门口。”

My teeth clench. "It's been a long time."  
我咬紧牙关。“好久不见。”

She folds her arms, one under the other, holding my gaze. I won't break, though.  
她双臂交叉，一手搭在另一手上，目光紧锁着我。但我不会退缩。

I see her bite the inside of her cheeks. Something that might be a laugh trembles in my sternum. Dammit, _no_. Keep it together Kazuya. A stifled chuckle coughs at the back of her throat, though she manages to keep a straight face.  
我看到她咬住了脸颊内侧。我的胸骨处似乎颤动着一丝可能是笑声的东西。该死，不。保持住，和也。尽管她努力保持面无表情，但还是忍不住从喉咙后部发出了一声闷笑。

I can't take it anymore.  
我再也忍不住了。

My lips twitch – and I laugh.  
我的嘴角抽动——然后我笑了出来。

She can't keep it in either, smiling wide. "Oh, my Kazu!" she sings, wrapping her arms around me, a kiss smacking my cheek. My face hurts from muscles that have forgotten how to grin.  
她也忍不住，笑容满面。“哦，我的和津！”她唱道，双臂环抱住我，一个吻啪地落在我的脸颊上。我的脸因久未笑过的肌肉而感到疼痛。

"You've gotten so tall!" she says, beaming. I don't have the heart to tell her it's the boots. "And what's all this, hm?" she asks, fingers scratching the stubble growing along my chin. "You're such a handsome boy without all this scruff."  
“你长这么高了！”她笑着说。我没忍心告诉她这是靴子的功劳。“这些都是什么呀，嗯？”她问，手指轻挠着我下巴上新长的胡茬。“没有这些胡渣，你可是个帅小伙呢。”

"Alright, _mom_." “好吧，妈妈。”

She clicks her tongue, smacking my chest. "Oh, shut up." she sips her whiskey and saunters back down the hall. I shamble inside, closing the door and sliding out of my boots.  
她咂了咂舌，拍了拍我的胸口。“哦，闭嘴。”她抿了一口威士忌，悠闲地踱回走廊。我拖着脚步进屋，关上门，脱下靴子。

"How's your mama?" she calls from the kitchen. "You went to see her, right?"  
“你妈妈怎么样？”她在厨房喊道。“你去看了她，对吧？”

"Of course I did," I holler back, shrugging my jacket off and picking one of the two white couches to plop down in. The living room is wide and open, the sun coming in from the windows making the place glow, with a little help from the crackling fireplace. On the mantle piece, set against black velvet, are an array of medals and commendations from her time in the military, namely a Colonel's badge. I think she retired from the Army maybe a decade ago, though I know for sure she was stationed at the Air Force base in Tucson five years before that.  
“当然去了，”我大声回应，脱下外套，选了其中一张白色沙发坐下。客厅宽敞明亮，阳光透过窗户洒进来，加上壁炉里噼啪作响的火光，让整个地方显得格外温馨。壁炉架上，摆放在黑色天鹅绒上的是她军旅生涯中获得的一系列勋章和嘉奖，其中最显眼的是一枚上校徽章。我想她大概十年前从陆军退役，不过我确切知道的是，五年前她曾在图森的空军基地驻扎。

Nearby, there's a picture with a much younger Misato in it. She stands on the left, long hair, aviator sunglasses sitting on her head. Next to her is a much taller man, hair a mess, clothes baggy, sporting a toothy grin. On the far right is a blonde girl with a shy, but guarded sort of look, a smile playing on her lips. None of them could've been older than twenty. I can't help but wonder, as I always have, who the other two people are.  
附近有一张照片，上面是年轻许多的美里。她站在左边，长发飘飘，飞行员太阳镜架在头顶。旁边是一个高得多的男人，头发凌乱，衣着宽松，露出一口白牙的笑容。最右边是一个金发女孩，带着羞涩却又戒备的神情，嘴角挂着微笑。他们都不可能超过二十岁。我不禁像往常一样好奇，另外两个人是谁。

Misato comes back with a few beer bottles pinched in her fingers. I relieve her of one, the others clacking down on the glass coffee table.  
美里用手指夹着几瓶啤酒回来了。我帮她拿了一瓶，其他的则咔嗒一声放在玻璃咖啡桌上。

She sits next to me, an arm draping over the backrest. "Such a nice boy coming to visit your old Aunt."  
她坐在我旁边，一只手臂搭在靠背上。“这么好的孩子来看望你老姑姑。”

I scoff. "Old? Please, I'm sure you're a regular cougar down at the bar."  
我嗤之以鼻。“老？拜托，我敢打赌你在酒吧里绝对是只常驻的猎豹。”

"Flatterer. Ladies love sweet talkers." she winks and takes a sip of whiskey. "How's your girlfriend?"  
“油嘴滑舌。女士们都喜欢甜言蜜语。”她眨了眨眼，抿了一口威士忌。“你女朋友怎么样？”

"She's fine," I say, thankful I've gotten so good at faking smiles. I pop the cap off the beer bottle and take a long drink. The label has a simple blue moon on the front, _Morimoto_ sitting across the bottom.  
“她很好，”我说，庆幸自己已经擅长伪装笑容。我打开啤酒瓶盖，深深喝了一口。瓶标上简单地印着一轮蓝月，底部坐着森本。

"How long are you staying?"  
"你要待多久？"

"Next day or so." "大概明天吧。"

She makes a face and pinches my arm. "And you're lodged up at some hotel? You could've stayed here a few days for free."  
她做了个鬼脸，捏了捏我的手臂。“然后你就住在某个酒店？你本来可以免费在这里住几天的。”

"I didn't want to impose."  
"我不想打扰。"

"Bullshit. You didn't seem to mind when you were little and out causin' trouble."  
"胡说。你小时候惹麻烦的时候可没见你介意过。"

The rest of the conversation goes on much the same and I work my way through a few more beers. We catch one another up on recent events. It feels good to just... talk. I learn that Sakura is finally getting married _–_ off to some British sailor stationed in Hakodate. Which means I won't have to hear Yuki rant about all the scumbags she's always dating. Good news in my book. I also find out that Kodama's son was killed earlier this year when his chopper went down in Bosnia. I didn't really know him beyond a handful of encounters. The Suzahara brothers must be hurting over a lost cousin, though. Especially after losing Hiro to an IED in Turkey two years ago. It puts a bit of a dampener on our reunion, but there's plenty of other light-hearted talk to share about friends and family we haven't seen in ages.  
接下来的对话大致如此，我喝了几瓶啤酒。我们互相更新了近况。感觉很好，只是...聊聊。我得知樱终于要结婚了——嫁给一个驻扎在函馆的英国水手。这意味着我不用再听由纪抱怨她总是交往的那些人渣了。对我来说是个好消息。我还了解到今年早些时候，儿玉的儿子在波斯尼亚的直升机坠毁事故中丧生。我与他只有几次短暂的接触。不过须原兄弟肯定因为失去表亲而难过，尤其是两年前浩在土耳其被 IED 炸死后。这给我们的重聚蒙上了一层阴影，但还有很多轻松的话题可以聊，关于那些我们多年未见的朋友和家人。

I can't help but feel there's something superficial about it all. I think my Aunt's just stalling a bit for my sake. I know she's glad to see me, just as much as I am to see her. There's just something on her mind, however, and I can see it lurking under the surface. My Aunt doesn't dance around touchy subjects, not elegantly, at least.  
我不禁觉得这一切有些肤浅。我想阿姨只是为了我而稍作拖延。我知道她见到我很高兴，就像我见到她一样。只是她心里有事，我能看出那潜藏的忧虑。我阿姨从不绕弯子谈论敏感话题，至少不那么优雅。

That feeling in my gut proves true as her posture changes, the formalities dispensed with. "Kazu, honey, we need to talk."  
那种直觉果然应验了，她的姿态变了，客套话也省了。“和也，亲爱的，我们需要谈谈。”

It reminds me in an instant that this is the woman who served with the old JSSDF and sat up with NERV's top brass during the Angel War before Japan was blown to hell. Even now, she sits like military, legs crossed and back straight. Relaxed, still-fifteen-at-heart-Misato isn't here anymore, replaced by a no-nonsense Army officer. It's always scared me how easily she's able to make that shift.  
这让我立刻想起，这位女士曾在旧日本自卫队服役，在日本被炸成地狱之前，她还与 NERV 的高层一起熬过了使徒战争。即便现在，她坐得也像军人一样，双腿交叉，背挺得笔直。那个放松、内心依然十五岁的美里已经不在了，取而代之的是一位严肃的陆军军官。她能如此轻易地完成这种转变，总是让我感到害怕。

"What about, Colonel?" I ask.  
"关于什么，上校？" 我问道。

She fixes me with a calculating stare. "This little grudge match you've got going on."  
她用一种算计的眼神盯着我。"这场小小的恩怨对决。"

For a minute, I wonder how much she actually knows about it. Considering how close she is with my parents, probably everything.  
有那么一会儿，我好奇她到底知道多少。考虑到她与我父母的关系如此密切，很可能一切都知道。

"Me and mom made up already." Can't quite manage to pull off that lie. "... Sort of."  
"我和妈妈已经和好了。" 这谎话怎么也说不圆。"...算是吧。"

A thin eyebrow rises. "Yeah? For how long? Once these two days are up, you're going to fly back to Washington and act like nothing happened, right?"  
她微微挑起眉毛。"是吗？能维持多久？这两天一过，你就要飞回华盛顿，当作什么都没发生过，对吧？"

There's no accusation in her voice, and I think that's the worst part. It's the same resignation I got from Marina earlier this morning. It's much harder to take from Misato though.  
她的语气里没有指责，我想这才是最糟糕的部分。就像今早玛丽娜表现出的那种无奈。但从美里那里感受到的，却更难以承受。

"We're better off this way. Me and my dad don't get along and I don't see eye to eye with my mom on much of anything these days... at least we're kind of talking now." even as I say it, I'm not sure whether or not I like the idea, or if I believe it will last. For the past eight years I've held on to that resentment towards her, and maybe to a lesser, more resolute extent, my father. It feels wrong to let go after all of that.  
"这样对我们更好。我和我爸合不来，最近也几乎和妈妈没什么共识...至少我们现在开始有点交流了。" 尽管我这么说，我并不确定自己是否喜欢这个想法，或者是否相信它会持久。过去八年来，我一直对她怀有怨恨，也许程度稍轻但同样坚定地，对父亲也是如此。在经历了这一切之后放手，感觉很不对。

Misato gently twirls her drink, watching the ice spin. "Every family has their little tiffs."  
美里轻轻旋转着她的饮料，看着冰块旋转。"每个家庭都有他们的小争执。"

"We're not exactly 'every' family."  
"我们并不算是'普通'家庭。"

She glances up with an impish smirk. "You think I don't remember the scrawny teen who'd show up at my doorstep every other night because he didn't want to stay at his own house? Hell, your dad wasn't much older when I took him in too."  
她抬头望来，嘴角挂着一丝调皮的笑意。“你以为我不记得那个瘦弱的少年每隔一晚就出现在我家门口，因为他不想待在自己家里？见鬼，你爸当年被我收留时也差不多大。”

"I'm nothing like him," I snap. Misato doesn't so much as flinch at the outburst, that practiced disinterest coming back again. She looks to a painting across the way, amber touching her lips. The glass is nearly empty. The fire snaps, filling the silence for us.  
“我和他完全不同。”我厉声反驳。美里对这突如其来的爆发毫不动容，那种习以为常的漠然再次浮现。她望向对面的一幅画，琥珀色的液体轻触她的唇边。杯中的酒几乎见底。壁炉中的火焰噼啪作响，为我们填补了沉默。

"I used to hate my dad, too," she says, grimacing at her cup. "He was almost always at work, and when he was home, he and my mother would find something to fight about. Until they finally got divorced when I was thirteen. I spent a long time resenting him for all of it. Then Second Impact happened, and he was gone... I've always regretted never giving us that chance to be closer."  
“我也曾恨过我爸，”她皱眉看着杯子说道，“他几乎总是在工作，而当他回家时，他和妈妈总能找到争吵的理由。直到我十三岁那年他们终于离婚。我花了很长时间怨恨他的一切。然后第二次冲击发生了，他就这样离开了...我始终后悔没能给我们一个机会，让我们更亲近。”

The couch isn't so comfortable anymore. I stand, wandering over to the mantelpiece again, inspecting each of the campaign ribbons and commendations. I hear her joints click as she walks back into the kitchen, footfalls soft on the tile. I glance to find her tugging the top off of a square bottle, tipping the neck into her glass. The liquid flows like molten gold, and she plops another ice cube in.  
沙发不再那么舒适了。我起身，再次踱步到壁炉架前，仔细端详着每一枚战役勋带和嘉奖状。我听到她走进厨房时关节的咔嗒声，脚步在瓷砖上轻柔。我瞥了一眼，看到她正拧开一个方形瓶子的盖子，将瓶口倾斜倒入杯中。液体如熔金般流淌，她又丢入一块冰块。

"It might feel good to cut them out of your life now," she pauses for a long swig, "but when everything is said and done, they're still your parents, and that's something you'll never get away from."  
“现在把他们从生活中剔除或许感觉不错，”她停顿了一下，喝了一大口，“但当一切尘埃落定，他们依旧是你的父母，这是你永远无法摆脱的。”

I want to tell her she's wrong. She didn't grow up in that house with my father. I love my Aunt Misato, but she just doesn't understand.  
我想告诉她她错了。她没有在我父亲身边的那所房子里长大。我爱我的阿姨美里，但她就是不理解。

"Who are they?" I ask, nudging a hand at the picture as she meanders back over. A softer, nostalgic smile graces her lips and for a second she actually looks her age.  
"他们是谁？" 我问道，用手指轻轻推了推照片，她漫步回到我身边。她的唇边浮现出一丝柔和、怀旧的微笑，有那么一瞬间，她看起来就像她的实际年龄。

"That's Ryoji Kaji and Ritsuko Akagi. We all went to Tokyo University together."  
"那是加持良治和赤木律子。我们都在东京大学一起读书。"

Akagi rings a few bells, though I can't remember from where. "Do you keep in contact?" I ask, making my bottle a little lighter.  
赤木这个名字听起来有些耳熟，但我记不清在哪里听过。"你还和他们保持联系吗？" 我问道，同时让我的酒瓶减轻了一些重量。

She shakes her head. "No. Kaji was killed before Third Impact... and Ritsuko never came back."  
她摇了摇头。“不，加持在第三次冲击前就遇害了……而律子再也没有回来。”

The beer sloshing down my throat turns to sulfur, a metallic taste worming into my gut and eating me from the inside. All I wanted to do was change the subject. Selfish. Before I can feel much guilt over it, she goes from dower to chipper in a snap and I have trouble telling if it's genuine when she starts talking about her college days. The biggest smiles spread across her face whenever she mentions Kaji, though. How they met in college, and how he was the most infuriating man she'd ever met.  
啤酒滑过喉咙，却化作硫磺，一股金属味在腹中蔓延，从内而外蚕食着我。我本只想换个话题，自私至极。还没来得及感到太多愧疚，她已从阴郁转为欢快，我难以分辨她的兴奋是否真实，当她开始谈论大学时光。每当提及加持，她的脸上总会绽放出最灿烂的笑容。他们如何在大学相遇，以及他是她遇到过的最令人恼火的男人。

We share a few more drinks and shoot some pool. There's mention of Macedonia on the news and Misato talks about the ops she ran back in Austria and Greece during the Union Wars in Eastern Europe.  
我们又喝了几杯，打了会儿台球。新闻中提到马其顿时，美里谈起了她在奥地利和希腊参与的东欧联盟战争中的行动。

After two hours and my sixth beer, I find I'm pushing the limit of how long I can put off leaving. "Well, I think I've got to be heading out. Told mom I'd visit her again today."  
两小时过去，第六杯啤酒下肚，我发现自己拖延离去的极限已到。“好吧，我想我得走了。告诉过妈妈今天会再去看看她。”

"Uh-huh. More likely you got sick of losing," she says, putting up her cue. I huff, grabbing my jacket from the living room and she walks with me down the hall to the front of the house, though I don't notice she's stopped halfway until I open the door. There's a hard look in her eyes, and something that might be uncertainty.  
“嗯哼。更可能是你厌倦了输，”她说着架起球杆。我哼了一声，从客厅抓起外套，她陪我走到走廊尽头，直到我开门时才发现她半途停下了。她眼神坚定，似乎还带着一丝不确定。

"Hey, be honest with me..." she pauses, nibbling at the inside of her lower lip, "when did you get diagnosed with secondary PTSD?"  
“嘿，跟我说实话……”她顿了顿，轻咬下唇内侧，“你是什么时候被诊断出继发性创伤后应激障碍的？”

I don't ask how she knows. I decide not to take offense to the intrusion in my private life, either. It probably made her feel better just being able to keep an eye on me these past few years.  
我不问她是怎么知道的。我也决定不因她干涉我的私生活而感到冒犯。过去几年里，能一直关注我，可能也让她感觉好些。

"When I was twenty-three, I think. That was after a slew of misdiagnosis and at least seven different therapists."  
“我想是二十三岁那年。在那之前经历了多次误诊，至少换了七个不同的治疗师。”

"How long have you been going?"  
“你已经持续多久了？”

I shrug. "On and off for five years, but it never really works out. Half of them didn't believe the shit I talked about, anyway. So I stopped going."  
我耸耸肩。“断断续续五年了，但总是没什么效果。他们中有一半人根本不信我说的那些事。所以我就不去了。”

Cold spills in from outsides, a light breeze swirling it around my arms and neck. She has more to say, and I'm not sure I want to be around to hear it. I'm ashamed enough at the admittance to therapy. I never thought I was the one that needed it.  
寒气从外面渗入，一阵轻风将其卷绕在我的手臂和脖颈上。她还有话要说，而我并不确定自己是否想留下来听。承认自己需要接受治疗已经让我感到足够羞愧了。我从未想过自己会是需要治疗的那个人。

Misato steps closer, arms folded over her chest. "I want you to promise me something."  
美里走近一步，双臂交叉在胸前。“我想让你答应我一件事。”

"What?" "什么？"

"If you can't be bothered to visit your parents unless one of them is dying," she gives me a wink and a wan smirk, just so I don't take the jibe too seriously, "at least call home every once in a while from now on, yeah?"  
"如果你不是因为其中一个快不行了才懒得去看望父母，" 她朝我眨了眨眼，露出一丝苍白的微笑，以免我过于认真对待这番挖苦，"至少从现在开始，偶尔打个电话回家，好吗？"

I sigh, but nod. "Alright... I promise."  
我叹了口气，但还是点了点头。 "好吧... 我答应你。"

She pulls me into a hug. "That's my boy. Don't be a stranger, hm?"  
她把我拉进一个拥抱。 "这才是我的好孩子。别变得陌生了，嗯？"

I almost wish I didn't care so much about my Aunt, that way I could make empty promises and never have to deal with my parents again, at least outside of the expected holidays and well wishes. She'll never let me live it down if I don't at least make the attempt. Just the thought of it is riddling me with guilt. I'm on speaking terms with my mother now, so I suppose I've already taken a step in the right direction. As far as forced small talk can be considered 'speaking terms'.  
我几乎希望自己不在乎姨妈，那样我就可以随意许下空洞的承诺，再也不必与父母打交道，至少在预期的节日和祝福之外。如果我不至少尝试一下，她永远不会让我忘记这件事。光是想到这一点，我就感到内疚不已。我现在和母亲能说上话了，所以我想我已经朝着正确的方向迈出了一步。尽管这种被迫的闲聊可以被视为‘能说上话’。

At the bus stop outside, the air is frigid and sunlight splashes over the mountains, but brings no warmth down to dusty Arizona.  
在外的公交车站，空气寒冷刺骨，阳光洒在山脉上，却未给尘土飞扬的亚利桑那带来一丝温暖。

### Interlude III

The whispers rise to shouts, echoing upstairs to my bedroom. Blinking, sleep clinging to my eyelids, I strain to listen. I can't hear them very well through the door and I think they're trying to be quiet. Throwing the covers off, I find them down in the kitchen. Mom is holding something and yelling at dad, it looks like a pill bottle. He's sitting at the table, head clasped in his hands while his fingers dig into his hair.  
低语声逐渐变成了喊叫，回荡在楼上我的卧室里。我眨了眨眼，睡意还黏在眼皮上，努力倾听。隔着门听不太清楚，我想他们可能是想保持安静。我掀开被子，发现他们在楼下的厨房里。妈妈手里拿着什么东西，对着爸爸大喊大叫，看起来像是一个药瓶。他坐在桌旁，双手紧握着头，手指插进头发里。

Then he starts to yell back, stands up, sweeps the plates and a vase off the table – a hundred shards of glass scattering across the floor. His eyes are wide and frenzied, like when he has one of his episodes, except now there's rage in them and the veins in his arms tighten as his hands ball into fists. Their voices are thundering off the walls and ringing in my ears.  
然后他开始回吼，站起身来，将盘子和一个花瓶从桌上扫落——上百片玻璃碎片散落一地。他的眼睛睁得大大的，狂乱无章，就像他发作时那样，只是现在眼中充满了愤怒，手臂上的青筋紧绷，双手握成了拳头。他们的声音在墙壁间轰鸣，震得我耳朵嗡嗡作响。

My mother doesn't back down and I wonder if dad might finally snap and hit her like I always think he will.  
我妈妈没有退缩，我怀疑爸爸这次会不会真的失控，像我总担心他会做的那样，对她动手。

He just keeps shouting that he's going to leave, that he's going to kill himself so she won't have to deal with him anymore. I hear keys jingle as he storms off down the hall, the front door squealing and then whacking shut. My mother isn't far behind. Peering down the hall, I see her throw the door open, standing at the threshold screaming, "Shinji!" just as his car peels off down the road. A growl grinds through her teeth and she slams the door.  
他不停地吼着要离开，说要自杀，这样她就不用再应付他了。我听到钥匙叮当作响，他怒气冲冲地沿着走廊离开，前门吱吱作响，然后砰的一声关上。我母亲紧随其后。我探头望向走廊，看到她猛地推开门，站在门槛上尖叫着：“真嗣！”就在他的车疾驰而去时。她咬牙切齿地发出低吼，然后用力甩上了门。

I slink back upstairs, grabbing my cellphone and slipping a pair of shoes on, no time for socks. I creep downstairs, passing by the kitchen. Something stops me cold: the sight of my mother at the table, back to me and face in her hands, oddly mimicking my father only minutes ago. The shattered plates lie at her feet, and a blackness forming in my lungs makes me feel just as broken. My body flinches. I imagine that I sit down next to her, hug her, maybe try to make her feel better, I don't know – _something_.  
我悄悄回到楼上，抓起手机，匆匆穿上鞋子，没时间穿袜子。我蹑手蹑脚地下楼，经过厨房。眼前的一幕让我愣住了：母亲坐在桌前，背对着我，双手捂着脸，奇怪地模仿着几分钟前的父亲。破碎的盘子散落在她脚边，我感到胸中涌起一股黑沉沉的压抑，仿佛自己也支离破碎。我的身体不由自主地颤抖了一下。我幻想着自己坐到她身边，拥抱她，也许试着让她感觉好些，我不知道——做点什么。

A frown tugs at my face, an unseen barrier keeping me from entering the light of the kitchen. Just the idea of it terrifies me. There's nothing I can do, nothing I'll ever be able to do. All I know is that I don't want to be here – I _can't_ be here, especially not when my dad gets back. I don't want to watch him walk through that door, looking worn and exhausted. A sad, sniveling wreck of person. A lost little _child_. I don't want to watch as mom touches her head to his and they hold each other for a long while. Because she _always_ forgives him, one way or another.  
眉头不由自主地皱起，一道无形的屏障阻隔我进入厨房的光明。光是这个念头就让我恐惧不已。我无能为力，也永远无法改变什么。我只知道我不想待在这里——我不能待在这里，尤其是当爸爸回来的时候。我不想看到他穿过那扇门，显得疲惫不堪。一个悲伤、啜泣的可怜人。一个迷失的孩子。我不想看到妈妈将头靠在他肩上，他们长久地相拥。因为她总是以某种方式原谅他。

It makes me sick. 这让我感到恶心。

He's threatened to kill himself a few times before. As I sneak out the back door, I hope he goes through with it this time. Even as I think it, wish it with all the malice in my heart, I don't know what I'll do if he actually doesn't come home. If he kills himself, if he mans up and just leaves us alone, maybe me and mom can be happy. To me, an eleven year old boy growing up with a father who can't forget, it's as sound a solution as any other.  
他之前威胁过几次要自杀。当我悄悄从后门溜走时，我希望他这次真的会这么做。尽管我心中满怀恶意地希望着，但若他真的没有回家，若他自杀了，若他鼓起勇气独自离开，也许我和妈妈就能幸福。对于一个十一岁男孩来说，成长在一个无法忘却过去的父亲身边，这似乎是一个合理的解决方案。

So why do I dread the thought of him never returning?  
那么，为何想到他可能永不归来，我会如此恐惧？

I head south down Campbell Avenue at a run, slowing to a jog when I think the house is far enough behind. I haven't packed anything, a little foolish in retrospect, but I just needed to get out of that house, if only for a little while. I needed to get away.  
我沿着坎贝尔大道向南奔跑，觉得距离足够远时才放慢脚步改为慢跑。我什么也没收拾，事后回想有点愚蠢，但我当时就是迫切需要离开那个家，哪怕只是暂时逃离。我需要远离。

A few porch lights illuminate Aunt Misato's villa, which isn't quite as large and grand as the other luxury homes in Catalina, but definitely more comfortable than the run-down shacks in Panama. I knock on the wooden frame of the double doors, hoping she's still up. Peering through the panes of cloudy glass, I can't make out any lights and, for a moment, feel a little guilty. Maybe I should've called ahead. What if she doesn't hear the knocking? Should I ring the doorbell?  
几盏门廊灯照亮了美里阿姨的别墅，虽然不及卡塔利娜其他豪宅那般宏伟，但比起巴拿马那些破旧的小屋，无疑舒适得多。我敲了敲双开门的木框，希望她还没睡。透过模糊的玻璃窗，我看不到任何灯光，那一刻感到有些内疚。或许我应该提前打电话。万一她没听到敲门声怎么办？我是不是该按门铃？

_Stupid, what are you even doing out here?  
傻瓜，你在这儿干嘛呢？_

A glow snaps to life in the hall, a blurry figure growing bigger in the world behind the doors. She pauses, likely peering through the little eye hole higher up. She's still rubbing sleep from her eyes when the door creaks open, garbed in baggy pink pants and a yellow top, hair disheveled on one side.  
走廊里突然亮起一束光，门后的世界中一个模糊的身影逐渐变大。她停下脚步，很可能是在透过上方的小窥视孔往外看。当门吱呀一声打开时，她还在揉着惺忪的睡眼，穿着宽松的粉色裤子，黄色上衣，一侧头发凌乱。

Seeing me, her brain kicks into overdrive – very awake and very concerned. "Hey, what's wrong kiddo?"  
看到我，她的脑子立刻高速运转起来——非常清醒，也非常担心。“嘿，怎么了，小家伙？”

"Nothing," I blurt, wincing. "It's just... uh, can I... stay here tonight?"  
"没什么，" 我脱口而出，皱了皱眉。"只是...呃，我今晚能...留在这里吗？"

She blinks, perplexion sitting on her brow. "How come?"  
她眨了眨眼，困惑的神情浮现在眉间。"怎么突然这样问？"

"I just... don't want to be home, right now," I say, trying to sound nonchalant, like this is something every kid asks their Aunt so abruptly in the night.  
"我只是...现在不想回家，" 我说道，尽量显得漫不经心，仿佛每个孩子都会在夜里突然向姑姑提出这样的请求。"

A few heartbeats go by with the nighttime breeze and Misato steps aside, nodding me in. She doesn't question why I'm dressed like I just hopped out of bed, why I'm wearing shoes without socks, or what I'm doing at her door at midnight. She just smiles and tells me to make myself at home, offers me soda and snacks while I get comfortable on her couch.  
几下心跳间，夜风轻拂，Misato 侧身让开，点头示意我进去。她没有问我为何穿着刚从床上跳起来的样子，为何没穿袜子就套着鞋子，或是为何午夜时分出现在她门前。她只是微笑着让我自便，递给我汽水和零食，让我在她沙发上舒舒服服地坐下。

She sets me up with pillows and blankets until I've got a cocoon of cotton and silk, stocked with more sugar-blasted treats than I know what to do with. She hops down next to me, wriggling to get comfy as she folds her legs. We stay up well into the night watching whatever happens to be on TV, mostly cartoons and stuff with a guy who has an oil-painted mustache. It didn't really matter what we watched, because I had Misato there laughing next to me. I can forget for a little while that my parents fight. Everything is normal here, everything is warm and right. I'd stay here forever if I could.  
她为我铺上枕头和毯子，直到我被棉丝交织的茧包裹，里面堆满了多得不知如何处理的甜食。她跳到我旁边，蜷起双腿，扭动着找了个舒服的姿势。我们熬夜看起了电视上随机播放的节目，大多是卡通和一些有油彩胡子的男人的东西。其实看什么并不重要，因为 Misato 就在我身边笑。我可以暂时忘记父母间的争吵。这里一切都正常，一切都温暖而美好。如果能永远留在这里，我愿意。

The next morning comes all too soon.  
次日清晨，来得太快了。

At some point, Misato must have texted my parents about where I was. Mom comes to get me, scolding me just for making her worry. Misato talks her down, makes up a few lies, and I'm saved from a month of being grounded. Just like that. As I follow mom out to the car, my Aunt gives me a wink and a little smile.  
不知何时，美里一定给爸妈发了短信告诉他们我在哪儿。妈妈来接我，光是让她担心就挨了一顿训。美里安抚了她，编了几个谎话，我就这样逃过了一个月的禁闭。就这么简单。当我跟着妈妈走向车子时，阿姨冲我眨了眨眼，露出一丝微笑。

From then on, I knew I finally had someone on my side. When things got hard at home, I could just stay over at Aunt Misato's. She never asked questions, never tried to pry where it wasn't wanted. If I _did_ want to talk about it, I would, and she'd sit and listen. If not, she didn't push for explanations or throw halfhearted advice at me. We'd stay up until five in the morning watching horror flicks or one of those old black and white comedies depending on her mood. She'd let me take sips from her beers and laugh when I made a face.  
从那时起，我知道我终于有了一个支持我的人。当家里情况变得艰难时，我可以直接去美里阿姨家过夜。她从不问东问西，也不试图探听不想说的事。如果我想谈，我会开口，她会坐下来倾听。如果不想，她也不会逼我解释或给我半吊子的建议。我们会熬夜到凌晨五点，看恐怖片或那些老黑白喜剧，看她的心情。她让我从她的啤酒里喝几口，看我皱眉头时哈哈大笑。

She spoiled me rotten and loved every minute of it. Now that I'm older, I think she always secretly wanted a child, but I was as close to the real thing as she was willing, or able, to get. That suited us both just fine. She was my best friend.  
她把我宠坏了，而且乐在其中。现在我长大了，我想她一直暗暗想要个孩子，但我已经是她愿意或能够接受的最近似真实的存在了。这对我们俩都刚刚好。她是我最好的朋友。

Back when I was still just a baby, Japan – as a nation – didn't really exist anymore. It would be a long while before it reached any semblance of a unified people again. So the Japanese that had been moved to the States after Third Impact tried to stick together and keep their disjointed culture alive, save for my parents. They were all too eager to separate themselves from the small patches of community that cropped up all along the East Coast. So one of the few truly Japanese people I knew growing up was Misato. I have a handful of fuzzy too-young-to-remember-anything memories of a woman who always smiled and laughed with me, speaking indistinct words in a soft, motherly tone.  
在我还是个婴儿的时候，日本作为一个国家已经不复存在。要等到它再次形成一个统一民族，还需要很长一段时间。因此，那些在第三次冲击后移居美国的日本人试图团结在一起，维系他们支离破碎的文化，除了我的父母。他们急于与东海岸各地涌现的小社区划清界限。所以，我童年时真正认识的日本人之一就是美里。我有一些模糊的、太年轻以至于记不清任何事情的记忆，那是一个总是对我微笑和欢笑的女人，用柔和、慈母般的语调说着含糊不清的话语。

Mom and dad were actually the ones who christened her Aunt Misato for me. She and my father were close when he was younger, so she was practically family. She wasn't state-side a whole lot, usually out on deployment. She'd call when she could and I was always the first one to answer the phone when it rang, just in case it was her.  
实际上，是我父母给我起了个称呼，叫她美里阿姨。她和父亲年轻时关系亲密，所以她几乎算是家人。她不常在美国，通常在外执行任务。她会尽可能打电话回来，而我总是第一个接电话的人，生怕是她打来的。

Every Thursday the mail came and I'd be racing home from the bus stop to check the mailbox for one of her letters. She'd send me envelopes packed with little odds and ends from the places she visited, a few photographs shipped with them. They were always signed: _to my dearest honey_ and punctuated with a small pen-drawn heart at the end.  
每个星期四，邮件会送到，我总是从公交车站飞奔回家，查看邮箱里是否有她的来信。她会寄给我装满她所到之处的小物件和几张照片的信封。信的结尾总是写着：给我的最亲爱的宝贝，并附上一颗小小的笔绘心形。

I still have a picture of her somewhere in full battledress, desert camo kit and a bandana to cover her hair. She's sitting in a dusty, sand-riddled barracks, an M-16 between her legs and a big smile on her face.  
我至今还保留着一张她的照片，她身着全套战斗装备，沙漠迷彩服，头戴头巾。她坐在满是尘土、沙粒的营房里，腿间放着一把 M-16 步枪，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。

Right around the time I was ten, she was discharged and decided to move out to Arizona with us. I was probably pretty lucky to have her around when I did. In middle school I was a bit of a delinquent, to put it lightly. The teachers had my mom's number on speed dial. I was suspended from school at least three times, nearly expelled five, had detention most days out of the week, and received countless scathing reprimands that would put even the nastiest drill sergeant to shame.  
就在我十岁左右的时候，她退役了，决定搬到亚利桑那州和我们一起生活。那时有她在身边，我可能算是相当幸运的。中学时期，我有点儿叛逆，说得委婉些。老师们几乎随时都能拨通我妈妈的电话。我至少被停学三次，差点被开除五次，每周大部分时间都在留校察看，还收到了无数严厉的训斥，连最严厉的教官都会自愧不如。

It was part of the reason I usually ended up at Misato's. Some days I wouldn't even go home. I'd send mom a text, tell her where I would be that night and pretend I didn't have parents for a while. It was a refuge from that other life at home. Mom couldn't do much to fight it either. Misato wielded this power when it came to her, this impenetrable air of authority, like no one I'd ever seen. It both amazed and terrified me. All the same, it was nice having someone to protect me. Someone who understood me in a way my parents, teachers and handful of rotten friends simply couldn't.  
这正是我常去美里家的原因之一。有些日子我甚至不回家，只给妈妈发条短信，告诉她我那晚会在哪里，然后假装自己没有父母一段时间。那是逃离家庭生活的避风港。妈妈对此也无能为力。美里在面对她时，有着一种我从未见过的、坚不可摧的权威气场，这既让我惊叹又让我害怕。尽管如此，有人保护的感觉还是很不错的。有人以一种我的父母、老师和少数几个糟糕的朋友无法理解的方式理解我。

Despite all the bad memories I have of Tucson, I took a lot of good ones from that house in Catalina.  
尽管我对图森有许多不好的回忆，但我在卡塔利娜的那栋房子里也留下了许多美好的记忆。

When I was twelve, it was decided in my mind that I was old enough to try more than just the cheap malt beers Misato kept stocked in the fridge. It was that gold stuff that came in oddly shaped bottles. Her favorite was the Canadian Whiskey, Crown Royal I think. At least it was the brand I saw the most of, so to my twelve year old psyche, it must have been _awesome_.  
十二岁那年，我心里认定自己已经足够成熟，可以尝试不仅仅是美里冰箱里常备的廉价麦芽啤酒。那是一种装在奇形怪状瓶子里的金色酒，她最喜欢的是加拿大威士忌，我想是皇冠威士忌。至少这是我最常看到的品牌，所以在十二岁的我看来，它一定很棒。

When I asked, she chuckled and handed me her glass. "You won't like it," she warned with a knowing smile.  
当我询问时，她轻笑一声，把她的杯子递给了我。“你不会喜欢的，”她带着会心的微笑警告道。

Proud, arrogant, in the prime of my youth, I scoffed. It was colored rich and vibrant amber – there was no way it could be anything but the softest and sweetest of juices.  
那时的我骄傲自大，正值青春年华，不屑一顾。那液体色泽丰富而鲜亮，呈现出浓郁的琥珀色——不可能是别的，只能是口感最柔和、味道最甜美的果汁。

I was sick for the rest of the night. She didn't complain or say 'I told you so'. She just took care of me, like she always did. I've had plenty of hard liquor since then, but haven't touched Whiskey once, much to my Aunt's boundless mirth.  
那一整晚我都感到不适。她没有抱怨，也没有说“我早就告诉过你”。她只是像往常一样照顾我。自那以后，我喝过不少烈酒，但再也没有碰过威士忌，这让我的阿姨乐不可支。

### Chapter 4: November 29 (II)

It's gotten much harder to see the red scar in the sky. Almost impossible to catch at night depending on where the moon is. There are pictures of it back when it was a huge, gaping wound in the stars. Mom used to tell me she could see it even during the day when she was younger. With so many returnees, it began to shrink until it was but a sliver that could only be seen from Earth certain times of the year.  
那道红色的天空疤痕已经变得难以辨认。夜晚几乎无法捕捉到它的踪迹，这取决于月亮的位置。曾经有照片记录下它那巨大、星空中裂开的伤口模样。妈妈过去常告诉我，她年轻时甚至在白天都能看到它。随着众多归乡者的到来，它开始逐渐缩小，直到一年中某些时候从地球上才能瞥见那细如发丝的一线。

It awes me, more so now than when I was a kid. I wonder what kind of war could suck up an entire world full of people and turn them into a floating mass of liquid. What must it be like up there? How do people come back from that? The worst part is that I'm sure some of it is common knowledge to most people by now. Second and Third Impacts are apart of the regular school curriculum, covered briefly and in a very broad sense. Still, the events are so heavily ingrained in the post-Third Impact psyche that, no matter how much anyone would like to forget, it's become an irreplaceable part of the culture. To the younger generation, who have been officially dubbed the Partial Generation, there's a strong disconnect from the Impact Generations that many try to patch up through one of the dozens of religions spawned in the aftermath of Third Impact.  
这让我感到震撼，尤其是现在比小时候更甚。我想知道什么样的战争能吞噬一整个世界的人，将他们变成漂浮的液体团块。那上面会是什么样子？人们又是如何从中恢复的？最糟糕的是，我确信现在大多数人对此都有所耳闻。第二次和第三次冲击已成为学校常规课程的一部分，虽只是简略提及，广义上涵盖。然而，这些事件深深烙印在第三次冲击后的心理中，无论人们多么想遗忘，它们已成为文化中不可替代的一部分。对于那些正式被称为“部分世代”的年轻一代，与“冲击世代”之间存在强烈的脱节，许多人试图通过第三次冲击后产生的数十种宗教之一来弥合这种差距。

I'm sure there are entire sessions in college classes that discuss it in depth. Long lectures on Metaphysics, its development in pre-Second Impact and the studies carried out afterwards. I never went. I didn't want anything to do with the Impacts and the Angel War.  
我敢肯定，大学课堂上会有整节课程深入讨论这个问题。关于形而上学的长篇大论，它在第二次冲击前的演变以及随后的研究。我从未参与过。我不想与冲击和使徒战争有任何瓜葛。

I still don't. 我至今依然如此。

The bus jostles, roaring as we make a wide left turn. My view of the sky is blocked by the buildings along either side of the road. It's too bright out to see the scar anyway and the nights come too early in winter to even catch a glimpse of it.  
公交车颠簸着，咆哮着向左急转弯。两侧的建筑挡住了我看向天空的视线。外面太亮了，根本看不清那道疤痕，而且冬天的夜晚来得太早，连瞥一眼的机会都没有。

My right hand is fiddling with the scruff on my chin and I'm all of a sudden very aware of how grungy it makes me look. I regret not shaving before coming to visit mom–  
我的右手不停地摩挲着下巴上的胡茬，突然间我非常意识到这让我看起来有多邋遢。我后悔没有刮胡子就来探望妈妈——

I force my hand down against an armrest. _It's been eight years since you've seen her, what do you care?_  
我用力把手压在扶手上。你已经八年没见过她了，有什么好在乎的？

Except that I _do_ care. A lot – and all we did was mumble a few words to one another. That's not fair goddammit.  
只是我确实在乎。非常在乎——而我们只是彼此咕哝了几句。这不公平，该死的。

A flash of red moves in the corner of my eye and a shriek of laughter echoes down the aisle. A child sits in his mother's lap. She whispers and the boy grins, saying something that makes her giggle and hug him tighter.  
一抹红色在我眼角闪过，一阵尖笑声沿着过道回荡。一个孩子坐在他母亲的腿上。她低语着，男孩咧嘴一笑，说了些什么让她咯咯笑起来，更紧地抱住了他。

_I'm seven or maybe eight. Knuckles drunkenly fight sleep from my eyes as I stagger into the kitchen, throat aching for water. I know I've come out here for something else though, something I can sense without even realizing it.  
我七岁，或许八岁。拳头迷迷糊糊地与睡意搏斗，我蹒跚走进厨房，喉咙干渴难耐。但我知道我出来这里是为了别的东西，某种我虽未意识到却能感知到的东西。_

_The lights are already on and I watch my mother toss a pair of tablets in her mouth. She downs half a glass of water, gasping for air and slumping forward a bit on the counter. She looks exhausted.  
灯光已经亮起，我看着母亲将一对药片扔进嘴里。她一口气喝下半杯水，喘着气，身体微微前倾靠在台面上。她看起来疲惫不堪。_

_"Mom?" I ask, brain not yet awake enough to distinguish between reality and dream.  
“妈妈？”我问道，大脑还未完全清醒，分不清现实与梦境。_

_She turns and her expression warms. "Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing up, hm?" she says, coming over to sit down at the kitchen table. Her elbows rest on her knees, hands splayed out to me. I touch them with my much smaller pair.  
她转过身来，表情变得温和。“嘿，亲爱的。你怎么醒了，嗯？”她说着，走过来坐在餐桌旁。她的手肘撑在膝盖上，双手向我张开。我用我那双小得多的手触碰着她的。_

_"Are your scars hurting?"  
"你的伤疤疼吗？"_

_"No," she lies. I take one of her arms, turning it over so I can see the thin, discolored lines. I touch them, tracing the one that starts at her middle finger, dips into her palm and stretches all the way up to her elbow. Smaller ones crisscross over her wrists.  
"不疼，" 她撒谎道。我握住她的一只手臂，翻转过来以便看清那些细长、褪色的痕迹。我轻触它们，沿着从她中指开始，深入掌心并一直延伸到肘部的疤痕。更细小的疤痕在她手腕上交错纵横。_

_"How do I fix them?" I ask.  
"我该怎么修复它们？" 我问道。_

_She smiles. "You don't fix scars, honey." she takes me up in her arms and sits me in her lap. A tune starts to hum from her throat, soft and light. It's one I've heard before, though I can't remember the words she used to sing. They were in a language I couldn't understand, or maybe I was just too young to comprehend them.  
她微笑着说：“亲爱的，伤疤是无法修复的。”她将我抱起，让我坐在她的腿上。她的喉咙里开始哼起一首轻柔的曲调，是我曾听过的，虽然我记不清她唱的歌词。那些词是用一种我无法理解的语言，或者也许是我当时太年幼，无法领会。_

_At some point I lean against her chest, not quite awake, but unable to fall asleep. My eyes find another scar that reaches up from under her shirt and claws along her neck. I think about her leaning over the counter and how red her eyes looked.  
不知何时，我靠在她的胸前，半醒半睡，却难以入眠。我的目光落在她衬衫下延伸至脖颈的另一道伤疤上。我想起她俯身在柜台前的样子，她的眼睛看起来那么红。_

_Absently, I touch the pale tear on her collar bone. "Do they make you sad?"  
我漫不经心地触摸着她锁骨上那道苍白的疤痕，问道：“它们会让你感到悲伤吗？”_

_She stops humming and I feel her smirk more than I see it. "Never... 'cause you know what your mama thinks about when she starts to feel sad?" she leans her head a bit to catch my eyes.  
她停止了哼唱，我感觉到她的笑意多于看到。“从不……因为你知道你妈妈开始感到悲伤时会想什么吗？”她微微侧头，试图捕捉我的目光。_

_"What?" "什么？"_

_She giggles. "You," she says, nuzzling her nose against mine and making me laugh.  
她咯咯笑了起来。“你，”她说着，用鼻子蹭了蹭我的鼻子，逗得我也笑了起来。_

_"Du bist meine herz und seele."  
“你是我的心与魂。”_

The brakes squeal and my vision comes back to focus as we pull into the drop-off. The hospital is towering over us and my gut drops. Disembarking, I spend the next five minutes leaning against the walls next to the entrance's automatic doors, staring down at the pill bottle in my hand. The room upstairs was such an easy thing to face earlier today and at Misato's. The comfort I felt being there is a distant dream now, snatched away and consumed beneath this monolith of reality.  
刹车尖叫着，我们的车驶入下客区，我的视线重新聚焦。医院高耸在我们上方，我的胃一阵下沉。下车后，我靠在入口自动门旁的墙上，接下来的五分钟里，我低头凝视着手中的药瓶。今天早些时候和在美里那里，面对楼上的房间是那么容易。那种身处其中的安慰感如今已成遥远的梦境，被现实这座巨塔夺走并吞噬。

What if he's there? How am I supposed to deal with him this time? A frown comes uninvited and I take my second anxiety pill for the day. The smells of bleach and a few other nose-burning chemicals I can't name flare to prominence as I step inside. It's a short journey up to the third floor.  
如果他在那里怎么办？这次我该怎么面对他？一个皱眉不请自来，我服下了今天的第二颗抗焦虑药。一进门，漂白剂和其他几种我叫不出名字的刺鼻化学品气味就变得格外突出。上到三楼的路程很短。

I'm really starting to hate this door.  
我开始真的讨厌这扇门了。

The world stops working when I see that blue jacket again. My father is sitting on the side of her bed, back facing me. His eyes come around to pierce me and I don't know why that makes my blood boil. He pushes himself off, leaving the hospital room without a word or another look. My shoulders fall and I release a breath I didn't realize I was holding.  
当我再次看到那件蓝色夹克时，世界仿佛停止了运转。父亲坐在她床边，背对着我。他的目光转过来刺向我，我不知道为什么这让我怒火中烧。他站起身，一言不发地离开了病房，没有再看一眼。我的肩膀垂了下来，吐出一口我未曾意识到自己一直屏住的气。

She looks better than yesterday. I'm not sure how to explain it, alive I guess. Even in a hospital bed, hooked up to these machines, she holds herself like royalty. It's... good to see her that way again, even if she's also wearing a disheartened kind of expression. The mother I met yesterday was the shell of a woman I've never seen before, not even in her worst moments. She's got her hair tied back messy, sitting with her back straight and hands in her lap. The right hand sits atop the other, where a simple golden band wraps around her ring finger.  
她看起来比昨天好多了。我不知道该怎么解释，大概是更有生气了吧。即便躺在医院的病床上，连接着这些机器，她依然保持着一种王室般的姿态。看到她这样，真是……令人欣慰，尽管她的脸上也带着一种沮丧的表情。昨天我见到的母亲，是我从未见过的她的空壳，即使在最糟糕的时刻也没有过。她的头发凌乱地扎在脑后，背挺得笔直，双手放在膝上。右手叠在左手上，无名指上戴着一枚简单的金戒指。

My hands find their way into jacket pockets and I take a few steps closer. "Hey."  
我的手不自觉地伸进了夹克口袋，向前走了几步。“嘿。”

She gives me a wan smile. "Hey."  
她给了我一个苍白的微笑。“嘿。”

Her voice is stronger today too, rich with that slightly lower pitch women adopt as they get older. Those bright blue eyes glance towards the door to her room and I wonder if she'll try to bring dad up this time. Just because we've traded emails once or twice does _not_ mean I want to talk to him. A sigh puffs free as I pull up the same chair from yesterday. Nicotine greets my nostrils, sparking a thousand different memories, too many for my brain to bother reliving all at once. They're probably not all that fond, yet they fill me with a longing for the home I left behind a long time ago. She may have quit two years ago, but it's going to be a while before she stops smelling like cigarettes.  
她的声音今天也更有力了，带着随着年龄增长而略微降低的音调。那双明亮的蓝眼睛瞥向她房间的门，我猜想她这次是否会提起爸爸。仅仅因为我们通过几次电子邮件并不意味着我想和他交谈。我叹了口气，拉过昨天那把椅子。尼古丁的气息扑鼻而来，勾起了成千上万个不同的记忆，太多以至于我的大脑无法一次性全部重温。它们可能并不都是美好的，但它们让我对很久以前离开的家充满了渴望。她可能在两年前就戒烟了，但她身上还会长时间保留着香烟的味道。

My nose twitches. "Well, when are they releasing you?"  
我鼻子动了动。“那么，他们什么时候让你出院？”

"Four o'clock." “四点钟。”

Either we're getting worse at this communicating thing or she's trying to figure out how best to insert my father into the conversation. Seems like a risky move. We just started sitting in the same room again.  
要么是我们沟通能力越来越差，要么是她正琢磨着怎么巧妙地把父亲扯进话题。这招看起来挺冒险的。我们才刚重新开始坐在同一间屋里。

She won't have time to wriggle him in if I keep talking. "Did you hear about Sakura?"  
如果我一直说话，她就找不到机会把他扯进来了。“你听说小樱的事了吗？”

I take a moment to mentally flog myself. Stupid question, of course she has. Mom nods anyway, gives me an odd look though. "Is that..." she reaches over and pinches the cloth on my shoulders. "Yeah, that's your dad's jacket."  
我花了一会儿时间在心里痛骂自己。愚蠢的问题，她当然有。妈妈还是点了点头，不过给了我一个奇怪的眼神。“那是……”她伸手捏了捏我肩上的布料。“是啊，那是你爸爸的夹克。”

_Dammit. 该死。_

"Huh?" I look down to the off-color square where her fingers are, a few threads left as a reminder of the old Japanese flag patch that was ripped off – long before I got my hands on it. All that's really left is a silver rank insignia on the left shoulder: a single bar with a star above it. I think it means Lieutenant or something like that. "I thought this was Aunt Misato's?"  
“嗯？”我低头看向她手指所在的那块颜色不同的方形区域，几根线头作为旧日本国旗徽章被撕掉的提醒——那是在我拿到它之前很久的事了。现在真正剩下的只有左肩上的一个银色军衔徽章：一根横杠上面有一颗星。我想那意味着中尉之类的。“我以为这是美里阿姨的？”

Mom shakes her head. "Was, a long time ago. She gave it to your dad before we had you. You used to like to wear it when he was out of town," a smile quirks her lips. "Curl up in bed and fall asleep with it."  
妈妈摇了摇头。“那是好久以前的事了。在我们有你之前，她把它给了你爸爸。你以前喜欢在他出差时戴着它，”她嘴角微微上扬，“蜷缩在床上，枕着它入睡。”

"I don't remember that..." the admittance startles me, kicks me in the chest. I sit back, brow scrunched, as I try to summon the memory. It just... isn't there. All I have are the moments he's yelled at us, threatened to kill himself or broken down crying in my mother's arms. There are a few glimmers of light, here and there. Times when I was able to forget the pardoned war criminal and just have a father. They're chipped and frayed though, faded and dim against the dark that eats away at the edges.  
“我不记得了……”这个承认让我自己都吃了一惊，仿佛胸口被猛踢了一脚。我向后靠去，眉头紧锁，试图唤起那段记忆。但它就是……不在那里。我所有的记忆都是他冲我们大吼大叫，威胁要自杀，或是在妈妈怀里崩溃哭泣的片段。偶尔也有几缕光亮，零星的时刻我能忘记那个被赦免的战犯，只拥有一个父亲的身份。但这些记忆都已支离破碎，黯淡无光，被黑暗蚕食着边缘。

I must be looking at her like she's crazy, because her expression falls away to something guarded, gaze fixed on her hands. "He's gotten better," she says, fiddling with her ring. "Less medication. More therapy."  
我一定是以看疯子的眼神看着她，因为她的表情变得警觉起来，目光固定在双手上。“他现在好多了，”她摆弄着戒指说，“减少了药物，增加了治疗。”

My teeth set on edge and I can't even stand to look at her. The chair creaks as I lean back, taking a deep breath in through my nose and letting it out slowly. There's a nice view of Tucson from the window, flanked all around by small mountains ranges, the city itself such a modest little collection of buildings compared to the sprawling old-world majesty of D.C.  
我的牙齿咬得咯咯作响，甚至无法忍受看她一眼。我向后靠在椅子上，椅子吱吱作响，深吸一口气，然后缓缓呼出。从窗户望出去，图森的景色尽收眼底，四周群山环抱，这座城市与华盛顿那古老而宏伟的广阔景象相比，只是一小簇不起眼的建筑。

Time stretches, what feels like an hour passing between the second-long reports from the EKG. After a few minutes, I think I'm able to talk without sounding bitter. "Why now? Why not back then?"  
时间仿佛被拉长，心电图每秒一次的报告间似乎过去了整整一个小时。几分钟后，我想我能开口说话而不显得苦涩了。“为什么是现在？为什么不是那时候？”

Mother scoffs, though it's hollow. "It wasn't that easy, especially for us... even after the trials... it took us a long time to get back on our feet."  
母亲嗤之以鼻，尽管这声音空洞无力。“没那么简单，尤其是对我们来说……即使在审判之后……我们花了很长时间才重新站起来。”

"Then I had to come along and muck everything up, huh?"  
"然后我就得来把一切都搞砸，是吧？"

Despite my tone, that brings out a wide smile. "You were a happy little accident."  
尽管我的语气如此，这却让她露出了灿烂的笑容。“你是个快乐的小意外。”

She earns herself a grimace, which only makes her grin wider. I was often told, very enthusiastically, that I was never planned to happen. It was her favorite pet name to tease me with, especially in front of company. A demeaning, but endearing sort of praise. "Mommy's happy accident!" she'd sing.  
她做出一副苦相，这反而让她的笑容更加灿烂。我常被人兴致勃勃地告知，我从未被计划过。那是她最喜欢的昵称，用来逗我，尤其是在客人面前。一种贬低却又亲切的赞美。“妈妈的快乐意外！”她会这样唱道。

She says it jokingly, even lovingly, but doesn't know how true it rings for me. I know there was a time before the war came into our house. My mother has a closet-full of photo albums to prove it. If not for them, I wouldn't have ever believed it. So I wonder, if I had never been born, would my parents have been better off? I'm sure my father thinks so.  
她半开玩笑，甚至带着几分爱意地说，却不知这话对我来说有多真切。我知道，在战争侵入我们家之前，曾有一段时光。我母亲有一柜子的相册为证。若非它们，我恐怕永远不会相信。于是我思索，如果我从未出生，我的父母会不会过得更好？我确信我父亲是这么想的。

No, I _know_ he does.  
不，我知道他确实这么想。

"Should've gotten help when he needed it. Would've saved us a lot of trouble."  
“本该在他需要时寻求帮助。那样会省去我们许多麻烦。”

Mother closes her eyes a moment, shoulders drooping with an unseen weight. "Some things are too hard to talk about. We were just kids, fighting a war we didn't understand. That doesn't just go away, no matter how much we might want it to."  
母亲闭上眼睛片刻，肩膀因看不见的重担而下垂。“有些事太难说出口了。我们那时只是孩子，打一场自己都不明白的战争。那不会轻易消失，无论我们多么希望如此。”

I can't hide my surprise at that. When I was younger, all I had were suspicions. It wasn't until I was about sixteen that I knew for sure my mother took part in the Angel War. She's just never come right out and admitted it.  
对此我无法掩饰自己的惊讶。小时候，我只有些许猜疑。直到大约十六岁时，我才确信母亲参与了天使战争。她从未直接承认过。

"Like your scars?" I say, suddenly a kid again. I imagine touching her arm, letting my finger tips graze over the marks as if to heal them, but banish the thought as soon as it arrives. She doesn't deny being in the war or insist it was the car accident like she has in the past. That little boy from the panhandle is gone, there's no point in pretending anymore.  
“像你的伤疤一样吗？”我突然又像个孩子一样说道。我幻想着触摸她的手臂，让指尖轻拂过那些痕迹，仿佛要治愈它们，但这个念头一出现就被我驱散了。她没有否认参加过战争，也没有像过去那样坚称是车祸造成的。那个来自潘汉德尔的小男孩已经不在了，再装作无事已无意义。

"You never get over something like that," she says in a small voice, staring down at her hands, "you never get over it."  
“你永远无法从那种事情中恢复过来，”她用微弱的声音说道，目光低垂看着双手，“你永远无法释怀。”

I wonder again, for the first time in years, what really gave her those scars. I wonder if it's anything like what my father has done – if maybe he did this to her. I'm always told it was the Eva, but didn't my father use one once long ago? I don't want to believe that my mother would stay with him after something like that, even if I can't be sure of exactly what 'that' is. I've heard the stories, like anyone else. Enough to have an idea, even if history is rather unclear about what really happened just before Third Impact.  
我再次好奇，多年来的第一次，究竟是什么让她留下了那些伤痕。我想知道这是否与我父亲所做的类似——也许是他对她做了这些。我总是被告知那是由于 EVA，但我的父亲不是很久以前也使用过一次吗？我不愿相信母亲会在那样的事情发生后还留在他身边，即便我无法确切知道“那件事”究竟是什么。我听过那些故事，像其他人一样。足以让我有个大概的了解，即使关于第三次冲击前究竟发生了什么的历史相当模糊。

They tell us that NERV, at the behest of an organization called SEELE, orchestrated the event. They tell us the JSSDF was sent in to wipe the place clean. They tell us that the giant machines called Evas fought eachother. Maybe there's more to it, more I don't know. My time with the subject has been brief since I've always done my best to avoid it. I'm curious now, like I was when I joined the CIA.  
他们告诉我们，在名为 SEELE 的组织的授意下，NERV 策划了这一事件。他们说 JSSDF 被派来彻底清除这个地方。他们说那些被称为 EVA 的巨大机器互相战斗。也许还有更多我不知道的内情。自从我总是尽力避免接触这个话题以来，我对这个问题的了解一直很短暂。现在我感到好奇，就像我加入 CIA 时那样。

_Is my mother_–_is the world_–_like this because of you, father?_  
是因为你，父亲，我的母亲——这个世界——才变成这样吗？

### Interlude IV

My parents never talked about the Angel War.  
我的父母从未谈及天使战争。

It was one of many forbidden topics.  
那是众多禁忌话题之一。

I learned about it mostly from Misato and lessons in school that I barely paid attention to. Getting to know the war that had so thoroughly scarred my parents wasn't high on my list of things to do at thirteen years old. I was trying to figure out exactly who I was, why girls were so strange now, why I didn't really have any friends. All while enduring the war that raged in my house.  
我主要从美里和学校里那些我几乎没怎么听的课程中了解到它。在十三岁的年纪，了解那个彻底伤害了我父母的战争并不是我优先考虑的事情。我正试图弄清楚自己到底是谁，为什么女孩们现在如此奇怪，为什么我几乎没有朋友。与此同时，还要忍受家中肆虐的战争。

I didn't have time to learn about anybody else's war.  
我没时间去了解别人的战争。

"Where are my A-tens?" dad hisses, panicked. He's throwing cupboards open, knocking drawers and their contents to the floor and muttering curses. It's about 3 A.M., I'm very awake now that my father has decided to tear apart the whole house. I sit on the lower steps of the stairs, peeking through the balusters and watching mom chase after him as he runs rampant on his mad search for something called A-tens. The panels under the sink creak open, paper towels and cleaning supplies tumbling out as he ducks inside. Mom places her hands gingerly on his shoulders.  
“我的 A-10 呢？”爸爸低声咆哮，显得惊慌失措。他猛地拉开橱柜，抽屉和里面的东西被撞得散落一地，嘴里还不停地咒骂着。现在是凌晨三点，父亲决定把整个房子翻个底朝天，我因此彻底清醒了。我坐在楼梯的低台阶上，透过栏杆窥视着，只见妈妈追在他身后，而他则在疯狂地寻找着所谓的 A-10。他弯腰钻进水槽下的隔间，纸巾和清洁用品随之滚落出来。妈妈小心翼翼地将手放在他的肩膀上。

"They're not here, Shinji. You're home." she says, like he's some old, senile man who can't even remember his own name.  
“它们不在这里，真嗣。你已经回家了。”她说话的语气，仿佛他是个连自己名字都记不清的老人。

He doesn't hear her. "I have to find them. I have to get in the Eva."  
他没听见她的话。“我必须找到他们。我必须进入 Eva。”

A VTOL's engines whine overhead, soaring back home to the Airbase miles away. Dad jumps and takes shelter behind the table, eyes searching beyond the kitchen window. "It's here goddammit. It's fucking here!" he shouts and I think I can see him shaking.  
一架 VTOL 的引擎在头顶呼啸，飞回数英里外的空军基地。爸爸跳起来躲到桌子后面，眼睛透过厨房窗户向外搜寻。“它来了，该死的。它真的来了！”他大喊，我似乎能看到他在颤抖。

Mom touches him again, trying to anchor him, maybe bring him back from the crater. Her voice is still calm and careful as she says, "There aren't any Angels, Shinji. Come on–"  
妈妈再次触碰他，试图稳住他，也许想把他从那深坑中拉回来。她的声音依旧平静而谨慎，说道：“没有使徒，真嗣。来吧——”

He smacks her hands away. "Just shut up and help me find them!" he snarls, tearing down the hall and ripping the closet door open, scattering coats, jackets, shoes and boxes across the floor. "They need me to pilot. I have t– _where are they_?!"  
他猛地拍开她的手。“闭嘴，帮我找到它们！”他咆哮着冲下走廊，猛地拉开衣柜门，外套、夹克、鞋子和盒子散落一地。“他们需要我驾驶。我有——它们在哪儿？！”

Mom keeps her distance now, right hand reaching over her stomach to cling to the opposite arm, just watching my dad slowly go insane. There's nothing she can do – nothing either of us can do.  
妈妈现在保持距离，右手伸过肚子抓住另一只手臂，只是看着我爸爸慢慢陷入疯狂。她无能为力——我们俩都无能为力。

"You don't have to pilot anymore," she whispers.  
“你不必再驾驶了，”她低声说。

He falls to his knees, grabbing his head. "I have to do it! I don't want to but I..." he chokes, folds in on himself, arms squeezing tight around his chest. His shoulders start to shake, a few sobs gasping free. "Please... don't make me. I don't... I don't want to do it again."  
他跪倒在地，双手抱头。“我必须这么做！我不想，但我……”他哽咽着，身体蜷缩，双臂紧紧环抱胸前。肩膀开始颤抖，几声抽泣断断续续地逸出。“求求你……别逼我。我不想……我不想再做了。”

Mother pads forward, coming down to her knees and wrapping her arms around him. "I know..." she says, holding his head to her chest. "I know."  
母亲轻步上前，跪下并将他拥入怀中。“我知道……”她轻声说，将他的头靠在自己胸前。“我知道。”

Those simple words bring everything crashing down. He sucks in a breath, anguish in every tear-filled convulsion. He cries like a lost child cries, gasping for speech as he does. "Please, I... don't... don't make me... anymore..."  
这简单的几个字让一切崩溃。他深吸一口气，每一滴泪都充满了痛苦。他像一个迷路的孩子般哭泣，抽噎着试图说话。“求你了，我……不想……不要再逼我了……”

His wails fill the house and there's more pain and suffering in them than I can bear. So I cover my ears, rocking on the bottom steps. I can't block it out with just my hands, no matter how tight I squeeze my eyes shut and pretend I'm somewhere far away. I rush back upstairs, lock my door and hide in the closet. This isn't the first time this has happened. It's like something has crawled into my father's skin and taken possession of him, twisting up his brain and making him crazy.  
他的哭喊声充斥着整个屋子，其中蕴含的痛苦与折磨让我难以承受。于是我捂住耳朵，蜷缩在楼梯最底层。无论我如何紧闭双眼，假装自己身处远方，仅凭双手无法隔绝这一切。我冲回楼上，锁上门，躲进衣橱里。这种情况已经不是第一次发生了。仿佛有什么东西钻进了我父亲的体内，占据了他的身体，扭曲了他的大脑，让他变得疯狂。

The first time he woke up shouting about his A-tens I hid in my room and cried. Those tears weren't for him, though. I was crying because I was scared, I'm still scared, and what's worse is that I don't know why. A few tears still manage to roll down my cheeks as I listen to his sobs faintly working their way upstairs. I keep the rest in – I don't cry. I don't even feel sorry for him anymore. I'm beyond the point of pity. It's stopped being sad. It's just another way my father tortures us, makes our lives a daily struggle – makes my mother have nightmares.  
第一次他醒来大喊关于他的 A-tens 时，我躲在房间里哭泣。然而，那些泪水并非为他而流。我哭泣是因为害怕，至今依然害怕，更糟糕的是，我不知道为何如此。听着他微弱的啜泣声逐渐传到楼上，几滴泪水仍不自觉地滑过我的脸颊。我忍住了其余的泪水——我没有哭。我甚至不再为他感到难过。我已经超越了同情的界限。这不再令人悲伤。这只是父亲折磨我们、让我们的生活每日挣扎、让母亲夜夜噩梦的另一种方式。

The next morning, I'm planted in front of the T.V., still wearing pajamas. It's about ten o'clock, mom is making breakfast in the kitchen. Sausages and eggs, it smells like. The thudding of boots on wood accompany dad down stairs as he dons his cotton-lined jacket, keys jingling in his hand. The nametag stitched into the olive green material reads _Katsuragi_.  
第二天早上，我穿着睡衣坐在电视机前。大约十点钟，妈妈正在厨房做早餐，闻起来像是香肠和鸡蛋。随着爸爸穿着棉衬里的夹克下楼，木地板上响起了靴子的咚咚声，手中的钥匙叮当作响。橄榄绿布料上缝着的姓名牌上写着 Katsuragi。

He comes to stand by the T.V., bloodshot eyes staring down at me. "Get your shoes on," he says, nodding towards the pair of sneakers next to the couch.  
他走到电视机旁，布满血丝的眼睛盯着我。“穿上你的鞋，”他说着，朝沙发旁的那双运动鞋点了点头。

I glance at the kitchen, and then to the keys in his hand. "Why? Where are we going?"  
我瞥了一眼厨房，然后看向他手中的钥匙。“为什么？我们要去哪儿？”

"Just put your shoes on."  
“把鞋穿上就行。”

I think about saying no. It isn't something done lightly. I've seen his rage before, and there's no telling what might make him snap. So I tug my shoes on and we take a trip down into Tucson proper where my dad, like he always does, points in the direction of Phoenix, hidden behind distant hills.  
我考虑过拒绝。这不是轻易能做的事。我曾见过他的愤怒，不知道什么会让他爆发。所以我穿上鞋子，我们前往图森市区，在那里，我爸爸像往常一样，指向隐藏在远山后的凤凰城。

"I wish you could've seen the towers in Tokyo-three, Kazuya. A hundred buildings three times the size, stretching over the mountains and glowing gold and orange in the sunset."  
“真希望你能看到东京三号的那些塔，和也。一百座三倍高的大楼，横跨山脉，在夕阳下闪耀着金橙色的光芒。”

It's the only thing he says the drive there and back, and one of the few things I've ever heard about Tokyo-3. I love imagining what that must have looked like, a little disappointed I'll never see them in person. I learned only a few months ago that Tokyo-3 had been completely destroyed in the war.  
他一路上来回只说了这么一句话，这也是我听过的关于第三新东京市的寥寥数语之一。我喜欢想象那景象一定是什么样子，只是有些遗憾自己永远无法亲眼见到。直到几个月前我才知道，第三新东京市在战争中已被彻底摧毁。

Our little routine carries out as it usually does. He pretends that last night never happened, that it was all just a bad dream. I'm more than willing to entertain that notion.  
我们的日常一如既往地进行着。他假装昨晚的事从未发生，一切只是个噩梦。我也很乐意接受这种想法。

Whenever my dad would have an episode, he'd take me out to a ma-and-pa bakery down in the city and buy me whatever I wanted. Powder covered jelly-filled donuts, crisp green apples smothered in chocolate and marshmallow and bits of candy. Warm crepes overflowing with raspberry sauce and sprinkled with sugar.  
每当爸爸发作时，他会带我去城里的一家夫妻面包店，给我买任何我想要的东西。粉末覆盖的果酱甜甜圈，裹着巧克力和棉花糖以及糖果碎片的脆绿苹果。热腾腾的薄饼溢满覆盆子酱，撒上糖粉。

Mom always gave him a look that bled disapproval when we got home, but never said anything. She let me have that small reprieve. Let me pretend that everything was okay for a little while. Because not pretending meant admitting there was something wrong in front of their son, as if that would solidify it more than me witnessing the actual events already had. My mother and father were expert pretenders.  
每次我们回家，妈妈总是用那种流露出不满的眼神看他，但从不言语。她让我有了那短暂的喘息机会。让我可以假装一切都还好，哪怕只是片刻。因为不假装就意味着要在儿子面前承认有问题，仿佛这会比亲眼目睹那些实际发生的事情更加确凿。我的父母是伪装的高手。

I could see it more than they thought, and I don't mean the screaming about Angels in the middle of the night or the meltdowns that happened in our kitchen. I could see something darker in every word they spoke, every fight, every lie – like little cracks. I could see all the winding, jagged fissures that led to something black and ugly, haunting my dreams at night.  
我能看到的比他们以为的更多，我指的不是深夜关于天使的争吵或是厨房里的崩溃。我能从他们说的每一句话、每一次争吵、每一个谎言中看到更深的东西——就像小小的裂缝。我能看到所有蜿蜒曲折、参差不齐的裂缝，它们通向某种黑暗而丑陋的东西，夜夜萦绕在我的梦中。

Still, those meager bright spots like the skyscrapers in Tokyo-3 gave me something to cling to. My parents rarely, if ever, shared their childhoods with me. Every once in a blue moon I heard about their time in Boston, though never in much detail. With every question I asked, they would answer with vague, tight-lipped phrases like, "It was hard, but we got by."  
尽管如此，那些微弱的亮点，就像东京-3 的摩天大楼，给了我一些可以依靠的东西。我的父母很少，或者说从未，与我分享过他们的童年。偶尔，我会听到他们在波士顿的时光，但从未详细讲述。每次我问起，他们总是用含糊其辞、紧闭双唇的短语回答，比如，“那很艰难，但我们挺过来了。”

Tokyo-3 was mentioned offhandedly, rarely in much detail and almost never nostalgically. Whenever I took the initiative and asked about it, they'd say things like, "It was such a long time ago, I don't remember."  
东京-3 这个名字偶尔会被不经意地提起，很少详细描述，几乎从未带着怀旧之情。每当我主动询问关于它的事情时，他们总是会说，“那是很久以前的事了，我不记得了。”

It was just their way of saying, "We don't talk about Tokyo-three."  
这不过是他们表达“我们不谈东京-3”的方式。

A rule that only applied when I was curious. So I eventually stopped asking. I just wanted to know them. I wasn't allowed to ask about the Angel War, so I had to claw for the bits and pieces of their life that I could get. The war in particular was always this faceless enigma to me – an ink-black shadow at the edge of thought that happened somewhere far and distant in a time and place I'll never know. It didn't have context, a face and a reality, until I met Toji Suzuhara. Even then I could barely fathom it.  
这条规矩只在我好奇时才生效。所以最终我不再问了。我只是想了解他们。我不被允许询问关于使徒战争的事，所以我只能努力拼凑那些我能得到的关于他们生活的碎片。那场战争对我来说始终是一个无面目的谜团——一个在思维边缘的墨黑色阴影，发生在遥远而陌生的时空，我永远无法知晓。直到我遇见了铃原东治，这场战争才有了些许背景、面孔和现实感。即便如此，我也只能勉强理解。

I was much younger, maybe nine years old when I met him and his seven sons for the first time. The oldest was thirteen and the youngest only two, his wife Hikari's stomach swelling with the eighth brother.  
我遇见他和他的七个儿子时，年纪还很小，可能只有九岁。最大的十三岁，最小的才两岁，他的妻子光肚子已经鼓起了第八个孩子。

Winter frosted the window panes, but inside it was warm and comfortable. Everyone smiled and laughed. I spent hours running in and out of the house with the Suzuhara's, forging a friendship in the oldest three that would later carry me through some of the toughest times of my adult life.  
冬天的霜花凝结在窗玻璃上，但屋内温暖而舒适。每个人都面带微笑，笑声不断。我和铃原一家跑进跑出，花了好几个小时，与最大的三个孩子建立了友谊，这份情谊后来支撑我度过了成年生活中一些最艰难的时光。

As I understood it, Toji was something like an old war buddy. Dad never said how exactly, all I knew was that they'd met when he was going to school in Tokyo-3. The man had been trying for a long time to move out to Hokkaido – stubborn old pride, mom had said. It was the only livable place left in Japan, at least for a large population. The island nation's people desperately wanted to return home, but the northern island could only fit so many and as a result it was expensive for even the smallest apartment. The waiting list was long and it could take years to get approved. The Suzuhara's had been scrounging up savings down in Louisiana for the past eleven years since applying.  
据我所知，冬二就像是父亲的老战友。爸爸从未细说，我只知道他们是在东京-3 上学时相遇的。这个人一直想搬到北海道去——妈妈说是顽固的老派骄傲。那是日本仅存的适合居住的地方，至少对大量人口来说如此。这个岛国的人民迫切想回家，但北海道容纳不了太多人，因此即使是小公寓也价格昂贵。等待名单很长，可能需要数年才能获批。铃原一家自申请以来，已经在路易斯安那省吃俭用了十一年。

I watched him walk with only a slight lean on his prosthetic leg, in plain view since he was wearing shorts of all things in winter weather. He was a tall, well-built kind of man, hair short and trimmed close. It was graying at the edges a little by the time we met. He'd flash me a wide, unabashed grin whenever he caught me staring at his leg. I immediately took a liking to this man. His wife Hikari, my other Aunt, was the kindest person I'd ever met. She had aged far better than her husband, a faded dash of freckles over her cheeks and nose, while her brown hair was tied up in a loose bun. She always had a smile on her face and never seemed to get impatient with her boys, no matter how much they tugged on her dress or made the younger ones cry.  
我看着他拄着假肢走路，只有轻微的倾斜，在冬日里他竟然穿着短裤，一切都清晰可见。他是个高大健壮的男人，头发剪得很短，修得整齐。我们相遇时，发梢已略显灰白。每当他发现我在盯着他的腿看，总会对我露出宽厚、不加掩饰的笑容。我立刻喜欢上了这个人。他的妻子光，我的另一位阿姨，是我见过的最善良的人。她比她丈夫老得慢得多，脸颊和鼻子上散布着淡淡的雀斑，而她的棕色头发则随意地挽成一个松散的发髻。她总是面带微笑，无论孩子们如何拉扯她的裙子或让年幼的孩子哭泣，她似乎从不感到不耐烦。

It was nice being around other people that looked like me. I don't look 100% Japanese, but enough that other kids send me the occasional scowl, call me a camp-rat or throw dirt at me during recess.  
周围有像我一样的人，感觉真好。我不完全像日本人，但足够让其他孩子在课间偶尔对我皱眉，叫我营地老鼠，或者朝我扔土块。

Just as pleasing was that they all spoke Japanese, even if they did it strangely. It sounded drawling compared to my parent's sharp and concise tones. What they didn't really speak was English. At least not well. My mother switched between the two easily, and dad wasn't bad at English when he tried. The Suzuhara's, on the other hand, were nigh unintelligible when they spoke it, likely because Toji was very adamant about Japanese being the only language they needed to speak fluently. It was silly, in retrospect, since they were going to learn it at school one way or another, whether it was here or in Hokkaido.  
同样令人愉悦的是，他们都会说日语，尽管说得有些奇怪。与我父母尖锐而简洁的语调相比，他们的发音显得拖沓。他们不太会说英语，至少说得不好。我母亲能轻松地在两种语言间切换，父亲努力时英语也不差。而铃原一家说英语时几乎难以理解，可能是因为冬治非常坚持日语是他们唯一需要流利掌握的语言。回想起来，这很可笑，因为他们无论如何都会在学校学到英语，无论是在这里还是在北海道。

I spent the latter half of the visit with mom and Aunt Hikari, who let me touch her big belly to feel little Akio putting up a fuss. In the kitchen, dad and Toji were sharing a few beers and laughing. My father was relaxing and telling jokes. It was a miracle. I couldn't find it in myself to be very happy for him. Why couldn't he be this way all the time? Why not with us?  
访问的后半段，我和妈妈以及光阿姨一起度过，她让我摸她的大肚子，感受小昭在里面闹腾。厨房里，爸爸和冬治在喝着几杯啤酒，笑声不断。我父亲在放松地讲笑话。这真是个奇迹。我发现自己无法为他感到非常高兴。为什么他不能一直这样？为什么不能和我们在一起时也这样？

While the wives were in the living room, the boys off causing trouble and dad up at the store, I spent several minutes watching Toji out on the back porch, smoking a cigarette. I always wondered why someone with such a big smile would risk staining his teeth forever. Mom said it couldn't be helped, most people they stuck in the refugee camps came out with a pack in their pockets. Stress levels were high and cigarettes were easy enough to get.  
当妻子们在客厅里，男孩们在外面惹是生非，而爸爸在店里时，我花了好几分钟在后门廊上看着 Toji 抽烟。我总是好奇，为什么一个总是笑容满面的人会冒着永远染黄牙齿的风险。妈妈说这是没办法的事，大多数被困在难民营里的人出来时口袋里都揣着一包烟。压力很大，而香烟又很容易弄到。

It didn't really matter at the time as I worked up the courage to go outside and stand next to him.  
那时这并不重要，因为我鼓起勇气走出去，站在他旁边。

"Hey there, little Kazu." he says, summoning that wide grin and shooting me a wink when I scowl at him.  
“嘿，小和。”他说着，露出了那宽阔的笑容，当我对他皱眉时，他还对我眨了眨眼。

"What happened to your leg?" I ask, pointing at the flush and shiny metal starting above his knee and flowing down in the shape of a normal leg. The shin piece is made up of a pale brown wood, kanji of varying sizes and intensity carved into it. It's hard to read, but I think they're names. I recognize the biggest set as Hachiro, the thirteen year old.  
“你的腿怎么了？”我问道，指着他膝盖上方开始延伸的闪亮金属，那形状如同正常的腿。小腿部分由浅棕色的木头制成，上面刻着大小和深浅不一的汉字。虽然难以辨认，但我觉得那些是名字。我认出了最大的那组字是“八郎”，一个十三岁的孩子。

Toji's shoulders tremble with a chuckle and he takes a long drag from his cigarette before saying, "Dad didn't tell you that story, Kazu?"  
户次的肩膀因轻笑而颤抖，他深深吸了一口烟，然后说道：“爸爸没跟你讲过那个故事吗，和？”

My dad never tells me anything. I just stare up at Toji, waiting for an answer.  
我爸从来什么都不告诉我。我只是抬头看着户次，等待着答案。

He shrugs. "Nah, guess he wouldn't." the man sits down on the porch step, knocking the spot next to him with a knuckle. I plop down too and for a while, we watch five of his seven sons wrestling down the hill that is my backyard.  
他耸耸肩。“不，我想他不会。”男人坐在门廊台阶上，用指关节敲了敲旁边的位置。我也坐了下来，我们静静地看着他的七个儿子中的五个在山坡上打闹，那山坡正是我的后院。

"You see, I was in the Angel War with him," Toji says, twisting out his cigarette bud against the concrete. "The aliens could do this thing to the Evas, take control of them while you sat inside. Imagine it like you're in your own head looking out, but your body isn't doing what you want it to do. It moves on its own. All you can do is watch."  
“你知道，我和他在天使战争中并肩作战，”东治说着，将烟头拧在水泥地上。“那些外星人能对 EVA 做手脚，控制它们，而你坐在里面。想象一下，你坐在自己的脑袋里往外看，但你的身体却不按你的意愿行动。它自行其是。你只能眼睁睁地看着。”

He pauses and my brow twists as I try to picture it. At school, they didn't tell us much about the battle machines used in the Angel War. All I know is that there were big mechs made to fight the monsters. No one ever said anything about piloting. What _is_ an Eva? What does it do? How could the aliens control it?  
他顿了顿，我皱起眉头试图想象那个场景。在学校里，他们没怎么告诉我们关于天使战争中使用的战斗机器。我只知道有一些巨大的机甲被制造出来对抗怪物。从没人提过驾驶的事。EVA 是什么？它是做什么的？外星人又是如何控制它的？

As if to answer my fervent questions, Toji goes on. "I passed out after a while. The Angel made my Eva attack the other ones, your father's too. But your dad wouldn't fight, didn't want to risk hurting his good friend inside. Almost got himself killed... then the Commander took control of it – wasn't your dad piloting anymore. He had to sit there and watch it break my Eva, tear it to pieces. I was told there was a lot of blood. His Eva split mine open, grabbed the entry plug – where they had us pilot – and squeezed," Toji raises his hand and closes it into a fist, "crushed my leg. You're dad was pretty messed up over it. I think that'd mess anyone up."  
"仿佛是为了回答我迫切的问题，冬二继续说道。“过了一会儿我就昏过去了。那个使徒控制了我的 EVA 去攻击其他的 EVA，包括你父亲的。但你爸爸不愿战斗，不想冒险伤害里面的好朋友。差点连自己都丧命了……然后司令接管了 EVA——你爸爸不再驾驶了。他只能坐在那里，眼睁睁看着我的 EVA 被撕成碎片。据说流了很多血。他的 EVA 撕开了我的 EVA，抓住了插入栓——我们驾驶的地方——然后挤压，”冬二举起手，握成拳头，“压碎了我的腿。你爸爸为此非常痛苦。我想这足以让任何人崩溃。”

It was the first real story I ever heard about the Angel War. I don't think Toji realized the lasting impressions it would leave on me, assuming that my parents must've told me all about their war in the Evas. He thought he was just indulging a kid's curiosity about a missing leg.  
"这是我第一次听到关于使徒战争的真实故事。我不认为冬二意识到这会给我留下多么深刻的印象，他以为我的父母一定已经告诉我所有关于他们在 EVA 中的战争经历。他以为他只是在满足一个孩子对一条断腿的好奇心。”

In the moment, it fills me with questions I'm afraid to ask out loud. How does a machine bleed? How could they rip eachother up like that? Is that what happened to mom? Did my father lose control of his Eva and watch it hurt her? My mind starts to build the pictures for me. I see a giant, red-eyed black machine that is my father's. I see it claw and rip away at huge, thick battleplate, tearing skin and snapping bones. In my nightmares, I would hear mother scream as he does it.  
那一刻，心中充满了不敢大声问出的疑问。机器怎么会流血？他们怎么能那样互相撕裂？妈妈是不是也遭遇了同样的事？父亲是否失去了对 Eva 的控制，眼睁睁看着它伤害了她？我的脑海开始为我构建画面。我看到一具巨大的、红眼的黑色机器，那是父亲的。我看到它用爪子撕扯着厚重的战斗装甲，撕裂皮肤，折断骨头。在我的噩梦中，我会听到母亲在他这样做时的尖叫声。

I did my best to distance myself from the war after that. I never wanted to believe my dad could do those things. I thought he fought the Angels to protect people. Isn't that what mom had said ? Or was it just more of her lies?  
从那以后，我尽力远离战争。我从未想过爸爸会做出那些事。我以为他对抗使徒是为了保护人们。这不是妈妈说的吗？还是这只是她更多的谎言？

That night, I don't sleep, staining the sheets with sweat as I tremble under the covers, fearing the day my dad finally loses control and crushes me too.  
那一夜，我无法入睡，汗水浸湿了床单，我在被子里颤抖，害怕有一天爸爸最终失去控制，也会将我碾碎。

**Author's Notes:** Hm, I realize it might be kind of annoying for the actual chapters to be so short compared to the Interludes. I _did_ want chapter 4 to be longer, but it's looking like chapter 5 should compensate well enough for that.  
作者的话：嗯，我意识到与间奏相比，实际章节如此简短可能会有些烦人。我本想让第四章更长一些，但看来第五章应该能很好地弥补这一点。

### Chapter 5: November 29 (III)  

The doctor says her blood pressure is too high. Likely the root cause of her heart attack, and a much more potent trigger for cardiac arrest.  
医生说她血压过高。这很可能是她心脏病发作的根源，也是引发心脏骤停的一个更强烈的诱因。

"The smoking hasn't helped. You'll have to keep a close eye on it from now on," he says, in that clipped way that is both professional and chiding at the same time. I chalk up an 'I told you so' victory point on the invisible scoreboard only I keep track of. The small win turns hollow once my brain processes the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest, the latter of which usually being the one that kills you outright before you can even think of getting to the hospital.  
“吸烟没有帮助。从现在开始，你得密切关注这一点，”他用那种既专业又带着责备的简短语气说道。我在只有我记录的隐形记分牌上记下了一次“我早告诉过你”的胜利分。但当我的大脑理解了心脏病发作和心脏骤停之间的区别，尤其是后者通常在你想到去医院之前就直接夺走你的生命时，这种小小的胜利感就变得空洞了。

I erase my mark from the board.  
我从记分牌上擦掉了我的标记。

Actually, I think I'll get rid of the board.  
实际上，我想我会把这块板子处理掉。

Mother doesn't put up a fuss as the doctor drolls on, nodding every so often. She tugs on the sleeves of her maroon turtleneck tunic – the worn, war-weary wisp of a woman in the hospital bed has vanished, buried under the adamant and clinical Metaphysics professor.  
母亲没有对医生喋喋不休的解释表示异议，时不时地点头。她拉了拉她那件深红色高领束腰外衣的袖子——那个在医院病床上疲惫不堪、饱经风霜的女人形象已经消失，取而代之的是那位坚定而临床的形而上学教授。

It chills me how utterly different they are. Even when dad was at his worst or her nightmares kept her up days on end, she was stalwart, proud – strong. The mother I've seen these past few days... I don't know her and I don't want to meet her again.  
他们之间的差异之大让我感到寒心。即使是在父亲最糟糕的时候，或是她的噩梦让她彻夜难眠，她依然坚定、自豪——坚强。这些天我看到的母亲……我不认识她，也不想再见到她。

Some paperwork is signed, new medications prescribed and the doctor says he's scheduled her for a follow up appointment at the clinic down the street in ten days. After that, he scribbles on his clipboard and hurries off down the hall. A nurse directs us towards the patient discharge and soon enough we're waiting in an open lobby bustling with people. A couple wheelchairs creak by, several desk clerks dealing with a handful of agitated family members.  
一些文件被签署，新的药物被开出处方，医生说她十天后会在街对面的诊所安排一次复诊。之后，他在剪贴板上匆匆写下几笔，快步离开走廊。一名护士指引我们前往病人出院处，不久我们便坐在一个热闹非凡的开放式大厅里等待。几辆轮椅吱吱作响地经过，几位前台职员正忙于应付一群焦躁不安的家属。

My father has gone off to fetch the car in the parking garage across the street, so we sit by the automatic doors and wait, an empty seat between us.  
父亲已经去街对面停车场的取车，于是我们坐在自动门旁等待，中间隔着一个空座位。

"You should come home for a while," mother says, jarring me straight. Just the mention makes my heart skip a beat.  
“你应该回家待一段时间，”母亲说道，让我顿时坐直了身子。仅仅是提到这个，我的心就跳漏了一拍。

My brain, meanwhile, starts working furiously to bullshit an excuse. "I really can't..."  
与此同时，我的大脑开始疯狂运转，试图编造一个借口。“我真的不能……”

She lifts an eyebrow. "What, you got a hot date?"  
她挑了挑眉毛。“怎么，你有约会？”

"Well, no..." “呃，没有……”

"Good, then you can come by the house for a bit."  
"好，那你可以在家里待一会儿。"

The doors part for my father and she stands. "_Schatzi_, Kazuya will be coming home with us."  
门为我父亲分开，她站了起来。“亲爱的，和也将会和我们一起回家。”

He glances at me, giving a nod before leading us out. The car outside is silver and some kind of Subaru, much older make and model than what's out there today. I'm surprised when mom lets him drive, he must've insisted. Since almost swerving us off the road while having one of his panic attacks years ago, he hasn't really been allowed behind the wheel.  
他瞥了我一眼，点了点头，然后带我们出去。外面的车是银色的，某种斯巴鲁，比现在的车型要老得多。我惊讶于妈妈让他开车，他一定是坚持要开。自从几年前他因为恐慌发作差点把我们开下路后，他就不太被允许开车了。

I take the back seat, now thoroughly emasculated in front of my parents. Somehow, not having my own mode of transportation handy feels like a sign of weakness – incompetence. Dad flicks on the radio, but keeps it low. Christmas music fills what would have otherwise been a very uncomfortable quiet, distilling the air with the hundredth rendition of a classic song that's nearly a century old.  
我坐到了后排，在父母面前彻底失去了男子气概。不知怎的，没有自己的交通工具在手边，感觉就像是一种软弱——无能的标志。爸爸打开了收音机，但音量调得很低。圣诞音乐填补了原本会非常尴尬的寂静，空气中弥漫着近一个世纪前的经典歌曲的第百次演绎。

The singer's voice is baritone and boisterous, mimicking the old swing style of the 1950s. A happy and upbeat tune, the sort of thing another family is singing along to in their own car, out of pitch and inbetween fits of laughter.  
歌手的声音是男中音，充满活力，模仿着 20 世纪 50 年代的老式摇摆风格。这是一首欢快活泼的曲子，那种其他家庭在自家车里跟着唱、跑调又夹杂着笑声的歌曲。

My father keeps hard eyes on the road, mother sits straight and gazes out the window while I slouch in the back between them, waiting for this humiliating nightmare to end.  
父亲目光坚毅地盯着路面，母亲坐得笔直，凝视着窗外，而我则在他们之间的后座上蜷缩着，等待这场羞辱的噩梦结束。

Even though it's been a while, I know all the roads. They've changed very little, save for maybe a few new layers of tar. As we ascend into the Catalina Foothills, something nameless starts to creep along the tailgate, tugging at the back of my brain. The doors and windows of the car might as well be prison bars – I'm trapped and there's no possible escape short of jumping out. The road becomes long and winding, too long, while the mountains grow larger. Rolling rock slowly closes in, rising so high they cast shadows in the deep crater they've formed.  
尽管已经有一段时间了，我依然熟悉所有的道路。它们变化甚微，除了可能多了几层柏油。当我们驶入卡塔利娜山麓时，某种无名之感开始沿着后挡板蔓延，牵动着我的思绪。车门的窗户仿佛牢笼的铁栏——我被困其中，除了跳车别无逃脱之法。道路变得漫长而曲折，太长了，而山峦愈发巍峨。滚动的岩石缓缓逼近，高耸入云，它们在深陷的坑中投下阴影。

I know that can't be possible. I know I shouldn't _really_ be considering jumping out of the car. There's no reason for it. I can't stop feeling like the world is about to swallow me whole, no matter how much I tell myself otherwise. Just when I think I might need to empty my prescribed anxiety meds, the brakes scream as we ease into the driveway, a narrow and winding concrete path.  
我知道那不可能。我知道我不该真的考虑跳车。没有理由这么做。无论我如何自我安慰，都无法停止那种世界即将将我吞噬的感觉。就在我以为可能需要服用处方抗焦虑药物时，刹车尖叫着，我们缓缓驶入车道，一条狭窄蜿蜒的混凝土小径。

It's been eight years since I've seen this house. Up on the side of a hill laden with skinny, leafless trees, towering cacti and brittle shrubs. A light snow covers the grassy knolls and has turned the roof white.  
距离我上次见到这栋房子已经过去八年了。它坐落在遍布瘦弱、无叶树木的山坡上，周围是高耸的仙人掌和脆弱的灌木。薄薄的雪覆盖着草地，屋顶也变得雪白。

I know now that it wasn't home I longed for when the smell of nicotine struck me in my mother's hospital room. Even if the panhandle held more pleasant memories for me – it wasn't any better before we moved. What filled me was simple nostalgia, a selfish wanting for rose-tinted days. I escaped this place as soon as I was legally able to – and I was determined to leave it behind forever.  
如今我明白，当尼古丁的气味在母亲病房中袭来时，我所渴望的并非家的温暖。即便佛罗里达狭长地带留有更多美好回忆——在我们搬家之前，那里也并未变得更好。充盈我心的是单纯的怀旧之情，一种对玫瑰色过往的自私向往。我一达到法定年龄便逃离了此地——决心将它永远抛诸脑后。

A shiver spills down my back as we stop. My parents push out of the car, cementing this as reality and not another nightmare like I was hoping. The pressure doesn't stop building as I march a few paces behind them. There are six steps leading up to the front porch and each one is a mountain, taking me days to climb. My knees ache, every fiber of my being screams out – _be careful, you're in danger here_ – as the door swings open.  
我们停下脚步，一阵寒意沿着我的脊背蔓延。父母从车里出来，将这一切化为现实，而非我所期盼的又一个噩梦。我紧随其后，压力不断累积。通往前门的小径有六级台阶，每一级都如山岳般难以攀登，仿佛耗费了我数日光阴。我的膝盖隐隐作痛，每一丝神经都在尖叫——小心，你身处险境——就在此时，门缓缓开启。

Even the hall's beige wall paint is the same. Photographs decorate each length of drywall, though some are missing. At least one of them was shattered to pieces sometime before I left – by my own hand. It hasn't been put back up.  
就连大厅的米色墙漆也依旧如故。每段石膏板墙上都装饰着照片，尽管有些已不见踪影。至少有一张在我离开前就已支离破碎——是我亲手所为。至今仍未重新挂起。

A low meow echoes into the living room as we enter, breaking the white-noise ringing spell cast over me.  
我们一进门，一声低沉的喵叫便在客厅回荡，打破了笼罩我的白噪音般的耳鸣咒。

"_Hallo_, Myshka!" mother cries, suddenly full of delight. She bends her knees and slides a hand over an orange tabby cat's back. The thin feline sidles up next to her, purring as he – she? – rubs his face against a knee.  
“哈喽，小猫咪！”母亲欢呼道，突然满心欢喜。她屈膝弯腰，一只手抚过橘色虎斑猫的背。那只瘦削的猫咪蹭到她身边，发出呼噜声，用脸蹭着她的膝盖。

"When did you get a cat?" I ask, hiding a flinch as dad sets down his keys in the open kitchen.  
“你什么时候养了只猫？”我问道，同时掩饰着父亲在开放式厨房放下钥匙时我的一丝畏缩。

"About six years ago," she says. "His name is Myshka."  
“大约六年前，”她说，“他叫米什卡。”

"It's a silly name," dad growls. I can't tell if that's just the way his voice sounds or if he really isn't pleased. He organizes some papers on the counter, shrugging his jacket off to leave only his black long-sleeved shirt to keep the cold at bay.  
“这名字挺傻的，”爸爸咕哝道。我分不清这只是他嗓音的常态，还是他真的不满意。他在柜台上整理了一些文件，脱下夹克，只留下那件黑色长袖衬衫抵御寒冷。

Mom smiles to herself, glancing up at me. "Your father didn't want me to get him. Said we didn't need a cat."  
妈妈自顾自地笑了，抬头看了我一眼。“你爸当初不让我养他。说我们不需要猫。”

"I've had a cat for thirty-four years," he grumbles, this time with a ghost of a smirk.  
"我养猫已经三十四年了，"他咕哝道，这次嘴角掠过一丝似有若无的笑意。

She sticks her tongue out and he huffs, pushing through the back door. She scratches behind Myshka's ears and he leans into her hand appreciatively.  
她吐了吐舌头，他哼了一声，推开后门走了出去。她挠了挠 Myshka 的耳后，它感激地向她的手靠了靠。

"I've caught them playing together. Mean old dad is just a sucker for redheads, isn't he, Myshka?"  
"我看到他们一起玩过。严厉的老爸就是对红头发没辙，对吧，Myshka？"

Myshka purrs in apparent agreement.  
米什卡发出呼噜声，显然是表示同意。

I slide my jacket – _dad's jacket_ – off and fold it over the backrest of the couch. Mom is whispering sweet nothings to Myshka as I meander towards the porch, barred by tall and wide windows. A garden stretches up the side of the hill at our backyard, a sprawl of trellises and boxed mazes of soil. Branching out from the foot of the porch are growths of shriveled vines that go on for at least fifty feet. My father navigates the paths between them, meeting a man who is busy watering the crops, dressed in khakis and a sleeveless white shirt. He's bald, just a bit younger and wears a big grin as he and my father shake hands.  
我脱下夹克——爸爸的夹克——叠好放在沙发背上。妈妈正对着米什卡低声细语，而我则漫步走向阳台，那里被高大宽阔的窗户隔开。后院的山坡上延伸着一座花园，错综复杂的格架和土壤迷宫。从阳台脚下延伸出枯萎的藤蔓，至少有五十英尺长。父亲穿梭其间的小径，与一个正在给庄稼浇水的男人相遇，他穿着卡其裤和无袖白衬衫。他秃顶，略显年轻，满脸笑容地与父亲握手。

"Who's that?" I ask. “那是谁？”我问道。

"Hm?" mom's face scrunches, perplexed as she comes to investigate. "Oh, that's Yoshiya. He took care of the cat while we were gone. A... _friend_ from your dad's therapy group."  
"嗯？" 妈妈皱起眉头，一脸困惑地走过来查看。"哦，那是由纪也。我们不在的时候他照顾了猫。是你爸爸治疗小组的一个...朋友。"

"You don't sound too happy about that."  
"听起来你不太高兴。"

She shrugs, turning away from the windows. "Doesn't matter what I think of him. The sessions help your father and that's what counts."  
她耸耸肩，转身离开窗户。"我对他有什么看法不重要。这些治疗对你爸爸有帮助，这才是关键。"

Yoshiya heads around the side of the house, while dad starts to tend to his garden. I can't imagine there's much to do for the brittle plants in winter, but he's got a pair of shears and plucks at weeds and other imperfections I can't perceive.  
吉也绕到房子侧面，而爸爸开始打理他的花园。我难以想象冬天里那些脆弱的植物有什么可做的，但他拿着一把剪刀，拔除杂草和其他我察觉不到的瑕疵。

On the way to the kitchen table, I stumble as Myshka darts between my legs, squeezing through the slightly ajar back door. He pads into the garden and follows my father about, hiding in the brush and chasing after lizards.  
走向厨房餐桌的路上，我绊了一下，因为米什卡从我腿间窜过，挤进了半开的后门。它踏进花园，跟在我父亲身后，躲在灌木丛中追逐蜥蜴。

The aroma of dark-roasted Jamaican coffee beans comes to greet me, accompanied by the click of a coffee pot. Mom is fixing up a fresh brew, taking from one of the many jars of ground beans stored in the cabinet. Masking tape marked with sharpie labels each type and where it's imported from. If there's one thing my father and I share – it's a love for coffee. He used to take me down to the fresh market every Sunday by a stall stacked seven feet high with tan jute bags, where an Indian man sold beans by the pound. We'd spend the morning there while he taught me about how they harvest the seeds from the _coffea_ plants and peal the skins so they can be roasted. Sometimes he'd make me close my eyes and sniff handfuls of beans to see if I could guess where they were from. I'd often day dream about growing my own coffee crops with him.  
浓郁的牙买加深度烘焙咖啡豆香气迎面而来，伴随着咖啡壶的咔嗒声。妈妈正在冲泡一杯新鲜咖啡，从橱柜里众多装有磨碎咖啡豆的罐子中取出一罐。每种咖啡豆都用马克笔在遮蔽胶带上做了标记，注明了类型和产地。如果说我和父亲有什么共同之处——那就是对咖啡的热爱。他过去常常在每个周日带我去新鲜市场，那里有一个摊位堆满了七英尺高的棕色麻袋，一位印度人按磅出售咖啡豆。我们会在那里度过整个上午，他教我如何从咖啡树上采摘种子并剥去外皮以便烘焙。有时，他会让我闭上眼睛，闻一把咖啡豆，看我能否猜出它们的产地。我常常幻想着和他一起种植自己的咖啡园。

"Cream and sugar?" mom asks, holding an empty black and white mug that says "Hollywood". One of the few remaining relics from an age without Impacts.  
“要加奶油和糖吗？”妈妈问道，手里拿着一个空的黑白相间的马克杯，上面写着“好莱坞”。这是那个没有冲击的时代的少数遗物之一。

I shake my head. "Black."  
我摇了摇头。“黑咖啡。”

On her left, hanging over the stove, is a picture of the three of us on the beach back when we lived in Panama. I have to be at least five years old, before the war. My mother has a red and white striped bathing suit, a pair of aviators atop her head. She's looking at me, in the middle of saying something while I'm covered in sand from the half-built castle between my legs. Dad is standing behind us with his hand on her back, the light of the sun casting a glare that hides his face.  
在她左边，挂在炉子上方的是我们三人在巴拿马海滩的照片，那时我们还住在那里。我至少得有五岁，战前。妈妈穿着红白条纹的泳衣，头上戴着一副飞行员墨镜。她正看着我，似乎在说什么，而我则被沙子覆盖，双腿间是一座半成品的城堡。爸爸站在我们身后，手搭在她的背上，阳光的照射让他的脸庞变得模糊不清。

When I was young, my mother took family pictures obsessively. We had at least five full-to-bursting photo albums that covered the day I was born 'till I was seven. I'm sure they're still around somewhere, stuffed in a closet or collecting dust up in the attic. When her nightmares became more prevalent and dad's episodes got worse, I recognized what all of the picture taking and false grins were really for.  
小时候，妈妈对拍家庭照有着近乎痴迷的热情。我们至少有五本满满当当的相册，从我出生那天起记录到我七岁。我确信它们还在某个地方，要么塞在橱柜里，要么在阁楼上积灰。当她的噩梦愈发频繁，爸爸的状况也恶化时，我才明白那些拍照和虚假笑容背后的真正用意。

If she captured enough moments of us smiling, doing something mundane, she could bury all the awful memories she didn't want under an ever growing pile of happier ones. She could pretend that we weren't such a broken family if we appeared normal on the outside.  
如果她捕捉到足够多我们微笑的瞬间，记录下那些平凡的日常，她就能将所有不想回忆的糟糕记忆埋藏在不断增长的快乐记忆之下。如果我们外表看起来正常，她就可以假装我们不是一个如此破碎的家庭。

The high-pitched whine of a small aircraft echoes over the hills, eliciting ripples of anxiety down my skin.  
一架小型飞机的高亢嗡鸣在山丘间回荡，激起我皮肤上一阵焦虑的涟漪。

Mother peers past me, and I don't have to wonder at what for long.  
母亲透过我向外张望，我不必多想便知道她在寻找什么。

The back door creaks, my father standing in the threshold. His shears clatter to the floor and his eyes are ablaze, livid – it runs ice through my veins. Mother stiffens, watching as he shuffles in and sits down at their red armchair, slowly, staring at nothing, working his jaw back and forth. He bends to untie his shoes. The laces stutter in his shaking hands, fingers scratching the leather as he tries to undo them. He can't quite piece it together: how exactly to unravel the knot, and curses under his breath.  
后门吱嘎作响，父亲站在门槛上。他的剪刀掉落在地，眼中燃烧着怒火，狂怒至极——这让我感到冰冷刺骨。母亲僵硬地站着，看着他蹒跚而入，缓缓坐到他们的红色扶手椅上，目光空洞，来回磨动着下巴。他弯腰解鞋带，颤抖的手中鞋带打结，手指在皮革上抓挠，试图解开。他无法完全理清：究竟如何解开这个结，嘴里低声咒骂着。

My back touches the counter before I realize I've taken several steps back, while my mother sits on her haunches in front of him, touching his knees. I see their lips moving, but the words are so soft I couldn't possibly discern what's being said.  
我的背部触碰到柜台，才意识到自己已后退了几步，而母亲则蹲在他面前，轻触他的膝盖。我看到他们的嘴唇在动，但话语太过轻柔，我无法听清他们在说什么。

After a while he takes in this big breath of air, in and out through his nose, doing everything he can to avoid my eyes. His hands are still trembling when mom helps him up and walks with him down the hall to their room. Right out of the hospital and here she is taking care of him again. My stomach flips and a sharp pain bites into my palms, where I've nearly broken the skin from squeezing my fingers so tight.  
过了一会儿，他深吸一口气，通过鼻子呼出，竭尽全力避开我的目光。当妈妈扶他起身，陪他走过走廊进入他们的房间时，他的手仍在颤抖。刚从医院出来，她又开始照顾他了。我的胃一阵翻腾，剧痛咬噬着我的手掌，那里因我紧握手指而几乎破皮。

A cold breeze flutters in through the still open back door, which clacks against the outside wall. I pull it close and pick up the shears, unsure of where they belong, and sit them on the bartop by a pair of peppermint candles.  
一阵冷风从仍敞开的后门吹入，门撞击着外墙发出声响。我关上门，拿起剪刀，不确定它们该放在哪里，便将它们搁在吧台上的一对薄荷蜡烛旁。

Mother's heels click along the floorboards when she comes back into the living room, fixing her hair some and evading my gaze.  
母亲的高跟鞋在地板上发出清脆的声响，当她回到客厅时，整理了一下头发，避开了我的目光。

"I thought you said he was getting better."  
“我以为你说他正在好转。”

"Stop it," she sighs, trying to put some bite in her voice. She comes to stand by the coffee pot, a hand touching her forehead, before it slides some renegade hair from her face. "I told you he's–"  
“别说了，”她叹息道，试图在声音中加入一些严厉。她走到咖啡壶旁，一只手抚着额头，随后将一缕散乱的头发从脸上拨开。“我告诉过你他——”

"I didn't want to come here," the words rush out before I can stop. My nerves are digging their claws into my muscles and I know the medication isn't working like it's supposed to.  
"我本不想来这里的，" 话脱口而出，我来不及阻止。紧张感如利爪般抓挠着我的肌肉，我知道药物并没有像预期那样起效。

She barks something between a sigh and a laugh, shaking her head. "Yeah, it's just too much asking my own son to come home after I get out of the hospital."  
她发出一声介于叹息和笑声之间的声音，摇了摇头。"是啊，只是要求我自己的儿子在我出院后回家，这要求太过分了。"

"Don't start that," I snap, voice rising, "I came to see you because I was worried. I didn't plan on turning this into some reunion."  
"别这么说，" 我厉声道，声音提高，"我来见你是出于担心。我并没有打算把这变成什么重聚。"

"Then why bother? Because you felt guilty?"  
"那又何必呢？因为你感到内疚？"

"Of course I did – I haven't seen you in years. But I left so I wouldn't have to deal with his insanity anymore!"  
"当然内疚了——我好几年没见到你了。但我离开就是为了不再忍受他的疯狂！"

I earn a scathing glare for that and she crosses her arms. "It must have been so hard having two parents that ever gave a damn about you."  
我因此得到了一个尖锐的白眼，她交叉双臂。“有两个真正关心你的父母，一定很难熬吧。”

"You know what he was like!" I throw a hand towards the hall. "Why the hell would I want to be back in this house?"  
"你知道他是什么样的人！" 我朝走廊挥了挥手。"我为什么要回到这个鬼地方？"

"Because we're your family!" she shouts, incredulous. "This is your home!"  
"因为我们是你的家人！" 她难以置信地喊道。"这是你的家！"

"Since when?!" I laugh, shaking my head, eyes wide because I can't believe what I'm hearing. "Dad made us _miserable_! He wasn't a father! When are you going to wake up and realize he's _never_ going to change?!"  
"从什么时候开始？！" 我笑着摇头，眼睛睁得大大的，因为我无法相信自己听到的话。"爸爸让我们痛苦不堪！他不是个好父亲！你什么时候才能醒悟，意识到他永远不会改变？！"

A slap rings out, a sharp sting warming my left cheek. I don't even remember her coming so close or raising her hand. Something festering and putrid sits in my lungs and weighs them down, boiling hot. I stop a hand from rising to touch the angry red mark on my face, trying to stand tall and calm despite how hard my heart is hammering.  
一记耳光响起，左颊火辣辣地刺痛。我甚至不记得她何时靠得这么近，或是何时举起了手。肺里仿佛有腐烂发臭的东西沉甸甸地压着，滚烫如沸。我强忍着不去抚摸脸上那道愤怒的红痕，努力站得笔直，保持平静，尽管心跳得如此剧烈。

She steps back, holding her hand at the wrist as the blindfold of rage falls. In a moment, she looks scared and there's that hurt in her eyes too. To my right there's a picture of us smiling on the wall, mocking me.  
她后退一步，手腕托着手，愤怒的蒙眼布似乎落下了。此刻，她看起来惊恐万分，眼中也流露出伤痛。我右侧的墙上挂着我们微笑的照片，嘲讽着我。

She sits on the couch, defeated. "_'Why can't you just get over it?'_ they'd say," she croaks, finding her voice. "_'Just put it behind you'_," she shakes her head, summoning old reserves of resentment. "Like we could just forget everything if we wished hard enough."  
她颓然坐在沙发上。“‘为什么你就不能放下呢？’他们会这么说，”她嘶哑地找回自己的声音，“‘就把它抛在脑后吧’，”她摇摇头，唤起了旧日的怨恨。“好像我们只要足够努力地许愿，就能忘记一切似的。”

Like that she steals my anger away, bringing clarity to my reeling thoughts. She doesn't say anything more for a while and eventually I sit down next to her. There's no acknowledgment, not from her bright blue eyes that can't look up from the floor – and it kills me. Myshka has found his way inside again, rubbing himself against my mother's legs. She doesn't smile this time, indulging his silent request for scratches.  
就像她偷走了我的愤怒，让我的思绪清晰起来。她好一会儿没再说什么，最终我坐到了她旁边。她没有任何表示，那双明亮的蓝眼睛始终盯着地板，这让我心如刀绞。Myshka 又钻了进来，蹭着我母亲的腿。这次她没有笑，只是满足了他无声的挠痒请求。

"You were eight by the time we were able to get him evaluated," she says, bringing the cat up to her lap. "The psychiatrist diagnosed him as bipolar, prescribed medication and called it a day. It was bullshit and I knew it – he didn't have any of the symptoms. I told them so, but if he ever got worse, they'd just double the dosage. During one of his visits to the unit, I was arranging to get him assigned to another specialist, but while they had him all doped up, the physician we already had made him sign an AMA release form. Then they tell me since he signed it, he can't be reevaluated until he admits himself under the same physician's care."  
“你八岁时我们才得以让他接受评估，”她说着，把猫抱到膝上，“精神科医生诊断他为双相情感障碍，开了药就打发走了。那完全是胡扯，我知道——他根本没有那些症状。我告诉他们了，但如果他情况恶化，他们只会加大剂量。有一次他来单位，我正安排让他转给另一位专家，但他们给他用药后，我们原来的医生让他签了一份自愿出院表格。然后他们告诉我，既然他签了字，就不能再接受评估，除非他自己主动在同一位医生那里接受治疗。”

I'm hanging onto every word, latched to the bitterness I hear in her voice. The same kind of frustration I'm all too acquainted with.  
我紧抓着她说的每一个字，被她声音中的苦涩所吸引。那种我再熟悉不过的挫败感，如出一辙。

"It was the same crap with every other doctor we tried to go to. If you complained they'd scream 'if you don't like it, leave!'... even when he was diagnosed with PTSD, we had to fight for years just to get the VA to cover him. They didn't count him as a veteran since he never signed any enlistment papers with NERV. There was a group here in Arizona that helped us out though, vouched for him. A bunch of ex-JSSDF, First Airborne Brigade."  
我们尝试过的每一个医生都是同样的套路。如果你抱怨，他们就会大喊‘不喜欢就走人！’……即使他被诊断出 PTSD，我们也得奋斗多年才能让退伍军人事务部为他提供保障。因为他从未与 NERV 签署过任何入伍文件，所以他们不承认他是退伍军人。不过，在亚利桑那州有一个组织帮了我们，为他担保。那是一群前日本自卫队第一空降旅的退役军人。

_Special Operations Group_. I think, recognizing the name from back when I still had top-secret security clearance. Ranger-qualified Japanese troops trained by Delta Force way back in 2003 after Old Tokyo was nuked. I recall the bald gentleman Yoshiya and how genuine his grin was. I try to imagine him as a soldier garbed in black with an assault rifle in hand. I imagine he and a brigade armed to the teeth storm into NERV to combat giant machines called Evas. I can't quite see it, only ever hearing the battle mentioned in fifth grade with any level of detail. Officially, it's referred to as the Siege of Tokyo-3, unofficially, most people know it as the New Year's Eve Massacre. I've heard all the associated horror stories. They must be true for him to earn such long-standing and unfiltered disdain from my mother.  
特种作战小组。我想，这个名字在我还拥有绝密安全权限的时候就有所耳闻。2003 年，在旧东京被核打击后，由游骑兵训练的日本士兵。我记得那位光头的吉也先生，他那真诚的笑容。我试图想象他身着黑色军装，手持突击步枪的模样。想象他和装备精良的部队冲进 NERV，对抗名为 Eva 的巨型机器。我难以完全想象，只在五年级时听人详细提及过这场战斗。官方称之为东京-3 围城战，非官方则多称其为除夕大屠杀。我听过所有相关的恐怖故事。这些故事必定真实，否则他不会招致我母亲如此长久且毫不掩饰的鄙视。

"Everything seemed to be going okay," she goes on. Myshka has settled in her lap, quickly falling asleep under her nimble fingers. "Then your dad... he had a really bad one five years ago and... god, he took so many pills. He was admitted to Saint Luke's and had to stay there for four months. I wasn't even allowed to see him for the first two weeks he was on suicide watch. Even after, visiting hours were only on the weekends. He's going regularly now for check ups."  
"一切似乎都在顺利进行，"她继续说道。Myshka 已经安顿在她的腿上，很快就在她灵巧的手指下睡着了。"然后你爸爸...五年前他经历了一次非常严重的...天啊，他吃了那么多药。他被送进了圣卢克医院，不得不在那里住了四个月。我甚至在最初的两个星期里都不能去看他，因为他在接受自杀监视。即便之后，也只有周末才能探视。他现在定期去复查。"

"I didn't know." it's a weak excuse and not the apology she deserves. My cheek still stings a little.  
"我不知道。"这是个苍白的借口，不是她应得的道歉。我的脸颊还有点刺痛。

"It's taken a long time, but he has – he _is_ getting better. We both are."  
"虽然花了很长时间，但他已经——他正在好转。我们俩都是。"

I don't want to believe her, at least about my father. The idea that, after all these years, he might finally be able to operate under some normalcy makes me feel... cheated. Like his recovery invalidates everything we had to go through before.  
我不想相信她，至少关于我父亲的事。这么多年来，他终于可能恢复正常生活的想法让我感到……被欺骗了。仿佛他的康复否定了我们之前所经历的一切。

"Do you still have nightmares?" I ask.  
“你还做噩梦吗？”我问道。

Instead of answering, she moves Myshka and gets up to stick her cold mug of coffee in the microwave. I hold back a grimace and join her in the kitchen, where she pours me a cup of scalding caffeine.  
她没有回答，而是移动了 Myshka，起身把那杯冰凉的咖啡放进微波炉。我忍住皱眉，跟着她走进厨房，她在那里给我倒了一杯滚烫的咖啡因。

She casts a glance my way, flashing a forced smirk. "Are you and that Marina girl still together?"  
她朝我这边瞥了一眼，强挤出一个假笑。“你和那个玛丽娜女孩还在一起吗？”

"Yes, why?" I ask, sliding into a chair. Misato must have been keeping her up to date. Still, the shift in mood and subject is jarring, unsettling. I'm surprised that our fight didn't escalate to me being kicked out again. She must really want me to stay. It just brings my guilt barreling down tenfold, and I'm more than willing to forget we ever fought today if she is.  
“是的，怎么了？”我边问边滑进椅子。美里肯定一直在向她更新情况。尽管如此，情绪和话题的转变还是令人震惊，不安。我惊讶于我们的争吵没有再次升级到我被赶出去的地步。她一定真的很想让我留下。这让我感到的愧疚感猛增十倍，如果她愿意，我更愿意忘记我们今天争吵过。

"Just _asking_ – getting married?" metal clinks against ceramic as she mixes her coffee and I don't like her coy tone at all.  
“只是问问——要结婚了吗？”她搅拌咖啡时金属勺碰击瓷杯的声音响起，我不喜欢她那种狡黠的语气。

My eyebrows twitch with a glower. "Not anytime soon, no."  
我的眉毛因怒气而抽动。“短期内不会，不会。”

"So grouchy," she pouts, setting my mug down and sitting across from me. Both hands wrap around her cup and she takes a sip. "The whole ceremony is overrated anyway. Why waste the money when you can just sign some papers and be done with it?"  
“真是个暴脾气，”她噘嘴说道，放下我的杯子，坐在我对面。双手环抱着她的杯子，喝了一口。“整个仪式本来就过誉了。既然可以签几份文件就搞定，何必浪费那笔钱呢？”

"So what about your ring?" I chuckle, gesturing.  
“那你的戒指呢？”我轻笑，示意道。

Her tongue clicks. "I told your dad I didn't need one. Sentimental fool bought us a pair anyway," she says, but I can see the glint in her eyes. She'll never admit she loves having the ring. They've been married for thirty-four years, couldn't say where or when or how. It hits home that I don't know much of anything about my parents at all. They're complete strangers to me. Who were they before they had me? What did they do before they met? How did they meet? All I have is a handful of moments, glimpses into a larger life marred with black memories that aren't talked about.  
她咂了咂舌。“我跟你爸说我用不着这个。结果那个多愁善感的傻瓜还是给我们买了对儿，”她说着，但我能从她眼中看到闪烁的光芒。她永远不会承认自己喜欢这枚戒指。他们已经结婚三十四年了，说不清是在哪里、何时、又是如何相遇的。这让我意识到，我对父母的了解少得可怜。他们对我来说完全是陌生人。在我出生之前，他们是谁？相遇之前，他们过着怎样的生活？又是如何相识的？我所拥有的，不过是一些零星的瞬间，窥视着他们那充满黑色记忆、未曾提及的过往。

I look at the pictures that surround us. If not for them, I wouldn't believe my parents were ever those people from before – people that were able to smile and laugh.  
我环顾四周的照片。若非这些照片，我几乎无法相信我的父母曾经是那样的人——那些能够微笑和欢笑的人。

We talk for a while longer, doing our best to forget the fight and tip toe around other subjects. Dad is growing watermelons outside and tries to keep track of the flight schedules from the Airbase so he isn't caught off guard when they pass over. He can't predict all of them. Just a year ago he also made a trip up to Chicago-2 to visit the Aida's. Mom couldn't take part, still busy with her work at the lab in Mesa. She complains a bit about her staff, but it's just good to hear she's finally decided to delegate some of the work.  
我们又聊了一会儿，尽力忘记刚才的争执，小心翼翼地避开其他敏感话题。爸爸在外面种西瓜，还试图记住空军基地的飞行时刻表，以免飞机飞过时措手不及。他无法预测所有的情况。就在一年前，他还去了芝加哥二号城拜访艾达一家。妈妈没能同行，因为她还在梅萨的实验室忙于工作。她抱怨了几句她的员工，但听到她终于决定分担一些工作，还是让人感到欣慰。

The sun has set and it's only seven o'clock. I make up some excuse about having to catch the bus back to my hotel soon. She doesn't offer me a room to stay in for the night, knowing what my answer will be.  
太阳已经落山，现在才七点钟。我找了个借口，说很快就得赶回酒店的公交车。她没有提出让我留宿一晚，因为她知道我的答案会是什么。

Fingers playing around her mug, she asks, "Will you stay for dinner?"  
她的手指在杯子上绕来绕去，问道：“你会留下来吃晚饭吗？”

I pause at the sink, setting my empty coffee cup on the adjacent counter. "Some other time," I say, moving to take my jacket from the couch. "My flight leaves at nine tomorrow."  
我在水槽边停下，将空咖啡杯放在旁边的台面上。“改天吧，”我说着，走向沙发拿起我的夹克。“我明早九点的飞机。”

Her lips purse. "We'll give you a ride to the airport, then."  
她抿了抿唇。“那我们送你去机场。”

Her tone makes it sound like a suggestion, as if she's asking permission this time. I don't object. A short walk down the hall, we pause at the threshold as I step outside. Now that I'm about to leave, there's suddenly so much more I want to say. I couldn't wait to get out of here earlier, and now I don't know if I want to go.  
她的语气听起来像是在提议，仿佛这次是在征求我的同意。我没有反对。我们沿着走廊走了一段，在门口停下，我踏出门外。现在我即将离开，突然间有太多话想说。之前我迫不及待想离开这里，而现在我却不知道是否还想走。

"Be safe," mom says. "小心点，" 妈妈说。

"I will." "我会的。"

The door hesitates for a moment before closing and my feet are stuck to the spot, the words I didn't know I wanted to hear lost behind it. I've left them here for eight years. I ran as far and as fast as I could at the first opportunity and never looked back. I used to be proud of that. I'd made the great escape, against all odds. I'd broken out of that prison and made a life for myself in the north.  
门犹豫了一会儿才关上，我的双脚像被钉在原地，那些我不知道自己渴望听到的话语被隔绝在门后。我已经离开他们八年了。一有机会，我就尽可能远、尽可能快地逃离，再也没有回头。我曾为此感到自豪。我克服重重困难，实现了伟大的逃脱。我从那座监狱中挣脱出来，在北方为自己创造了一个生活。

When I take a step back and really look, I haven't done much of anything since then, have I?  
当我退后一步，真正审视自己时，我发现自那以后我并没有做什么，是吗？

At the hotel, I call Marina. She fills our conversation with all of the trivialities of her past couple of days, updates me on all the latest drama between her friends. I spend an hour feigning interest, until I manage to convince her I need to sleep. What Jessica said behind Amber's back is the farthest thing from my mind after today.  
在酒店，我给玛丽娜打电话。她把过去几天的琐事一股脑儿地倾诉给我，还更新了她朋友们之间的最新八卦。我花了整整一个小时假装感兴趣，直到终于说服她我需要睡觉。今天之后，杰西卡在安柏背后说的话已经离我脑海最远。

"I love you," she says and I hope my response doesn't sound hollow.  
“我爱你，”她说，我希望我的回应听起来不那么空洞。

"I love you, too." "我也爱你。"

I hang up, set my phone down on the nightstand. The AC clicks on, pooling cold air down to the floor and around my feet, still set to 68 like I left it this morning. I think to turn it up, but my legs can't seem to move. Even the notion of getting up is too exhausting to entertain.  
我挂断电话，把手机放在床头柜上。空调启动了，冷气汇聚到地板，环绕在我的脚边，依然设定在今早我离开时的 68 度。我想调高温度，但双腿似乎动弹不得。甚至连起床的念头都显得太过疲惫，无法去想。

I'll be going back to D.C. tomorrow. The thought of it doesn't sit quite right in my mind, reliving my father trying to untie his shoes and my mother desperately grasping for something normal.  
我明天就要回华盛顿了。这个念头在我脑海中挥之不去，重现父亲试图解开鞋带和我母亲拼命抓住某种正常感的情景。

_Home_.

**Author's Notes: 作者笔记：**

Not the greatest, but not terrible considering it was written in two days.  
不算最好，但考虑到是两天内写成的，也不算糟糕。

_Schatzi_: from the German word _Schatz_, which translates to 'treasure', usually a term of endearment used in the same way we say 'darling' or 'sweetheart'. Adding the 'i' at the end turns it into more of a pet name and is meant to show affection.  
Schatzi：源自德语单词 Schatz，意为‘珍宝’，通常作为一种亲昵的称呼，类似于我们说的‘亲爱的’或‘甜心’。在词尾加上‘i’使其更像一个昵称，用以表达爱意。

_Myshka_: Russian for 'little mouse'.  
米什卡：俄语中意为“小老鼠”。

### Interlude V

A nuclear bomb from the Third World War, sudden climate change and encroaching sea levels made most of the American West Coast uninhabitable, and very low on peoples _'places I'd like to live'_ lists.  
第三次世界大战中的核弹、突如其来的气候变化以及不断上升的海平面，使得美国西海岸大部分地区变得不适宜居住，在人们‘我想居住的地方’清单上排名极低。

There were a few small hamlets wringing out a meager existence for themselves, staying far from the irradiated shores of San Francisco, and certainly sticking to the east below the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most of the Californian coast had been swept up greedily by the sea, the waters reclaiming what was rightfully theirs after the Fault Line gave in 2028, the 9.0 magnitude quakes starting in Mexico and traveling north. The aftershocks lasted for weeks and the fires, carried far and wide by the dry winds blowing inland, thoroughly cleansed the coast of anything that managed to survive the Impacts. Even four decades after the Third, half-sunken cities continue their slow collapse, many more once bustling hubs of a rich and prosperous civilization left to decay. A crippled populous moved north to one of the few safe havens left in California – Sacramento, which has doubled in size since.  
仍有几个小村落勉强维持着生计，远离旧金山辐射污染的海岸，并且坚决停留在内华达山脉以东。大部分加州海岸已被海水贪婪地吞噬，2028 年断层线崩溃后，9.0 级地震从墨西哥向北蔓延，海水重新夺回了本属于它们的地方。余震持续了数周，干燥的陆风将大火远远带入内陆，彻底清除了海岸上任何侥幸生还的生物。即使是在第三次世界大战结束四十年后，半沉没的城市仍在缓慢崩塌，更多曾经繁华的文明中心被遗弃，任其腐朽。一个残破的群体向北迁移，前往加州仅存的几个避难所之一——萨克拉门托，这座城市自那时起规模已翻倍。

For the much younger, and arguably stupider, generation it had turned into a kind of coming of age ritual to journey down crumbling roads into the areas where the toxicity had abated, high on opiates as they explore the ruins of a dead world.  
对于那些更年轻、可以说也更愚蠢的一代人来说，沿着破败的道路深入到毒性已消散的区域，成了某种成人仪式。他们在鸦片的作用下，探索着这个死寂世界的废墟。

In the wake of The Collapse, Arizona fell back into a lawless frontier, vying for control against rabid, zealous refugees and outlaws that had nowhere else to go, yet refused to stay in their shattered corner of the world.  
在《崩溃》之后，亚利桑那州再次沦为无法无天的边疆，与狂热、虔诚的难民和无处可去的亡命之徒争夺控制权，他们不愿留在自己支离破碎的世界角落。

In the two years after the Bloody Sunday of 2033 that ended rioting in Phoenix, we arrived in Flagstaff by way of the beat up Honda I'd sat in the back of since I was two. A twenty-six hour drive through five states – an added hour for each border crossed, made longer still as our sojourn took us through a Texas gripped by martial law. We stopped at a gas station in Amarillo, where I watched a Bible Burning in front of an old church across the way, riot police keeping outraged onlookers at bay. A precursor look at life in the West.  
在 2033 年血腥星期日结束凤凰城骚乱后的两年里，我们乘坐那辆破旧的本田车抵达了弗拉格斯塔夫，自从我两岁起就坐在车后座。穿越五个州的二十六小时车程——每过一道边境就多加一小时，而我们的旅程还经过了实行戒严的德克萨斯州，使得时间更长。我们在阿马里洛的一个加油站停下，我看到对面一座旧教堂前正在焚烧圣经，防暴警察将愤怒的旁观者挡在外面。这是对西部生活的一次预览。

I'd heard of them, but never actually seen one. An angry response from a disillusioned following. The old Christian God had sat by and done nothing as man-made gods brought an end to the world. Or so the story went, depending on who you asked. Our family had been forced to flee Florida because of the New Trinity religions. A handful of the orthodox branches had managed to track us down, trying to get my parents to endorse their particular brand of crazy. I didn't understand it until my college roommate, belonging to the Thodorisian Unification Church, gave me a very brief and very belittling run down.  
我听说过他们，但从未真正见过。一个幻灭追随者的愤怒回应。当人为的神明终结世界时，古老的基督教神却袖手旁观。或者这就是故事的版本，取决于你问谁。我们一家被迫逃离佛罗里达，因为新三位一体宗教。一些正统分支设法找到了我们，试图让我的父母支持他们那套疯狂的理念。直到我的大学室友，属于西奥多里安统一教会，给了我一个简短且轻蔑的解释，我才开始理解。

My parents were Chosen. They'd lived in Tokyo-3, what many of the orthodoxy considered holy ground now. These people were sought after, regarded as saints and prophets. Or something like that.  
我的父母是被选中的人。他们曾住在东京-3，那里现在被许多正统派视为圣地。这些人备受追捧，被视为圣人和先知。或者类似的东西。

Flagstaff was situated on a mountain, smack dab in the middle of a sprawl of forests encompassing Coconino County. A good place to get lost. In the front hall of my parent's Catalina residence, there's a photo of me and dad in that old home outside of town, covered in mud as our dog Frau set about digging up the yard just after the rains. In it, I'm helping her dig out one of the holes, my dad somehow caught up in the mess, but happy to help nonetheless.  
旗杆市坐落于一座山上，正好处在科科尼诺县一片广袤森林的中心。是个容易迷失的好地方。在我父母卡特琳娜住所的前厅里，有一张我和爸爸在镇外老家的照片，那时我们浑身是泥，我们的狗弗劳正忙着在雨后刨地。照片中，我正帮她挖其中一个洞，爸爸不知怎么也卷入了这场混乱，但仍然乐意帮忙。

We looked happy. Like a real family.  
我们看起来很幸福。像一个真正的家庭。

In later pictures, my father is in almost none of them, yet I still smiled big for the camera. Anyone but me wouldn't be able to tell that it was fake. I got good at pretending I was happy. I learned from the best, afterall. The dog from the picture, a Boxer pup named Frau, disappeared from the family albums around the same time. It's funny the good memories you forget when all you carry are the bad ones.  
在后来的照片中，几乎看不到我父亲的身影，但我仍然对着镜头笑得灿烂。除了我，没人能看出那是假的。我擅长假装快乐。毕竟，我是从最好的榜样那里学来的。照片中的那只斗牛犬幼崽，名叫弗劳，大约在同一时间从家庭相册中消失了。当你只带着糟糕的记忆时，那些美好的回忆就会变得可笑地被遗忘。

It was September and we had just moved to Arizona, ripping me away from the little network of friends I'd managed to build. As some sort of weird apology, my father took me to one of the local animal shelters so I could pick a dog to bring home. I already hated living in Flagstaff, away from the warm beaches, and stuck in this miserable forest trapped between mountains. I didn't want to go out looking for a dog. I didn't learn how to stand up to my parents until I was sixteen, and never had the courage to until I was nineteen.  
那是九月，我们刚搬到亚利桑那州，把我从好不容易建立起来的小朋友圈中硬生生拽走。为了某种奇怪的道歉，父亲带我去了当地的一家动物收容所，让我挑一只狗带回家。我已经讨厌住在弗拉格斯塔夫，远离温暖的沙滩，被困在这座夹在山间的凄凉森林里。我不想出去找狗。直到十六岁我才学会如何对父母说不，而且直到十九岁才有勇气这么做。

So off we went. 于是我们就出发了。

At the front office, a frumpy middle-aged woman with a mole stricken cheek, mouth smacking with a piece of gum, nods us towards the back. Dad leads the way, until a skin and bones kennel master ushers us in with all the zeal of an undertaker, a wide ring of keys jingling at his belt. He introduces us to a narrow hall with a high pointed ceiling. Chainlink cells ring, barking wails bouncing off the cinder block walls and howling down to us. A ceiling fan creaks as it swings lazily overhead, making the light from the high window slits blink as the blades cut through it.  
在前台办公室，一位邋遢的中年妇女，脸颊上有一颗痣，嘴里嚼着口香糖，点头示意我们往后走。爸爸领路，直到一个骨瘦如柴的收容所管理员带着殡仪员般的热情把我们迎了进去，腰间挂着一串叮当作响的大钥匙。他带我们进入一条狭窄的走廊，高高的尖顶天花板。铁丝网围成的笼子环绕四周，吠叫声在煤渣砖墙上回荡，向我们咆哮而来。天花板上的风扇懒洋洋地摆动着，叶片切割着从高窗缝隙透进的光线，使其闪烁不定。

Dad has to touch a hand to my back to convince me forward. I want to leave, it feels wrong here. He doesn't care. It doesn't matter that this is something his son didn't want to begin with, he has to do something to assuage his guilt.  
爸爸不得不把手放在我的背上，催促我向前。我想离开，这里让我感觉不对劲。他不在乎。这原本就不是他儿子想做的事，但他必须做些什么来减轻自己的内疚。

The mutts are pressed up against their cages, yapping, whimpering. The further in we move, the more trapped I am. A German Shepherd smacks into the fence on my right and, startled, I tumble in front of another pen. There's a dog within who isn't in a mad frenzy for affection or even cursory acknowledgment to feed their insecurity. It's worse than that, something more terrible than a love-starved pup. Her copper eyes are afflicted with something I've already seen, even if it doesn't have a name for me. A soggy corner of the cinder block wall has been made her home, no more worry given for warmth or comfort.  
那些杂种狗紧贴着笼子，吠叫着，呜咽着。我们越往里走，我越感到被困。一只德国牧羊犬撞到我右边的栅栏上，我吓了一跳，跌倒在另一个围栏前。里面有一只狗，它并没有陷入疯狂的求爱或甚至只是为了得到一点关注来填补不安。情况比那更糟，比一个渴望爱的幼崽更可怕。她那铜色的眼睛里有着我已经见过的东西，尽管我还不知道它的名字。她把混凝土墙的一个潮湿角落当作了家，不再担心温暖或舒适。

Nothing left to do but die.  
除了等死，别无他法。

Fingers snagging into the links, I scan the plastic protected sheet with her adoption information.  
手指勾住铁链，我仔细查看塑料保护膜下的领养信息。

I touch a word I've never seen before. "What's that mean?"  
我触摸到一个从未见过的单词。“那是什么意思？”

Dad's hand is there under my arm to help me up. He squints, shifting his glasses. "It means they're going to put her down soon. They don't have enough space in the kennels and no one's adopted her."  
爸爸的手臂在我腋下支撑着我起身。他眯起眼睛，调整了一下眼镜。“这意味着他们很快就要让她安乐死了。犬舍空间不足，也没有人领养她。”

"What's wrong with her? How come no one wants her?"  
“她怎么了？为什么没人要她？”

I hear the cartilage in his knees as he squats, peering into the cage with me. "She's older than most... and she's been to war," he answers, struggling for further explanation. There's nothing else he needs to say. I'm still fairly young, but to me, _war_ is a black word, something whispered while glancing over your shoulder for fear of being caught even uttering it.  
我听到他蹲下时膝盖软骨的声音，他和我一起朝笼子里看。“她比大多数都年长……而且她经历过战争，”他回答道，努力寻找更多的解释。他没有必要再说别的了。我虽然还年轻，但在我看来，战争是个黑色的词汇，是那种需要偷偷瞥一眼四周以防被人听见才敢低声说出的东西。

_War_ means tears and wide-eyed terror.  
战争意味着泪水和惊恐的瞪眼。

_War_ means you're broken and no one can ever fix you.  
战争意味着你支离破碎，无人能将你修复。

"Is she ever going to get better?" I ask, gripping the cage tight.  
“她会好起来吗？”我紧握着笼子问道。

"She's a survivor," dad says, flashing me a rare smile. He stands, a hand motioning the kennel master over. He already knows which one I want. The jailer shoos me away as he slams a key into the lock.  
“她是个幸存者，”爸爸说着，罕见地对我露出了微笑。他站起身，一手示意犬舍主人过来。他早已知道我想要哪一只。狱卒将我赶开，随即用钥匙猛地插入锁中。

My father's calloused hand touches the back of my neck. "And now she's got you."  
我父亲那长满老茧的手触碰着我的后颈。“现在她把你也搞定了。”

The boxer girl perks up, perhaps wondering what more there is to endure before she is allowed to rest. She stands as the kennel master hooks a leash to her collar, her little nub of a tail wiggling.  
拳击女孩精神一振，或许在想还要忍受些什么才能得到休息。她站起身来，犬舍主人将牵引绳钩在她的项圈上，她那小巧的尾巴欢快地摇摆着。

As she's escorted out, she sniffs, fervent, her nose just isn't big enough to get every little scent and she isn't satisfied until she's staring me right in the face. Then a lick, straight over my lips – and another, my cheek, her big flat pink tongue is determined to cover my face in saliva. I duck my head, laughing, but the tide keeps coming and she settles for licking my hair.  
当她被带出去时，她急切地嗅着，鼻子不够大，无法捕捉到每一丝细微的气味，直到她直直地盯着我看，才感到满足。然后她舔了一下，直接越过我的嘴唇——又一下，我的脸颊，她那宽大粉红的舌头决心要把我的脸涂满口水。我低下头，笑着躲避，但口水攻势不断，她便转而舔起了我的头发。

Papers are signed, checks written and then we're on our way back home, with a passenger that is not content to bark at just _one_ passerby.  
文件已签署，支票已填写，随后我们带着一位不满足于只对一个路人吠叫的乘客踏上归途。

"Absolutely not." mother says as we walk through the door, swiping the smile from my face. I see the fire that flares in her eyes, a passivity born of practiced control holding her expression as she turns back to the sink.  
“绝对不行。”母亲一边说着，一边推门而入，她的这句话让我的笑容瞬间消失。我看到她眼中燃起的怒火，一种由习惯性控制所孕育的被动性维持着她的表情，她转身回到水槽旁。

"Why?" I ask, glancing at my father, who faces the closet, frozen halfway to putting up his jacket. The water continues to rush and I'm not even graced with a look, the sleeves of mother's white blouse rolled up as she tends to the dishes.  
“为什么？”我问道，瞥了一眼父亲，他正对着衣柜，挂外套的动作僵在了半途。水流依旧哗哗作响，我甚至没有得到一个眼神，母亲的白衬衫袖子卷起，她正忙着洗碗。

"She's really nice, and dad said–"  
"她人真的很好，爸爸还说——"

"Enough." the edge in her voice cuts the line of protest in my throat, a dryness shriveling anything else to dust. The Boxer sits, panting, and I run my hands through her short brass toned fur. Only an idiot keeps fighting when they know they've been beaten – and only those in denial try to fight when the battle is lost before it even begins.  
"够了。" 她声音中的锋芒切断了我的抗议，喉咙里干涩得连其他话语都化为了尘埃。拳师犬喘着气坐下，我抚摸着它那短而呈黄铜色的毛。只有傻瓜才会明知败局已定还继续战斗——而那些不愿面对现实的人，才会在战斗开始前就已输掉的情况下还试图挣扎。

"We've already signed the papers," dad says, striding down the hall and setting said documents on the kitchen table.  
"我们已经签了文件，" 爸爸说着，大步走过走廊，将那些文件放在厨房桌上。

The sink knobs creak and the faucet ceases flowing, hands seeking a washcloth. Still she doesn't look at me. "Papers can be voided. Take it back."  
水槽旋钮吱嘎作响，水龙头停止了流水，双手摸索着找擦手巾。她依旧没有看我。“文件可以作废。收回它。”

"I let Kazuya pick a dog to bring home. She stays."  
“我让和也选了一只狗带回家。她留下了。”

There's something in his tone that pulls her attention, keeps it locked for a moment as she studies him – a predator sizing up a meal. Then they find me from across the room and I flinch, eyes I've seen warm and kind now frigid. I am not being regarded as a son who has tread on ice far too thin between parents without knowing, but more a peasant in the presence of royalty. It's callous, looking down at me from on high.  
他的语气中有种东西吸引了她的注意，让她凝视他片刻——像捕食者打量猎物。随后他们从房间另一头发现了我，我畏缩了一下，曾经温暖亲切的目光如今冰冷如霜。我并未被当作一个不慎踏足父母间薄冰之上的儿子，而更像是一个在皇室面前卑躬屈膝的平民。那种居高临下的俯视，冷漠无情。

"Do whatever you want, then," she says, casting my father a parting glare before taking her leave.  
"随你便吧，"她说着，临走前向我父亲投去一瞥怨色。

"Welcome home," I mutter to Frau, who brings my smile back with a lick.  
"欢迎回家，"我低声对弗劳说，她舔了我一下，让我重展笑颜。

Mother never quite let it go, often making some quip – especially if my father was in the room – about how she might go down to the pound and buy a dozen cats just because she felt like it.  
母亲对此事始终耿耿于怀，时常借题发挥——特别是当父亲在场时——说她可能会去收容所买上十几只猫，只因她一时兴起。

Meanwhile, Frau would be busy trying to catch her own nub.  
与此同时，弗劳会忙着试图抓住她自己的小尾巴。

What her original name was, I'll never know and for the first week we had her I couldn't decide on one that I liked. For a while we just called her "Girl". Despite the severe animosity she held towards the pup, Mom thought it was funny to call her Frau, and the name sort of stuck. Frau was as un-lady like as could be, in particular, towards the only other female in the house. At first I was the only one allowed to pet her, a snippy anxiety warning anyone else they best watch their fingers. Father eventually earned her trust, while mother had to worry her hand might become another chew toy if she ever risked it.  
她的原名是什么，我永远不会知道，而且在我们拥有她的第一个星期里，我无法决定一个我喜欢的名字。有一段时间，我们只是叫她“女孩”。尽管她对小狗怀有严重的敌意，妈妈觉得叫她弗劳很有趣，这个名字就这样留了下来。弗劳一点也不像淑女，尤其是对家里唯一的另一只雌性。起初，只有我被允许抚摸她，她会发出尖锐的警告，让其他人最好小心他们的手指。父亲最终赢得了她的信任，而母亲则担心如果她冒险伸手，手可能会变成另一个咀嚼玩具。

If me and Frau were playing, there was no time for anything else. If mom was trying to get me to do chores or even made to touch me as she passed, the Boxer would snarl and snip. One day, my mother had enough. She got between me and Frau, who barred her teeth and growled.  
如果我和弗劳在玩耍，就没有时间做其他事情了。如果妈妈试图让我做家务，甚至在我经过时试图触碰我，这只拳师犬就会咆哮和咬牙。有一天，我妈妈受够了。她站在我和弗劳之间，弗劳露出了牙齿并低吼。

"There's only room for one bitch in this house," mom said, leaning so close their noses nearly touched.  
"这个家里只能有一个泼妇," 妈妈说着，身体前倾，两人的鼻子几乎碰到了一起。

Frau jumped up, dragging her big, sloppy wet tongue full across mom's face. She howled in disgust and I laughed, while Frau pranced away. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought she was smiling.  
弗劳跳了起来，用她那又大又湿漉漉的舌头在妈妈的脸上狠狠舔了一遍。妈妈厌恶地大叫，而我则笑出声来，弗劳则得意洋洋地跑开了。如果我不了解情况，我可能会以为她在笑呢。

They were on better terms after that. Mom still very loudly proclaimed her dislike for the _Inz__ü__chtig k__ö__ter_.  
从那以后，他们的关系有所改善。妈妈仍然大声宣称她不喜欢那些近亲繁殖的狗。

As much as she was my friend, Frau was a bit like a second mother. In the Fall, getting home from school became a hassle, as I was made to endure a Frau-enforced checkpoint. She'd be lying on the porch, keeping a vigilant watch for me down the street. I had to stop at the driveway and wait, or else Frau would start barking and drive herself into a panic. She'd patrol the edges of the house, nose low to the ground. Once her rounds were complete, the building cleared, I was allowed inside.  
尽管弗劳是我的朋友，但她有点像我的第二个母亲。秋天放学回家成了件麻烦事，因为我得忍受弗劳强制执行的检查点。她会躺在门廊上，警惕地盯着街上的我。我必须在车道上停下来等待，否则弗劳就会开始吠叫，把自己吓得惊慌失措。她会沿着房子边缘巡逻，鼻子紧贴地面。一旦她完成了巡视，确认安全无虞，我才能被允许进屋。

My bed was her favorite spot to sleep. Often I'd wake up in the morning pressed against the wall because Frau had taken over the rest of the mattress. Along with this ability to move me without waking me at all, she possessed an amazing talent for manipulation. On the weeks where dad disappeared from the world and his family, a boxer dog could be found sitting in front of his door, making high-pitched whimpers that died into displeased grunts. Father couldn't ignore her for very long and he was rewarded with many licks, a noble prize.  
我的床是她最喜欢的睡觉地点。常常早上醒来时，我被挤到了墙边，因为弗劳占据了床的其余部分。除了这种能在不吵醒我的情况下移动我的能力，她还拥有惊人的操控天赋。在那些爸爸从世界和家人中消失的星期里，你会发现一只拳师犬坐在他门前，发出高音的呜咽声，然后变成不满的咕哝。父亲无法长时间忽视她，而他会得到许多舔舐作为奖赏，这是一份崇高的奖赏。

We spent two years in Flagstaff before better job opportunities prompted a move to the south. My parents bought a home in Catalina, reasonably sized and well furnished. Me and Frau experienced the dangers of cacti and sand snakes first hand for the next year. She made things bearable for a while, chasing away the loud, shivering panics of my father's episodes with her warmth.  
我们在弗拉格斯塔夫度过了两年，直到更好的工作机会促使我们南迁。父母在卡塔利娜买了一栋大小适中、家具齐全的房子。接下来的那一年，我和弗劳亲身经历了仙人掌和沙蛇的危险。她用她的温暖驱散了父亲发作时那令人颤抖的恐慌，让一切变得可以忍受。

It was Fall again when I came home and Frau wasn't at her usual post on the front porch. Instead, she had elected to take a nap on the back patio. Except she'd been baking in the sun for the past few hours, the smell of rot and evacuated bowels beginning to fester. Mom and dad were at work and they would be for another few hours. She was lying on her side, a few flies flitting around her face. At times I used to think of how sad I would feel if she died, but I didn't feel anything at that moment. Something happened to me, flipped a switch inside my brain, shutdown all non-necessary functions.  
当我回家时，又是秋天了，弗劳没有像往常一样在前门廊上。相反，她选择在后院露台上小睡。只是她已经在阳光下暴晒了几个小时，腐烂和排泄物的气味开始发酵。妈妈和爸爸还在上班，还要再过几个小时才能回来。她侧躺着，几只苍蝇在她脸旁飞舞。曾经我常想，如果她去世我会多么难过，但那一刻我什么感觉都没有。有什么东西触动了我，大脑里仿佛有个开关被翻转，关闭了所有非必要的功能。

I spent a while just staring at her, until my mind decided there was only one thing to do with a dead body. I didn't cry as I dragged her out into the yard, or as I yanked a shovel out of the shed. I started to dig in the tough desert soil, blunting the sheet steel against rocks and bulbous roots.  
我盯着她看了好一会儿，直到我的脑海里只剩下一个念头：处理一具尸体。我拖着她走到院子里，从棚子里拽出一把铁锹，没有流泪。我开始在坚硬的沙漠土壤中挖掘，锹刃在岩石和粗大的树根上变得钝了。

Boots crunched behind me, the sun a bit lower since I started, blisters bubbling on my fingers from the rough and untreated wood. I'd only managed a couple of feet, far too shallow for a burial. Without a word, my father took the shovel from my small hands, digging six feet deep and just wide enough to fit the old war dog. Frau's eyes were closed, her tongue hanging out and touching the sand. Grunting, dad hefted her in his arms and settled her in, careful not to jostle her neck. A hand grazed over her short-hair coat, whispered words lost in the dirt hole where he stayed for a time.  
身后传来靴子踩碎东西的声音，太阳已经西沉了一些，粗糙未处理的木柄让我的手指起了水泡。我只挖了几英尺深，远远不够埋葬她。父亲一言不发地从我手中接过铁锹，挖了一个六英尺深、刚好够放下这位老战士的坑。弗劳的眼睛闭着，舌头伸出，触碰着沙子。父亲哼了一声，将她抱起，小心翼翼地放入坑中，生怕碰到她的脖子。他用手轻抚着她短毛的外衣，低语声消失在泥土中，他在那里停留了一会儿。

Looking back on it, I think losing Frau hurt my father as much as it hurt me. We both lost a friend that day. Someone who could understand our pain without words. Comfort us without needing anything in return. Its simplicity was a way out. A way to turn a blind eye to harsh reality.  
回想起来，我觉得失去弗劳对父亲的打击和我一样大。那天，我们都失去了一个朋友。一个能理解我们的痛苦，无需言语就能安慰我们，不求回报的存在。这种简单的方式是一种逃避，让我们可以对残酷的现实视而不见。

I stood in the scathing sun and watched my father bury my only escape, smother it under a suffocating pile of dirt.  
我站在灼热的阳光下，看着父亲埋葬我唯一的逃避，用一堆令人窒息的泥土将其掩埋。

She still rests somewhere in his garden, fast asleep in a bed of yellow roses.  
她仍安息在他的花园某处，在一片黄玫瑰的床铺中沉睡。

### Chapter 6: November 30

My mother offers to let me ride shotgun, making this second trip thrice as embarrassing. She knows me too well. Little more than a carry on, in the form of a worn duffel bag, accompanies me. The road keeps my attention while I try not to think about my dad in the seat beside me. No one talks – he doesn't even have the radio on this time. I fight to keep from reaching up to press the power button.  
我母亲提议让我坐副驾驶，这让第二次行程尴尬了三倍。她太了解我了。我随身携带的不过是一个磨损的行李袋。我尽量不去想坐在我旁边的父亲，而把注意力集中在路上。没人说话——这次他甚至没有打开收音机。我努力克制自己不去伸手按下电源按钮。

The morning traffic passes in a blur and we find parking for Tucson International Airport. It's a humble two story series of gateways that can host twenty planes at the most.  
早晨的车流匆匆而过，我们找到了图森国际机场的停车位。这是一个简朴的两层楼建筑群，最多能容纳二十架飞机。

"Hey, Shinji!" “嘿，真嗣！”

We turn as one, down the drop-off is the same man I spied gardening with a sleeveless shirt in winter weather yesterday. My brain grasps for a name, _what was it?_  
我们齐齐转身，悬崖边上正是我昨日所见那位在冬日里穿着无袖衫打理花园的男子。我的大脑急切地搜寻着他的名字，是什么呢？

"Yoshiya," dad says, grasping his outstretched hand, warmth rising to the surface. A tight lipped smile is shared between the ex-JSSDF and my mother, then he spots me and his eyes light up.  
"由矢也，" 爸爸说着，握住了他伸出的手，温暖逐渐浮现。前日本自卫队队员和我母亲之间交换了一个紧抿嘴唇的微笑，随后他看到了我，眼中闪烁着光芒。

"Well, if it isn't the infamous Kazuya." Yoshiya holds out his hand again. I'm not ready for his finger-crushing grip and that makes him grin wider. "Good to finally meet you."  
"哎呀，这不是大名鼎鼎的和也吗。" 由矢也再次伸出手来。我还没准备好迎接他那能捏碎手指的握力，这让他笑得更开了。"终于见到你了，真是太好了。"

_Infamous?_ I throw father a glance, but my parents have already moved down the luggage drop off, where a pigtailed girl leans over a row of padded seats. The two boys she's harassing, in that unabashed and yet innocent way only children can manage, run off as my parents arrive. Her black hair whirls as she turns, shouting an exclamation that goes unheard as she jumps forward to hug his legs. He smiles, mouth moving but words lost in the hustle and bustle of the airport crowds.  
臭名昭著？我向父亲投去一眼，但我的父母已经走向行李领取处，那里一个扎着马尾辫的女孩正俯身在一排加垫座椅上。她以那种只有孩子才能做到的既无畏又纯真的方式骚扰着两个男孩，他们一见我父母到来便跑开了。她转身时黑发飘扬，大喊一声，却因机场人群的喧嚣而未被听见，她跳上前去抱住他的腿。他微笑着，嘴巴动了动，但话语淹没在机场的嘈杂声中。

"Oh, that's my little girl," Yoshiya says, following my gaze. "I've got to fly upstate and mama's at work, so your dad agreed to watch her for us the other day. I know it's a burden, your mom fresh out of the hospital and all, but he insisted."  
“哦，那是我的小女儿，”Yoshiya 顺着我的目光说道，“我得飞往州外，妈妈又在工作，所以那天你爸爸同意帮我们照看她。我知道这对你们是个负担，你妈妈刚出院，但他坚持要帮忙。”

"Ah, right..." “啊，这样啊……”

"Not much of a talker, are you?"  
"不太爱说话，是吧？"

"Uh–"

"That's alright," he laughs, a hand clasping my shoulder. "Your dad doesn't talk much either. Writes a lot. I think he needs someone to talk to, though. We get him to open up sometimes. You can't push something like that, not in therapy. You gotta' let them work up to it, you know?"  
"没关系，"他笑着说，一只手搭在我的肩膀上。"你爸爸也不怎么说话。他写很多。不过我觉得他需要有人聊聊。我们有时能让他敞开心扉。但这种事不能强求，不是在治疗中。你得让他们慢慢来，明白吗？"

I don't know, but I nod anyway. Pigtails bounce towards us, followed patiently by my parents.  
我不知道，但还是点了点头。扎着双马尾的女孩向我们跑来，我的父母耐心地跟在后面。

"Hey, are you Kazuya?" the half-Japanese girl asks. I say _half_ because her skin has an unusual copper tone and her jaw isn't quite so round. Brazlilian maybe? It sounds terrible, but I've never been very good at telling the differences between South American ethnicities. The girl can't be older than nine, curiosity widening her amber eyes.  
"嘿，你是和也吗？" 这位半日本血统的女孩问道。我说她是半日本血统，因为她的肤色有一种不寻常的铜色，下巴也不那么圆润。也许是巴西混血？听起来可能不太好，但我一直不太擅长分辨南美各民族的差异。这女孩看起来不超过九岁，好奇心让她的琥珀色眼睛睁得更大了。

"Uh, yes?" "呃，是的？"

"I'm Nina!" she jabs a thumb at herself. In an instant she grows serious, skeptical even. "Hey, Grandpa Shinji says you work at the CIA – does that mean you're a secret agent?"  
"我是妮娜！" 她用拇指指着自己。转眼间，她的表情变得严肃，甚至有些怀疑。"嘿，爷爷真嗣说你在 CIA 工作——那你是不是个特工？"

"Grandpa?" I glance up to dad, who only looks mildly displeased. I'm also trying to keep from screaming because my father has disclosed my workplace to a child, who is now yelling about it very loudly.  
"爷爷？" 我抬头看向爸爸，他只是略显不悦。我也努力克制着不尖叫，因为父亲竟然向一个孩子透露了我的工作地点，而她现在正大声嚷嚷着这件事。

Mother can't hide a smirk, sidling up to him while a hand pats his chest. "He's always been an old man at heart."  
母亲忍不住露出了一丝笑意，靠近他并用一只手轻拍他的胸膛。"他一直都有颗老灵魂。"

"Are you?!" Nina demands.  
"真的吗?!" 妮娜质问道。

I refrain from glaring at her. "Sorry, kiddo, that's classified."  
我忍住不瞪她。"抱歉，小家伙，那是机密。"

"Pleeease? I won't tell nobody – promise!"  
"求求你啦？我谁也不告诉——我发誓！"

Yoshiya chuckles, messing with one of her tails so she spins around. "Here, love," he puts a ten dollar bill and his phone in her hand. "Go with Kazuya to the food court and get whatever you like. Daddy has to talk to Grandpa Shinji for a minute."  
由谢也轻笑出声，拨弄着她的一根尾巴让她转了个圈。“来，亲爱的，”他将一张十美元的钞票和手机放在她手中。“跟和也一起去美食广场，想吃什么就买什么。爸爸得和爷爷真嗣谈一会儿。”

Thankfully, Nina protests before I do. "I can wait!" she cries with undisguised betrayal.  
幸好，妮娜在我开口前就抗议了。“我可以等！”她带着明显的背叛感喊道。

Yoshiya just shakes his head and nods her off. "You haven't eaten breakfast yet, go on."  
由谢也只是摇摇头，示意她离开。“你还没吃早餐呢，去吧。”

I look to mom for help, or an explanation – _anything_. I don't want to be alone with this kid. "We'll be along in a bit." she says, the trio walking further down the terminal.  
我向妈妈寻求帮助，或是解释——什么都行。我不想独自面对这孩子。“我们一会儿就过来。”她说着，三人继续沿着航站楼走去。

Nina's fingers tighten around the bill and I bounce on my heels. "Uh, guess you better follow me then, huh?"  
尼娜的手指紧紧捏着账单，我踮着脚尖跳了跳。“呃，那你就跟着我走吧，对吧？”

The place is bustling, barely awake commuters shuffling in line for coffee or some poorly prepared and overpriced breakfast sandwich. I've elected to take the cafe's watered down coffee, for a rare moment splashing creamer and sugar into the mix just to make it taste like something. Nina sits across from me, kicking her legs and content to munch on her morning bagel, while also playing some flashy game on Mr Yoshiya's phone.  
这个地方熙熙攘攘，昏昏欲睡的通勤者们排着队买咖啡或是一些准备不善且价格过高的早餐三明治。我选择了这家咖啡馆的淡咖啡，难得地往里加了些奶油和糖，只为让它尝起来有点味道。尼娜坐在我对面，晃着腿，满足地啃着她的早餐百吉饼，同时还在玩着吉田先生的手机上的一款炫酷游戏。

"Kazuya, have you ever been scared of your daddy?" she doesn't look up from the glowing screen, poking away, eyes perhaps a bit more pensive than before. I don't answer right away – I can't. Taking several long sips of coffee, I mentally fumble for the right words.  
"和也，你有没有害怕过你爸爸？" 她没有从发光的屏幕上抬起头，继续戳着，眼神或许比之前多了几分沉思。我没有立刻回答——我做不到。我喝了几大口咖啡，心里摸索着合适的词句。

"Sometimes," I say carefully.  
"有时候，" 我小心翼翼地说。

She blinks, but the answer seems to please her. Explosions ripple across the screen under her expert fingers. "Mine says your daddy was in a war a long time ago too. That means we're the same," she says, as if relating a seemingly complicated concept that should have been simple to understand from the get-go.  
她眨了眨眼，但这个回答似乎让她满意。屏幕上在她熟练的手指下爆发出阵阵爆炸。"我爸爸说你爸爸很久以前也参加过战争。那意味着我们是一样的，" 她说，仿佛在讲述一个看似复杂却本应一目了然的概念。

Somehow, I know she's right. I saw it the moment we met. A barely hidden apprehension – a brave and smiling face put up as a shield against a harsh and unforgiving world, that way no one can see the real Nina hiding within. I wonder how much she knows about what her father has done back in the war? Does she know about the Special Operations Group, or the Siege of Tokyo-3? If we're the same like she claims, probably not. Now that I think about it, I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would relate that kind of stuff to a child.  
不知为何，我知道她说得对。从我们相遇的那一刻起，我就看到了。一种几乎隐藏不住的忧虑——一张勇敢微笑的面孔，作为抵御残酷无情世界的盾牌，不让任何人看到内心真正的妮娜。我不知道她对她父亲在战争中所做的事情了解多少？她是否知道特种作战小组，或是第三新东京市的围城？如果她所言非虚，我们确实相似，那么她可能并不知情。现在想来，我无法想象有哪个理智的人会把这些事情告诉一个孩子。

The motors fail, joints jarring to a halt and coffee cup stopping just centimeters from my lips. I set it down on the table, the sweetness of the french vanilla cream turning rancid and bitter. That feeling swarms over me, a buzzing numbness as my mind drifts.  
马达失灵，关节猛地停下，咖啡杯离我的嘴唇仅差几厘米。我将它放在桌上，法式香草奶油的甜味变得酸涩苦涩。那种感觉涌上心头，一种嗡嗡作响的麻木感，我的思绪随之飘散。

_It's the Eva_. Mother used to whisper. _It's not him – it's the Eva._  
是 Eva。母亲过去常低声说。不是他——是 Eva。

Even after all this time, I've never understood what really lies behind those words. I was never made to understand. Whatever terrible things the Eva had done, still reaching its claws into my father's skull decades after the fact, it was too much for just a child to know. The story Toji Suzahara told me when I was nine, in retrospect, was almost cruel. How could he have expected a young boy to take that?  
即便过了这么久，我始终未能真正理解那些话语背后的深意。我从未被引导去理解。无论 Eva 曾犯下何种可怕的罪行，即便在数十年后仍将魔爪伸向我父亲的颅骨，这些对于一个孩子来说，实在是太过沉重。九岁那年，铃原东治告诉我的故事，现在回想起来，几乎可以说是残忍。他怎能期望一个年幼的孩子承受这些？

_Like a man_. I imagine Hachiro, his eldest son, saying.  
像个男人一样。我想象着他的长子八郎，如是说。

"He gets really angry sometimes," Nina mumbles, yanking my eyes across the table. "Mom says he can't help it, like a baby that cries. She says it's because of what he saw in the war. I don't really understand it." her dad's phone buzzes, splashing prisms of color in a very vibrant declaration that Nina has lost. She pushes it away, holding the phone in contempt. An iron gaze speaks of something deeper, the loss solidifying a disconnection from her father more than some silly game. "I wish he would talk to me about that stuff. I can listen as good as any adult. Did your daddy ever tell you about the war?" at last her eyes come to me, hopeful.  
“他有时真的很生气，”妮娜低声说道，拉扯着我的目光越过桌面。“妈妈说他控制不了，就像一个哭泣的婴儿。她说这是因为他在战争中看到的那些事。我不太明白。”她爸爸的手机震动起来，投射出五彩斑斓的光芒，宣告妮娜的失败。她厌恶地将手机推开，铁一般的目光透露出更深层的含义，这场游戏的失败比任何幼稚的竞赛更能让她与父亲之间产生隔阂。“我希望他能和我谈谈那些事。我听得和任何成年人一样认真。你爸爸有没有和你谈过战争的事？”终于，她的目光转向我，带着一丝希望。

"No."

Her gaze falls, hands snatching the phone from the table. "Why's it have to be such a big secret?"  
她的目光低垂，双手迅速从桌上抓起手机。“为什么非得是个大秘密呢？”

I sip at disgustingly sweet coffee to stall, shrugging. "Some things are too hard to talk about," I say, hating myself for parroting my mother. I can't believe I'm sitting here feeding this girl more lies. Or maybe there's more truth in that not-answer than I want to admit. How can I tell Nina anything about why her father doesn't talk about the war, when I barely understand it myself?  
我啜饮着甜得令人作呕的咖啡以拖延时间，耸了耸肩。“有些事情太难开口，”我说，痛恨自己重复母亲的话。我简直不敢相信自己坐在这里向这个女孩灌输更多谎言。或许那个未回答的问题中隐藏的真相比我愿意承认的更多。我连自己都搞不懂她父亲为何对战争闭口不谈，又怎能向妮娜解释清楚呢？

"I guess so." a grimace quirks at her lips, little fingers toying with her dad's cell.  
“我想是的。”她嘴角露出一丝苦笑，纤细的手指摆弄着她爸爸的手机。

It makes me realize just how lousy I would be as a father. I don't know how to deal with kids and I've never been able to stand the sound of a child crying. I don't want to be the cause of that. Just the idea of being responsible for someone else's happiness... it makes me sick. Makes me want to hide in the deepest, darkest depths of the ocean and never return to the waking world.  
这让我意识到自己作为父亲会有多么糟糕。我不懂得如何与孩子相处，也一直无法忍受孩子的哭声。我不愿成为那种哭声的源头。仅仅是想到要为别人的幸福负责……就让我感到恶心。让我想躲进海洋最深最暗的角落，再也不回到清醒的世界。

"There you are!" “你在这儿！”

In a flash, the real Nina is gone, replaced by the nothing-is-wrong-in-my-world illusion of her. She jumps up and runs to her father, my parents a few paces behind him. Even seeing her so sullen a moment ago, it's actually hard to say this part of her is just for show. Her smile is so full of love and adoration, nothing like the smiles I used to wear.  
转眼间，真正的妮娜消失了，取而代之的是她那世界一切安好的幻象。她跳起来跑向父亲，我的父母紧随其后。尽管刚才看到她如此沮丧，但这一刻的她却难以分辨是否只是表演。她的笑容充满了爱与崇拜，与我曾经戴上的那些微笑截然不同。

Are we really the same? Or is Nina just braver than I ever was?  
我们真的相同吗？还是妮娜只是比我曾经勇敢得多？

The clerk at Terminal 15 calls for final boarding and I fish the ticket from my overcoat. The long ramp leading to the vessel beyond waits to swallow me whole. I turn my back on it, preparing myself for parting words. As I do, mother hugs me, so very content to just hold me – if only for a moment. I expected a lot of things from this trip. A cold reunion and a frigid departure, back to doing the same things I've always done. Has anything really changed? My mother's hugging me for the first time in years and I don't know how to feel about it.  
15 号航站楼的职员宣布最后登机，我从大衣里掏出机票。通往船只的长长通道静静等待着将我吞没。我转身背对它，准备说出告别的话语。就在这时，母亲拥抱了我，如此满足于仅仅抱着我——哪怕只有片刻。我对这次旅行有过许多预期。冷淡的重逢和冰冷的离别，回到一如既往的生活。真的有什么改变了吗？母亲多年来第一次拥抱我，我不知该如何感受。

My arms hesitate to rise, hands touching her back, unsure if I should squeeze back. "Goodbye, mom."  
我的手臂犹豫着抬起，双手触碰她的背，不确定是否应该回抱。“再见，妈妈。”

She pulls away before we can embrace for long, a soft touch to her voice. "Don't think I won't come up there if you don't call from now on, okay?"  
她在我们能长时间拥抱之前就抽身离开，声音中带着一丝温柔。“如果你以后不打电话来，我可是会上去找你的，好吗？”

"Alright," I say, unable to keep the corners of my mouth from stretching, just a little. She steps back, putting on a small smile for me. Father stays planted where he is and it takes all of my lasting resolve to hold his gaze. Deep-set ocean water eyes hide behind large bifocal glasses, his chin smooth and bare this time. The air between us is thick and constricting. Mechanically, I lift my right hand – before either of us can even consider attempting a hug. His rough, leathery hand takes hold of mine.  
“好吧，”我说，嘴角不由自主地微微上扬。她后退一步，为我露出一抹浅笑。父亲依旧站在原地，我竭尽全力才保持住与他对视的勇气。深邃如海洋的双眼隐藏在宽大的双光眼镜后，这次他的下巴光滑无须。我们之间的空气沉重而压抑。机械般地，我举起右手——在我们任何一人考虑尝试拥抱之前。他粗糙、布满皱纹的手掌握住了我的。

I try to swallow. "It was, uh... good to see you, dad."  
我试图咽下喉咙里的紧张。“呃……见到你真好，爸爸。”

"It was good to see you too, son."  
"见到你我也很高兴，孩子。"

Our hands break away and Nina quirks her head at this exchange, debating a puzzled frown. Yoshiya is there, hands resting on her shoulders. He gives me a nod and a smile. "Take care of yourself, Kazuya."  
我们的手分开，妮娜对此交换感到困惑，皱起了眉头。吉田在那里，双手搭在她的肩上。他向我点头微笑。“照顾好自己，和也。”

Mouth too dry for words, all I can do is nod in return.  
嘴巴干得说不出话，我只能点头回应。

Little Nina waves. "Bye, Kazuya!" those big eyes of hers seem to twinkle. _We share a secret, you and I_, they say. I've been let into her world, past the barriers and mirrors. She's seen in me something that echoes her own truth.  
小妮娜挥手。“再见，和也！”她那双大眼睛似乎在闪烁。我们之间有个秘密，你和我，它们在说。我被允许进入她的世界，穿越了障碍和镜子。她在我的身上看到了与她自身真相相呼应的东西。

I thump down the carpeted hall, never sparing a glance back and find my spot in 37A, a walkway seat. Grimacing, I hunker down and hope no one has the window beside me so I can steal it later. Knowing that I'll be home this afternoon is a strange and foreign concept, I almost can't believe it. Murmured conversation hovers over the seats, occasionally lost in the dull whine of turbines. Nina says we're the same, but at the very least she loves her father – and he has nothing but affection for her. It seems her parents try to make her understand, even if she isn't quite ready to comprehend the nature of her father's scars.  
我沿着铺着地毯的走廊咚咚走去，从未回头一瞥，找到了我在 37A 的过道座位。皱着眉头，我蜷缩起来，希望旁边没有人占着窗户，这样我稍后可以偷偷看风景。知道今天下午就能回家，这个概念既奇怪又陌生，我几乎无法相信。低语的交谈声在座位间飘荡，偶尔被涡轮的沉闷嗡嗡声淹没。妮娜说我们是一样的，但至少她爱她的父亲——而他对她也只有爱意。似乎她的父母试图让她理解，即使她还不太能理解她父亲伤痕的本质。

_And you are?_ A voice suspiciously like my own laughs. As if to mock me further, I find those soft spoken words uttered in a bright afternoon hospital room by my mother:  
而你是谁？一个听起来像我自己的声音怀疑地笑着。仿佛是为了进一步嘲弄我，我发现这些轻柔的话语是在一个明媚的下午在医院病房里由我母亲说出的：

_"You never get over something like that..."  
"你永远无法从那种事情中走出来..."_

_"You never get over it."  
"你永远无法释怀。"_

A pair of Ecclesiastes sit in the row next to me. The Third Eye blisters across the skin of their foreheads by way of scarred flesh, in the same manner their Goddess Lilith had once possessed. They are her messengers, bringers of order, preachers of her truth. So say the pamphlets I usually get in the mail. I can't be sure which branch they belong too, but from their rather sharp and clean business attire, I can guess they aren't one of the Western Trinity's more fanatical manifestations, often shrouded in mysticism and questionable cult practices.  
一对《传道书》信徒坐在我旁边的座位上。他们额头上的第三只眼是通过疤痕组织形成的，就像他们的女神莉莉丝曾经拥有的那样。他们是她的使者，秩序的传递者，真理的宣讲者。正如我通常在邮件中收到的宣传册上所说的那样。我不确定他们属于哪个分支，但从他们相当尖锐和整洁的商务装束来看，我猜他们不是西方三位一体中那些更狂热的表象，那些常常笼罩在神秘主义和可疑的邪教实践中。

Shin Seiki maybe? Out of all the whacked religions that spawned from Third Impact, the Reformed Shin Seiki Church of the New Trinity is arguably one of the more tame followings. If I remember right, they're the prevalent movement down southwest now. I remember watching their houses of worship sprout up all over Arizona. Even taking the buses around Tucson these past few days, I couldn't get more than a half-mile without seeing one.  
新世纪或许？在第三次冲击后涌现的各种离奇宗教中，新三一改革新世纪教会可以说是其中较为温和的一支。如果我没记错的话，他们现在是西南地区的主流运动。我记得在亚利桑那州各地都能看到他们的礼拜场所如雨后春笋般涌现。就连这几天在图森乘坐公交车时，我走不了半英里就能看到一座。

I try to keep them out of mind. The flight takes forever, even though I paid a little extra for non-stop so I wouldn't have to transfer in Denver. With an hour until landing, I call Marina and let her know I'll be home soon. I've received approximately twenty texts since our last talk about how much she misses me, practically begging for my attentions. For the time being, I don't let it bother me, just sink a little more into the seat and let the roar of the plane's engines lull me into oblivion.  
我尽量不去想这些。飞行时间长得让人难以忍受，尽管我额外支付了费用选择了直飞，以免在丹佛转机。距离降落还有一个小时，我给玛丽娜打电话，告诉她我很快就会到家。自从我们上次通话以来，我大约收到了二十条短信，她几乎是在恳求我的关注，说她有多么想念我。目前，我尽量不让这些打扰到我，只是更深地陷进座位里，让飞机引擎的轰鸣声将我带入无意识的状态。

As we're pulling into port, I prepare myself for the inevitable and take another anxiety pill for the day, debating a mood-stabilizer with a half-grimace. I probably need it, what's the harm in taking another tablet? They were prescribed to be used, afterall.  
当我们即将靠岸时，我为自己做好了面对不可避免情况的准备，并服用了今天的另一片抗焦虑药，带着半分苦笑考虑是否再加一片情绪稳定剂。我可能确实需要它，再吃一片药有什么害处呢？毕竟，这些药是医生开给我的，本就是用来服用的。

My silver 2014 Mustang Convertible is waiting in the lot underneath Reagan Airport. Marina likes to call it Gypsy. It's the same color as some giant mech – codenamed Gypsy – in one of those cheesy post-Second Impact movies. Clambering inside, me and Gypsy get on George Washington Parkway following the Potomac river, D.C. proper visible across the way. I cross it at I-495 and arc over into my Silver Springs apartment complex. Fifteen stories tall and packed with overpriced studio compartments.  
我的银色 2014 年野马敞篷车正停在里根机场下的停车场。玛丽娜喜欢称它为‘吉普赛’。它的颜色与那些俗气的二次冲击后电影中的某个巨型机甲——代号‘吉普赛’——相同。我爬进车内，与‘吉普赛’一起驶上乔治华盛顿公园路，沿着波托马克河前行，华盛顿特区就在对岸清晰可见。我在 I-495 处横穿而过，弧形驶入我位于银泉的公寓小区。这座十五层高的大楼挤满了价格不菲的工作室式小间。

Me and my beloved are situated in room 303. I can hear the neighbor's kids as I step in – the upstairs neighbor that is. The living room makes up most of the space, kitchen and bathroom on the other side by the only window – which is draped with blackout curtains to make it completely dark inside.  
我和我心爱的人住在 303 室。我一进门就能听到邻居孩子的声音——确切地说是楼上的邻居。客厅占据了大部分空间，厨房和浴室在另一侧，唯一的窗户挂着遮光窗帘，使得室内完全黑暗。

"About time," Marina's voice travels over from the couch.  
“终于回来了，”玛丽娜的声音从沙发那边传来。

"Hey, sweetheart," I sigh, throwing my luggage and overcoat to the floor, a curse hissing free as I stumble into the kitchen. I can't stand the fact she has to exist in utter darkness all of the time. It's two in the afternoon dammit. I flick the kitchen lights on and throw the curtains open for good measure. Marina clicks her tongue as she pads across the carpet. The sun makes her caramel hair shine, curls falling along soft-cut features. I lean in, though the pout she gives me says she was hoping for something a little more passionate than the peck I give her. Her arms wrap around my waist and she earns a brief one-armed squeeze back, while I'm reaching to flick on the coffee pot. She reminds me of a puppy, bearing no concept of time and unable to tell that it's only been three days, not three years.  
"嘿，亲爱的，"我叹了口气，将行李和外套扔到地上，咒骂声不由自主地溜了出来，我踉跄着走进厨房。我无法忍受她必须一直生活在完全的黑暗中。现在是下午两点，该死的。我打开厨房的灯，顺手拉开窗帘。玛丽娜咂了咂舌，踏着地毯走过来。阳光让她的焦糖色头发闪闪发光，卷发沿着柔和的轮廓垂落。我倾身过去，尽管她撅嘴的表情表明她希望得到比我的轻吻更热情的回应。她的手臂环住我的腰，我伸手去开咖啡壶时，用一只手臂短暂地回抱了她一下。她让我想起一只小狗，对时间毫无概念，无法察觉这只是三天，而非三年。

That makes me chuckle. "Look out."  
这让我轻笑出声。"小心点。"

She offers a plaintive noise and a slight, playful push. My keys clack on the bartop – wallet and phone joining them next.  
她发出一声哀怨的声响，轻轻地、开玩笑地推了我一下。我的钥匙在吧台上发出叮当声——钱包和手机紧接着放在了旁边。

"How was your trip?" she asks, leaning by the bathroom door.  
“旅途怎么样？”她靠在浴室门边问道。

I touch her as I pass into the living room, settling on the couch. "Okay, I guess."  
我经过她身边走进客厅，在沙发上坐下。“还行吧，我想。”

I feel her move against the backrest, hands sliding over my neck and around my shoulders, thumbs kneading into knotted muscle. A pair of lips touch my neck, working their way down to my collar bone.  
我感觉到她靠在椅背上移动，双手滑过我的脖子，环绕到肩膀，拇指揉捏着紧绷的肌肉。一对唇瓣轻触我的颈部，缓缓向下移至锁骨。

I jerk away, temper flaring. "Not now, Marina." I regret it instantly as her warmth recedes, collapsing on the bed with her back to me. A sigh. "I'm sorry, I'm just... really tired."  
我猛地抽身，怒火中烧。“现在不行，玛丽娜。”我立刻后悔了，她的温暖退去，她背对着我倒在床上。一声叹息。“对不起，我只是……真的很累。”

"You always are." she sits up, legs swinging over the edge of the mattress. "We haven't had sex for three months."  
“你总是这么说。”她坐起身，双腿晃荡着越过床沿。“我们已经三个月没做爱了。”

"Look, I just got back from seeing my parents and I... I just want to relax, okay?"  
“听着，我刚从见我父母那儿回来，我……我只是想放松一下，好吗？”

Her eyes roll and she shakes her head. "Whatever."  
她翻了个白眼，摇摇头。"随便。"

Normally I would just drop it, and she'd stew for a bit before we're able to talk again. This time her tone wriggles under my skin. "Are you really upset about this?"  
通常我会就此打住，她会闷闷不乐一会儿，然后我们又能重新交谈。但这次她的语气让我感到刺痛。"你真的因为这个生气吗？"

"Just fucking forget it, Kazuya." Marina pushes off the bed, marching into the kitchen. "It's not like you care anyway."  
"别再提了，和也。"玛丽娜从床上起身，大步走向厨房。"反正你也不在乎。"

Something – twists. This isn't like the other times we've argued, where I half-heartedly beg for her forgiveness, dejected because I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with her fickle whims. That thread of patience, drawn taut these past few days, snaps.  
某种东西——扭曲了。这次不同于我们以往的争吵，我半心半意地乞求她的原谅，沮丧不已，因为我感觉自己不该忍受她那反复无常的任性。那根绷紧了数日的耐心之线，断了。

"Yeah, you're right, shame on me for not wanting to fuck you the instant I get home from seeing my mother in the hospital." I'm standing now, just outside the kitchen.  
“是啊，你说得对，我真不该在你一回家就想着和你上床，毕竟我刚从医院看望我妈回来。”我站了起来，就在厨房外。

Marina laughs. "Oh please, she has a heart attack and suddenly give a shit about her?"  
玛丽娜笑了。“哦，拜托，她心脏病发作了，你就突然关心起她来了？”

"You have no idea what you're talking about – Jesus Christ, I just went on a trip to meet people I was A-OK never having contact with again, but no, poor Marina had to go three days without me, _god forbid_."  
"你根本不知道你在说什么——天哪，我刚去了一趟旅行，见了一些我完全可以不再联系的人，但不行，可怜的玛丽娜却得三天见不到我，天知道。"

"You could have brought me with you, jackass! But it's just way easier to forget you have a girlfriend if you leave her at home, right?"  
"你本可以带我一起去的，混蛋！但把你女朋友留在家里，忘记你有女朋友就容易多了，对吧？"

"I was gone for three days, Marina! What the fuck did you even do? Did you sign up for medicare to cover that knee surgery you need? Did you apply for a college? Did you look for a second job? Did you do any of the shit I've been asking you to do for the past two years?"  
"我只离开了三天，玛丽娜！你到底做了什么？你申请了医疗保险来覆盖你需要的膝盖手术吗？你申请大学了吗？你找了第二份工作吗？你做了过去两年我一直在要求你做的那些事吗？"

Her eyes narrow. "Fuck you."  
她的眼睛眯了起来。“去你的。”

"Stop acting like child and _grow up_!"  
“别像个孩子一样，成熟点！”

"Look who's talking!" she snaps, jabbing my chest with a finger. "Big shot CIA man fucked up his first mission and works behind a desk so he can live in some shithole apartment for the rest of his life, crying about his mommy and daddy. Yeah, you've really grown up, Kazuya." she's got me backed into a corner now, nowhere to run. "I bet you just make it up, don't you? All that crap about your dad and his episodes – you just want people to feel sorry for you, don't you? You're just a spineless, worthless piece of–"  
“看看是谁在说话！”她厉声说道，用手指戳着我的胸膛。“中央情报局的大人物第一次任务就搞砸了，只能坐在办公桌后，在那个破公寓里度过余生，哭诉着他的父母。是啊，你真的成熟了，和也。”她现在把我逼到了角落，无处可逃。“我打赌你都是编的，对吧？你爸和他那些发作的事——你只是想让别人同情你，对吧？你不过是个无胆无用的废物——”

Anger, true anger, makes you someone else. Someone you don't know. This Kazuya, wrapped tight in a blistering hot coil, pushes Marina – shoves her hard so she hits the cabinets and knocks the coffee pot to the floor. Glass breaks, putrid brown oozing over the white tile. Neither of us move and everything is still, something I've always dreaded seeing bursting free in Marina's wide eyes.  
真正的愤怒会让你变成另一个人，一个你不认识的人。这个被炽热怒火紧紧包裹的和也，用力推了真理奈一把——她重重地撞上了橱柜，咖啡壶随之落地。玻璃破碎，恶臭的棕色液体在白色瓷砖上蔓延。我们俩都一动不动，我一直以来害怕看到的景象在真理奈睁大的眼中爆发。

"Go ahead... hit me." she squeaks, trying to swallow her fear, gripping the counter top edges for dear life. "You've always wanted to, right?"  
“来吧……打我。”她颤声说道，试图咽下恐惧，紧紧抓住台面边缘以求生存。“你一直都想这么做，对吧？”

I come back to myself, hands balled into fists and that hot, burning rage snaps cold – no, not cold. Freezing. "I'm... I'm sorry, Marina... I..."  
我回过神来，双手紧握成拳，那股炽热的怒火骤然冷却——不，不是冷却，是冻结。“我……对不起，真理奈……我……”

She flinches as I take a step. "Get away from me. Don't come near me." then she's out of the kitchen, grabbing her purse and then her overcoat. The door creaks open and she turns to look me in the eyes, her own bleeding shattered hope and fractured hurt. "You're fucking crazy, you know that?" she whispers–  
她在我迈出一步时畏缩了。“离我远点。别靠近我。”随即她冲出了厨房，抓起钱包和外套。门吱呀一声打开，她转头直视我的眼睛，眼中满是破碎的希望和裂痕般的伤痛。“你他妈疯了，你知道吗？”她低声说道——

And then she's gone. 然后她就消失了。

Nothing registers, at first. A daunting silence worms its way into the apartment, sliding into my ears until I can't hear anything but white noise.  
起初，什么也没有感觉到。一股令人窒息的寂静悄然潜入公寓，钻进我的耳朵，直到我只能听到一片白噪音。

"Fine," I bark, not quite able to manage a shout through the quiver in my voice – so I pick up a dirtied glass and hurl it at the closed door. I cling to those residuals of anger. I scream. "I don't need you! I don't need _anyone_!" I collapse against the counter, trying to stay standing while the world flips on its head. "Who the fuck needs you, anyway?"  
“好啊，”我厉声道，声音颤抖得几乎喊不出来——于是我抓起一个脏玻璃杯，猛地朝紧闭的门扔去。我紧抓着那些残留的怒气。我尖叫着：“我不需要你！我不需要任何人！”我瘫倒在柜台边，试图保持站立，而世界却在天旋地转。“反正谁他妈需要你啊？”

No one answers and the question rings against the walls, while I wonder if it was meant for me or Marina. My heart just won't stop pounding, a panic attack rolling over my nerves and striking with splintering chills. I find my overcoat, fumbling for the anxiety pills I know are still there. I empty the bottle's contents into my hand, a glass of water at the sink helping them down. I know it's not enough to kill me, and a part of me resents that. They don't have time to do much before I fall to my knees, spilling my guts across the floor. Too much, too much. Too much emotion. Too much stress – _too much_.  
无人应答，问题在墙间回响，我疑惑这是针对我还是玛丽娜。我的心跳就是停不下来，恐慌发作如潮水般淹没我的神经，带来碎裂般的寒意。我找到我的大衣，摸索着里面我知道还在的焦虑药片。我将瓶中内容物倒进手里，水槽边的一杯水助其下肚。我知道这不足以致命，而我的一部分对此感到怨恨。它们还没来得及发挥多大作用，我就跪倒在地，将胃里的东西吐了一地。太多，太多了。太多情感。太多压力——太多。

A hammer begins to beat against my skull, a resounding crescendo that drives me to the floor, every vile and disgusting sickness pervading my body – reducing me to a wretched mess. But that quiet, that open, yawning, empty quiet is what really gets me. It waits patiently for the stockade to break. The floodgates are open, but the lake on the other side is desert dry.  
一把锤子开始敲打我的头骨，一阵震耳欲聋的渐强音将我逼至地面，每一种恶毒而令人作呕的疾病侵袭我的身体——使我沦为可怜的废物。但真正击垮我的是那寂静，那空旷、张口、空无一物的寂静。它耐心等待着栅栏的崩塌。洪水闸门已开，但另一边的湖却是沙漠般干涸。

Sitting against the cabinets seems only infinitesimally better than lying on the floor where gravity is trying to crush me into pulp. My right hand finds a phone from the counter top too.  
靠着橱柜坐着似乎只比躺在地板上好一点点，重力正试图将我压成浆糊。我的右手从台面上摸到了一部手机。

No text messages. No missed calls. I think it's starting to get dark out. Hard to tell how long I've been in this stupid kitchen.  
没有短信。没有未接来电。我想天开始黑了。很难说我在厨房里待了多久。

My fingers find a number. Not Marina's – but a number I hadn't even seen pop up since four days ago, simply labeled: _Home_.  
我的手指触到了一个号码。不是玛丽娜的——而是一个四天前就再未出现过的号码，仅仅标注着：家。

An idea possesses me. An instinct. I hit the 'call' button. A ringer purrs, once, twice. On the fourth chime, I assume no one is around.  
一个念头占据了我的思绪。一种本能。我按下了“呼叫”键。铃声轻柔地响起，一次，两次。在第四声响后，我以为无人应答。

Then a click. 接着是一声轻响。

And my father's voice. "Hello?"  
还有我父亲的声音。“喂？”

At first I'm stuck rigid – frozen. I never expected him to be the one to answer. "Hello?" he asks again.  
起初我僵住了——动弹不得。我从没想过会是他接的电话。“喂？”他又问了一遍。

I hang up, tossing the phone away as if burned. I feel like shit. Worse than that, I feel like a coward.  
我挂了电话，像被烫到一样把手机扔开。我感觉糟透了。更糟糕的是，我觉得自己像个懦夫。

In the end, I really am just a child.  
最终，我确实只是一个孩子。

I can't hold it in anymore – I break.  
我再也忍不住了——崩溃了。

"I'm sorry... god, I'm so sorry."  
“对不起...天哪，我真的很抱歉。”

I don't care that the spilled brew is soaking into the linoleum and making it bubble, or that the coffee maker is pouring a fresh blend onto the sizzling burner. The tears just keep flowing and I couldn't hold back the shuddering sobs if I tried.  
我不在乎那洒出的饮料正浸透油地毡并使其起泡，也不在乎咖啡机正将新煮的咖啡倾倒在咝咝作响的加热器上。泪水不断涌出，我无法抑制那颤抖的呜咽，即使我试图控制。

I'm just like him. 我和他一样。

I'm just like my fucking father.  
我和我那该死的父亲一样。

**Author's Notes:** It's been a busy month. Should be able to get back to weekly updates now. I _could_ take my time, but then this story would never get done. Once that happens, I'll come back to it one day and work a little harder on fleshing out Kazuya and Marina's relationship, but for now, this will do to get us through the rest of the story. Drop off comments/thoughts if you have any.  
作者的话：这个月忙得不可开交。现在应该能恢复每周更新了。我可以慢慢来，但那样这故事就永远完结不了。一旦情况允许，我会回来再努力丰富和完善一岐和真与玛丽娜的关系，但眼下，这样足以让我们继续推进故事。欢迎留下评论和想法。

### Interlude VI

My mother had a falling out with her father a decade ago. Since then, we haven't talked to the Langley side of the family, small though it may be.  
我母亲十年前与她的父亲闹翻了。自那以后，我们与兰利家族那边的亲戚就断了联系，尽管他们人数并不多。

Everyone on my dad's side isn't around anymore. I can't say for sure what exactly happened. I've only been told that his mother died when he was real young. The name Gendo Ikari was spoken only once in my presence, and used as a barb by my mother at that. It was strange to learn about a grandfather I would never meet through grade school History lessons.  
我父亲那边的人都已经不在了。具体发生了什么，我无法确切地说。我只知道他母亲在他很小的时候就去世了。碇源堂这个名字在我面前只被提起过一次，还是我母亲用来讽刺的。通过小学的历史课来了解一个从未谋面的祖父，这感觉很奇怪。

_Gendo Ikari, first Rokubungi, was a Japanese scientist and Commander of the paramilitary organization NERV and considered to be at the center of Third Impact –_ reads one of the entries.  
碇源堂，初代六分仪，是一位日本科学家，也是准军事组织 NERV 的指挥官，被认为是第三次冲击的核心人物——其中一条记录如此写道。

He was sentenced to death and executed by lethal injection in 2021.  
他于 2021 年被判处死刑，并通过注射死刑执行。

The Ottawa trials had been going on since late 2017. Normally, the ICC wouldn't be able to sentence anyone under its jurisdiction to death. Grandpa Ikari was the singular reason a Review Conference was held in Berlin to vote for an amendment that would allow the death penalty to be issued for ICC trials.  
渥太华的审判自 2017 年底以来一直在进行。通常情况下，国际刑事法院（ICC）不能对其管辖下的任何人判处死刑。碇爷爷是唯一的原因，柏林召开了一次审查会议，投票通过了一项允许在国际刑事法院审判中判处死刑的修正案。

The tally was almost unanimously for it.  
投票结果几乎是全票通过。

I can't say I know much else about the trials, even though they were some of the most important in recent history. Some other higher-ups were caught in the fallout, slapped with thirty years to life in prison. I don't know their names or what they did. It was just another part of the war that I didn't care to learn about. I still remember, back in college, what a shock it was when I discovered my parents were actually involved in the entire mess. They'd been put on trial like all the others, pardoned despite being accused of taking part in genocide.  
我不能说我对此案了解多少，尽管它们是近代史上最重要的审判之一。一些其他高层人物也在风波中落马，被判了三十年至无期徒刑。我不知道他们的名字或他们做了什么。这只是我不愿了解的战争的另一部分。我至今还记得，在大学时，当我发现我的父母竟然卷入了整个混乱时，那震惊的感觉。他们像其他人一样接受了审判，尽管被指控参与了种族灭绝，却获得了赦免。

I couldn't ask them about it at the time. I was twenty and still fresh off my departure from home – the fracture that broke an already strained relationship. I was beginning to understand the significance of their lineage and their vaguely touched upon roles in the Angel War – something they'd always kept from me.  
当时我无法向他们询问此事。那时我二十岁，刚离家不久——那次决裂加剧了我们本已紧张的关系。我开始理解他们血统的重要性以及他们在天使战争中隐约提及的角色——这些他们一直对我保密的事情。

It only gave me more reason to distrust them.  
这只会让我更加不信任他们。

Third Impact was a dark time most of my professors were tight-lipped about. For them, the apocalypse was still too fresh and raw. For me, the world hadn't ended at all. It was always this twisted, on-the-brink-of-collapse game to eek out an existence. The conflicts of the past were more of a dream. Mythical and always told with too much of the tale missing or embellished. Just the idea of it is something I still grapple with.  
第三次冲击是一个大多数教授都讳莫如深的黑暗时期。对他们来说，末日仍太过新鲜和残酷。对我而言，世界根本未曾终结。它始终是一场扭曲的、濒临崩溃边缘的生存游戏。过去的冲突更像是一场梦，神话般的，且总是讲述得支离破碎或过于夸张。光是这个想法，我至今仍在努力理解。

It was even more of a surprise finding out my mother had authored most modern textbooks on Metaphysics. The experiences of my youth became much clearer after that revelation.  
更令人惊讶的是，发现我母亲撰写了大部分现代形而上学教科书。那次揭露之后，我童年的经历变得清晰了许多。

Ever since middle school, when teachers found out my last name, I was held to some higher standard. I was expected to be exceedingly perfect in every activity I pursued. It wasn't anything new, mother never accepted anything less than my fullest potential. Then at eleven years old suddenly it was expected of me everywhere and from everyone.  
自从中学时老师们得知我的姓氏后，我就被置于某种更高的标准之下。无论我参与什么活动，都被期望达到极致的完美。这并不新鲜，母亲从未接受过我低于最大潜能的表现。然后在十一岁时，突然间，这种期望无处不在，来自每一个人。

"You'll do great things one day, Kazuya," they'd say – and I basked in that praise, that undisguised pride. I took every ounce of it and built a little rosary to keep me happy. I didn't have any friends to share it with. Not even my mother, who knew all too well what it was like living with my father, could fill that role for me. She was always gone, or on business, or shut off from me because of her nightmares.  
“有一天你会成就一番伟业，和也，”他们曾这样说——我沉浸在那赞誉之中，那不加掩饰的骄傲。我汲取每一分赞美，编织成一串小小的念珠，让我心满意足。我没有朋友可以分享这些。就连深知与我父亲生活是何滋味的母亲，也无法填补这个角色。她总是不在，或是在忙工作，或是因为她的噩梦而与我隔绝。

I wanted to be the best. I _had_ to be the best – for her. If I was the best, maybe she would praise me, or stay at home with me, or try and get to know me as desperately as I wanted to know her.  
我想成为最优秀的。我必须成为最优秀的——为了她。如果我是最优秀的，也许她会表扬我，或者留在家里陪我，或者像我渴望了解她一样，努力地了解我。

I knew that she was born and raised in Berlin. Her father was an Army Colonel from Tennessee. She went to Heidelberg University when she was eleven and graduated at thirteen. Her favorite color was red. She hated stuffed animals and used to like to play the violin.  
我知道她出生并成长于柏林。她的父亲是田纳西州的一名陆军上校。她在十一岁时进入海德堡大学，十三岁毕业。她最喜欢的颜色是红色。她讨厌毛绒玩具，曾经喜欢拉小提琴。

That was all she ever really allowed me to know. I needed more.  
她只允许我知道这些。我需要更多。

Despite my best efforts, life at home became less and less bearable. My father's PTSD was always lingering in the shadows, always had me on edge in a place I should've felt safe. My mother's patience wore thin and her stress bled out into everything she said and did. She'd snap at the drop of a hat, going off on a curse-laden tirade. If I scored below an A on an assignment, it was a lecture. If I lost a Soccer game. If my room wasn't clean. If I left dishes in the sink. A lecture. Disappointment.  
尽管我尽了最大努力，家里的生活却越来越难以忍受。父亲的创伤后应激障碍总是潜伏在阴影中，让我在一个本应感到安全的地方也时刻紧张。母亲的耐心逐渐耗尽，她的压力渗透到她说的每句话和做的每件事中。她会因为一点小事就爆发，用一连串的咒骂发泄情绪。如果我的作业得分低于 A，就是一顿训斥。如果我输了一场足球赛。如果我的房间不整洁。如果我把碗碟留在水槽里。训斥。失望。

Eventually I'd had enough. I started to stand up to her, to fight back. My mother isn't the kind of woman to back down – for anything. It's her way or the highway. The only person I've ever seen her give any ground to is my father, and it's begrudgingly at that. The more and more we fought, the less I applied myself at school, and the praise I received from my teachers turned into reprimands when my grades plummeted. "You used to be such a hard working boy, Kazuya. Don't you want to get into a good school? Surely you don't want to disappoint your mother?"  
最终我受够了。我开始反抗她，回击。我母亲不是那种会退缩的女人——无论什么情况。要么按她的方式来，要么就别做。唯一能让她让步的人是我父亲，而且那也是不情愿的。我们争吵得越多，我在学校就越不努力，原本从老师那里得到的赞扬变成了责备，因为我的成绩一落千丈。“你曾经是个非常勤奋的孩子，和也。难道你不想进一所好学校吗？你肯定不想让你母亲失望吧？”

It didn't matter if it was what I wanted. She was always disappointed anyway. I could see it. In the way she fixed me with a cold look as we sat in the Principal's office. Or how her shoulders sagged when we got home, dejected, as I tried to apologize. She'd heard it too many times before.  
那是否是我所愿，已无关紧要。反正她总是失望。我能看出来。在我们坐在校长办公室时，她用冰冷的目光盯着我。或是当我们回到家，我试图道歉时，她肩膀下垂，沮丧的样子。她之前已经听过太多次了。

It got to the point where I couldn't focus on any of the lessons. I stopped caring whether or not homework was finished. I just locked myself in my room, waiting for the next day to drag by and continue to endure. The thresholds of my mother's temper reached new lows. Nights often ended in screaming matches between us. Running to Misato's wasn't enough of an escape once I turned fourteen, so I isolated myself – trading spiteful, petty insults with my mother whenever we crossed paths.  
到了我无法专注于任何课程的地步。我不再关心作业是否完成。我只是把自己锁在房间里，等待下一天缓慢过去，继续忍受。我母亲的脾气达到了新低。夜晚常常以我们之间的尖叫争吵结束。十四岁后，逃到美里那里已不足以成为逃避，所以我孤立自己——每当与我们母亲相遇时，就互相用恶毒、琐碎的侮辱攻击对方。

I was spiraling into a black pit and I didn't know how to stop. There were these gray, gnarled, stringent emotions all knotted up inside. It was the Eva - that stupid fucking Eva my father carried with him.  
我正陷入一个黑暗的深渊，我不知道如何停止。这些灰色、扭曲、严厉的情绪纠结在一起。都是因为那该死的 Eva——我父亲随身携带的那个 Eva。

There was a secret war I couldn't ever tell anyone about. I had fantasies of doing exactly that, telling my teachers about all of the crazy shit that happened. Then they would feel sorry for me and try to comfort me. I never did anything like that. I was afraid, more than anything, that no one would believe me. That, and admitting my parents worked for NERV would've been like someone walking around a post-WWII Germany and admitting their parents were Nazis.  
有一场秘密战争，我永远无法向任何人透露。我曾幻想过这样做，向我的老师们倾诉所有发生的疯狂事情。然后他们会为我感到难过，试图安慰我。但我从未这样做过。我更害怕的是，没有人会相信我。而且，承认我的父母为 NERV 工作，就像有人在二战后的德国四处走动，承认他们的父母是纳粹一样。

When people asked what they did for a living, I always made up some lie, some happy memory that didn't exist. My dad's a policeman and he helps lots of people! My mother's an engineer for NASA! Something noble, at times extravagant. Something that I could be proud of. When other kids were impressed or envious, looking at me with wide and curious eyes, it made me feel less alone in the world. Some nights after an episode, I'd comfort myself by imagining I had an older brother, someone to confide in and share in my suffering. It was the reason I always held a small amount of resentment towards the Suzahara brothers. I would have given anything to have what they shared.  
当人们问起他们的职业时，我总是编造一些谎言，一些并不存在的快乐记忆。我爸爸是警察，他帮助了很多人！我妈妈是 NASA 的工程师！一些高尚的，有时甚至是夸张的事情。一些我可以引以为傲的事情。当其他孩子感到惊讶或羡慕，用宽大而好奇的眼睛看着我时，这让我在这个世界上感到不那么孤单。有些夜晚，经历了一次事件后，我会安慰自己，想象自己有一个哥哥，一个可以倾诉并分担我痛苦的人。这就是为什么我总是对铃原兄弟抱有一丝怨恨。我愿意付出一切，去拥有他们所分享的东西。

Back when my father's symptoms first started, he lost his job at the news agency in Panama City after decking one of his coworkers. In the span of four years he worked his way through twelve different jobs. His PTSD used to get so bad he couldn't hold any of them down for long. No boss wanted that mess on their hands. It turned into such an awful track record no one would even give him the courtesy of an interview. He was cast to the wayside, unwanted, occasionally exiled for more personal vendettas. Usually, everyone took the Soryu name at face value, rarely putting up much of a fuss. But if anyone did any digging, paid for more thorough background checks and found out my dad was actually an Ikari, that was when we had to annex ourselves from the community completely.  
早在父亲症状初现时，他因殴打同事而失去了在巴拿马城新闻社的工作。四年内，他辗转了十二份不同的工作。他的创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）曾严重到无法长期保住任何职位。没有老板愿意接手这样的麻烦。这糟糕的履历最终导致无人愿意给予他面试的机会。他被边缘化，无人问津，偶尔还会因私人恩怨被驱逐。通常，人们仅凭 Soryu 这个姓氏就做出判断，很少大惊小怪。但一旦有人深入调查，支付更详尽的背景检查费用，发现我父亲其实是 Ikari，那时我们便不得不彻底脱离社区。

Here in the states most people still hold Japan in contempt for Third Impact, punishing its soldiers for the machinations of its leaders. The Japanese that managed to resettle remembered things a little differently. A group in Hokkaido made something for my parents. Coming home from school, I noticed a new picture hanging in the hallway. In the living room beyond, dad was rummaging through an open box. There was one for my mother too, but I don't remember her ever opening it.  
在美国，大多数人仍因第三次冲击而对日本抱有轻蔑，惩罚其士兵以回应其领导人的阴谋。那些设法重新定居的日本人则记得事情略有不同。北海道的一群人为我父母做了些东西。放学回家时，我注意到走廊上挂了一幅新画。在客厅那边，爸爸正在翻找一个打开的箱子。也有一个给我妈妈的，但我记不清她是否曾打开过。

In the picture, there were these tall twin towers flanked by a series of smaller skyscrapers, silhouetted against a rich orange sky – I remember them from when dad used to take me down to the bakery and reminisce about Tokyo-3 in the sunset. A white cross sat in the background over golden hues. At the bottom, inscribed in silver against the black, just two words:  
画中，两座高耸的双子塔被一系列较小的摩天大楼环绕，映衬着一片绚烂的橙色天空——我记得爸爸曾带我去面包店时，常在夕阳下回忆起东京-3 的景象。背景中，一座白色十字架矗立在金色光影之上。底部，银色字迹刻在黑色背景上，只有两个字：

_Thank you_. 谢谢。

I didn't know who sent the boxes, how they found us – maybe it was the Soryu surname they latched onto. It didn't matter. I didn't care. The war was ruining my life and here it was in our hallway, glorified – _honored_ – in glass and ebony frame. Those people on that wreck of an island didn't know my father at all. If they saw what he was really like, no one would ever thank him.  
我不知道是谁寄来了这些箱子，他们是如何找到我们的——或许是他们抓住了‘宗像’这个姓氏。这无关紧要。我不在乎。战争正在毁掉我的生活，而现在它就在我们的走廊里，被玻璃和乌木框所美化——所尊崇。那个岛上的废墟中的人们根本不了解我的父亲。如果他们看到他真正的样子，没有人会感谢他。

They also gave him some memorabilia that must've been popular on the home island: a black nylon jacket with _01_ in white on the back. I think it was his unit designation back in the war. It fits him just right, though he looks a bit uncomfortable in it, as if he's uncertain about even wearing it. _Proud Angel Fighter_, it says on the left shoulder.  
他们还给了他一些肯定在家乡岛上很流行的纪念品：一件黑色尼龙夹克，背后用白色印着 01。我想这是他在战争中的部队编号。虽然这件夹克正好合身，但他看起来有点不自在，仿佛连穿上它都感到不确定。左肩上写着‘骄傲的天使战士’。

"Nobody cares you were in some stupid war," I sneer as I walk by, pausing at the base of the stairs. "All you did was make everybody miserable."  
“没人关心你参加过那场愚蠢的战争，”我经过时嘲讽道，在楼梯底部停下。“你只是让大家都不开心。”

He doesn't say anything, doesn't try to defend himself or all the horrible things everyone says he did. He just gets this sad sort of look and takes the jacket off, stowing it away in the closet where he never touches it again.  
他什么也没说，没有试图为自己辩护，也没有反驳大家说他做的那些可怕事情。他只是露出了那种悲伤的表情，脱下夹克，把它收进衣柜里，再也没有碰过它。

For the next five years that picture of the Tokyo-3 towers hung in our hallway.  
接下来的五年里，那张东京-3 塔的照片一直挂在我们家的走廊上。

I smashed it to pieces when I left.  
我离开时把它砸得粉碎。

### Chapter 7: December 1

My name is Kazuya Langley Soryu.  
我的名字是和也·兰利·惣流。

My father kept my mother's last name, for obvious reasons. My middle name is from Grandfather Langley, even though he was a Soryu for his first marriage.  
出于显而易见的原因，我父亲保留了我母亲的姓氏。我的中间名来自外祖父兰利，尽管他第一次婚姻时是惣流。

I like to think I was gifted that name because my mother still held some lasting fondness for a father who was never around much when she was growing up. I create that fantasy because I don't really know. In reality, she probably chose it in case I ever needed something more American to use in social situations. Just in case I entered an area where the Japanese were even more unwelcome than they already were. Forty something years after Third Impact, it's not so bad anymore. Sometimes a drunk might spit at me and call me a "dirty fucking Jerry", but that's about as far as it goes.  
我喜欢认为这个名字是母亲对外祖父仍存有的一份持久情感的体现，尽管他在她成长过程中并不常在身边。我编织这个幻想，因为我并不真正了解。实际上，她可能选择这个名字是为了我在社交场合中万一需要一个更美国化的身份。在第三次冲击发生四十多年后，情况已经没那么糟糕了。有时会有醉汉朝我吐口水并骂我‘肮脏的该死的日本佬’，但也就仅此而已。

This morning I ride Gypsy out to Headquarters. My Department is nestled in the old headquarters building put up back in the 1950s. Winter has kicked into full gear and it's cold as hell. I thought I'd miss this after visiting Arizona, but all I can think about is how much I want to get inside so my feet and hands don't snap off from frostbite.  
今早我骑着吉普赛马前往总部。我的部门坐落在建于上世纪五十年代的旧总部大楼里。冬天已经全面来临，冷得要命。我曾以为在访问亚利桑那后会怀念这里的寒冷，但现在满脑子只想快点进去，免得手脚因冻伤而断裂。

It's only 34 degrees here.  
这里只有 34 度。

Checkpoints are passed, polite nods given to other passing officers. Everyone mostly keeps to themselves.  
通过了检查站，向其他经过的警官礼貌地点头示意。大家基本上都各自为政。

For my part, I sit in an office all day and shuffle files from one server to another. In the middle of that process, documents have to be reviewed, old records have to be analyzed for inconsistencies, marked for classification and then refiled if some asshole upstairs fucked up the paperwork. It's the kind of menial, thankless crap that no one thinks about when the CIA comes to mind – but someone has to do it.  
就我而言，我整天坐在办公室里，将文件从一个服务器转移到另一个服务器。在这个过程中，文档需要审查，旧记录需要分析不一致之处，标记分类，然后如果楼上某个混蛋搞砸了文书工作，还得重新归档。这是那种当人们想到中央情报局时不会考虑的琐碎、吃力不讨好的工作——但总得有人来做。

"Kazuya," a voice growls from the open door of a windowed office. "Glad to have you back."  
“和也，”一个声音从一间带窗办公室的门口咆哮道，“很高兴你回来了。”

I don't know how he sees me through the very literal mountain of paperwork on his desk. I can't even see _him_ behind it. A manilla folder slides out from the middle, somehow leaving a small slit where I can see the Chief's eyes. "All quiet on the western front?"  
我不知道他是怎么透过他桌上那座字面意义上的文件山看到我的。我甚至看不到他的人影。一个马尼拉文件夹从中滑出，不知怎么地留下了一个小缝隙，让我能看到局长的眼睛。“西线无战事？”

He always has the worst jokes. I force a chuckle. "For now."  
他总是讲些最糟糕的笑话。我勉强笑了一声。“目前来说。”

"Good, good." he seems to nod, and a hand reaches over the mountain to offer me a folder. "Sorry to saddle you with this right back on the job, but I need these on priority. Blackbagging ops in Serbia. Two thousand thirteen. Not classified anymore."  
“好，好。”他似乎点了点头，一只手从文件堆里伸过来递给我一个文件夹。“抱歉刚回来就让你接手这个，但这些我需要优先处理。塞尔维亚的秘密行动。二零一三年。已经不涉密了。”

Taking it in hand, I mentally prepare myself for diving into the servers to find all of it. "Sure thing."  
我接过文件夹，心里准备着潜入服务器查找所有相关资料。“没问题。”

I stop by my desk, which is only slightly more spacious than everyone else's in the Department. There's already a few other assignments waiting at my In slot. It's a constant war of attrition to make sure I don't end up as scattered and backed up as the Chief.  
我停在自己的办公桌前，虽然它比部门里其他人的稍微宽敞一点。我的收件箱里已经躺着几份待处理的文件。为了不让自己像主任那样杂乱无章、积压成山，我必须时刻保持警惕，这是一场持久战。

"Langley." a deadpan voice says. It belongs to a simple long-sleeved white shirt, short jet black hair and brown eyes sporting dark rings under them. Philip – tells everyone to call him Pip – takes a sip from his coffee. "Good weekend? Sucked here. Inbox's backed up. Carrie was a bitch. More than usual," he says in that same quiet monotone that makes him sound forever tired.  
“兰利。”一个毫无生气的声音说道。说话的是一个穿着简单长袖白衬衫、留着短短的乌黑头发、棕色眼睛下带着黑眼圈的男人。菲利普——他让大家叫他皮普——啜了一口咖啡。“周末过得好吗？这里糟透了。收件箱积压如山。凯莉是个婊子。比平时更甚。”他用那种总是让人感觉他永远疲惫不堪的平静单调语气说道。

He keeps walking before I can say anything.  
他没等我开口就继续往前走了。

As far as I know, Pip doesn't really like anybody. So at the very least I know he doesn't dislike me because I'm Japanese. Most people in the Department know me as a Langley. You'd think that an office block full of CIA officers, people who supposedly have a very keen eye for irregularities and misdirection, never bothered to see past the guise and discover me for a Soryu. Well, most people except the Section Chief and Carrie.  
据我所知，皮普并不真正喜欢任何人。所以至少我知道他不会因为我是个日本人而讨厌我。部门里大多数人都知道我叫朗利。你可能会以为，一个满是中情局官员的办公楼，那些本应对异常和误导有敏锐眼光的人，却从未费心看穿伪装，发现我是索吕。嗯，大多数人，除了部门主管和卡丽。

I find her around the corner, leaning against the copier. Thin blonde hair, pale complexion and slim red lips I've gotten very familiar with in the past. Carrie Bulkeley, in her own way, is a lot like me. I think it's why we never really got along in the end. She saw right through me with those sharp green eyes. From the moment I borrowed a pen and she caught me staring at the sway of her hips as she walked off.  
我在拐角处找到了她，她正靠在复印机上。金色的短发，苍白的肤色，还有那双我过去非常熟悉的纤细红唇。卡丽·布尔克利，以她自己的方式，和我有很多相似之处。我想这就是为什么我们最终没有真正相处得来的原因。她那双锐利的绿眼睛一眼就看穿了我。从我借笔的那一刻起，她就注意到我盯着她走路时臀部的摆动。

It was the start of a tumultuous relationship that was more or less an unspoken agreement to be Friends with Benefits. We'd get wasted in some shitty bar, have sex at her flat, and come back into work the next morning like nothing had ever happened. Things turned sour when we started trying to pursue an actual relationship. I guess neither of us knew how to deal with it.  
这是一段动荡关系的开始，基本上是一种心照不宣的‘朋友加利益’协议。我们会在某个破酒吧里喝得烂醉，在她公寓里发生关系，第二天早上又若无其事地回到工作中。当我们开始尝试发展一段真正的关系时，事情变得糟糕起来。我想我们俩都不知道该如何处理。

She grants me a cursory glance. "You look like shit."  
她匆匆瞥了我一眼。“你看起来糟透了。”

"I feel like shit." “我感觉糟透了。”

"Trouble with the mis'ess?"  
"太太遇到麻烦了？"

I know she's mostly joking, but my temper sky rockets. "Fuck off, please and thank you."  
我知道她多半是在开玩笑，但我的脾气瞬间爆发。“滚开，请了，谢谢。”

She _tsks_ and slaps my shoulder with the folder in her hand. "God, you're such a dick."  
她啧了一声，用手中的文件夹拍了拍我的肩膀。“天啊，你真是个混蛋。”

I give her a wink. "Only for you."  
我向她眨了眨眼。“只为你。”

"I feel so special," she deadpans, throwing hair over a shoulder. "Seriously, what's got you?"  
“我感觉自己特别重要。”她面无表情地说，甩了甩头发到肩上。“说真的，你怎么了？”

A big sigh, hands shuffling through my _In_ files. "Parents, girlfriend... and Shamal didn't mark up these goddamn requisition reports from thirty-four."  
我长叹一口气，双手在“收件箱”里翻找。“父母，女朋友……还有 Shamal 没给这该死的三十四份申请报告做标记。”

"Welcome to the Directorate of Intelligence."  
"欢迎来到情报局。"

I grunt, moseying into the adjacent breakroom where there's three hour old coffee and a mumbling T.V.  
我咕哝一声，慢悠悠地走进隔壁的休息室，那里有三小时前的咖啡和一台喃喃自语的电视。

"You hear about Macedonia?" Carrie nods to the screen. "SOG team got hit by somebody in Thessaloniki. All KIA. Chief says it was probably PLA Spec Ops. Clandestine really screwed up this time."  
"你听说马其顿的事了吗？" 凯莉朝屏幕点了点头。"特种作战小组在塞萨洛尼基被袭击了。全员阵亡。长官说可能是中国特种部队干的。这次秘密行动真是搞砸了。"

"It happens. That's the game."  
"事情总会发生。这就是游戏规则。"

"Doesn't mean it _should_ happen. Especially after Beijing."  
"并不意味着它应该发生。尤其是在北京之后。"

I give her a flat grimace. Hard to argue that one, even if it was a few years ago now. It's one of the many things I both like and dislike about her. She's honest, generally well-meaning, but in your face and condescending about it all in one package. That's Carrie. Always making sure I never get too accustomed to the practice of self-deception.  
我向她露出一个生硬的苦笑。这一点很难反驳，尽管那已经是几年前的事了。她身上有许多我既喜欢又不喜欢的地方。她诚实，通常出于好意，但总是直截了当且带有居高临下的态度。这就是嘉莉。总是确保我永远不会习惯于自我欺骗的练习。

Operation Hourglass, my very first case, wasn't supposed to end with the deaths of two innocent Chinese women and a CIA officer. I wasn't directly responsible, but my information wasn't right – and information is everything in the CIA.  
时光沙漏行动，我的首个案件，本不该以两名无辜中国女性和一名中情局官员的死亡告终。我并非直接责任人，但我的情报有误——而在中情局，情报就是一切。

That was pretty much the end of my career with the Clandestine Department. The higher ups decided I still had useful skills – archiving documents and analyzing old records. They let me keep my paygrade since I'd already been with the agency for a few years. It was a merciful sentence in light of how bad I'd fucked up.  
那几乎宣告了我在秘密部门的职业生涯的终结。高层认为我仍具备有用技能——归档文件和分析旧档案。他们让我保留了薪资等级，毕竟我已为机构效力数年。考虑到我搞砸的程度，这算是仁慈的判决了。

My phone buzzes. A text. I panic a little, hoping it isn't Marina, but really hoping it is. No, I can't deal with this at work. I'm not ready.  
手机震动，收到一条短信。我有些慌张，既希望是玛丽娜发来的，又希望不是。不，我无法在工作时处理这个。我还没准备好。

At exactly 4:17, August 4, 2031, Kensuke Aida fell off the U.S. Supercarrier _Abraham Lincoln_. Well, not exactly fell off, more or less thrown off by the exhaust from a jet blast as a fighter crossed the arresting wires with just a little too much power. It was at this point he was blown towards the mesh of nets surrounding the drop off of the flight deck, mounted to save his life in case of such a mishap. Except it did not account for the scrawny Navy boy also getting picked up on the wind by his loose jacket. It was fortuitous then that the jet engine test area, at the aft of the carrier where he was standing, stuck out just so from the flight deck. It was also doubly lucky that an engine wasn't being tested at the time, or else Kensuke would've been a very crispy corpse.  
2031 年 8 月 4 日，下午 4 点 17 分整，Kensuke Aida 从美国超级航母亚伯拉罕·林肯号上掉了下来。确切地说，并不是自己掉下来的，而是被一架战斗机在拦截索上以稍强的动力飞过时产生的尾流抛了出去。就在这时，他被吹向了飞行甲板边缘周围用来防止此类事故的网状防护网。只是这并未考虑到他那宽松的夹克也被风吹起的瘦弱海军男孩。幸运的是，他当时所在的航母后部的喷气发动机测试区恰好从飞行甲板上凸出来。而且，当时并没有进行发动机测试，否则 Kensuke 可能已经变成一具焦尸了。

He broke four ribs, dislocated his right shoulder and fractured a femur.  
他断了四根肋骨，右肩脱臼，股骨骨折。

It's his favorite story to tell.  
这是他最喜欢讲的故事。

Sitting at a bar down the street, I'm listening to the fourth rendition. Kensuke has his dress blues on. Always puts on his best when he gets to see his daughter. Yuki herself has settled for the simpler tan service uniform. A Navy girl, just like her dad raised her.  
坐在街边的酒吧里，我正在听第四遍。健介穿着他的蓝色礼服。每次见到女儿时，他总是穿上最好的衣服。雪自己则选择了简单的卡其色制服。海军女孩，就像她父亲培养她的那样。

She takes her peaked cap off with a sigh. "Thank you, dad. That was just as riveting as the _first_ thirty times I heard it."  
她叹了口气，摘下尖顶帽。“谢谢你，爸爸。这和我前三十次听到的一样扣人心弦。”

The man laughs, taking a gulp from his beer and adjusting his glasses, the rectangular and efficient kind. "Kazuya hasn't heard it before, right?"  
那男人笑了，喝了一大口啤酒，调整了一下他的眼镜，那种方形的、高效款式的。“和也以前没听过这个，对吧？”

I don't have the heart to tell him I have. Plus it just further frustrates Yuki when I shake my head and Kensuke taps her shoulder with a backhand, saying, "See?"  
我不忍心告诉他我听过。而且，当我摇头时，这只会让由纪更加沮丧，而健介用反手拍了拍她的肩膀，说：“看吧？”

She rolls her eyes, moving an errant lock of shoulder-length oak hair. She's also got a bit of red on her cheeks – and not from the cold outside. Kensuke is the boisterous sort, even after being in the military for thirty-two years now. It's relatively quiet in the bar tonight and there's a band towards the back playing some Christmas piece. Chief Petty Officer Aida has been loudly reminiscing about his youth in the Navy, much to the embarrassment of his only daughter. The myriad of patrons have been throwing us glances, but little more. Nobody disrespects a man in uniform, even if they are just another Jerry.  
"她翻了个白眼，拨开一缕散落在肩上的橡木色头发。她的脸颊上也带着一丝红晕——不是因为外面的寒冷。健介是个活泼的人，即使已经在军队服役了三十二年。今晚酒吧相对安静，后面有一支乐队在演奏圣诞曲目。海军一级军士长相田一直在大声回忆他在海军的青春岁月，这让他的独生女感到尴尬。众多顾客不时向我们投来目光，但也就仅此而已。没有人会不尊重一个穿制服的人，即使他们只是另一个普通人。”

He finishes off his glass and knocks on the bartop, signaling for another. "So how's your ma', Kazuya? Just got back in, haven't heard from your dad since last week."  
他喝完杯中的酒，敲了敲吧台，示意再来一杯。“那么，和马，你妈妈怎么样了？刚回来，从上周起就没听到你爸的消息。”

I shrug, offer a weak smile. I know them too well to try and pretend much. "Fine. Doc says she needs to keep her blood pressure down."  
我耸耸肩，勉强笑了笑。他们太了解我了，我也没法装得太多。“还好。医生说她需要控制血压。”

He huffs, fresh mug in his hand. "I could've told her that for free. Actually, I have."  
他哼了一声，手里拿着新倒的啤酒。“这我免费就能告诉她。实际上，我也确实说过。”

"Not in those exact words," Yuki chides, finishing off her third glass. A curious smirk pokes at her cheeks. "I think she gave you a black eye, didn't she?"  
“不是用那些确切的词，”由纪责备道，喝完了她的第三杯酒。她的脸颊上露出一丝好奇的微笑。“我想她给了你一个黑眼圈，不是吗？”

He grumbles a bit, scratching at his close-cropped hair. "Fun fact: just because you're in a military base doesn't mean you're safe from PMS. No offense, Kazuya, but you know how she is. Always had a temper, ever since we were kids. Knew she'd be a handful the minute I met her."  
他咕哝了几句，挠了挠剪得短短的头发。“有趣的事实：即使你在军事基地里，也不意味着你能免受经前综合症的影响。无意冒犯，和也，但你知道她是什么样的。从小脾气就大。我第一次见到她就知道她会是个麻烦。”

I _do_ know how she is, but this is the first I've heard of that particular incident. Either her moods must've been on a shorter leash or she's never taken much of a liking to Kensuke – it's hard to tell what kind of men she does and does not approve of. I want to ask him about it, managing to keep my mouth shut anyway. If I give in to that ravenous curiosity, I'll be losing to something I've left deep and buried since I was in college. Plus, I don't want it out in the open that Kensuke Aida might know more about my parents than I do.  
我确实知道她是什么样的，但这还是我第一次听说那个特定的事件。要么是她的情绪控制得更紧，要么是她从未对健介有过太多好感——很难判断她对什么样的男人赞成或不赞成。我想问他这件事，但还是设法保持沉默。如果我屈服于那股贪婪的好奇心，我就会输给大学时期深埋心底的东西。此外，我也不想让外界知道，相田健介可能比我更了解我的父母。

"Didn't you first meet her on an aircraft carrier?" Yuki asks, still with that quizzical expression.  
"你不是第一次在航空母舰上遇到她的吗？" 由纪问道，脸上依旧带着那副好奇的表情。

My eyebrows tighten and I blink. "What?"  
我皱起眉头，眨了眨眼。"什么？"

Kensuke gets this big smile. "Yep. We all did. You should ask your dad about that one, Kazuya. He'd probably tell it better than I could."  
健介露出了大大的笑容。"没错。我们都是。你应该问问你爸爸，和也。他讲得可能比我好。"

I can't hold this one back. It's just the strangest thing I've ever heard. Or maybe it's strange because I'm trying to conjure up an image of what my parents even looked like when they were young – and I can't. "They met on an aircraft carrier?"  
我无法抑制这份好奇。这是我听过最奇怪的事了。或许正因为我在努力想象父母年轻时的模样——却怎么也想不起来。“他们在航空母舰上相遇的？”

"It was right after the, uh, which one was it...?" he looks up to the ceiling, hand rubbing his chin.  
“那是在……呃，是哪一次来着……？”他抬头望向天花板，手摩挲着下巴。

"Fifth Angel, dad." “是第五使徒那次，爸爸。”

"Right!" he says, snapping his fingers. "Sixth Angel showed up that day while we were on the carrier. Sunk half the damn Pacific Fleet." he shakes his head a bit.  
"对！" 他说着，打了个响指。"第六使徒那天出现在航母上，把半个太平洋舰队都击沉了。" 他微微摇了摇头。

A fleet? An entire fleet was attacked by an Angel – and my parents were there? That's how they met? I have too many questions to ask and not enough mouths to ask them all at once. My lips part with a question and Kensuke's watch beeps. He pulls up a sleeve and grimaces.  
一个舰队？整个舰队被使徒攻击了——而我父母就在那里？他们就是这样相遇的？我有太多问题要问，却没有足够的嘴巴同时问出来。我张开嘴想问一个问题，这时 Kensuke 的手表响了。他拉起袖子，皱了皱眉。

"Well, I've got a date down at the courthouse. Don't ever get married."  
"好吧，我得去法院赴约了。千万别结婚。"

Yuki frowns. "But you _like_ Frederic."  
Yuki 皱起眉头。“但你喜欢 Frederic。”

"I was talking to Kazuya – always good to see you." he reaches over and we shake hands. "You know, it's still not too late for you to join the Navy."  
“我刚才在和 Kazuya 说话——很高兴见到你。”他伸出手来，我们握了握手。“你知道，现在加入海军还不算太晚。”

"No offense, but I think I'd throw myself overboard before I had the chance to fall off."  
“无意冒犯，但我想我宁愿自己跳下船，也不愿有机会掉下去。”

That makes him laugh and he claps me on the shoulder. Yuki gets up for a parting hug. She fusses over his uniform as they separate, brushing off his shoulders, fixing and straightening his jacket. His hard, wizened features become a little softer as he grins, settling his cap on right.  
这让他笑了起来，他拍了拍我的肩膀。Yuki 起身给了他一个告别的拥抱。他们分开时，她忙着整理他的制服，掸去他肩上的灰尘，调整并拉直他的夹克。他坚硬、布满皱纹的面容在微笑中变得柔和了一些，他调整好帽子，戴得端正。

"Thanks, sweetheart." “谢谢，亲爱的。”

"Love you, dad." she kisses him on the cheek, making him chuckle as he leaves. It's only late afternoon as he marches out into orange hues.  
“爱你，爸爸。”她亲吻了他的脸颊，让他轻声笑了起来，然后他离开了。此时只是傍晚时分，他踏着橙色的光影走了出去。

"Sorry," Yuki says after a minute, a bit of guilt settling over her expression. "I forgot you don't–"  
"对不起，" 由纪在一分钟后说道，脸上浮现出一丝内疚。"我忘了你不——"

"So where's Frederic?" I ask, trying to focus on the football game up across the big flat screen.  
"那么弗雷德里克在哪儿？" 我问道，试图将注意力集中在对面大屏幕上的足球比赛上。

Yuki doesn't falter. "Still out on deployment. He'll be back around March. _I'll_ be out with Seventh Fleet."  
由纪没有动摇。"还在执行任务中。他大概三月份回来。我会随第七舰队外出。"

I imagine that must be hard, having a fiancé in the Army, always in different places across the world. Yuki doesn't seem to mind it too much. She's been a military brat all her life. Kensuke joined the U.S. Navy in 2021, so she's always had a soft spot for military men and a strong dislike for civilian women ever since her mom up and left a few days before her fifth birthday.  
我想那一定很不容易，有个在陆军服役的未婚夫，总是辗转世界各地。但由纪似乎并不太介意。她从小就是个军娃。健介在 2021 年加入了美国海军，所以她一直对军人有好感，而对平民女性则有着根深蒂固的反感，这一切都源于她母亲在她五岁生日前几天突然离开。

Yuki and Frederic have been engaged for four years now and her father is currently working his way through a third divorce. They usually get their leave to line up, but can't talk about where they're being deployed next or what they'll be doing. I poke fun by asking her if she's going to get married on a boat too. She doesn't think that's so funny. At times, she even seems a little worried over it. I guess she's all too familiar with her dad's track record and doesn't want any of the same.  
由纪和弗雷德里克订婚已经四年了，而她的父亲正在经历第三次离婚。他们通常会安排休假时间一致，但不能谈论下一步将被派往何处或执行什么任务。我开玩笑问她是否也打算在船上举行婚礼。她并不觉得这有什么好笑的。有时，她甚至显得有些担忧。我想她对父亲的过往再熟悉不过，不想重蹈覆辙。

Her voice stuns me out of the bottom of my glass. "You can't keep doing that, you know."  
她的声音将我从杯底拉回现实。“你知道，你不能再这样下去了。”

"What?" I ask, spoken more like a challenge – daring her to continue.  
"什么？" 我问道，语气更像是一种挑衅——激她继续说下去。

She taunts me with a sad smile. "Keep everything bottled up like that."  
她带着一丝哀伤的微笑挑衅我。"就这样一直把所有事情都憋在心里。"

"How is my personal life anybody's business?"  
"我的个人生活关谁的事了？"

Her hands cup my face and she turns me to look at her. "That's what I'm talking about, Kazu. You can't keep pushing people away. Open your heart a little, hm?" her right hand pats my cheek – _good boy_. Standing, she tugs on her uniform and fits her cap on. "Anyway, I've got to be heading out too. Next one's on me, okay?"  
她双手捧着我的脸，让我转向她。“这就是我想说的，和也。你不能总是把人推开。稍微敞开心扉，嗯？”她的右手轻拍我的脸颊——好孩子。她站起身，整理了一下制服，戴上帽子。“总之，我也得走了。下次我请，好吗？”

"Sure." "当然。"

_Like you're one to talk, Yuki_. I don't want to fight with her over it. I care about her too much. Or maybe I'm scared she'll eventually leave me too. I lost that fight when I was fifteen, but at least we're still friends and at least we still talk. I don't know if that makes it better or worse.  
像你这样的人还来说我，由纪。我不想和她为此争吵。我太在乎她了。或者也许我害怕她最终也会离开我。我在十五岁时就输掉了那场战斗，但至少我们还是朋友，至少我们还能交谈。我不知道这是好是坏。

Yuki nudges my arm. "Hey, are you sure you're okay?"  
由纪轻推我的手臂。“嘿，你确定你没事吗？”

I lift my mug, plastic smile and all. "Yup."  
我举起我的杯子，带着塑料般的微笑。“嗯。”

She shakes her head, but smiles anyway. "I'll see you around, then."  
她摇了摇头，但还是笑了。“那我们回头见。”

"See ya'." “再见。”

_Open your heart_, she says. As if it's the easiest thing in the world once you get the hang of it. Since I've known her, Yuki's been the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve. We were an odd pair at fifteen. She, expressive and emotional. Then me, quiet and moody.  
她让我敞开心扉，好像一旦掌握了窍门，这便是世界上最简单的事。自从认识她以来，由纪就是那种把心事写在脸上的女孩。十五岁时，我们是奇怪的一对。她，情感丰富且外露。而我，沉默寡言，情绪多变。

I pay our tab, trying to keep those Summer memories from surfacing.  
我结了账，努力不让那些夏日的记忆浮现。

The apartment is quiet. Marina hasn't called or texted and all of her things are still here. I wonder when she's going to come get them. I can only assume we're done for – it's over. Part of me hopes that's the case, that way I can just give up and go back to being on my own.  
公寓里静悄悄的。玛丽娜既没打电话也没发短信，她的所有东西都还在这里。我不知道她什么时候会来取走。我只能假设我们结束了——一切都结束了。我的一部分希望事实如此，这样我就可以放弃，重新回到一个人的状态。

People are hard to deal with.  
人很难相处。

Two years ago, I was in yet another therapy session, trying to make it seem like I was doing something to better myself. In actuality, the only reason I'd gone was because it had been mandated by my department that I go for yearly checkups. I quit out after my slated two weeks were up. I didn't really want to hear what she had to say, or try and reach deep down to some hidden truth.  
两年前，我又一次坐在心理治疗室里，表面上装作在努力自我提升。实际上，我去那里的唯一原因是我所在的部门要求我每年进行一次检查。我按计划的两周结束后就退出了。我并不真的想听她说什么，也不想试图挖掘内心深处的隐秘真相。

I was afraid. 我害怕。

In those two weeks, that stranger got to know me better than I did.  
在那两周里，那个陌生人比我更了解我自己。

_"Why do you want to know about the war?" she asks, pencil touching her lower lip.  
“你为什么想知道战争的事？”她问，铅笔轻触着下唇。_

_I shrug. "I feel like if I know the war, then I'll know my father."  
我耸耸肩。“我觉得如果我知道战争，就能了解我父亲。”_

_She nods, even smiles a bit. "There are a lot of ways to get to know someone. Just as many ways to forgive someone too."  
她点点头，甚至微微一笑。“了解一个人有很多方式，原谅一个人也同样如此。”_

So I decide to call again tonight. Not to offer forgiveness, that's a chasm I don't think I'll ever be able to cross. It's something else – something desperate, I guess. An inherent need to connect with someone. Anyone.  
所以我决定今晚再打电话。不是为了给予宽恕，那是我认为永远无法跨越的深渊。而是出于别的——我想是绝望，一种与某人、任何人建立联系的内在需求。

I consider just hanging up when my father answers: "Hello?"  
当我父亲接电话时，我考虑过直接挂断：“喂？”

"Hey, dad," I blurt, before I freeze up like last time.  
“嘿，爸爸，”我脱口而出，随即像上次那样僵住了。

A pause. "Everything alright, Kazuya?"  
一阵沉默。“一切都好吗，和也？”

_Of course_. In his eyes, why else would I call unless something was wrong? Well, something is wrong, but I don't want to talk about that.  
当然。在他看来，我打电话除了有事不对劲还能为什么？嗯，确实有问题，但我不想谈这个。

"I'll get your mother, hang on."  
"我去叫你妈妈，等一下。"

"Uh, wait, I... I actually called to talk to you, dad."  
"呃，等等，我... 我其实是打电话来跟你聊的，爸爸。"

"What about?" he sounds suspicious.  
"什么事？" 他听起来有些怀疑。

I fidget, stuttering a moment. _What the hell do I do from here?_ "Kensuke said that– you and mom met on an aircraft carrier, during the Angel War."  
我局促不安，结巴了一会儿。接下来我该怎么办？“健介说——你和妈妈是在天使战争期间，在一艘航空母舰上相遇的。”

_Very smooth, Kazuya.  真会说话，和也。_

"Oh, I..." he trails off and there's just quiet for a bit. I start to panic and it gets harder to breathe. I've fucked up again. I've mentioned the Angel War. He's going to have another episode. He's going to slip into the crater and start screaming.  
“哦，我……”他话音渐弱，一时间只剩下沉默。我开始慌了，呼吸也变得困难。我又搞砸了。我提到了天使战争。他又要发作了。他会陷入那个坑里，开始尖叫。

"We did, but... I don't want to talk about that... sorry."  
"我们确实做了，但是...我不想谈论那个...对不起。"

I try not to sound disappointed. "No, that's okay. I'll just – I'll just talk to mom, then."  
我尽量不显得失望。"不，没关系。那我就——我就和妈妈聊聊吧。"

He hands off the phone and I feel so completely stupid. Just a stupid little kid. It rips me open how right Marina was – and she knew it. She was so sure of it, so wounded she had to cut me up right back. I can barely pay attention as me and mother trade "hellos and how are yous" and find something trivial and non-family related to talk about.  
他把电话递过来，我感到自己愚蠢至极。就像个愚蠢的小孩。玛丽娜的话一针见血，让我心如刀割——她早就知道，她如此确信，如此受伤，以至于必须回敬我一刀。我和母亲互相问候，聊些无关紧要的琐事，我几乎无法集中注意力。

I really want to hit something. This is unhealthy.  
我真的想揍点什么。这很不健康。

I think she can sense something's wrong. She doesn't ask and I wish I could tell her. I don't have any idea how. I'm still trying to get comfortable with the idea of talking to her again. I know she's going to misunderstand anyway, think I'm ticked at her or something. I can't tell her that's not what's wrong.  
我觉得她能感觉到有什么不对劲。她没问，而我真希望自己能告诉她。我不知道怎么说。我还在努力适应再次和她交谈的想法。我知道她无论如何都会误解，以为我在生她的气或其他什么。我不能告诉她那不是问题所在。

She tells me goodbye, tells me dad has one more thing to say and hands the phone back. On the other end, I can hear his footsteps and the creak of a door.  
她跟我说再见，告诉我爸爸还有一件事要说，然后把电话递了回去。在另一端，我能听到他的脚步声和门吱嘎作响的声音。

"Your mom's birthday is coming up soon," he says.  
"你妈妈的生日快到了," 他说。

I glance at the calendar. December 1st – shit, she'll be turning 54 in three days.  
我瞥了一眼日历。12 月 1 日——该死，她三天后就要 54 岁了。

"Uh, yeah... what should I get her?"  
"呃，是啊... 我该给她买什么呢？"

Birthdays have always been a strange affair in our house. Dad received them awkwardly – if he was out of his room that week – and mother made a big fuss over hers, demanding extravagant tribute. It was the one occasion me and my father teamed up to get her something really special. As for my own, I stopped caring when I was around eleven and the celebrations died down for all of us. Each one was just a countdown until I'd finally be old enough to leave. It was the only real reason I looked forward to it.  
在我们家，生日总是件奇怪的事。爸爸收到礼物时总是尴尬——如果那周他走出房间的话——而妈妈则对她的生日大肆宣扬，要求奢华的礼物。我和爸爸唯一联手的时候就是给她准备特别的东西。至于我自己的生日，大约十一岁时我就停止在意了，我们所有人的庆祝活动也逐渐减少。每个生日对我来说都只是倒计时，直到我终于足够大可以离开。那是我唯一期待它的真正原因。

"She's always been hard to buy for," dad concedes, pausing again. He sounds nervous. "I was thinking... she... your mom's been working a lot... at the lab and... I think she could use a vacation. What if she went up and stayed with you for her birthday? You both can catch up some more and you can show her around Washington. I think she'd like that."  
“给她买礼物总是很难，”爸爸承认道，再次停顿。他听起来很紧张。“我在想……她……你妈妈最近在实验室工作很忙……我觉得她需要一个假期。如果她去你那里过生日怎么样？你们俩可以多聊聊，你还可以带她在华盛顿转转。我想她会喜欢的。”

My first response is _No_. I clench my teeth to keep from saying it. I have to at least give it some consideration. There are 20 days a year I can use to be absent from work. Not using some from last year, I've built up at least a month's worth of time off. But this has to be the worst possible time for it. I don't feel confident in dealing with either of my parents in any... close capacity. It's fine now that they're seven states away.  
我的第一反应是拒绝。我紧咬牙关，以免脱口而出。至少我得考虑一下。每年我有 20 天可以请假不上班。加上去年没用完的，我攒下的假期至少有一个月。但偏偏这个时候提出请假，时机糟糕透顶。无论是与哪位父母近距离相处，我都缺乏自信。现在他们远在七个州之外，倒还好。

"Will you be coming too?" I ask and for a while only phone static answers me.  
“你也会来吗？”我问道，电话那头一时间只有静电噪音回应。

"I... no, I wouldn't want to get in the way, or anything."  
“我……不，我不想妨碍你们，或是其他什么。”

Dad says he'll pay for the plane ticket. We agree to fly her out on December 3rd and fly her back on the 6th. Neither of us says goodbye as we hang up. I dial the Chief to let him know when I'll be using my days again.  
老爸说他负责买机票。我们商定让她 12 月 3 日飞过来，6 日再飞回去。挂电话时，我们谁也没说再见。我拨通了局长的电话，告诉他我何时会再次请假。

The kitchen is still marred with dried spills of coffee – and vomit. I pop a few mood-stabilizers. I'm only supposed to take one, but I need the other two to replace the missing anxiety meds. That's how medication works, right? It makes me feel blissfully mellow. Something in me supposes I should pick up the glass from the floor too. Instead, I pass out on the couch, shoes and all. I don't take my anti-nightmare pills.  
厨房里还残留着干涸的咖啡渍和呕吐物。我吞了几颗情绪稳定剂。其实只该吃一颗，但我需要另外两颗来替代失踪的抗焦虑药。药物不就是这样起作用的吗？这让我感到无比宁静。内心有个声音认为我也该把地上的玻璃杯捡起来。然而，我直接穿着鞋在沙发上昏睡过去。我没有服用防止噩梦的药。

I don't deserve that reprieve tonight.  
今晚我不配得到那样的解脱。

**Author's Notes:** Apparently, CIA employees aren't referred to as Agents, but Officers. I think the only employees at the CIA referred to as Agents are the Special Agents that operate in their Internal Affairs equivalent. _The more you know_.  
作者笔记：显然，中央情报局（CIA）的员工不被称为特工，而是官员。我认为在 CIA 中唯一被称为特工的是那些在内部事务部门工作的特别特工。知识就是力量。

**EDIT:** Forgot to mention. The use of the term Jerry is taken from _The Creative Principle_ and the Japanese Refugee and Resettlement Initiative. JRRI for short, spawning the nickname "Jerry". I'm also aware that this term, funnily enough, is shared with the WWII slang for German soldiers.  
编辑：忘了提及。“Jerry”一词源自《创造性原则与日本难民及安置倡议》，简称 JRRI，由此衍生出昵称“Jerry”。有趣的是，我也知道这个词汇在二战俚语中同样指代德国士兵。

 ### Interlude VII

One day my mother sat me down on the couch, something anxious in her posture. I think I was thirteen. I ran through the week's events for anything I might have done to upset her, and prepared myself for the inevitable firestorm.  
有一天，母亲让我坐在沙发上，她的姿势中透着一丝焦虑。我想我当时十三岁。我回想着一周内发生的事情，试图找出可能惹她生气的原因，并准备迎接即将到来的风暴。

She sits an arm's length away, pursing her lips a moment. "Kazuya, we're going to talk about sex."  
她坐在离我一臂之遥的地方，抿了抿嘴唇。“和也，我们要谈谈性。”

I stand to leave, stopped by the snap of her fingers. She points down. _Sit_. I've experienced her temper – pushed it to the breaking point enough to know when to back down.  
我起身想离开，却被她弹指制止。她指了指下面。坐下。我见识过她的脾气——曾将其逼至崩溃边缘，所以知道何时该退让。

She readjusts herself, hands folding in her lap. "What do you know?"  
她重新调整坐姿，双手叠放在膝上。“你知道些什么？”

"I don't want to talk about this, mom."  
“我不想谈这个，妈妈。”

"Too bad." “那可真糟糕。”

I glare at her. "Not doing it."  
我瞪着她。“不做。”

"I can make this _very_ unpleasant," she says, voice low and controlled. Dangerous. I probably should've been thankful she hadn't exploded yet. I think it was simply the subject matter that saved me. Attitude was not well received. Ever.  
“我可以让你很难堪，”她低声说，语气控制得很好，危险。我本该庆幸她还没爆发。我想是话题内容救了我。态度不受欢迎，从未。

So I shut up and she began the most embarrassing – and easily the most uncomfortable – afternoon talk of my life. I always thought this was something an adolescent boy was supposed to hear about from their father. But he wasn't there.  
所以我闭嘴了，她开始了最尴尬——也无疑是最不舒服——的下午谈话。我一直以为这是青春期男孩该从父亲那里听到的。但他不在。

Again. 再一次。

It had stopped being such a surprise at this point in my life, though left its wounds all the same. Each time, I grew to resent him a little more. It reinforced my belief that he never really cared about me. He couldn't be bothered to sit down with his son, talk with him about being a man.  
到了我生命中的这个阶段，这已不再那么令人惊讶，尽管留下的伤痕依旧。每一次，我对他的怨恨都加深了一点。这强化了我对他的看法，他从未真正关心过我。他连坐下来和儿子谈谈如何成为一个男人都懒得。

I wasn't worth the effort.  
我不值得他费心。

From my mother, the Metaphysics Professor, it was detached, clinical and involved very precise wording, like I was in one of her classes. She explained to me, with _unwanted specificity_, how erections happen, why they're normal and that masturbation is also normal, after which she then threatened to beat me senseless if she ever caught me in the act. That was the mother I was more familiar with. The one who was crass and overbearing.  
从我母亲，那位形而上学教授那里，我得到的解释是冷漠、临床式的，用词精确得像在她的课堂上。她以不必要的详细程度向我解释了勃起的原因、为何它们是正常的，以及自慰也是正常的，随后又威胁说如果她抓到我这么做，就会把我打得失去知觉。那是我更熟悉的母亲形象。粗鲁且专横。

By that point, I just had my face buried in my hands – wishing for some freak accident to kill me, like a falling airplane or an earthquake. She went on to inform me about condoms and why I shouldn't even be having sex until I was at least eighteen.  
那时，我只能双手捂脸——祈祷有什么怪异的事故能让我一了百了，比如飞机坠落或地震。她继续告诉我关于避孕套的事，以及为什么我至少要等到十八岁才能有性行为。

For the first time in seven years, I prayed to God again just to ask him to make her stop. I wasn't answered for another hour.  
七年来第一次，我又向神祈祷，只求他让她停下来。结果又过了一个小时，我才得到回应。

As awkward as it was, for both of us – she kept looking away and losing her train of thought – I think she found my discomfort more than a little funny. In that knowing kind of way where parents get a kick out of torturing their children through embarrassment.  
尽管这很尴尬，对我们俩都是——她不停地移开视线，思路也断了——我觉得她觉得我的窘迫相当有趣。那种父母通过让孩子难堪来取乐的熟悉方式。

It didn't really prepare me for how to deal with women. Some things are intuitive, other things that should have been taught man to man just weren't there. I didn't have an older brother like Hachiro to boast about their exploits in great detail. My father definitely wasn't there to guide me through the minefield either. All the examples I had of male and female interaction were inherently broken, bitter and petty. There were some tender moments. They were rare, but they were heartfelt on a level I could only wonder at.  
这并没有真正教会我如何与女性相处。有些事情是直觉性的，而另一些本应由男人之间传授的东西却缺失了。我没有像八郎那样有哥哥可以详细炫耀他们的经历。我的父亲当然也没有在那里引导我穿越这片雷区。我所见到的男女互动的例子本质上都是破碎的、苦涩的、琐碎的。也有一些温柔的时刻。它们很罕见，但在我看来却是发自内心的真诚。

One night, as the moonlight pooled through the house in soft blue rays, I stirred. The air was thin and chilled as I came from downstairs. It was after one of mother's nightmares, I think. I spied them down the hall on the floor, father's back against the wall while she was nestled against him, gathered in his arms. She'd calmed down some when she decided to speak.  
一天晚上，月光透过房屋洒下柔和的蓝色光芒，我醒了。我从楼下上来时，空气稀薄而寒冷。我想那是在母亲经历了一场噩梦之后。我看到他们在走廊的地板上，父亲背靠墙，而她依偎在他怀里，被他紧紧抱住。她稍微平静了一些，决定开口说话。

"Tell me some things you like about me," she says, quietly. For a moment, I see that hardened facade fall and I see the warmth in their closeness, how easy and wanted it is. On this night, she is weak and she needs him. For just a moment, she needs validation – only from him.  
“告诉我你喜欢我什么，”她轻声说。那一刻，我看到那坚硬的外表消失了，我看到了他们之间的温暖，那是多么自然和被渴望的。在这个夜晚，她很脆弱，她需要他。只是片刻，她需要他的肯定——只来自他。

Only ever from him. 只来自他一人。

He says he doesn't think her scars are ugly. He says he thinks she's pretty and smart. "And you're strong," he whispers, "even when you don't want to be. You're always so strong."  
他说他不觉得她的伤疤丑陋。他说她既漂亮又聪明。“而且你很坚强，”他低声说，“即使你不想坚强的时候也是如此。你总是那么坚强。”

My parents were hard people, jaded. At times I wondered if they even loved each other. I so rarely saw that side of them and mother only allowed herself to be that way with him. I was jealous of that. Not because she didn't treat me with affection or kindness, but because I never saw her without the walls like he did.  
我的父母是严厉的人，心灰意冷。有时我会怀疑他们是否真的相爱。我很少见到他们那一面，母亲只在父亲面前才会那样。我对此感到嫉妒。不是因为她对我缺乏爱意或温柔，而是因为我从未像他那样见过她卸下心防的样子。

There was only one time I ever asked my father about girls.  
我唯一一次问父亲关于女孩的事，是在某个时刻。

"What do you do when you like a girl?"  
“当你喜欢一个女孩时，你会怎么做？”

He paused. "Ask her if she likes you back, I suppose."  
他顿了顿。“我想，问问她是否也喜欢你吧。”

His gaze lingered on me, contemplating talking further. I left the room before he had the chance. I didn't want to talk to him more than I had to.  
他的目光在我身上徘徊，似乎在考虑是否继续交谈。我趁他还没开口，便离开了房间。我并不想与他多说一句话。

It was straight forward, but not what I needed. I was laughed at the next day and told that I was "weird".  
这很简单直接，但并非我所需要的。第二天我被嘲笑，被告知我"很奇怪"。

A year later, I was fourteen and Summer was around the corner. Before I fell out of control and slipped into the deep canyon that formed from a crumbling relationship with my parents, the Aida's had come to visit and one of them was going to stay for a little while.  
一年后，我十四岁，夏天即将来临。在我失控坠入因与父母关系破裂而形成的深渊之前，艾达一家来访了，其中一位将暂时留下来。

Yuki Aida was my first _real_ love. I first met her when I was four and she was only a year older than me. We still lived in Panama then and Kensuke was stationed at the base in Jacksonville for a couple of years. Playdates would often be arranged before then Petty Officer Third Class Aida was deployed overseas on his newly assigned ship, the USS _Dwight D. Eisenhower_. They'd been up at the Kitsap Navy Base for the past year or so when our parents agreed Yuki would stay with us while her dad was sent off to a war zone.  
相田由纪是我真正的初恋。我第一次遇见她时，我四岁，而她只比我大一岁。那时我们还住在巴拿马，健介被派驻在杰克逊维尔基地几年。在三等军士长相田被派往新分配的艾森豪威尔号航母执行海外任务之前，我们经常安排一起玩耍的时间。他们在基萨普海军基地已经待了一年左右，当我们的父母同意由纪在她父亲被派往战区时和我们住在一起。

When I asked her where, she smiled and said, "It's a secret. You're not in the military, so I can't tell you."  
当我问她去哪儿时，她微笑着说：“这是个秘密。你不在军队里，所以我不能告诉你。”

She got postcards from him almost every week. It became the brightest part of my day, watching her run into the house with our mail, giddy grin on her face. The soldiers in uniform hadn't knocked on our door that morning, either. Everything was still right with her world.  
她几乎每周都会收到他的明信片。看着她带着邮件跑进屋子，脸上洋溢着兴奋的笑容，成了我一天中最明亮的时刻。那天早上，也没有穿制服的士兵敲响我们的门。她的世界依然一切安好。

Even though she said it was secret, Yuki was too proud of her dad not to share them with me. He was out by the Philippines, a place of emerald mountains and teal waters. It was just a postcard, so we didn't see the burning jungles or sinking ships like he did.  
尽管她说这是秘密，但由纪对父亲的自豪感让她忍不住与我分享。他身处菲律宾，那里有翡翠般的山峦和碧绿的海水。这只是一张明信片，所以我们看不到他经历的燃烧的丛林或沉没的船只。

Yuki was a puzzle to me. Not like the other girls at school, who were almost alien in thinking and might ostracize me if I didn't understand their unspoken language. She was a rip tide of emotion that could flip to tranquil waters in the blink of an eye. It was exciting, how freely she expressed herself. No false looks, scared eyes, or pained grimaces like my parents.  
由纪对我来说是个谜。不像学校里的其他女孩，她们的思维几乎像外星人一样，如果我不懂她们无声的语言，可能会被排斥。她是一股情感的激流，能在眨眼间转变为平静的水面。她自由表达自己的方式令人兴奋。没有虚假的表情，没有恐惧的眼神，也没有痛苦的扭曲，就像我的父母那样。

Yuki was only ever Yuki. With her, I didn't have to be so grown up all the time. I could just be me, too. She was a connection to the world I'd lost a long time ago. I had it back and I didn't ever want to let go.  
由纪始终只是由纪。和她在一起，我不必总是那么成熟。我也可以只是我自己。她是我很久以前失去的那个世界的联系。我找回了它，而且我再也不想放手。

Even so, there was always something hidden behind her smile. I always wondered. She could've stayed at Kitsap, could have been with other military kids. People who more readily understood her and accepted her without question. So why decide to stay in a house with dysfunctional adults and a socially awkward boy?  
即便如此，她的笑容背后总隐藏着些什么。我总是好奇。她本可以留在基萨普，和那些军人的孩子在一起。那些人更能理解她，无条件地接纳她。那么，为何她会选择留在一群功能失调的成年人中间，和一个社交尴尬的男孩同住一个屋檐下呢？

The answer came much later. For the moment it wasn't important. A curtain had been drawn to let the light in. The sun was bright and new, the sky spirited and vibrant. Yuki was a spark of life in a world darkened by war and loss.  
答案在很久以后才揭晓。眼下这并不重要。一幕帘子已被拉开，让光明照进。阳光明媚而新鲜，天空充满活力与生机。在战争与失落笼罩的世界里，由纪是一束生命的火花。

If I wanted to stay inside, she'd come and drag me out of my room. Usually at dawn, far too early for anything human to be up. When I slurred something along those lines and curled into a ball, she threw the covers off, exclaiming, "A warrior's spirit always rises with the sun!"  
如果我想待在室内，她会来把我从房间里拽出去。通常是在黎明时分，对于人类来说起床还太早。当我嘟囔着类似的话并蜷缩成一团时，她会掀开被子，大声宣布：“战士的灵魂总是随着太阳升起！”

On those sweltering days we'd take long misshapen sticks and pretend we were Samurai. I made her knuckles bleed once and instead of crying, she baseball swung me in the side. Ribs blasting with pain, I fell to my knees, but couldn't stop laughing. That's kind of how we got even at times, odd as it may seem. If you hurt somebody, you got hurt back. It just made sense.  
在那些酷热的日子里，我们会拿起形状怪异的长棍，假装自己是武士。有一次我把她的手打得流血，她没有哭，反而像打棒球一样给了我一击。肋骨剧痛让我跪倒在地，却忍不住大笑。这就是我们有时如何扯平的方式，虽然听起来有点奇怪。如果你伤害了别人，就会受到同样的伤害。这很合理。

Other days we'd take the buses to Saguaro and explore the dry, cacti riddled hills and search for Groundsnakes. They were small and elusive, the hunt made all the more challenging due to the many venomous rattlers hidden beneath shrubs or stones. We scored points based on the color of the snake we found, red-orange earning the most.  
其他日子里，我们会乘公交车去仙人掌国家公园，探索那些干旱、布满仙人掌的小山，寻找地蛇。它们体型小且难以捉摸，由于许多有毒的响尾蛇隐藏在灌木或石头下，使得狩猎更具挑战性。我们根据找到的蛇的颜色得分，红橙色得分最高。

Mother was, more often than not, nervous. Not about the snakes – we didn't tell her about that. She would've had a heart attack a lot sooner if she ever knew. What worried her was that she had two teenagers she couldn't keep tabs on because of her work, and Dad kept to himself – while Misato occasionally drove us out to the bar she worked at for a bite to eat. Most of the time we were left to our own devices. That got her antsy, even though we'd already had _The Talk_.  
母亲多半时候都很紧张。不是因为蛇——我们没告诉她这些。如果她知道，心脏病可能会提前发作。她担心的是，她有两个青少年因为工作无法时刻关注，而爸爸总是独来独往——虽然美里偶尔会开车带我们去她工作的酒吧吃点东西。大多数时候，我们都是自生自灭。这让她焦虑不安，尽管我们已经进行过那次谈话。

Nearly every night mother would ask me what we did, bordering an interrogation. My dad would shoot her a look and shake his head, warning her off the subject. Whatever quiet conversations they had about us in their room, they both seemed to be glad I had made a friend in someone.  
几乎每个晚上，母亲都会问我白天做了什么，近乎审问。父亲会给她一个眼神，摇摇头，警告她别再追问。无论他们在房间里对我们的事有过怎样的私下讨论，他们似乎都为我交到一个朋友而感到高兴。

Gradually, it became something more than that. Yuki wasn't particularly busty or shapely, but she was pretty and she was a girl living in my house. That's all that was needed for an attraction to build. I'd never really thought of her in much of a sexual way before. Sure, I'd seen her in a bikini when we went for a swim, but she was, first and foremost, my friend.  
渐渐地，这种关系变得不同寻常。由纪并不特别丰满或曲线玲珑，但她漂亮，而且是个住在我家的女孩。仅此一点就足以产生吸引力。我以前从未真正以性感的眼光看待过她。当然，我们去游泳时我见过她穿比基尼的样子，但她首先是我朋友。

It was something I was slow to awaken to. All in one night someone shined a light on it and I couldn't ignore that whispering other anymore.  
这是我慢慢才意识到的。就在一夜之间，有人点亮了这盏灯，我再也无法忽视那低语的另一面了。

Yuki liked to wear her dad's shirts to bed. The long-sleeved button up kind that were too baggy on a fifteen year old girl. She came to hang out in my room and watch TV, like we usually did. She'd forgotten, or purposely left undone, the top buttons and I caught the curve of pale flesh. I told her I could see her breasts, to which she shrugged and said, "You're my friend. I don't care if you see me naked."  
由纪喜欢穿着她爸爸的衬衫睡觉，那种长袖的、扣子很多的款式，对于一个十五岁的女孩来说过于宽松了。她像往常一样来到我的房间看电视。她忘了，或者说故意没扣上最上面的几颗扣子，我瞥见了她苍白的肌肤曲线。我告诉她我能看到她的胸部，她耸耸肩说：“你是我的朋友。我不介意你看到我裸体。”

"Prove it." “证明给我看。”

She shrugged again and stood, unbuttoning the rest and tossing the shirt aside, hands sitting on her hips. "See?"  
她又耸了耸肩，站起身来，解开剩下的扣子，把衬衫扔到一边，双手叉腰。“看到了吗？”

I saw it all. Something stirred in me, blood rushing with warmth. Yuki stepped closer to where I sat on the bed, expression cloudy.  
我目睹了一切。某种情感在我心中涌动，热血带着温暖奔涌。Yuki 向我坐着的床边靠近，表情阴沉。

"What?" she asked and without quite understanding the intent behind them, my hands moved to touch her hips, slow and uncertain. She bit her lower lip, but didn't protest. My fingers glided up and she gasped, soon pressing herself against me on the bed.  
“什么？”她问道，而我并未完全理解自己的意图，双手缓缓且不确定地触碰她的腰际。她咬了咬下唇，但没有抗议。我的手指滑上去，她倒吸一口气，很快便紧贴着我躺在床上。

Our exploration was fumbling, sloppy, nervous. We got the hang of it a bit. We kissed, fooled around a little. We didn't have sex. That was something still far too nebulous and foreign to pursue.  
我们的探索笨拙、凌乱、紧张。渐渐地，我们掌握了一些技巧。我们亲吻，嬉戏了一会儿。我们没有发生关系。那件事依然太过模糊和陌生，难以追求。

As the next morning came, we wordlessly climbed out of bed, took our separate showers, trying to figure out how to look at each other now. We went on exploring the mountains of Arizona, a barrier between us. Everything was different. She didn't sit quite so close to me on the couch, or sleep in my room and keep me up all night talking about the stars.  
随着次日清晨的到来，我们默默地起床，各自洗了澡，试图弄清楚现在该如何面对彼此。我们继续探索亚利桑那的山脉，那成了我们之间的隔阂。一切都变了。她不再像以前那样紧挨着我坐在沙发上，也不再睡在我的房间里，整夜和我聊星星，让我无法入眠。

Two weeks passed by before Yuki told me she was going back up to Kitsap. Summer had come to an end and the conflicts in the east kept _Eisenhower_ at foreign ports. I was... heartbroken.  
两周过去了，Yuki 才告诉我她要回基萨普。夏天已经结束，东部的冲突使得艾森豪威尔停留在国外港口。我……心碎了。

I always assumed she'd be staying until her dad got back. So I asked her again why she stayed here, instead of at Kitsap.  
我一直以为她会等到她爸爸回来。所以我再次问她为什么留在这里，而不是在基萨普。

We were sitting outside and she curled her knees to her chest, trying to make herself small, the real Yuki hidden behind those ochre eyes. "Me and my dad– we move around a lot. I begged him to let me stay here instead of Kitsap. Sure, there are lots of other kids like me on the bases, but they're always gone after a few months. I got so sick of watching everyone leave."  
我们坐在外面，她把膝盖蜷缩到胸前，试图让自己显得渺小，真正的由纪隐藏在那双赭色眼眸之后。“我和我爸——我们经常搬家。我求他让我留在这里，而不是去基萨普。当然，基地里有很多像我这样的孩子，但他们总是几个月后就离开了。我厌倦了看着每个人离开。”

All she could do was stand by and watch as friends came and went, connections slipping completely out of her control. Nothing she could do to stop it all. Yuki wanted to say goodbye, but on her terms. I was the ideal choice – lots of civilians go their entire lives living in the place they grew up, not like military kids, where home is whatever base their parents happen to be stationed at that year.  
她只能站在一旁，眼睁睁看着朋友们来来去去，联系完全脱离了她的掌控。她无能为力去阻止这一切。由纪想要体面地告别，但得按她的方式。我是理想的选择——许多平民一生都生活在他们长大的地方，不像我们这些军人的孩子，家就是父母当年驻扎的基地。

I knew she'd have to leave eventually, go wherever the Navy decided her dad was needed most. This was all too sudden.  
我知道她迟早得离开，去海军决定她爸爸最需要去的地方。这一切来得太突然了。

We were young and didn't know what to do with this newfound spectrum of emotion. For Yuki, she had let us get too close and just the idea of me leaving her one day, however unlikely, was something she couldn't face. Even if it was just in the sense of friends being too far to maintain contact anymore. Her mother never wrote or called, why would I? Compartmentalizing and cutting off was the only way she knew how to handle it. She'd been trying to escape from the military and its nomadic ways. Yet when she finally got close to someone, it scared her and she fell right back into it.  
我们那时还年轻，不知如何应对这突如其来的情感光谱。对于由纪来说，她让我们走得太近，光是想到有一天我会离开她，无论可能性多小，都是她无法面对的。即便只是朋友间的距离远到无法再保持联系。她母亲从未写信或打电话，我又为何会呢？分门别类并切断联系是她唯一知道的处理方式。她一直在试图逃离军旅生活及其漂泊不定的方式。然而当她终于接近某个人时，这让她感到害怕，她又回到了原点。

None of it was quite so clear then.  
当时这一切并不那么清晰。

It was my first day back to school the morning she was supposed to leave. Some military family friendly with the Aida's were coming to take her up to Kitsap with them. It was dark out when I left – earlier than even she would be awake. I denied her that final goodbye, abandoning her the same way I felt abandoned.  
那是我返校的第一天，而她本该在那天离开。一些与 Aida 家交好的军人家庭会来接她去基萨普。我出门时天还黑着——比她醒来的时间还要早。我没有给她最后的告别，抛弃她如同我感到被抛弃一样。

_You hurt me, I hurt you.  
你伤害我，我伤害你。  
_  
That was the rule. 这是规则。

It was a rotten thing to do.  
这么做真是糟糕透顶。

I was still wounded for a time after, especially with how things ended between me and my parents. Yuki and I didn't really reconnect again until I was twenty. After that last Summer with her, I fell into a bitter cycle searching for closeness while keeping people emotionally at arm's length. The relationships I formed were shallow and doomed from the start. I'd find a pretty girl, we'd go on a couple of dates, get to fooling around in bed and over the next few weeks my insecurities would take hold. I'd get anxious, clingy, irritable. I drove so many of them away I got into the habit of cutting ties before much of a bond could form at all. I was in a stupor, riding on the high of being joined with someone for a night, before flitting off to the next.  
在那之后的一段时间里，我仍然感到受伤，尤其是我和父母之间的关系如何结束的。我和由纪直到我二十岁时才真正重新联系起来。在那最后一次与她共度的夏天之后，我陷入了一个痛苦的循环，一边寻求亲密关系，一边又把人们情感上拒之门外。我建立的关系从一开始就很肤浅且注定失败。我会找到一个漂亮的女孩，我们约会几次，开始在床上嬉戏，接下来的几周我的不安全感就会占据上风。我会变得焦虑、黏人、易怒。我赶走了太多人，以至于养成了在任何真正的联系形成之前就切断关系的习惯。我处于一种恍惚状态，享受着与某人共度一夜的快感，然后又匆匆转向下一个。

As I grew older, I realized just how lonely that was. I tried to form bonds, to keep connections – and I couldn't.  
随着年龄的增长，我意识到那是多么孤独。我试图建立纽带，保持联系——但我做不到。

It got to the point where any woman would do. I just didn't want to be alone anymore, even if I was with someone I didn't particularly love. Anything was better than being with myself.  
事情发展到任何女人都可以的地步。我只是不想再孤单一人，即使与我在一起的人并不是我特别爱的。任何事都比独自一人好。

### Chapter 8: December 3

Mother arrives in short order and I'm petrified.  
母亲很快就到了，我吓得魂不附体。

I'm not sure how my dad persuaded her to travel across the country on such short notice. She's been a slave to the lab in Mesa ever since we moved to Tucson. Whether by choice or by necessity, I can't say.  
我不确定父亲是如何说服她在如此短的时间内横跨全国的。自从我们搬到图森以来，她一直是梅萨实验室的奴隶。无论是出于选择还是必要，我说不上来。

Either way, the quivering bouts of dread are rolling over me in mountainous waves. I knew this would be happening for two days now, I shouldn't be this – _freaked out._ It becomes all too clear, dauntingly, that this was a very bad idea.  
无论如何，恐惧的颤抖像山一样一波波向我袭来。两天来我都知道这会发生，我不应该这么——吓坏了。事情变得非常清楚，令人胆寒，这是一个非常糟糕的主意。

I'm 27 and a pencil pusher at a job I don't care for. I don't have a house, I don't have a wife – I don't even have a girlfriend now. What I do have is a tiny studio apartment and a very nice car named Gypsy. I realize all I've done by bringing my mother up here is make her witness to how empty my life is and welcome her disappointment.  
我 27 岁，做着一份我不太在意的工作，整天与铅笔为伍。我没有房子，没有妻子——现在连女朋友都没有。我有的只是一个狭小的单身公寓和一辆非常棒的车，名叫吉普赛。我意识到，带我妈妈来这里，只是让她见证我生活的空虚，迎接她的失望。

A very bad idea indeed.  
确实是个非常糟糕的主意。

Foot traffic in and out of the airport is a bit of a nightmare due to the time of year. Everyone is traveling. Thankfully Terminal C, gate 35 isn't terribly crowded. Most people out West prefer to stay there instead of paying bloated plane ticket prices.  
由于季节的原因，机场的进出人流量简直是一场噩梦。大家都在旅行。幸运的是，C 航站楼 35 号登机口并不算太拥挤。西部的大多数人宁愿待在那里，也不愿支付高昂的机票价格。

She comes up the boarding ramp in a black overcoat that is both utilitarian and fashionable – and so very like her. Her hair's tied back messy again and the dark color of her winter wear doesn't make it look quite so dull in shade.  
她穿着一件既实用又时尚的黑大衣走上登机坡道——这非常像她。她的头发再次随意地扎在脑后，冬装深沉的颜色并没有让它的色调显得那么暗淡。

We hug, stiff and awkward like before.  
我们拥抱，僵硬而尴尬，一如往常。

I take a step back as we separate. How do you do this talking thing again? "I'm surprised you decided to come up."  
我们分开时，我后退了一步。再次交谈该怎么做呢？“我很惊讶你决定上来。”

She adjusts the carry on hanging from her shoulder. "Your father can be a real bully when he wants to be."  
她调整了一下挂在肩上的随身行李。“你父亲想要霸道起来，可是真能吓唬人。”

"So you had to be strong armed into flying here?" I ask, offering a smirk I don't feel.  
“所以你是被硬拽来这里的？”我问道，挤出一个并非发自内心的假笑。

Mother returns it. "I had to have a heart attack for you to see me."  
母亲回以微笑。“我得心脏病发作，你才肯来看我。”

That makes me flinch and my mouth argues a grimace. She might as well have slapped me again. "I... I was just..."  
"这让我不禁退缩，嘴角勉强扯出一个苦笑。她简直就像再次扇了我一巴掌。“我……我只是……””

Her shoulders sag a bit, both hands clutching the strap of her carry on. "I know," she says, lips pursed. The blare of a hundred voices and PA announcements descends over us, vulnerable eyes unsure of where to look.  
她的肩膀微微下垂，双手紧抓着行李箱的背带。“我知道，”她说，嘴唇紧抿。无数的嘈杂声和广播通知声在我们周围响起，那双脆弱的眼睛不知该看向何处。

"Well, let's get going, then."  
"“好吧，那我们走吧。””

We make a trip down to baggage claim and go to meet Gypsy. Riding up along the Potomac, I ask her how her flight was. We converse in a curt manner all the way, while my hands grip the steering wheel far too tight. She doesn't comment when we pull into my apartment complex and I find it difficult to keep from staring at her to gauge a reaction. How could I have let my father do this?  
我们一路下到行李认领处，去见 Gypsy。沿着波托马克河行驶时，我问她飞行如何。我们一路简短交谈，我的双手紧握方向盘。当我们将车开进我的公寓楼时，她并未发表评论，我发现自己难以不盯着她以揣测她的反应。我怎能让父亲这么做呢？

Up at room 303, I jam my key into the slot, realizing too late that it's already unlocked. I don't know what to do when I see Marina by our – my – bed, packing a suitcase full to bursting with clothes. Her eyes find me stuck in the door way.  
到了 303 房间，我急忙将钥匙插入槽中，却意识到为时已晚，门已解锁。当我看到 Marina 在我们的——我的——床边，正往一个塞得满满当当的行李箱里装衣服时，我不知所措。她的目光找到了卡在门口的我。

She nods, barely. "Hey." 她微微点头，几乎难以察觉。"嘿。"

"Hey." I shuffle my feet, glancing back to where my mother is waiting in the hall, missing her eyes. I turn back to Marina, trapped. Jumping out of the window across the way almost seems like a good idea.  
"嘿。" 我挪动着脚步，回头望向在走廊里等待的母亲，怀念她的目光。我转回身面对玛丽娜，感到被困住了。从对面窗户跳出去的主意几乎显得不错。

"Just came for my clothes," Marina says.  
"只是来拿我的衣服，" 玛丽娜说道。

I nod, rocking on my heels. "Right."  
我点头，脚后跟轻轻摇晃。" 对。"

"I'll get everything else later."  
“其他的我晚点再拿。”

"Sure." "当然。"

Marina grabs her key from the kitchen counter, suitcase zipped up and rolling at her heels. Her steps slow, pausing a moment, gaze on the floor. She's waiting for me to say something, to stop her. My arm twitches, maybe to reach out, mouth open. No words come and I keep my hand at my side. There's nothing I can say, nothing I really want to say that wouldn't be a lie. I can't lie to her anymore. I can't pretend.  
玛丽娜从厨房台面上抓起钥匙，行李箱拉好拉链，紧随其后。她的脚步放缓，停顿片刻，目光落在地板上。她在等我说些什么，阻止她。我的手臂微微颤动，或许想要伸出手，嘴巴张开。却无言以出，我保持手在身侧。我无话可说，也没有真正想说的话，那不会是真话。我不能再对她撒谎了。我不能再假装了。

As she sets off down the hall, I know I've only driven the knife deeper with my silence. Right now, I can't feel anything. I might as well be dead inside.  
当她沿着走廊离开时，我知道我的沉默只是让刀子插得更深。此刻，我什么也感觉不到。我内心或许早已如同死去。

"Everything alright?" mother asks.  
“一切都好吗？”妈妈问。

Plaster smile. "Not really, no." I lead her in, being the gentlemen she expects me to be and relieving her of her luggage. Everything is as clean as I could make it, even rented a steam vacuum to clear up the carpets. Couldn't quite get rid of the warped linoleum in the kitchen. Maintenance has been indisposed since I called a day ago.  
强装笑容。“不太好，真的。”我领她进去，表现得像个她期望的绅士，帮她拿行李。一切都被我打扫得一尘不染，甚至租了个蒸汽吸尘器来清理地毯。厨房的翘曲油毡地板却怎么也弄不好。自从我一天前打电话以来，维修人员就一直没空。

"Make yourself at home." “请随意，就像在自己家一样。”

Mother meanders in, hands clasped languidly in front of her, neutral eyes taking everything in. What little there is. She only nods when I tell her she's got the bed and I'll be sleeping on the couch. It sounds so stupid when I say it. Not even a proper apartment with more than one damn room. I wish she'd say something, maybe even offer a condescending remark, anything but that guarded, hesitant expression.  
母亲缓缓踱入，双手慵懒地交叉在身前，中性的眼神将一切尽收眼底。尽管所见甚少。当我告诉她床归她而我将睡在沙发上时，她只是点头。这话听来如此愚蠢。连个像样的公寓都没有，仅此一间房。我多希望她能说些什么，哪怕是句居高临下的评论，也好过那戒备而迟疑的表情。

Of all the days Marina could have shown up, it had to be today and without any kind of warning to boot. If I'd been caught in traffic just a few minutes later, I wouldn't have even had to see her. I guess hoping this weird little vacation would go even remotely smooth was just hoping for too much.  
玛丽娜偏偏选在今天出现，且毫无预警。若我晚几分钟堵在路上，甚至不必与她碰面。看来，指望这趟古怪的小假期哪怕稍显顺利，终究是奢望过高了。

I step past her into the kitchen. "Coffee?"  
我越过她走进厨房。“要咖啡吗？”

"Cream and sugar, please." she moves to sit at the 'dining' table. I fix up a brew with the new coffee pot I bought yesterday. There's a french press in the cupboard collecting dust. Laziness tends to outweigh my desire for flavor. I wouldn't have the patience for it today anyway.  
“请加奶油和糖。”她走向‘用餐’桌坐下。我用昨天新买的咖啡壶煮了一壶。橱柜里有个法式压滤壶积满了灰尘。懒惰往往胜过我对风味的追求。今天我也没那个耐心用它。

"Was that Marina?" mother asks, a softness to her tone.  
“那是玛丽娜吗？”母亲问道，语气柔和。

I force down the condescending reply on the tip of my tongue. After a minute I settle for a simple, "Yes."  
我强压下舌尖上的轻蔑回答。过了一会儿，我简单地答道：“是的。”

The coffee maker cracks and sputters for a while as we fiddle with our phones. Anything is better than just staring at a wall and not talking. I set her warm mug on the table, retreating back to the kitchen to pour my own.  
咖啡机噼啪作响了一阵，我们各自摆弄着手机。总比只是盯着墙不说话要好。我把她那杯温热的咖啡放在桌上，退回厨房给自己倒了一杯。

After a few sips, she asks, "So, where are we going?"  
喝了几口后，她问道：“那么，我们去哪儿？”

I lean against the bartop, too nervous to sit anywhere in my own apartment. "Well, it's your first time in D.C. right? Thought we could stroll down National Mall today. Take a look at the Washington Monument."  
我靠在吧台上，紧张得在自己家里也坐不住。“呃，你第一次来华盛顿吧？我想我们可以去国家广场走走，看看华盛顿纪念碑。”

She smirks. "A giant block of stone. How fun."  
她轻蔑地笑了笑。“一块巨大的石头。多有趣啊。”

I grunt, turning back to the coffee pot. Has it always been this hard to joke with each other?  
我咕哝一声，转回咖啡壶那边。我们之间的玩笑话，难道一直这么难说出口吗？

I take up a spot on the other side of the table, still standing. Thankfully mother doesn't ask anything more about Marina and tactfully comments that my apartment complex is "nice". The coffee goes cold before we finish and she isn't hungry yet, so it's as good a time as any to head out.  
我在桌子的另一边站定。幸好母亲没有再追问玛丽娜的事，而是巧妙地称赞我的公寓楼“不错”。咖啡在我们喝完之前就凉了，而她还不饿，所以现在正是出门的好时机。

I'm waiting by the door, tugging my overcoat straight. It's been longer than a minute when I realize she's rooted in the kitchen, staring at something on the counter – next to the sink where I keep my pills. Dammit, I forgot to the put them away.  
我站在门口，拉直我的大衣。时间已经过去不止一分钟，我才意识到她僵立在厨房里，盯着台面上某样东西——就在我放药的洗碗池旁边。该死，我忘了把它们收起来了。

"Mom?" “妈？”

My voice shakes her and she comes back to herself, stepping out of the kitchen, smile-too-big-to-be-real and all. "Yes, let's go."  
我的声音让她回过神来，她走出厨房，笑容大得过于不真实。“好，我们走吧。”

The drive is short and parking is easy enough to find. We enter down Pennsylvania Ave, a wide corridor of hotels and corporate offices. The monument comes into view right away, a pillar of white spearing up into a pale blue sky, reigning supreme over an open land of withered trees and thick snows. It's not as bad as last year, when the snowfall came up to my knees.  
车程很短，停车也不难找。我们沿着宾夕法尼亚大道进入，这是一条宽阔的走廊，两旁是酒店和办公楼。纪念碑立刻映入眼帘，一根白色的柱子直插苍白的蓝天，在枯树和厚雪覆盖的开阔地上独占鳌头。这比去年好多了，那时积雪深及我的膝盖。

"We never used to get snow," mother says as we trudge through to a clear path, "not unless you lived way up by the northern cap. It was always summer."  
“我们以前从不怎么下雪，”妈妈一边艰难地走向一条清晰的小径，一边说，“除非你住在北边的帽状地区。那里总是夏天。”

"I remember. Dad told me sometimes the soles of his shoes would melt on the asphalt." I've always tried to picture what a world without seasons might be like. I kind of lived in one for a while. Sometimes it got cold in Florida, but it was essentially always summer, even before and after Impacts. On the hotter days, the cicadas would scream and dad would shake his head, sighing. "It's going to rain tomorrow."  
“我记得。爸爸告诉我，有时候他的鞋底会在柏油路上融化。”我一直在努力想象一个没有季节的世界会是什么样子。我在某种程度上经历过一段时间。佛罗里达有时会变冷，但基本上总是夏天，甚至在撞击事件前后也是如此。在更热的那些日子里，蝉会尖叫，爸爸会摇摇头，叹息道：“明天会下雨。”

And so it would. 于是它便如此。

I've lived in D.C. for almost seven years now and I've never actually seen the national monument up close. It's hard to appreciate just how big the obelisk is until you're right up next to it. I crane my neck to look and instead of stone, I see a giant armored foot followed by a leg and a body. How big were they really?  
我在华盛顿特区已经住了将近七年，却从未真正近距离看过国家纪念碑。直到你站在它旁边，才能真正体会到这座方尖碑有多么巨大。我仰起头想看清楚，却看到一只巨大的装甲脚，接着是腿和身体。他们究竟有多大呢？

Mother's brought a camera and there's a brief flash as she snaps a picture of the obelisk.  
母亲带了一台相机，她对着方尖碑按下快门，闪光灯一闪而过。

"What was he like?" I ask, trying to dispel thoughts of the shadow.  
"他是什么样的人？" 我问道，试图驱散那阴影的念头。

Her face quirks. "What?" 她的表情有些古怪。"什么？"

"Dad. Before..." I hesitate, chewing on my tongue, and deciding to follow one of the sidewalks arcing beyond the open courtyard. "You knew him when you were kids, right?"  
"爸爸。在那之前..." 我犹豫了一下，咬着舌头，决定沿着一条弧形的人行道走，这条人行道延伸到开阔的庭院之外。"你小时候就认识他，对吧？"

She nods, snapping another picture as we pass. "When we were teenagers. He was quiet, shy..." she locks her eyes to mine, toying with a smile. "Distant."  
她点点头，又在我们经过时拍了一张照片。“当我们还是青少年时。他很安静，害羞……”她目光锁定我，玩味地微笑。“疏远。”

I don't deign to offer a response. We walk by the motionless sentinel soldiers of the Korean War, cloaked in snow. The Lincoln Memorial lords over the strip, the reflecting pool empty for refurbishing.  
我不屑于回应。我们走过静止不动的朝鲜战争士兵雕像，它们被雪覆盖。林肯纪念堂俯瞰着这片区域，倒影池因翻新而空无一物。

"It may sound silly, but your father is... infuriatingly Japanese."  
“这可能听起来很傻，但你的父亲……令人恼火地日本化。”

I stop, brow creased. "What do you mean?"  
我停下脚步，眉头紧皱。“你这是什么意思？”

"He doesn't want to burden anyone," she says, nodding for me to keep walking. "Unloading that weight onto somebody else would be inconvenient and selfish. To him, at least."  
“他不想给任何人添麻烦，”她点头示意我继续走。“把那份重担卸给别人，对他来说，至少是麻烦且自私的。”

"He burdens you," I say, quiet enough to at least not sound bitter.  
“他让你承受了重担，”我轻声说道，至少听起来不那么苦涩。

"It's different with us."  
"我们之间不一样。"

"It always is." "向来如此。"

Walking side-by-side, we settle into the dull roar of traffic and distant voices. Around us are memorials for a handful of wars, crafted with emotion and heartfelt care. The walkway starts to dip, gradually, and a black surface creeps up out of the ground, holding inscriptions marked in white. I read some of the names, considering how I would feel if my father's name was on the wall with the others. Would I miss him if I never met him? Never got the chance to know him? I grew up with the man and I still don't understand him. Would I have cherished the picture of the Tokyo-3 towers instead of hate it?  
我们并肩而行，融入车流的沉闷轰鸣与远处的嘈杂人声。四周是几场战争的纪念碑，饱含情感与真挚关怀地雕琢而成。步道开始缓缓下沉，地面渐渐浮现出一片黑色，上面刻着白色的铭文。我读着其中一些名字，想象如果我父亲的姓名也刻在这墙上，我会作何感想。如果我从未遇见他，从未有机会了解他，我会想念他吗？我与这个男人共同长大，却仍无法理解他。我会珍惜那张第三新东京市塔楼的照片，而非憎恨它吗？

The polished black slabs are higher than I remember. They're too tall in fact, making it seem like we're in a deep pit.  
那些打磨过的黑色石板比我记忆中的要高。实际上，它们太高了，以至于我们仿佛置身于一个深坑之中。

"Do you think they should have a memorial for Tokyo-three?" the question sounds vague when I say it out loud. I don't know if anyone else in the world has ever commissioned a memorial for it. I guess by 'they' I mean America.  
“你觉得他们应该为第三东京市建一个纪念碑吗？”这个问题当我大声说出来时显得很模糊。我不知道世界上是否还有人曾为它建造过纪念碑。我想，‘他们’指的是美国。

We've stopped where the obsidian walls meet at a point. Mother shrugs, mustering a wry face. "No one wants to remember. Not really."  
我们停在黑曜石墙交汇的顶点处。母亲耸了耸肩，摆出一副苦笑的表情。“没有人真的想记住。”

"That's not what I asked."  
“那不是我问的。”

"It doesn't matter." she shakes her head, taking a picture of the long walls and catching other visitors in the lens. "That part of my life is gone."  
“这无关紧要。”她摇摇头，拍下长长的墙壁，镜头中捕捉到其他游客的身影。“那段生活已经结束了。”

I don't know what to say to that. Has she always felt this way about it? Has she always been so determined to forget Third Impact and the Evas? I know that the family pictures we used to take were to bury those things. To phase them out of memory completely. Just like Tokyo-3. Nothing left but a gaping black hole in the ground.  
我不知道该说什么。她一直这样看待吗？她一直如此坚决要忘记第三次冲击和 EVA 吗？我知道我们过去拍的家庭照片是为了埋葬那些记忆，彻底将它们从记忆中抹去。就像第三新东京市一样，除了地面上的一个巨大黑洞，什么也没留下。

I catch our reflection in the obsidian stone. It doesn't capture her age quite so thoroughly as a mirror might and I see a vision of a younger woman. She speaks to me and for a second I'm convinced I'm just going crazy.  
我在黑曜石上捕捉到我们的倒影。它没有镜子那样彻底地捕捉她的年龄，我看到的是一个年轻女子的影像。她对我说话，有那么一瞬，我确信自己只是疯了。

"I... I haven't been a very good mother, have I?" she asks, eyes settled on a bouquet of flowers at the base of a slab. Her voice isn't small or weak like it was in the hospital, in fact it's hardly a question. To me it sounds more like an admission, a realization she's resigned herself to. Maybe that's only partly true. There is a bit of uncertainty, a shiver in the back of her throat. She's waiting for an answer, like Marina was – and I don't have any words.  
“我……我不是一个好母亲，对吧？”她问道，目光落在一块石碑底部的花束上。她的声音不像在医院时那样小或虚弱，实际上这几乎不像个问题。对我来说，这听起来更像是一种承认，一种她已经接受的认识。也许这只是部分真实。她的声音中带着一丝不确定，喉咙后部微微颤抖。她在等待一个答案，就像玛丽娜那样——而我无言以对。

I've wanted to hate her for a long time now. I told her once what I thought of her as a mother, never suspecting she believed it.  
长久以来，我一直想恨她。我曾告诉她，我认为她作为母亲是什么样的人，从未怀疑过她相信了这一点。

I can still see the broken look on her face when she found my pills. The smile she wore when we met again for the first time in eight years. I've hurt her again and all I can think about is how much I want to take back all the awful things I've said to her back home.  
我仍能清晰地看到她发现我药片时脸上的破碎表情。八年后我们再次相遇时她所戴的微笑。我又一次伤害了她，而我满脑子想的都是如何收回在家中对她说的那些伤人的话。

But I can't. 但我做不到。

My arm shifts, knuckles brushing hers. Something pushes against me, fills me with doubt. I manage to take her hand in mine, weaving my fingers with hers. She squeezes back, but doesn't look away from the black wall etched with thousands of names. So we stand in this artificial depression, dragged down beneath the snow, and all I can do is stand here. While my mother tries to open her heart to me, all I can do is stand here with her hand in mine, wishing somehow I knew what to say.  
我的手臂移动，指节轻触她的。某种力量推动着我，让我充满疑虑。我设法握住她的手，手指与她交缠。她回握了一下，却没有从那刻着成千上万个名字的黑色墙壁上移开视线。于是我们站在这人工营造的忧郁中，被雪压得喘不过气来，而我能做的只是站在这里。当母亲试图向我敞开心扉时，我能做的只是握着她的手站在这里，真希望自己知道该说些什么。

Is this what healing is?  
这就是所谓的治愈吗？

It doesn't feel like it.  
感觉并不像。

The cold is turning my lips brittle and dry. My tongue passes over them and I let go of her hand, reaching for the other.  
寒冷让我的嘴唇变得脆弱而干燥。我用舌头舔过它们，然后松开了她的手，伸向另一边。

"Why don't we take a picture together?" I ask and she doesn't resist when I grab her camera, too thrown to do anything but look bewildered. The moment of reluctance bleeds out until she manages a nod, cautious. I put an arm around her, stretching the other out to catch us both in the shot. We smile and there's a flash of light. A Vietnam wall slides along on my mother's right, the Washington Monument rising up behind us.  
“我们为什么不一起拍张照呢？”我问道，她没有抗拒，当我拿起她的相机时，她只是显得有些不知所措。那一丝犹豫渐渐消散，她终于勉强点了点头，带着几分谨慎。我伸出一只手臂搂住她，另一只手伸出去为我们俩拍照。我们微笑着，闪光灯一闪而过。越南战争纪念墙在我母亲右侧缓缓滑过，华盛顿纪念碑在我们身后耸立。

We walk around for a little longer and eventually agree it's time to get some food. I take her down the street to Harry's, a little pub I like to frequent – decent prices. As soon as we sit down at a table, basking in the glowing warmth of the low lighting, our moods just – lift. The bitter, cold ice formed over the river has been broken, letting the water flow unhindered. We joke and we talk with an ease I didn't think possible. Mother complains about the food, claiming she never has been and never will be a cheap date. I promise to take her out to a proper restaurant tomorrow.  
我们又逛了一会儿，最终一致认为该吃点东西了。我带她沿着街道来到 Harry's，一家我喜欢的小酒馆——价格公道。我们一坐下，沐浴在柔和的灯光下，心情便随之高涨。那条冰封的河流上的苦涩寒冰已被打破，让水流得以自由流淌。我们轻松地开着玩笑，交谈着，这种自在是我未曾预料到的。母亲抱怨食物，声称她从来不是，也永远不会是那种廉价的约会对象。我承诺明天带她去一家正经的餐厅。

Which reminds me. "Where do you want to go tomorrow?"  
这让我想起来了。“明天你想去哪儿？”

"Somewhere not quite so depressing."  
“某个不那么压抑的地方。”

I chuckle. "Sure." 我轻笑。“当然。”

Later that evening, back at the apartment, I make good on my promise to Misato. Stepping out into the hallway, I dial for Home. Dad's probably a bit on edge anyway. Always has made a habit of worrying over mom.  
那天晚上晚些时候，回到公寓，我兑现了对美里子的承诺。走出房间，我拨通了家的电话。爸爸可能也有点紧张。他总是习惯性地担心妈妈。

He answers halfway through the first ring.  
他在第一声铃响过半时接了电话。

"Hey, dad." “嘿，爸爸。”

"Kazuya," he says, hesitance failing to belie his surprise. "How's your mother?"  
“和也，”他说道，犹豫不决却难掩惊讶之情。“你妈妈怎么样了？”

"Fine, fine. We walked around the Washington Monument today, took some pictures." I pace a bit, clawing around for anything else to mention. That's pretty much the gist of it, There's really nothing else for us to talk about, is there?  
“好吧，好吧。我们今天绕着华盛顿纪念碑走了走，拍了几张照片。”我来回踱步，试图找些别的话题。大致就是这样了，我们真的没什么别的好聊了，对吧？

He must be thinking the same thing and asks, "Is she having a good time? Is she happy?"  
他一定也在想同样的事，问道：“她玩得开心吗？她快乐吗？”

I shrug. "I think so."  
我耸耸肩。“我想是的。”

"Are you two fighting?" "你们俩是在吵架吗？"

"No... no, nothing like that. I guess we're just... learning how to walk again."  
"不……不是那样的。我想我们只是在……重新学习如何相处。"

"You don't realize how close you are to her... how much she loves you," he says and I want to hang up on him. Who is he to tell me what I don't know? He doesn't even know _me_. I don't say anything, just lean against a wall and wait for him to continue. He has to know he's pushing it. "I've... well, we've been through a lot of rough patches, Kazuya. She's always been strong for it. That's just how she is. When it comes to you, though... she doesn't have any armor. Has a heart made of glass and it scares the hell out of her."  
"你不知道你和她有多亲近……她有多爱你，"他说着，我真想挂断电话。他凭什么告诉我我不知道的事？他根本就不了解我。我什么也没说，只是靠在墙上，等着他继续。他肯定知道自己在越界。"我……嗯，我们经历了很多坎坷，和也。她一直都很坚强。她就是这样的人。但对你来说……她没有任何防护。她的心就像玻璃一样脆弱，这让她害怕得要命。"

The idea of her, my Mother the Indomitable, being scared of something like that... it can't be true. It can't be real.  
她，我那不屈不挠的母亲，会害怕那样的事情……这不可能。这不可能是真的。

I know it is, though. I saw that glass heart only a week ago, in a hospital room where I nearly broke it. A part of me really wanted to. I just can't be that cold, not with her. She takes away my armor too – like she did today. How are we able to do that? How are we able to hurt each other so much and still be so close?  
但我知道这是真的。就在一周前，我在医院病房里看到了那颗玻璃心，差点把它打碎。我内心的一部分真的很想这么做。但我就是做不到那么冷酷，尤其是对她。她也夺走了我的盔甲——就像今天这样。我们怎么能做到这一点？我们怎么能如此深深地伤害对方，却依然如此亲密？

"We were flying out to meet the Third Pacific Fleet," dad says, jarring my brain stupid as it tries to play catch-up. It takes me a minute realize what he's talking about. I'd forgotten we were even on the phone. "It was transporting Unit-02 to New Yokosuka from Germany. We touched down on an aircraft carrier, uh... something Rainbow. I can't remember."  
“我们正飞去与第三太平洋舰队会面，”爸爸说，我的大脑笨拙地试图跟上节奏。我花了一会儿才意识到他在说什么。我甚至忘了我们还在通话。“它正从德国将二号机运往新横须贺。我们降落在了一艘航空母舰上，呃……什么彩虹。我记不清了。”

He pauses and I don't speak – if I do he might stop. Did I just hear him chuckle?  
他顿了顿，我没有说话——如果我开口，他可能会停下来。我刚才听到他轻笑了一声吗？

"She was wearing this yellow sundress. We were standing out on the flight deck and the wind picked up–" he starts laughing. My father. _Laughing_. "Damn near lifted it over her head. I swear your mom turned redder than her hair. Toji was right up in front of her too, full view. She slapped him around for his trouble."  
“她当时穿着那条黄色的太阳裙。我们站在飞行甲板上，风突然刮了起来——”他笑了起来。我的父亲。在笑。“差点把裙子掀到她头上。我发誓你妈妈脸红得比她的头发还红。东治就在她正前方，一览无余。她为了这事狠狠地扇了他一巴掌。”

Just the idea of her being happy, of getting to spend time with her son – It's making him laugh, making him smile. Making him joke. I can barely believe it. His mood swings used to get so bad, so unpredictable, I couldn't even acknowledge there was another side to his personality. Hearing it is... too many things to name. Where was this when I asked about it two days ago? Why couldn't he talk about it then? Why now?  
仅仅是想到她快乐的样子，能和她儿子共度时光——这让他笑了起来，让他露出了微笑。让他开玩笑。我几乎不敢相信。他的情绪波动曾经那么糟糕，那么不可预测，我甚至无法承认他的性格还有另一面。听到这些……有太多难以言表的感受。两天前我问起时，这些在哪里？为什么那时他不能谈论这些？为什么是现在？

"Kazuya?" "和也？"

My courage flees. 我的勇气消失了。

"Yeah – yeah, I'm still here. Um... listen, someone's on the other line. I have to go."  
"嗯——嗯，我还在。呃……听着，有人在另一条线上。我得挂了。"

I end the call before he can say anything, trying to convince myself that there was nothing else for us to talk about anyway.  
我挂断了电话，不让他有机会说任何话，试图说服自己我们之间已经没有什么可谈的了。

### Interlude VIII

There's a point in our lives where we have to make a decision.  
在我们生命中的某个时刻，我们必须做出决定。

A hazy precipice where we climb, struggling to reach the top to make that transition from children to adults. Laying out the stones that'll form the foundation for the rest of our lives.  
一个朦胧的悬崖边缘，我们攀爬着，挣扎着要到达顶端，完成从孩童到成人的转变。铺设那些将构成我们余生基础的石块。

I never reached the top. The climb was too long and the rocks thrown from on high too sharp. The boulders and stones crashed against me, bruising and bleeding. Despite that, I managed to scale those impossible heights. I was so close to the peak and the fog had grown heavy. I couldn't see the top anymore. I was lost.  
我从未到达顶峰。攀登的路太漫长，从高处投下的石块又太尖锐。巨石和石块撞击着我，使我受伤流血。尽管如此，我还是设法攀上了那些难以企及的高度。我离顶峰如此之近，雾气也变得浓重。我再也看不见顶端了。我迷失了方向。

I didn't know who I was or where I was going.  
我不知道自己是谁，也不知道将去往何方。

When I needed a hand to reach out and pull me up, to guide me, my mother stood there and watched me slip and fall. I thought that, of all people, she would understand the war and what it was doing to us.  
当我需要一只手伸出，拉我一把，引导我时，我的母亲却站在那里，看着我滑倒和跌落。我以为，在所有人中，她会理解这场战争以及它对我们造成了什么。

She didn't understand anything.  
她什么都不懂。

I can't say it was entirely her fault. I could've hauled myself over the edge if I'd really tried. But I was so tired of everything. Letting go was just... easier.  
我不能完全说是她的错。如果我真的努力，我本可以把自己拉上去的。但我对一切都感到厌倦。放手只是……更容易。

As a child, I'd never seen into my parents room much, not even during the moves. I knew I had once shared their bed as a toddler, but couldn't have told you what it looked like in any of our homes. Not until I was around sixteen and both my parents were out of the house one afternoon.  
小时候，我从未仔细看过父母的房间，即使在搬家时也没有。我知道自己曾在蹒跚学步时与他们同床共枕，但无法告诉你我们任何一个家中的床是什么样子。直到我大约十六岁，一个下午，父母都不在家。

I stand in front of their plain white door, maybe two inches thick. Taller and wider than any prison wall. Made only with the thickest reinforced concrete. Yet it's all too easy to grasp the handle and push it open.  
我站在他们那扇朴素的白色门前，也许有两英寸厚。比任何监狱的墙都要高和宽。只用最厚的加固混凝土制成。然而，握住把手并推开它却异常容易。

The hinges creak. I take a step into my father's world. The air smells undeniably like his cologne, rich sea salt winds that make me think of the ocean.  
铰链吱嘎作响。我踏入父亲的世界。空气中无疑弥漫着他古龙水的味道，浓郁的海盐气息让我联想到大海。

Newspaper articles and old photos with incoherent scribbles are tacked up to a corner of the wall, right next to an office desk and powered down computer. My father is always writing on that thing. I can't pick up a book without thinking of him, even though I've never read any of his stories or whatever it is he writes. I don't think he's ever published anything.  
报纸文章和带有潦草笔记的旧照片钉在墙角，紧挨着办公桌和关闭的电脑。父亲总是在那上面写作。我拿起一本书就会想起他，尽管我从未读过他的任何故事或他写的东西。我想他从未发表过任何作品。

The room itself is immaculate, conservative. The bed is made without a wrinkle, carpet fresh and warm under my feet. A few contemporary paintings decorate the walls. It's almost intentionally mundane, done to counteract that picture-laden corner bleeding over the sunflower yellow paint, a frenzied brain caught in a loop. The air around it is oppressive, heated – angry. It screams _conspiracy._  
房间本身一尘不染，风格保守。床铺得平整无皱，地毯在我脚下新鲜而温暖。几幅当代画作装饰着墙壁。这里几乎刻意显得平凡，以抵消那幅满是图片的角落溢出的向日葵黄漆，一个陷入循环的狂乱思绪。周围的空气压抑，炽热——愤怒。它尖叫着阴谋。

My face scrunches, trying to decipher this alien language disguised as Japanese. Half of the articles are in English, some even look like official reports. None of it makes sense – it's all just garbled numbers, which I think are dates, and illegible notes. Some lines blur over and over until they devolve into meaningless gibberish, painted like graffiti over the images of Old Japan and buildings with foreign names.  
我的脸皱成一团，试图解读这伪装成日语的外星语言。一半的文章是英文，有些甚至看起来像官方报告。这一切都毫无意义——全是乱七八糟的数字，我想是日期，还有难以辨认的笔记。有些行一遍遍模糊，直到变成毫无意义的胡言乱语，像涂鸦一样覆盖在古老日本和带有异国名字的建筑图像上。

My father hid from the world and from the war here, or so I used to think. The truth was much different. He was stuck on those islands. Always standing on their shores. A POW destined never to come home. My mother couldn't forget the war, even if she wanted to like she claims. In her arms at night she held a living, breathing reminder of it day by day. A scar that often split open anew and with a vengeance.  
我曾经以为我父亲躲在这里，远离世界和战争。但真相大相径庭。他被困在那片岛屿上。总是站在它们的岸边。一个注定永远无法回家的战俘。我母亲无法忘记战争，即使她声称想忘记。在她的怀抱中，每晚都抱着一个活生生的、呼吸着的战争提醒者，日复一日。一道常常带着怨恨重新裂开的伤疤。

The wall burns at me with its intensity and I stumble away from that stained corner. _Wait_, something calls to me, catches my eye, sitting on the dresser facing my mother's side of the bed. The sheen is dull, even under the light coming in through the window. An oval mirror faces me as I approach, two of the small things resting in front of it. Red bulbs with hard black lines cutting through them.  
那堵墙以其强烈的火焰向我逼近，我踉跄着远离那个污迹斑斑的角落。等等，有什么东西在呼唤我，吸引我的目光，它静静地躺在梳妆台上，正对着我母亲床的那一侧。即使是在透过窗户射进来的光线之下，那光泽也显得暗淡。一面椭圆形的镜子在我靠近时映入眼帘，镜子前摆放着两件小物件。红色的灯泡上，坚硬的黑色线条贯穿其中。

I reach out, plucking one up in my fingers.  
我伸出手，用手指轻轻夹起一个。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

I jump and it clatters over the dresser and to the floor. My father stands in the doorway.  
我一惊，它便哗啦一声从梳妆台上滚落到地板上。父亲站在门口。

"Nothing," I say, donning a glare to counter his unreadable expression. After a moment, he nods to the hall, stepping aside so I can hurry out. I didn't even hear the front door open.  
“没什么，”我回答，用一个怒视来回应他那难以捉摸的表情。过了一会儿，他向走廊点了点头，侧身让开，让我快点出去。我甚至没听到前门打开的声音。

At the stairs, I stop on the first step, watching my mother swipe through her phone on the couch.  
在楼梯口，我在第一级台阶上停下，看着母亲在沙发上滑动手机。

"Where'd you go?" “你去哪儿了？”

She sighs, not even turning around to look at me. "To convince your teachers yet again that you're not a waste of a student. It gets harder to lie about every time I go."  
她叹了口气，甚至没有转身看我。“再次说服你的老师们，你不是一个浪费资源的学生。每次我去都越来越难撒谎了。”

Hard lines carve at my face and I bark a laugh. "_You_ finding it hard to bullshit someone?" I ask, knowing how terribly prodding this fire will end. She just had to go for another stupid barb instead of just answering the question. If she wants a fight, I'll give her one.  
我脸上刻着坚硬的线条，发出一声干笑。“你发现很难对某人胡扯吗？”我问道，明知这火上浇油会多么糟糕。她非得再用另一个愚蠢的嘲讽，而不是直接回答问题。如果她想要一场战斗，我会给她。”

She doesn't respond, not even a glare, just keeps poking at her phone. I huff, scowl not quite fading as I make it upstairs to my room.  
她没有回应，连瞪一眼都没有，只是继续摆弄她的手机。我哼了一声，皱眉未消，走上楼回到我的房间。

Seven Christmas' ago, dad got me a music player and some earbuds to go with it. Holding it under some contempt, I came to appreciate the gift later and how easily it let me block everything out.  
七年前的一个圣诞节，爸爸送了我一个音乐播放器和配套的耳机。起初我带着些许轻视的态度，但后来我逐渐领会到这份礼物的价值，以及它让我轻松隔绝外界干扰的能力。

Minutes tick by, the music almost taking me away when my mother decides to invite herself in. Normally she'd at least knock first, that's how I know this is serious.  
时间一分一秒地过去，音乐几乎将我带离现实，这时母亲却自作主张地走了进来。通常她至少会先敲门，正是这一点让我意识到事情的严重性。

I yank the earbuds out as she leans against my door frame, eyes tired, but hard.  
我猛地拔下耳机，她倚在我的门框上，眼神疲惫却坚定。

"What?" I snap. "什么？" 我厉声道。

She shrugs, unimpressed. "Did you even look at any colleges today?" she asks, slight frown telling me she already knows the answer.  
她耸耸肩，不为所动。"你今天有看任何大学吗？" 她问，微微皱眉告诉我她已经知道答案了。

"Got busy. Didn't have time."  
"忙得很。没时间。"

"That's it? Just got busy?" she laughs the last part and it's hollow, tweaking my temper. She sees it too, knows just how to twist her words. Her stance shifts and she lets out a sigh, so tired of it all. "You can't get into a decent college with your grades anyway. What do you plan to do when you graduate?"  
"就这样？只是忙而已？" 她笑着说最后一部分，声音空洞，激起了我的怒火。她也看出来了，知道如何巧妙地用言辞刺痛我。她的站姿变了，叹了口气，对这一切感到无比疲惫。"反正以你的成绩也进不了什么好大学。你毕业后打算做什么？"

I know exactly what she's doing and I'm not going to fall for it. I've fought with her too many times about this to be goaded into another sparing match. Beneath the skin I'm shaking. Our fights are explosive, but these arguments, the kind where she brings up school and the future – we might as well be given knives to stab each other with.  
我清楚她在做什么，我不会上当的。关于这个话题，我们已经争吵过太多次，不会再被激怒去进行另一场较量。表面上我镇定自若，内心却在颤抖。我们的争吵总是激烈异常，但这些争论，尤其是她提到学业和未来的那些——我们简直就像是被赋予了刀子互相捅刺。

"I don't know," I say, hoping – praying – that she gives up on this one.  
"我不知道，" 我说，心中暗自祈祷——恳求——她能就此罢休。

To give up would mean defeat and that is not something my mother ever concedes. "I guess you're just going to work some dead end job for minimum wage the rest of your life, huh?"  
放弃意味着失败，而我母亲从不承认失败。“我猜你这辈子就打算做些低薪的死胡同工作了，是吧？”

"I can still go to college."  
“我还是可以去上大学的。”

She laughs, a real one this time. "What, some underfunded community college?"  
她这次真的笑了。“什么，去个资金不足的社区大学？”

I fumble, bite my lower lip and make a dedicated lunge with my imaginary weapon. "We can't all be child prodigies bound for Heidelberg."  
我笨拙地咬住下唇，用想象中的武器猛地一刺。“我们不可能都是注定要去海德堡的神童。”

"You're right," she parries, throwing off my guard. "I had to work to get into Heidelberg at eleven. I guess I should just take you out of school then so you can start applying for some shitty fast food job and move out. You obviously don't care where the hell you end up, why should I?" a sledgehammer in place of a knife, cracking bones and pressing against my lungs.  
“你说得对，”她巧妙地反击，让我措手不及。“我十一岁进海德堡是努力的结果。我想我应该让你退学，这样你就可以开始申请那些糟糕的快餐工作，然后搬出去。你显然不在乎自己最终会到哪里，我为什么要关心？”她用锤子代替刀子，敲碎骨头，压迫我的肺部。

I won't break. "I do care, it's just–"  
我不会崩溃。“我确实在乎，只是——”

"Why did I waste all this time with advanced classes, paying extra for the magnet schools, if you were just going to waste it?" she barks, knocking me down all too easily. She has me pinned and she knows it.  
“我为什么要浪费这么多时间上高级班，额外花钱去读磁校，如果你只是要浪费这一切？”她厉声说道，轻而易举地将我击倒。她把我按住了，她知道这一点。

The walls are ringing, my blood pulsing with a need to escape. There's nowhere to run. "I don't know. I'll figure it out."  
墙壁在回响，我的血液因逃脱的渴望而脉动。无处可逃。“我不知道。我会弄明白的。”

"No." fury draws at her, a cord drawn taut over the years snapping. "No, there is no figuring it out. You decide now. I'm not playing these games anymore."  
“不。”愤怒在她脸上浮现，多年来紧绷的弦突然断裂。“不，没有什么弄明白的。你现在就决定。我再也不玩这些游戏了。”

"I'm not playing games either! I just have to – consider all my options."  
"我也不是在玩游戏！我只是必须——考虑所有选择。"

"Show me!" she shouts, her voice shaking like my body is. "Show me all of these other options you have! Let me guess, you're going to head to ASU and fuck off for two years so you can snag a manager position at a telecom company, right?"  
"给我看！" 她喊道，声音颤抖得和我身体一样。"给我看你所有的其他选择！让我猜猜，你要去 ASU 混两年，然后找个电信公司的经理职位，对吧？"

It hits exactly where she wants it too, gutting me, yanking a flinch from my shoulders. Behind her I see a shadow against the light, my father drawn upstairs by us. He stands behind her, doesn't touch her, doesn't say anything, just stares at me with woeful eyes. I clamp my mouth shut, chew on my tongue, all too exposed now that he's here watching and listening. I don't know how to fight now. There's two of them and I can't trust which side my father will take, if any. He'll probably just go back to his room and disappear.  
这话正中她的下怀，让我心如刀绞，肩膀不由自主地抽搐了一下。在她身后，我看到一个影子映在光里，是我父亲被我们吵上了楼。他站在她身后，没有触碰她，也没有说话，只是用忧郁的眼神盯着我。我紧闭双唇，咬着舌头，现在他在这里看着听着，我感觉自己暴露无遗。我不知道现在该怎么反击。他们俩对我一个，我不知道父亲会站在哪一边，如果有的话。他可能会回到自己的房间，消失不见。

_Coward.  懦夫。_

"What happened?" mother presses, voice low, every word a bullet that rips into me. "You had some hardass shit to say to me down stairs, why so quiet now? I'm done, Kazuya... you have to figure out where the hell you're going in life or you have to find a new home. I'm not going to let my son sit in his room until he's in his thirties so he can continue to amount to _nothing_ for the rest of his life."  
“发生了什么？”母亲追问，声音低沉，每个字都像子弹般撕裂着我。“你刚才在楼下不是有狠话要对我说吗，现在怎么这么安静？我受够了，和也...你得弄清楚自己这辈子到底要往哪儿走，不然你就得找个新家。我不会让我儿子一直窝在房间里，直到三十多岁还一事无成地度过余生。”

I look at the floor, quivering so hard I have to squeeze my fingers tight to make it stop. I can't take it anymore, but I have to. _I have to_.  
我盯着地板，颤抖得如此厉害，以至于我不得不紧紧握住手指来让它停止。我再也受不了了，但我必须忍耐。我必须。

_What do I do? 我该怎么办？_

"That's not fair," I say, voice wavering.  
"这不公平，"我说，声音颤抖着。

"That's life. Get used to it. What's it going to be?"  
"这就是生活。习惯吧。你打算怎么做？"

_What do I do? 我该怎么办？_

It begins as a tremble, the wounds, even the scabbed over scars, peel open to spill everything over the edges.  
一切始于颤抖，伤口，甚至是结痂的疤痕，都裂开溢出一切，蔓延至边缘。

"I don't... I don't _know_." a frown cracks at my mask, choking me the more I try to fight it back, a heat building behind my eyes. A possession sweeps over me, guiding my sight up to her, perhaps in some innate attempt to seek solace. A world of weight presses down on me, the battles of the Angel War, the burden to meet her expectations – I'm not strong enough now. I need help.  
“我不……我不知道。”眉头在我面具下裂开，我越是试图压抑，越是窒息，眼后一阵热意涌起。一种占有欲席卷而来，引导我的视线向上望向她，或许是出于某种本能寻求慰藉。世界的重压向我袭来，天使之战的战斗，满足她期望的重担——我现在不够坚强。我需要帮助。

"I just..." "我只是……"

_Someone help me_. 谁能帮帮我。

Was my face so pleading when I looked at her? Hopeful she might offer kind, healing words? Lend me relief from a bitter front, as mothers are supposed to? She stands there, so very resolute in posture – unshakable, like those northern eyes of hers. The air holds its breath, her answer staring at me through cloudy irises.  
我看着她时，脸上是否满是恳求？期待她能说出温柔治愈的话语？给我从苦涩的伪装中解脱，就像母亲应有的那样？她站在那里，姿态如此坚定——坚不可摧，就像她那北方的眼眸。空气屏住了呼吸，她的回答透过朦胧的虹膜凝视着我。

Without uttering a word, in the way her chin lifts, in the way her jaw tenses, she answers –  
她一言不发，只是下巴微微抬起，下颌紧绷，答案已不言而喻——

_No_.

Ever since I was six, I'd been trying to hold the tears in. Be the grown up she expected me to be. Real adults didn't cry. Proper people who weren't twisted up on the inside didn't cry. I wouldn't be like my father.  
自从六岁起，我就一直在努力忍住泪水。成为她期望中的成熟模样。真正的成年人不会哭泣。内心没有扭曲的正常人不会哭泣。我不会像我父亲那样。

I would never be like him.  
我永远不会像他那样。

A sob shatters me and I pinch my eyes, as if that will somehow stem the flow of tears. I can see her through blurred vision, arms crossed, holding herself back as I fall apart. A hand covers my face because I can't bear the weight of her gaze anymore, grasping for some moment of privacy in this broken thing named Kazuya. If the pounding frag bursts in my throat weren't drawing such bawling, tear streaked whimpers, I'd tell her how much I hate her, I'd scream at her. _I hate you. I hate you I hate you_–  
一声啜泣将我击碎，我紧闭双眼，仿佛这样就能止住泪水的涌流。透过模糊的视线，我看到她双臂交叉，强忍着不让自己崩溃，而我却在瓦解。一只手遮住了我的脸，因为我再也承受不住她目光的重压，在这名为和也的破碎之物中寻求片刻的私密。如果喉咙里没有那撕心裂肺的哭泣和泪痕斑斑的呜咽，我会告诉她我有多恨她，我会对她大喊大叫。我恨你。我恨你我恨你——

A body and a warmth presses itself on the bed next to me, my father's arm hugging around my back. "It's alright... I'm here, son. I'm right here. You're okay."  
一个身体和温暖紧贴着我躺到床上，父亲的手臂环抱在我的背上。“没事的...我在这里，儿子。我就在这里。你没事的。”

He hugs me close, hand rubbing my shoulder and voice full of a tenderness I don't recognize. "It's alright. I'm here."  
他紧紧拥抱着我，手轻抚我的肩膀，声音充满了我未曾察觉的温柔。“没事的。我在这里。”

At the time, it just made me cry harder.  
那时，这只会让我哭得更厉害。

When I needed her most – my mother abandoned me and the man I hated tried to comfort me and salvage my pride, best he could.  
在我最需要她的时候——我的母亲抛弃了我，而我憎恨的那个男人试图安慰我，尽可能地挽回我的尊严。

That was the moment I became well and truly lost.  
那一刻，我彻底迷失了。

### Chapter 9: December 4

I laid wide awake last night, concentrating on my mother's quiet breathing and wondering if her dreams would be visited by the Eva. She still takes sleeping pills. Lying in the dark, listening to her occasionally rustling the sheets or mumbling, is more soothing than any of my dreams might have been. Comforting, in a way, knowing that after so long she's able to have at least one peaceful night of rest.  
昨夜我辗转难眠，专注听着母亲平静的呼吸声，思索着她的梦境是否会有 Eva 造访。她仍在服用安眠药。躺在黑暗中，听着她偶尔翻动床单或喃喃自语，比我的任何梦境都要抚慰人心。在某种程度上，这令人感到安慰，知道经过这么长时间后，她至少能拥有一个安宁的夜晚。

I don't feel very tired when morning creeps over the world. I'm sure it'll hit me later in the day, but for now the smell of steaming coffee is tantalizing and it's shaping up to be a relatively cloudless and bright day. Mother wakes around 6, an early riser. I try to give her some privacy, throwing a couple of eggs in the pan and some bread in the toaster for myself. I'm sure she considers her mornings to be undignified – the almost immediate retreat to my bathroom, where she stays for a good half hour, tells me as much. She'd rather be freshened up in front of her son than be seen at all.  
当清晨悄然降临世界时，我并不感到特别疲惫。我确信这会在一天中的某个时刻袭来，但此刻热腾腾的咖啡香气诱人，今天看来会是一个相对晴朗明媚的日子。母亲大约六点醒来，是个早起的人。我尽量给她一些私人空间，往平底锅里打了几个鸡蛋，给自己烤了几片面包。我确信她认为早晨的时光有失尊严——她几乎立刻就躲进我的浴室，一待就是半小时，这足以说明一切。她宁愿在儿子面前梳洗打扮，也不愿被看到。

I huff, holding onto the thought, wishing I had shown such care when I went to see her. _Wishing gets you no where_. I'm clean shaven and fresh and it's her birthday today. Happy Rotational Survival Day, Pip would say.  
我叹了口气，紧抓着这个念头，希望自己在去看她时也能如此细心。空想无济于事。我刮干净了胡子，神清气爽，今天是她的生日。‘旋转生存快乐日’，皮普会这么说。

Like the rising sun outside, even my mother has a little more brightness to her as she steps out of the restroom, buttoning the cuffs of her pale yellow shirt. She stands next to me, our elbows not quite touching. I ask her if she wants any, to which she only shakes her head, hands resting on the counter next to the stove. The eggs sizzle, over easy.  
就像外面的朝阳升起，连我母亲走出洗手间时也多了几分光彩，她扣上淡黄色衬衫的袖口。她站在我旁边，我们的手肘几乎没有触碰。我问她是否想要一些，她只是摇摇头，双手放在炉子旁边的柜台上。鸡蛋在锅中滋滋作响，煎得恰到好处。

"What medication do they have you on?" She asks and I see she's staring at spot I keep my pills. It's barren now. I hid the bottles as soon as we got back yesterday.  
“他们给你开了什么药？”她问，我注意到她在盯着放药的地方。那里现在空空如也。昨天我们一回来，我就把药瓶藏起来了。

I take a big breath and puff it out. "Just anti-depressants at first. Graduated to anti-anxiety, anti-nightmare and mood-stabilizers. The works."  
我深吸一口气，然后缓缓吐出。“一开始只是抗抑郁药。后来升级到了抗焦虑、抗噩梦和情绪稳定剂。一应俱全。”

She doesn't make anything of my light tone. "I didn't see any anxiety meds."  
她对我的轻松语气并不在意。“我没看到任何抗焦虑药物。”

"I need to get a new prescription," I say with a shrug, avoiding her eyes. 'I emptied the bottle hoping to OD' doesn't have quite the same ring to it. In truth, I won't be able to refill it for another week. Go me.  
“我需要重新开个处方，”我耸耸肩，避开她的目光。‘我把瓶子倒空了，希望能过量’这话听起来就没那么顺耳了。说实话，我得再等一个星期才能续药。我真行。

And like that the space between us is strained again. Or maybe my system is protesting against a lack of blissful chemical sedation. Hard to tell. Have I always been this jittery or is it just the coffee? Even as we head down the road towards D.C., I find my bouncing nerves are only mitigated by how relaxed my mother is today. She was wound like a spring yesterday and this morning there's a shadow of a smile hovering at the corners of her mouth, as though it might burst free at any moment.  
就这样，我们之间的空间再次变得紧张。或许是我的身体在抗议缺乏愉悦的化学镇静。很难说。我一直是这么紧张，还是只是因为咖啡？即使我们沿着通往华盛顿的路行驶，我发现我跳动的神经只能被母亲今天的放松所缓解。她昨天还像弹簧一样紧绷，今早嘴角却挂着一丝微笑的影子，仿佛随时都可能绽放开来。

After parking, we head down Pennsylvania Ave again and she hooks her arm through mine, hanging onto it as we walk.  
停好车后，我们再次沿着宾夕法尼亚大道走去，她挽着我的手臂，紧紧抓着一起前行。

"Where to?" she asks. “去哪儿？”她问道。

I guess she isn't pissed after all. How is it she knows me so well but I can't read her at all? Must be a mom thing.  
看来她终究没生气。她怎么这么了解我，而我却完全看不透她呢？一定是妈妈特有的本领吧。

"I think it's a nice day to spend inside staring at paintings."  
“我觉得今天很适合待在室内欣赏画作。”

That smile breaks free and she nods. I may not be able to predict my mother's moods, but I have a feeling it doesn't really matter where we go or what we do today. So long as she gets to walk with her arm hooked through mine, she'll be content.  
那个笑容终于绽放，她点了点头。我或许无法预料母亲的情绪，但我有种感觉，无论我们去哪儿或做什么，今天都不重要。只要她能挽着我的手臂一起走，她就会心满意足。

We can see the Capitol building down the strip. Most of the year you can only spot the statue-crested dome spearing through the bushy heads of trees. Across from us is the pillared entrance to the National Gallery of Art. A statue of the Roman god Mercury hails us to greet him as we enter, standing atop his fountain in the middle of a rotunda guarded by columns of malachite marble. The gallery isn't terribly busy for the time of day. A few local artists have set up shop here and there, doing their best to mimic the work of the old masters.  
我们可以看到国会大厦沿着街道远处的身影。一年中的大部分时间，你只能看到那雕像冠顶的圆顶穿透茂密的树冠。对面是国立美术馆的柱廊入口。当我们进入时，罗马神墨丘利的雕像在喷泉中央向我们致意，他站立在一个由孔雀石大理石柱守护的圆形大厅中央。美术馆在一天中的这个时候并不算太繁忙。一些当地艺术家在这里零星地摆摊，尽力模仿古代大师的作品。

We wander through the west wing, quirking our heads at the more abstract pieces imbued with symbolic meaning that only the artist seems to know. The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun. We chuckle a bit at the dramatized figures. Next to it, a woman with red hair looks at us from where she sits by the railway, a puppy fast asleep in her lap. The painting down the hall makes me stop where I stand, my legs making long strides to bring me right up close a second later. Even after staring for a long minute, trying to figure out what in particular about this works calls to me, I find I still can't move away.  
我们漫步在西翼，对那些充满象征意义、似乎只有艺术家自己才明白的抽象作品感到好奇。《红大龙与太阳下的女人》。我们对这些戏剧化的形象轻声笑了起来。旁边，一位红发女子从她坐在铁路旁的画中向我们望来，她膝上的一只小狗正酣睡。走廊尽头的画作让我停下脚步，我的双腿不由自主地迈开大步，将我带到画前。即使凝视了许久，试图弄清楚究竟是这幅画的哪一点吸引了我，我发现我仍然无法移开视线。

The woman is up on a hill of green, shimmering yellow under the light of the sun, blue sky and fluffy clouds at her back. The light is against her so that she casts a shadow down the hill. Next to her is a boy, but he stands further beyond the tall grass. Both of them are looking at me, waiting – _are you_ _coming?_ They seem to ask.  
那女子站在一片绿意盎然的小丘上，阳光下泛着金黄的光泽，背后是蔚蓝的天空和蓬松的云朵。光线从她背后射来，使得她在小丘上投下了一道影子。她身旁站着一个男孩，但他站在更高的草丛之外。两人都望着我，等待着——你会来吗？他们似乎在问。

I want nothing more than to be on that hill with them under the warmth of the sun. Up there in the light, where everyone will be able to see me.  
我无比渴望能与他们一起在那阳光照耀的山丘上，沐浴在温暖的阳光下。在那光明之处，让所有人都能看见我。

The thought is as elating as it is frightening.  
这个念头既令人振奋又让人害怕。

I don't want them to see the real me – the one who can't love anybody right. The one who had once wished his dad would kill himself. The one who tried to make his mother feel lower than dirt. People will see that part of me and they will turn away, disgusted.  
我不想让他们看到真实的我——那个不懂如何去爱的我。那个曾希望父亲自杀的我。那个试图让母亲觉得自己连泥土都不如的我。人们会看到我的这一面，他们会厌恶地转身离去。

The other kids in school, back when I was still just quirky instead of the strange not-right-in-the-head Japanese boy, would ask, "If you could have any super power, what would it be?"  
在学校时，当我还只是有点古怪而不是那个脑子不正常的奇怪日本男孩时，其他孩子会问：“如果你能拥有任何超能力，你会选择什么？”

"I'd want to be invisible."  
“我想变得隐形。”

They traded quizzical looks, before one asked, "Why?"  
他们交换了疑惑的眼神，然后其中一个问道：“为什么？”

Why indeed? Why wouldn't I want to be super strong or fast or be able to shoot laser beams from my eyes? If I was invisible, no one could hurt me. You can't hate what you can't see, right? If no one knows you exist, no one can yell at you or make you feel unwanted.  
为什么呢？为什么我不想变得超级强壮或快速，或者能够从眼睛发射激光束？如果我能隐形，就没有人能伤害我。你看不见的东西，你就不会讨厌，对吧？如果没有人知道你的存在，就没有人会对你大喊大叫或让你感到不受欢迎。

In this painting, the father and husband, is missing. He's the painter, giving us a glimpse into the light of his life.  
在这幅画中，父亲和丈夫的角色缺失了。他就是画家，让我们得以一窥他生命中的光芒。

_Are you coming? 你来吗？_

"I like this one better," mother says, gesturing to the one in front of her on my right. It's done in the same impressionistic wisps of color. A man, with his back to us, paints under the shade of a yellow parasol. On his left is a woman in blue, collecting flowers? Roses? The color is indecisive, a gnarled oak tree rising between the man and woman. A simple, quiet moment.  
“我更喜欢这个，”母亲说，指向我右边的那幅画。它同样采用了印象派的色彩线条。一个男人，背对着我们，在黄色阳伞的遮荫下作画。他的左边是一位穿蓝衣的女子，正在采集花朵？玫瑰？色彩并不确定，一棵扭曲的橡树矗立在男女之间。一个简单而宁静的瞬间。

Were things ever that peaceful for my parents? Were they ever that at ease with each other? Does she gravitate towards it because it speaks to her inner wants? Or does it represent a moment of rest she was once able to grasp? Just one day in too many years to breathe?  
我的父母是否曾有过那样平静的时光？他们是否曾如此自在地相处？她是否被这幅画吸引，因为它触动了她内心的渴望？或者它代表了她曾经能够抓住的片刻休息？在无数年中仅有的那么一天，得以喘息？

_Is that your truth? Did I take your chance to breathe away?  
那是你的真实吗？我是否夺走了你呼吸的机会？_

We spent more time there than I thought either of us would have cared for. The new modern art building next to it takes significantly less time to browse through. The sun has just begun the second half of its arc through the sky when we decide to eat. The Old Ebbitt Grill is heavy with that rustic Victorian era charm. White, design imprinted table cloths, velvet seats, intricately crafted gold painted lamp necks that give off a dull glow. It isn't the most expensive place, but it isn't cheap either.  
我们在那里度过的时间比我想象中我们任何一个人愿意的都要多。旁边新建的现代艺术大楼浏览起来要快得多。当我们决定用餐时，太阳刚刚开始它穿越天空的下半程。老艾比特烧烤店充满了那种乡村维多利亚时代的魅力。白色、印有图案的桌布，天鹅绒座椅，精巧的金色灯颈发出柔和的光芒。这里不是最昂贵的地方，但也不便宜。

Seated at a booth lined with dark green shrubbery, we talk about her work with the neurology department at Mesa. It's a privately funded lab, working just like thousands of others to find new medical approaches to mental disorders – or just figure out how it all works to begin with. I can't say what that and Metaphysics have in common for her to intermingle the two. The Soul and Mind are separate but the same? I listen to her rant, sensing how much it infuriates her that after centuries we know so much about the human brain, but so very little at the same time. She's been spending the past thirteen years trying to understand how people's minds actually work and to her own admittance has little to show for it.  
坐在铺满深绿色灌木的隔间里，我们谈论她在梅萨神经科部门的工作。这是一家私人资助的实验室，与其他成千上万的实验室一样，致力于寻找治疗精神疾病的新方法——或者仅仅是试图从一开始就弄清楚这一切是如何运作的。我不明白这和形而上学有什么共同之处，以至于她要将两者交织在一起。灵魂与心灵是分离却又相同的吗？我听着她的抱怨，感受到她对人类大脑了解甚多，却又知之甚少的矛盾感到多么愤怒。过去十三年里，她一直在努力理解人们的心智究竟是如何运作的，而她自己也承认，成果寥寥。

I can sympathize. 我能理解这种感受。

Then the moment I've been dreading since she arrived in Washington drops on the table with all the weight of a semi-truck.  
然后，自从她来到华盛顿就一直让我忧心忡忡的那一刻，如同一辆半挂卡车般沉重地落在了桌面上。

"How's the CIA?" she asks, going out of her way to make the question sound innocent.  
"中情局怎么样？" 她故意装作不经意地问，试图让问题听起来无害。

I shrug. "Not much to talk about. Same paperwork, different salary." It's more of a lie than it was before. Mother hums, fork making circles in her trout parmesan. I'm not really bound as much by secrecy. I can talk about the stuff that isn't classified anymore. I doubt she'd really care to listen.  
我耸耸肩。"没什么好说的。还是那些文书工作，只是薪水变了。" 这话比以前更像是谎言了。母亲哼了一声，叉子在她那盘鳟鱼帕尔马干酪里画着圈。我不再那么受保密协议的束缚了。我可以谈论那些不再属于机密的事情。我怀疑她是否真的有兴趣听。

"Do you still think it was wrong of me to join the CIA?" I ask, trying to sound casual, as if her answer doesn't hold such incredible weight.  
"你还是觉得我加入中情局是错的吗？" 我尽量装作随意地问，仿佛她的回答并没有那么重大的分量。

Her expression is neutral. "It never mattered to you before."  
她的表情毫无波澜。“这对你来说从来都不重要。”

I lean forward, fingering the thin stem of my wine glass. I could probably snap it with my thumb with the right amount of pressure. "It's always mattered."  
我身体前倾，用手指拨弄着细长的酒杯脚。只要用力得当，我或许能用拇指将其折断。“一直以来都很重要。”

It's something I thought I'd never admit to anyone, least of all her. That was the last, fragile link between us to break. I can still feel that rush of adrenaline I got after telling her off – what a catharsis it was to get her to feel something. It's one of the brain's many tricks. Played me like a fool, when all I really wanted was–  
这是我以为自己永远不会向任何人承认的事，尤其是她。那是我们之间最后一丝脆弱的联系断裂的时刻。我至今仍能感受到向她发泄后那股肾上腺素的涌动——让她感受到些什么，那是一种怎样的宣泄啊。这是大脑众多把戏之一。当我真正想要的只是——

"You're very intelligent, Kazuya," she finally says, my eyes darting up before I can think to put my mask back on. She leans forward and meets them. "I know all mothers say that about their kids, but in your case it's actually true... I wasn't upset that you didn't want to go into Metaphysics like me. You were putting that thick," she pokes my forehead, "brilliant head of yours to waste. I thought I had to be tough on you to get you to see that."  
"你非常聪明，和也，"她终于说道，我的目光不由自主地抬起，还没来得及重新戴上伪装。她倾身向前，与我对视。"我知道所有母亲都会这样夸自己的孩子，但在你身上，这确实是真的...我并没有因为你不想像我一样进入形而上学领域而感到难过。你那颗厚重的，"她戳了戳我的额头，"聪慧的脑袋，正被浪费着。我以为我必须对你严厉，才能让你明白这一点。"

A fierce sense of pride fills me, fighting against our old battle scars. This one I'll take to my grave, but that harsh treatment did work, in a way. I'll never agree that it was properly handled and that particular betrayal will always leave buried shrapnel in my heart. I can, at the very least, admit that it got me to do something.  
一股强烈的自豪感涌上心头，与我们的旧伤疤抗衡。这一点我会带到坟墓里，但那种严苛的对待确实在某种程度上奏效了。我永远不会认同那是恰当的处理方式，那份特定的背叛将永远在我心中留下埋藏的弹片。至少，我可以承认，它让我做了些什么。

What happened afterwards... there's still too much roiled up for me to face yet.  
之后发生的事情...我内心仍有太多纷乱，尚未准备好面对。

"Would it make you happy if I went to school again?"  
"如果我再去上学，会让你开心吗？"

She huffs. "Would it make _you_ happy?"  
她哼了一声。"会吗？"

I can't say. I've never really known what I wanted to do with my life. I've just taken strides with the crowds, walking with them in what I thought were steps towards social acceptance. If I did things other people did, I would be normal, right?  
我说不上来。我从未真正知道自己想做什么。我只是随着人群迈步，以为这样就能走向社会的认可。如果我做别人做的事，我就会变得正常，对吧？

"I took a children's psychology course my first year. I just wanted some easy credits, but... I ended up really liking it. I don't know, maybe I could teach something like that one day."  
"我大一的时候选修了一门儿童心理学课程。我只是想轻松拿点学分，但...结果我真的很喜欢它。我不知道，也许有一天我可以教这样的课程。"

She leans her cheek on a propped up hand – and her smile is so completely full of love. "You are such a difficult boy."  
她将脸颊靠在撑起的手上——她的笑容里充满了满满的爱意。"你真是个难缠的男孩。"

"I guess I take after my mother."  
"我想我是继承了我母亲的特质。"

I didn't think it was possible, but her smile grows. "Yeah, I guess you do."  
我本以为这不可能，但她笑得更灿烂了。“是啊，我想你是对的。”

It's a comfortable drive home and I spend it replaying that glowing smile over and over. Thankfully, Marina hasn't come by again, still maintaining radio silence. I was expecting this to be a long, painful, frustrating process. She's only ever been a vindictive kind of woman for the year and a half I've known her. This other Marina is so determined to phase me out of memory that she'd rather sneak into my apartment when she thinks I'm not home than risk facing me again.  
回家的路上感觉很舒适，我一路上反复回味着她那灿烂的笑容。幸好，玛丽娜没有再来打扰，依然保持着沉默。我原本以为这将是一个漫长、痛苦且令人沮丧的过程。在我认识她的这一年半里，她一直是个报复心很强的女人。这个新的玛丽娜如此坚决地想要将我从记忆中抹去，以至于她宁愿在我不在家时偷偷溜进我的公寓，也不愿再面对我。

I never expected that to sting quite so much.  
我从未想过这会让我如此难受。

By the bed, mother pulls something square and brown out of her suitcase, sitting down with it on the couch.  
母亲从床边的行李箱里拿出一个方形棕色物品，坐在沙发上。

"What's that?" "那是什么？"

"I was digging around the attic the other day – and I found this." In her lap she holds a thick, synthetic leatherbound book.  
“前几天我在阁楼里翻找——找到了这个。”她膝上放着一本厚厚的合成革封面书。

I can't help but laugh. "You brought a photo album?"  
我不禁笑出声来。“你带了一本相册？”

"Twenty-twenty-seven to twenty-thirty-two." she pats the spot beside her, giddy.  
"二十点二十七分到二十点三十二分。" 她拍了拍身边的空位，兴奋不已。

"Come on, I don't want to look at those."  
"来吧，我不想看那些。"

She makes a slight pout. "But it's my birthday."  
她微微撅起嘴。"但今天是我的生日。"

I roll my eyes, sitting down anyway and she smirks, triumphant. She has two other albums at home that cover the same years. I'm at least curious as to why she considers this one particularly special. She starts flipping through, lips stretching into that wide smile I saw at dinner. I'm just a baby in most of them, wide-eyed, curious. First one I see is her in the hospital, holding a newborn me in her arms. She looks awful, but her expression is soft and vibrant. Rich with new life.  
我翻了个白眼，但还是坐了下来，她得意地笑了。她家里还有另外两本相册，记录着同样的年份。我至少对她为何认为这本特别感兴趣。她开始翻阅，嘴唇绽放出晚餐时我见过的那种灿烂笑容。大多数照片中的我还是个婴儿，眼神好奇，充满惊奇。第一张我看到的是她在医院里，抱着刚出生的我。她看起来很憔悴，但表情温柔而充满生机。洋溢着新生命的丰盈。

The pictures stretch on, page by page, telling a story – one I only remember in bits and pieces.  
照片一页页展开，讲述着一个故事——一个我只能零星回忆起的故事。

"You were a pretty happy kid," mom says, revisiting those beaches in Panama, letting memories of more care free times wash over her.  
“你小时候很快乐，”妈妈说道，重温着巴拿马海滩的记忆，让那些无忧无虑时光的回忆涌上心头。

"Look," she says, a slim finger touching one of the pictures. "You two were best friends."  
"看，" 她指着其中一张照片，纤细的手指轻触其上。"你们俩曾经是最好的朋友。"

We're in a convertible and I take a moment to marvel at how young my father is, how I hardly recognize him and that wide smile. I'm maybe three, sitting between his legs and pretending I'm steering.  
我们坐在一辆敞篷车里，我惊叹于父亲如此年轻，那笑容宽广到几乎让我认不出他。我大概三岁，坐在他两腿之间，假装自己在驾驶。

In another, he's on his back balancing me up on his feet, my arms out like superman. Then my first day of school back in Panama, the sun is just peaking over the buildings as we walk to the drop off. He's got my hand in his, smiling down at me. One time mom found us both passed out on the couch, with me fast asleep in the crook of his arm. Afternoon spills in through the windows, casting us in warm hues.  
另一张照片中，他仰面躺着，用脚把我高高举起，我张开双臂像超人一样。还有我在巴拿马第一天上学，太阳刚刚从建筑物后升起，我们走向校车。他握着我的手，低头对我微笑。有一次，妈妈发现我们俩都躺在沙发上睡着了，我紧紧依偎在他的臂弯里。午后阳光透过窗户洒进来，将我们笼罩在温暖的色调中。

I can see it. Those captured moments are so full of truth and light. Innocence. This is how my mother wants to spend her birthday: sharing her happy memories with me.  
我能感受到。那些被定格的瞬间充满了真实与光芒。纯真。这就是我母亲希望度过生日的方式：与我分享她的快乐回忆。

I spot something then, touching the pages. "Where'd that come from?"  
我随即注意到一些东西，轻触着页面。“这是从哪儿冒出来的？”

One shot has me in the bathtub, a big desert camo helmet swallowing my head, tipping forward so all the camera can see is my big grin.  
其中一张照片是我坐在浴缸里，一顶巨大的沙漠迷彩头盔几乎吞没了我的头，向前倾斜，镜头里只能看到我灿烂的笑容。

Mother blinks and shakes her head. "You used to like collecting old combat gear. Stay out on the beaches all day playing war. One day your dad bought you this Army helmet he found at a thrift store. You ate with it, slept with it, _bathed_ with it. I couldn't get you to take the damn thing off. Had to fight with you to leave it home for school."  
母亲眨了眨眼，摇摇头。“你以前喜欢收集旧的战斗装备。整天在海滩上玩战争游戏。有一天，你爸爸在旧货店给你买了这个军用头盔。你吃饭戴着它，睡觉戴着它，洗澡也戴着它。我怎么也让你脱不下来。为了让你上学时把它留在家里，我还得跟你争斗一番。”

I laugh, picturing her chasing me through the house for it. "Really?"  
我笑了，想象着她在家中追着我要头盔的情景。“真的吗？”

"Mm-hm." “嗯哼。”

Misato comes to me in a blur, dressed in uniform? I don't know, she's got me wearing her helmet, sitting me in her lap and smiling. We must be visiting her at the base. _"Mommy and daddy were soldiers, too, Kazuya,"_ she says. I don't remember why or how we came to it, but I know she was proud when she said it. So I was proud too.  
"美里以一种模糊的身影来到我面前，穿着制服？我不确定，她让我戴上了她的头盔，坐在她的腿上，微笑着。我们一定是在基地看望她。“妈妈和爸爸也是士兵，和也，”她说。我不记得为什么或怎么谈到这个话题的，但我知道当她说出这句话时，她是自豪的。所以我也感到自豪。”

Mother points again. "Look, see? My little soldier." she'd snapped a picture of me in that old Gulf War helmet, eyes peaking over the mound of dirt from the fox hole I'd dug out, a toy rifle in my hands.  
"母亲再次指向照片。“看，看到了吗？我的小士兵。”她拍下了我戴着那顶旧海湾战争头盔的照片，眼睛从我挖出的散兵坑的土堆上方窥视，手里还拿着一把玩具步枪。”

I wanted to be a soldier.  
我曾想成为一名士兵。

Just like my parents. 就像我父母一样。

Except they weren't those kinds of soldiers and war wasn't at all like I thought it would be.  
只是他们并非那种士兵，而战争也完全不像我所想象的那样。

My age doesn't change much as the book goes on and I'm only five before we reach the end. Towards the back she has some later photos I assume there wasn't any other place for in the albums. One of them is a picture of her with Grandfather Langley. It's in our old yard at Flagstaff and he's in uniform. They're both as stiff as boards, a good few inches separating them, his hand touching her back in a mechanical gesture of closeness. Neither of them wears much of a smile.  
随着书页翻动，我的年龄变化不大，直到故事结束时我仍是五岁。在相册的后面，她放了一些后来的照片，我想是因为没有其他地方可以放了。其中一张是她与兰利祖父的合影。照片摄于弗拉格斯塔夫的老宅院中，他身着军装。两人都僵硬如木，相隔好几英寸，他的手机械地搭在她的背上，象征着亲近。两人脸上都没有太多笑容。

A ringtone chirps, mother's cell phone buzzing. Setting the album on the coffee table, she crosses the room and answers it, while I attempt to avoid being nosy and flip through the book again. I stop when she glances back at me, her posture tensing. Her voice is hushed, a worry I've heard before reaching me from that corner.  
一阵铃声响起，母亲的手机嗡嗡作响。她把相册放在茶几上，穿过房间接起电话，而我则试图避免显得过于好奇，再次翻阅那本书。当她回头看我时，我停了下来，她的姿势变得紧张。她的声音低沉，那种我曾听过的担忧从那个角落传来。

My heart picks up, sensing what's happening before I can. It's my father on the other end of that line, I know, a chill running through my bones. Another glance and this time it's written all over her face. He's having an episode. I know it. I can feel it in creeping tugs of dread. Long minutes tick by and she's starting to sound desperate.  
我的心跳加速，预感到即将发生的事情。我知道，电话那头是我父亲，一股寒意贯穿我的骨髓。再次看向她，这次她的脸上写满了担忧。他正在发作。我知道。我能感觉到那种逐渐蔓延的恐惧。漫长的几分钟过去了，她的声音开始显得绝望。

Mother marches back to me. "Talk to him, please," she says, holding the phone out. "He won't listen to me. He's not making any sense, please just talk to him."  
母亲快步回到我身边。“跟他说说话，求你了，”她把手机递给我，“他不听我的。他说的话毫无逻辑，请你跟他谈谈。”

My eyes take in the phone, then dart back up to her and I like to think the betrayal I feel doesn't reach my face. It must have, because she pulls her hand away, about to bring the phone to her ear again. I stand and snatch it in the same movement, showing her my back as the phone touches my ear. I can't stand to see her look so scared.  
我的目光扫过手机，随即又回到她身上，我宁愿相信自己脸上的背叛感并未显露。但显然是有的，因为她缩回了手，准备再次将手机贴近耳朵。我站起身，顺势夺过手机，背对着她接听。我无法忍受看到她如此惊恐的表情。

"Dad?" I ask, bracing myself for the tide of cursing and yelling that's sure to follow. It doesn't, but I flinch as his panic spills over the line. He's ranting. "It wasn't me," he says, repeating it over and over. He says that he never meant to hurt anybody. He didn't want to hurt anybody. He didn't know what he was doing. A headache starts to crack against my skull.  
“爸？”我问道，做好了迎接一连串咒骂和咆哮的准备。然而并没有，但他的恐慌透过电话线传来，我忍不住一颤。他在狂乱中重复着：“不是我，”一遍又一遍。他说他从没想过要伤害任何人。他不想伤害任何人。他不知道自己在做什么。一阵头痛开始在我头骨内裂开。

I hold back a sigh. "Calm down, dad. What are you talking about?" I can only wonder what he must be seeing right now. What apparition of me is accusing him.  
我忍住叹息。“冷静点，爸。你在说什么？”我只能猜测他现在看到了什么。是什么幻象在指控他。

"I didn't– I didn't really want to kill all those people, Kazuya. I've done some terrible things, but I didn't really want everyone to die. It wasn't me, it wasn't me..."  
"我并没有——我真的不想杀那些人，和也。我做过一些可怕的事，但我并不真的想让所有人都死。那不是我，那不是我……"

_It was the Eva_. 那是 Eva。

I don't know what he could possibly mean. Could he be talking about Third Impact? That was Gendo Ikari, wasn't it? That's what all the books and lessons said. Why would it be my father? How could it be him?  
我不明白他可能指的是什么。他是在说第三次冲击吗？那是碇源堂，不是吗？所有的书和课程都是这么说的。为什么会是我父亲？怎么可能是他？

Because the Evas ended the world, didn't they? I've known all along – that the truth is my father lost control and hurt people with it. That's what all those history texts said about the Evas. I took those half-remembered insights and turned them into an excuse to hate him further. He hurt us all the time, why wouldn't I believe he'd be capable of such a terrible thing?  
因为 EVA 终结了世界，不是吗？我一直都知道——真相是我父亲失去了控制，用它伤害了人们。那些历史课本上都是这么描述 EVA 的。我利用那些模糊的记忆，将其转化为进一步憎恨他的借口。他一直伤害我们，我为什么不会相信他能做出如此可怕的事呢？

So why am I standing here wanting to believe otherwise? He's talking like he's been put before judge and jury. As if I'm trying to convict him for genocide, like those trials all those years ago.  
那我为何站在这里，却渴望相信另有隐情？他说话的语气仿佛自己已被送上法庭，接受审判。好像我正试图以种族灭绝的罪名定他的罪，就像多年前那些审判一样。

I don't know what to do.  
我不知道该怎么办。

I swallow, forcing down that wreck called Kazuya, still sixteen and crying in his room. "It's okay, dad... I'm here."  
我咽下口水，强压下那个被称为和也的废墟，他依然十六岁，在房间里哭泣。“没事的，爸爸……我在这里。”

What else can I do?  
我还能做什么呢？

"I didn't mean to." His voice is pleading, on the verge of crumbling. "I didn't, I didn't..."  
"我不是故意的。" 他的声音带着恳求，濒临崩溃。"我没有，我没有……"

"I know, dad. I know you didn't."  
"我知道，爸爸。我知道你不是故意的。"

"I never wanted to kill anybody. You believe me... don't you?"  
"我从没想过要杀任何人。你相信我...对吧？"

Right now, what I have to say is the only thing he cares about. There's nothing more important. I realize in this moment my father has given me the power to break him. To take his shattered self and crush him completely. I've dreamed of that. What I would say, how I would hurt him. Yet here he is, asking for my help, begging. He needs me... and that pull is too strong to shake free of.  
此刻，我必须说的话是他唯一关心的。没有什么比这更重要了。我意识到在这一刻，父亲赋予了我击垮他的力量。将他破碎的自我彻底碾碎。我曾梦想过那情景，我会说什么，如何伤害他。然而现在，他却在向我求助，乞求。他需要我...那种牵引力太强，无法挣脱。

I can't run away anymore.  
我再也无法逃避了。

"Of course I do," I say, just more than a whisper, the words foreign as they roll off my tongue. This time I'm only answered by silence. "I know you didn't mean to... do what you did. I know you wouldn't kill anybody... I know you wouldn't hurt anybody. It's okay, dad."  
"当然，" 我轻声说道，声音几乎细不可闻，这些话从我口中说出显得如此陌生。这一次，回应我的只有沉默。"我知道你不是故意的... 做出那样的事。我知道你不会杀任何人... 我知道你不会伤害任何人。没事的，爸爸。"

What follows is a long, torturous descent into quiet. I can hear the neighbors kids thumping around upstairs. My heart starts pounding in my ears. When he speaks, I can hear him as if he were standing right next to me.  
接下来是一段漫长而痛苦的沉寂。我能听到楼上邻居孩子的蹦跳声。我的心开始在耳边怦怦直跳。当他开口时，我仿佛感觉他就站在我身边。

"I don't believe you." "我不相信你。"

The receiver clicks, a low tone chirping over the dead line. I shut the phone off, turning back to my mother who has her arms wrapped around herself. My brain can't quite process what's just happened, why it happened. For a second I'm able to really see her, what she's thinking. _I shouldn't have left him. I knew I shouldn't have left him._ I want to tell her it's not her fault. Dad thought he could handle himself for a few days, that's all. It's not your fault.  
接收器咔嗒一声，死寂的线路中传来低沉的鸣响。我关掉手机，转身面对着双臂紧抱自己的母亲。我的大脑还无法完全理解刚刚发生了什么，为什么会发生。有那么一瞬间，我真切地看到了她的内心，她在想什么。我不该离开他。我知道我不该离开他。我想告诉她这不是她的错。爸爸以为自己能应付几天，仅此而已。这不是你的错。

Neither of us says a word.  
我们俩谁也没有说话。

We end up on the couch again, a good foot between us while she sifts through the photo album, not really seeing any of the pictures.  
我们最终又坐回了沙发上，中间隔着一尺的距离，她翻阅着相册，却并未真正看进任何一张照片。

"Tomorrow we'll have been married for thirty-five years," she says, at last filling the long silence.  
“明天就是我们结婚三十五周年了。”她终于打破了漫长的沉默。

I find myself staring at her ring. "You got married on December fifth?"  
我不由自主地盯着她的戒指。“你们是十二月五号结婚的？”

"Yeah. Jerry settlement in Idaho."  
“是啊。杰瑞在爱达荷州安顿下来。”

That catches me by surprise. I always knew they were stuck in the camps like most other Japs at some point. It seems like a pretty crummy place to be married. I decide not to ask her about it.  
这让我有些意外。我总知道他们像大多数其他日本人一样，曾在集中营里待过一段时间。那似乎不是一个适合结婚的地方。我决定不问她关于那件事。

"No anniversary plans?" “没有庆祝纪念日的计划吗？”

She shakes her head. "We've never really celebrated it like that."  
她摇了摇头。“我们从来没有那样庆祝过。”

"So... it's not special to you?"  
"所以... 这对你来说并不特别吗？"

By the way she looks at me, like I'm speaking another language, I know I've missed something, misinterpreted. She takes a moment to answer, turning back to the album.  
从她看我的眼神，仿佛我在说另一种语言，我知道我错过了什么，误解了。她花了一会儿时间回答，转回相册。

"We're together," she says, tracing the outline of a photo with all three of us, taken selfie-style. "That's enough."  
"我们在一起，" 她说，用手指沿着一张我们三个人的自拍风格照片轮廓划过。"这就足够了。"

She decides to leave a day early. Sets up a flight for the next morning. I'm... frustrated with her, to say the least. Frustrated with my father for taking this from her, from us. Tonight was a cruel reminder of how close the war really is, and that we'll never be able to get away from it.  
她决定提前一天离开。预订了第二天早上的航班。我...至少可以说，我对她感到沮丧。对我父亲从她、从我们这里夺走这一切感到愤怒。今晚残酷地提醒了我们，战争离我们有多近，我们永远无法摆脱它。

I lie awake again that night, my eyes struggling to adjust to the dark after turning off the lights. Her back is to me and I can hear that she's awake too. My father's words echo off the walls. I'd betrayed him today afterall. He'd known I didn't really believe what I'd said. I was just lying. I'd betrayed him anyway.  
那一夜我又一次辗转难眠，关灯后我的眼睛努力适应着黑暗。她的背对着我，我能听到她也没睡着。父亲的那些话在墙间回响。今天我终究还是背叛了他。他知道我并不真正相信自己所说的。我只是在撒谎。无论如何，我还是背叛了他。

I hadn't meant to this time.  
这次我并非有意如此。

"Mom... what happened, during the Siege?" I ask, the blackness, where I can't see her face, both giving me courage and blanketing me with doubt. I wait long, vein trembling minutes for an answer. Maybe she _has_ fallen asleep.  
"妈妈... 围城期间发生了什么？" 我在黑暗中问道，那里我看不见她的脸，既给了我勇气，又让我被疑虑笼罩。我等待了漫长、颤抖的片刻，期待着回答。也许她已经睡着了。

"There was a battle," she says, revealing a hollow edge I've never heard before. My mother without the walls.  
"那是一场战斗，" 她说，声音中带着一种我从未听过的空洞边缘。我的母亲，没有了往日的坚强。

"And I lost." "而我输了。"

### Interlude IX

Misato had drank too much.  
美里喝得太多了。

It was a rarer occurrence than one might think, considering the amount of alcohol she consumed on a daily basis. These were the times when I kept quiet and just sat with her as she became inconsolably sad. No longer the bubbly Aunt, or even the Colonel. The drinks let that buried depression tug down at her and snare her in the muck and mire, rising to snuff out the light in her eyes.  
考虑到她日常的饮酒量，这种情况其实比人们想象的要少见。每当这时，我总是保持沉默，只是静静地陪着她，看着她变得无法安慰的悲伤。不再是那个活泼的阿姨，甚至不再是那位上校。酒精让那深藏的抑郁拖拽着她，陷入泥沼，逐渐熄灭她眼中的光芒。

"I sent him out there. What else could I do?" she had said, on this night where she had drank too much, listless on the couch. "What else could I do?"  
“我把他送到了那里。我还能做什么呢？”在这个她喝得太多的夜晚，她无力地躺在沙发上说道，“我还能做什么呢？”

I didn't have any answers for her. I just listened, like she listened for me. This time was different, though. There were tears welling in her eyes, a sorrow not born of past pains, but rather a longing. So deep and profound it hurt just to look at.  
我无法给她任何答案。我只是倾听，就像她曾倾听我一样。但这次不同，她的眼中涌动着泪水，不是因往昔的痛苦，而是一种深切的渴望。如此深沉而强烈，仅仅是看着都让人心痛。

"I sent him out to fight," she went on, reaching for the half finished beer on the floor and knocking it over instead. "I told him to come back to me."  
“我让他去战斗，”她继续说道，伸手去拿地板上那半瓶未喝完的啤酒，却把它碰倒了。“我告诉他要回到我身边。”

Her knees draw up. "He never did. That boy I sent down to the cages... he never did come back."  
她蜷缩起膝盖。“他从未回来。那个我送进笼子的男孩……他再也没有回来。”

I used to wonder who 'that boy' was. Who was the boy she sent to war that never came back? Another pilot, like my dad? She didn't have any sons, none that I knew of. No nephews. Really, there was only one boy she could've been talking about.  
我曾好奇‘那个男孩’是谁。她送走的那个男孩是谁？他一去不复返，是像我父亲一样的飞行员吗？她没有儿子，至少我不知道有。也没有侄子。实际上，她提到的男孩只可能是那一个。

It hadn't quite clicked until I saw my father's room and that black corner. He'd been split apart, scattered to bits and pieces that were left behind in the sand, ghosts left to haunt empty suburbia. A man came back, but a boy had died somewhere out there beyond the sea.  
直到我看到父亲的房间和那个黑暗的角落，一切才恍然大悟。他已被撕裂，碎片散落在沙土中，留下的只是幽灵，在空荡的郊区徘徊。一个男人回来了，但某个男孩却在大海彼岸的某个地方死去。

Even Misato was still touched by the Eva's long shadow.  
即便是美里，也仍被 EVA 的漫长阴影所触动。

I hated them. 我恨他们。

The night when I was sixteen and shattered made me realize the only way to escape my parents and the war was to, funnily enough, do exactly what my mother wanted. I applied myself at school again, cleaned up my grades, managed to scrounge together a good GPA out of it. I scoured colleges all along the east coast, filling out forms for every scholarship I could get my hands on. There was a nice beefy one for children of Japanese refugees, instated as some sort of half-assed apology, courtesy of the U.S. Government. Thanks Sam.  
在我十六岁那晚，一切支离破碎，我意识到逃离父母和战争的唯一方法，说来讽刺，竟是照母亲所愿行事。我重新投入学业，整顿成绩，勉强拼凑出一个不错的 GPA。我搜遍了东海岸的所有大学，填满了每一个我能申请到的奖学金的表格。有一个丰厚的奖学金是专门为日本难民子女设立的，算是美国政府半心半意的道歉。谢谢你，山姆。

The CIA was an exciting avenue. Less work than the military and I could travel the world, go to places on missions that affected global policy making. The para-military training we went through during recruitment was grueling, the funniest part being that none of us ever used it again. Officers work through their agents. Operators, they're called. Everyday people in foreign countries recruited to serve as intelligence gatherers. It's actually pretty rare for any Officer to leave their office nowadays.  
中央情报局是一个令人兴奋的选择。比军队工作少，我还能周游世界，执行影响全球政策制定的任务。我们在招募期间的准军事训练极其艰苦，最讽刺的是，我们中没有人再使用过这些技能。军官通过他们的特工工作。他们被称为操作员。在海外国家招募的普通人，作为情报收集者。如今，军官离开办公室的情况其实相当罕见。

I didn't know that at the time and it seemed far more noble than being a Metaphysics professor like my mother, which she had secretly been grooming me for since grade school. Always managed to insert talk about MIT into our conversations. She was delighted, of course, I had dedicated myself to doing so well in school again. _I've gotten through to him_. She was surely thinking. _I've won_.  
那时我并不知情，这看起来远比像我母亲那样成为一名形而上学教授更为高尚，她从小学起就暗中培养我走这条路。总是设法在我们的对话中插入关于麻省理工的话题。当然，她很高兴，我又一次全身心投入学业并表现出色。她肯定在想：我已经打动了他。我赢了。

She realized soon enough that something different was happening when I refused to speak to her at dinner, or told her I was too busy studying when she wanted to take me out somewhere – just trying to spend time with me. She'd broken my walls. I was never going to forgive her for that, taking a cruel pleasure from the indignant looks I got whenever I refused her offers for dinner or a movie.  
她很快意识到有些不同的事情正在发生，当我拒绝在晚餐时与她交谈，或告诉她我忙于学习无法陪她外出——只是想和我共度时光。她打破了我的防线。我永远不会原谅她这一点，每当我拒绝她的晚餐或电影邀请时，她那愤愤不平的表情让我从中获得了残忍的快感。

But you don't ignore Professor Asuka Langley Soryu. If anything, she ignores you. When she demands your attention, you give it. When she's done with you, you shut up and be thankful for what you got. Her advances were surprisingly subtle at first, as though she were probing my defenses. A shrewd tactician if nothing else. She wanted to throttle me for answers, but was hesitant her meddling might cause my renewed vigor towards education to drop. I maintained a strict gag-order. We were on even grounds now and she didn't know me or how to approach me anymore. I didn't let her. I wouldn't let her make use of that weakness again.  
但你不会忽视碇唯教授。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是她忽视你。当她要求你的注意时，你给予它。当她对你完成时，你闭嘴并对你所得到的表示感谢。她最初的接近出奇地微妙，仿佛在试探我的防线。如果不是别的，她是个精明的战术家。她想掐住我以获取答案，但又担心她的干预可能会导致我对教育的重新热情下降。我保持了严格的缄默令。我们现在处于平等地位，她不了解我也不知如何接近我。我没有让她得逞。我不会让她再次利用那个弱点。

Our cold war came to an end the day after my nineteenth birthday. I'd gone over to a friend's to get wasted for the night. They weren't even people I liked very much, just some jocks that had once said I was a "cool dude" for starting a fight back in middle school. I just didn't want to be home on my birthday.  
我们的冷战在我十九岁生日后的第二天结束了。我去了朋友家喝得烂醉如泥。那些人甚至不是我特别喜欢的，只是一些曾经在中学校园斗殴时说过我是个“酷哥”的运动员。我只是不想在自己的生日待在家里。

I came back just after noon. My mother was sitting at the kitchen table, hands folded over an open letter. From where I was standing I could see part of a college crest.  
我中午刚过就回来了。我母亲坐在厨房桌旁，双手叠放在一封打开的信上。从我站的地方可以看到部分大学徽章。

"I've been patient," she says, expression carved from stone. "I've given you your space. But I'm not paying for you to go to Berkeley."  
"我一直很耐心，" 她语气如石雕般冷硬，"我给了你足够的空间。但我不会出钱让你去伯克利。"

I cross my arms. "That's fine. You can keep your money. I've got all the scholarships I need."  
我交叉双臂，"那没关系。你可以留着你的钱。我已经拿到了所有需要的奖学金。"

"To do what?" She snaps and I notice her hands tense.  
"为了做什么？" 她厉声问道，我注意到她的手紧握起来。"

Inwardly, I smile. "Get a good higher education – then I'll be off to join the CIA."  
我内心微微一笑。“接受良好的高等教育——然后我就会加入中情局。”

And like that I've won. She was going to fight but she's got no leverage. Not anymore. I made sure of that. There's something else there when she leans her head against splayed fingers, shaking her head.  
就这样，我赢了。她本想反抗，但她已无任何筹码。不再有了。我确保了这一点。当她将头靠在张开的手指上，摇着头时，那里还有别的东西。

"I'm so disappointed in you, Kazuya," she says, quietly, pursing her lips as something repressed and beaten comes to the surface.  
“我对你太失望了，和也，”她轻声说道，紧抿着嘴唇，似乎有什么被压抑和击败的东西浮现出来。

"No," I murmur, my composure falling completely, scalding heat bleeding over my cheeks. "No, you don't get to be disappointed in me. That would imply you gave a damn to begin with. You're just upset that you can't control me, that I won't be your obedient little doll. I don't want to be a Metaphysics professor. I don't want to be like you. I'd rather be the fucking garbage man than some worthless professor like you."  
"不，"我低声说，镇定自若完全崩溃，滚烫的热度涌上面颊。"不，你没有资格对我失望。那意味着你一开始就他妈的在乎。你只是恼火无法控制我，我不会再做你那听话的小玩偶。我不想当形而上学教授。我不想变得像你一样。我宁愿做个该死的清洁工，也不愿像你这样无用的教授。"

There's hard, skin-splitting force behind her hand as she slaps me. It rings louder than any gunshot and has me taking a staggering step back. She'd never hit me before, not even during our nastier fights. I can taste blood from where my teeth have cut into my cheek. A hand swipes at my lips, collecting globules of crimson that spill down my fingers.  
她一巴掌扇过来，力道之大仿佛要撕裂皮肤。那声音比任何枪声都要响亮，让我踉跄后退。她以前从未打过我，即使在更激烈的争吵中也没有。我能尝到血的味道，因为我的牙齿咬破了脸颊。我用手抹去嘴唇上的血迹，鲜红的血滴顺着手指滑落。

"This is who you are," I say, low and even so the shiver in my chest doesn't rise to my voice. I turn my hand out so she can see. "You're a horrible person and I hate you."  
"这就是你的真面目，"我说，声音低沉平稳，不让胸中的颤抖传到嗓音里。我把手伸出来让她看。"你是个可怕的人，我恨你。"

My hand curls into a fist, spreading the blood into my palm. I cling to that, clutch it tight, my last lifeline to the world. The only thing that brings me any comfort and soothes my festering wounds.  
我的手紧握成拳，将血迹涂抹在掌心。我紧紧抓住这一点，握得死死的，这是我与这个世界最后的联系。唯一能带给我安慰并抚平我溃烂伤口的东西。

"I **hate** you." “我恨你。”

I remember her hands were curled in tight fists and she was trembling. I thought it was because she was angry. Now, I know it was something else entirely. I'd ripped her open like the Eva had – and she didn't want me to see just how deep the tear went.  
我记得她的双手紧握成拳，浑身颤抖。我以为她是因为生气。现在，我知道那是完全不同的原因。我像 Eva 一样撕裂了她——而她不想让我看到那伤口有多深。

Five days later, I'm all packed and ready to leave. Mother has been a specter of clacking heels and bouncing red hair. Gets up early and returns so late I don't see her. I've caught her around the house a handful of times and I'm not acknowledged in the slightest. It's like I don't exist anymore.  
五天后，我收拾好一切准备离开。母亲成了一个幽灵，高跟鞋的咔嗒声和跳跃的红发。她早起晚归，我几乎见不到她。我在家里碰到过她几次，却丝毫没有被注意到。仿佛我已经不存在了。

She's doing that today too. I know she has off from work but she's holed up in her room. She won't see me. I know it's irrational for that to bother me so much.  
她今天也这样。我知道她今天不上班，但她把自己关在房间里。她不愿见我。我知道这让我如此困扰是不合理的。

"You won't say goodbye to her?" dad asks from down the hall, giving me a wide berth. He's not even looking at me as I gather my things by the door, just stares low at the wall.  
“你不跟她道别吗？”爸爸从走廊那头问我，刻意与我保持距离。我收拾门口的东西时，他甚至没看我一眼，只是低头盯着墙。

That draws out a hollow laugh, a twisted smile. "Like she cares. She's probably glad to get rid of me. I'm just a burden, after all." I sneer the last part, knowing I'm close enough to their room for her to hear me.  
这话引出一阵空洞的笑声，扭曲的微笑。“好像她在乎似的。她大概巴不得甩掉我。毕竟，我只是个负担。”我冷笑着说出最后那部分，知道我离他们的房间够近，她能听见。

"You can't understand," he says, taking away my petty triumph. I pause by my suitcase, glaring up at him. "You'll never understand."  
"你无法理解，"他说着，夺走了我那微不足道的胜利。我停在我的行李箱旁，怒视着他。"你永远不会理解。"

It isn't said with anger, more a tone of pity, even regret, which just makes it worse. Demeaning. He was talking about my mother of course. In the moment, I was too blinded to see that.  
这话并非带着愤怒，更多的是一种怜悯，甚至是遗憾的语气，这反而更让人难受。贬低人。他当然是在谈论我的母亲。那一刻，我被愤怒蒙蔽了双眼，未能看清这一点。

"I don't _want_ to understand you," I say, hauling up the few belongings I've decided to bring. I was young. Too young and too angry. The suitcase zips up, everything double and triple checked.  
"我不想理解你，"我说，拖起我决定带走的少数物品。那时我还年轻。太年轻，也太愤怒。行李箱拉上了拉链，所有东西都反复检查了好几遍。

Dad takes a few hesitant steps closer. "Your room will still be here."  
爸爸犹豫地向前走了几步。“你的房间还会在这里。”

"Why? Get rid of that stuff. I'm not coming back."  
“为什么？把那些东西处理掉。我不会回来了。”

He clamps his mouth shut, nothing left to say. What the hell did he expect? Why does he care all of a sudden?  
他紧紧闭上嘴，无话可说。他到底期待什么？为什么突然这么在意？

_"I'm here son. I'm right here. You're okay."  
"我在这里，儿子。我就在这儿。你没事的。"_

I will him to keep his feet where they are. I don't want him to try and hug me. I don't want him anywhere near me. Not so long as I live. He stays put and out of the corner of my eye I find that plaque with the Tokyo-3 towers.  
我让他保持原地不动。我不希望他试图拥抱我。我不希望他靠近我。只要我还活着，就不行。他站定不动，我用眼角余光瞥见了那块带有第三新东京市塔的牌匾。

"This picture is a lie," I say, a flash of anger taking me, reaching my hand out to tear that frame off the wall. "Just like this family."  
"这张照片是假的，"我说，一阵愤怒涌上心头，伸手去撕掉墙上的相框。"就像这个家庭一样。"

I toss it, gravity doing the rest and sending glass and wood splintering across the hallway. I fling the front door open, stepping out into the bright, warm noon light. I'm finally leaving. I'm free. I march down that driveway, taking strength from my resolve and my determination.  
我一扔，重力接手，玻璃和木屑四溅在走廊上。我猛地推开前门，踏入明亮温暖的正午阳光中。我终于要离开了。我自由了。我大步走下车道，从我的决心和意志中汲取力量。

I'm free. 我自由了。

A weight lifting off my shoulders as I walked, leaving that dark house behind, I looked back, just once. The door was still open, where my father stood staring at the broken picture gathered up in his hands.  
当我走出门，离开那阴暗的房子，肩上的重担仿佛卸下了，我回头看了一眼。门还开着，父亲站在那里，手里捧着破碎的相框，目光呆滞。

_"That boy never did come back."  
那个男孩再也没有回来。_

### Chapter 10: December 5

Nobody wins in a war.  
战争中无人能胜。

Least of all the soldiers who are sent to fight it.  
尤其是那些被派去作战的士兵。

I glance at my mother's wrist as she bends to set her carry on down. The wrist with the long white scar.  
我瞥了一眼母亲弯腰放下手提行李时的手腕，那只带有长长白色疤痕的手腕。

I tried counting all of them once. Most of those faded marks intersect, blurring together into strips of bleached skin. Thirty-five. Not including the razor thin incisions at her wrists. The Angel War, in three weeks time, will have come to an end forty years ago. She'll never tell me what happened, that much I'll have to accept. She won't lie to me like when I was younger, but it will always be another part of her only my father knows. He was right. I'll never understand.  
我曾尝试数过所有这些疤痕。大多数淡去的痕迹相互交错，模糊成一片片褪色的皮肤。三十五处。不包括她手腕上那些细如刀割的痕迹。天使之战，三周后，将在四十年前结束。她永远不会告诉我发生了什么，这一点我必须接受。她不会像我小时候那样对我撒谎，但这将永远是她的一部分，只有我父亲知道。他是对的。我永远不会理解。

Would it really bring me any peace if I could comprehend it? Do I really want to know how that final battle played out? There are other ways to find the answers I want. I'm just not sure if I want to know what could drive someone as seemingly strong-willed as my mother to hurt herself.  
如果我能理解这一切，真的会给我带来平静吗？我真的想知道那场最终战役是如何进行的吗？还有其他方法可以找到我想要的答案。我只是不确定自己是否想知道是什么驱使像我母亲这样看似意志坚强的人伤害自己。

_"There was a battle... and I lost."  
“曾经有一场战斗……而我输了。”_

The temp dropped hard last night and the snowfall is still coming down in thick sheets. The roads are absolute chaos. Snow trucks struggle to push all of it clear, causing blockages in traffic all along the highways, made all the worse by reduced speed limits and vigilant state troopers. It's going to take a lot of time and road-side bullying to get back home.  
昨晚气温骤降，大雪依旧纷飞，厚厚的雪片不断落下。道路上一片混乱。除雪车艰难地清理着积雪，导致高速公路上交通堵塞，加之限速和警觉的州警巡逻，情况更加糟糕。要回家，恐怕得花上不少时间和在路上连哄带骗了。

For now, we're in the crowded shelter of Reagan airport. I hug my mother this time, grip her tight. So she knows for sure that I really do love her. I have to let her know, before she goes, that at least I still care about her.  
眼下，我们躲在里根机场拥挤的避难所里。这次我紧紧拥抱了母亲，用力抓住她。这样她就能确信我真的爱她。我必须在母亲离开前让她知道，至少我还在乎她。

"Give Misato my best," I say as we part.  
“代我向美里问好，”我们分别时我说道。

Mother huffs. "Of course. You know, she always talks about how the bar just isn't the same without you starting fights over pool."  
母亲哼了一声。“当然。你知道吗，她总是说起自从你不在酒吧里为台球打架后，那地方就再也不一样了。”

I muster a small smile, waiting for one of us to say something over the din of the airport. I don't know if we accomplished much of anything with this trip. I don't know if we've healed. But then you don't fix scars, do you?  
我勉强挤出一个微笑，在机场的喧嚣中等待着我们中的某个人开口。我不知道这次旅行我们是否真的达成了什么。我不知道我们是否已经愈合。但疤痕是无法修复的，不是吗？

"Listen..." Mother says, serious – piercing me with that level stare of hers. "A lot happened back when I was a pilot. That's not the reason I never talked about it," she pauses to search my face, as if taking me in for the first time, brand new to her world all over again. Her gaze strays from mine and she brushes flecks of snow from my shoulders. "I just found something else to be proud of."  
“听着……”母亲认真地说道，用她那锐利的目光直视着我。“当我还是一名飞行员时，发生了很多事。但这并不是我从未提及的原因，”她停顿了一下，仔细打量我的脸，仿佛第一次真正认识我，重新进入她的世界。她的目光从我身上移开，轻轻拂去我肩上的雪花。“我只是找到了其他值得骄傲的东西。”

She picks up her carry on and we don't hug again, saying quiet goodbyes instead. I approach the big floor-to-ceiling windows by the terminal, where I watch her plane for the next hour as it loads up, pulls away and rolls out onto the tarmac.  
她拿起手提行李，我们没有再次拥抱，而是轻声道别。我走到航站楼旁的大落地窗前，接下来的一个小时里，我看着她的飞机装载、驶离，然后滑行到停机坪上。

Found something else to be proud of. That's only a half truth.  
找到了另一件值得骄傲的事。但这只说对了一半。

My mother didn't want to remember her time in the war, still doesn't want to. I think of that photo album again and on some level, I feel like I can understand, seeing her as I have this past week. Since the war and since the camps, she just wanted to make new, happy memories with me and my dad. All the ugliness in her past just wasn't important when she had us.  
我母亲不想回忆她在战争中的时光，至今依然不想。我又想起了那本相册，在某种程度上，我似乎能理解她，尤其是过去这一周我所见到的她。自从战争和集中营之后，她只想和我以及爸爸一起创造新的、快乐的记忆。当她拥有我们时，过去的所有丑陋都不再重要了。

Things turned out pretty ugly anyway, didn't they?  
事情最终还是变得相当糟糕，不是吗？

At home, I decide to hop on the net and end up staring at the searchbar for what feels like ages. My fingers tap the keys but don't input anything, an intent lurking somewhere behind those joints. My father's breakdown over the phone yesterday is still fresh. Still boils in my stomach. Fear. Too smothering and heavy. The war and its entirety is open to me here.  
回到家，我决定上网，结果盯着搜索栏发呆了好久。手指敲打着键盘，却什么也没输入，关节背后似乎隐藏着某种意图。昨天父亲在电话里的崩溃依然历历在目。依然在我胃里翻腾。恐惧。太过压抑和沉重。战争及其全部真相就在这里向我敞开。

I have to look. I can't shut it away anymore. I have to at least try to come to terms with it. These past few days have had my brain doing flips, and these new, conflicted feelings towards my father and my childhood haven't helped. If I don't try to get past this, I'll just be stuck in the same place I've always been.  
我必须去了解。我不能再逃避了。至少得尝试去接受它。过去几天里，我的大脑一直在翻江倒海，对父亲和童年的这些新出现的矛盾情感也没有任何帮助。如果我不试着克服这一点，我将永远停留在原地，一如往常。

I start by looking up the ship my father mentioned, the USS _Rainbow_.  
我首先查找父亲提到的船只，USS Rainbow。

The first result is an old battleship. Commissioned in 1901 and decommed in 1925. Definitely not the right one. Under it is a picture of the _John C. Stennis_ carrier with a rainbow arching over it. _Next_.  
第一个结果是一艘旧战舰。1901 年服役，1925 年退役。显然不是这艘。下面是一张约翰·C·斯坦尼斯号航母的照片，上方有一道彩虹拱形。下一个。

The USS _Over the Rainbow._ Nimitz class supercarrier. Commissioned May 27th 1975 – decommissioned October 12th 2038. This has to be it. I follow the link, its long history just a blur of black lines as I scroll through.  
USS Over the Rainbow。尼米兹级超级航母。1975 年 5 月 27 日服役——2038 年 10 月 12 日退役。一定是这艘了。我点击链接，它的漫长历史在我滚动浏览时只是一片模糊的黑线。

Then I find it. The Eva.  
然后我找到了它。那台 Eva。

Someone took a picture from the flight deck and I'm surprised the photographer didn't break their neck just looking up at it. The foot of the red machine is right down next to the conning tower, the rest of it taking up the entirety of the shot and nearly blotting out the sun.  
有人从飞行甲板上拍下了这张照片，我惊讶于摄影师抬头看它时竟然没有扭断脖子。红色机体的脚部紧挨着指挥塔，其余部分占据了整个画面，几乎遮住了太阳。

The half-imagined shadows of my nightmares take a defined shape and color. It's not just crazy hallucinations or muttered ramblings anymore. In a moment it turns real, bright red and rigid with black, orange and white accents, heavy and powerful. It's nothing like the monsters I used to imagine – with its huge armored leg, upper structure adorned in thick red plating. Undeniably a machine, with its narrow waist, long legs and broad shoulders mounted with tall pauldrons. I can hear the mechanisms whirl and the metal groan. The source tag under the photo identifies it as Unit-02. My mother's Eva. A combat-tailored model built in Germany. The articles go on to talk about the pilots, mentioning a boy named Shinji Ikari.  
我噩梦中半虚构的阴影此刻有了明确的形状和色彩。不再是疯狂的幻觉或胡言乱语。转眼间，它变得真实，鲜红而坚硬，点缀着黑、橙和白色，沉重而强大。它与我过去想象的怪物截然不同——巨大的装甲腿，上部结构覆盖着厚重的红色装甲板。无疑是一台机器，细腰、长腿、宽肩上装着高耸的肩甲。我能听到机械的旋转声和金属的呻吟声。照片下的标签显示它是 02 号机。我母亲的 Eva。一架在德国制造的战斗定制型号。文章继续谈论着驾驶员，提到了一个名叫碇真嗣的男孩。

I fall into the Angel War, sticking with the pictures – what few there are. I'm not ready to read about it in much detail. I can already feel the jitters in my hand. No anxiety pills. It's so stupid, getting worked up just because of some old pictures. But if panic attacks were reasonable, tangible things to deal with, people might not need medication in the first place.  
我陷入了天使战争的资料中，只敢浏览那些图片——虽然数量寥寥。我还没准备好深入阅读细节。我的手已经开始颤抖。没有抗焦虑药。真是愚蠢，仅仅因为一些旧照片就如此紧张。但如果恐慌发作是合理且可处理的实体事物，人们或许根本不需要药物。

I don't find any pictures of her, none that aren't of the MIT professor Soryu. The world comes into sharp focus when I scroll over the dated image of a young boy, far too young to be the man I know. But I'd recognize those eyes anywhere.  
我没有找到任何她的照片，除了那些麻省理工教授草薙的照片。当我滚动到一张标注日期的男孩照片时，世界突然变得清晰起来，他太年轻，不可能是我所认识的那个人。但我一眼就能认出那双眼睛。

It's a bit unnerving to realize the entire world has access to pictures of my father when he was younger, while I have none. Well, pictures is inaccurate. There's just one. An old school photo of him when he was thirteen, wearing some black button-up uniform. There's something hidden behind that flat expression. A flurry of something, deeper and darker than any underwater chasm. It wasn't the Angel War that haunted him back then. It was something else, something older.  
意识到全世界都能看到我父亲年轻时的照片，而我却一张也没有，这有点令人不安。好吧，说照片不准确。其实只有一张。是他十三岁时的学校旧照，穿着一件黑色纽扣制服。在那平静的表情背后隐藏着什么。一种纷乱的东西，比任何深海裂缝都要深邃和黑暗。当时困扰他的并非天使战争，而是其他更古老的东西。

I've never really stopped to think about it before, just how old they were. It's funny how something so significant can just go over your head, even when it's right in front of you. My parents being in their fifties, that means they were born in the early two-thousands. Two-thousand and one, exactly.  
我以前从未真正停下来思考过，他们到底有多老。有趣的是，如此重要的事情竟然会从你头上溜走，即使它就摆在你面前。我的父母五十多岁，这意味着他们出生于二十一世纪初。确切地说，是二〇〇一年。

My parents were fourteen when they fought in the Angel War. At least my dad was. Mom was only thirteen. They were just kids.  
我的父母在十四岁时参加了天使战争。至少我爸爸是。妈妈那时才十三岁。他们还只是孩子。

I exit the page. 我退出了页面。

He was just fourteen when Third Impact happened.  
他才十四岁，第三次冲击就发生了。

I've been scared of the war since I can remember. I didn't fight it like my father, but the pieces of it he brought back were more than I ever wanted to experience. I never wanted anything to do with it, just wanted to cover it up and forget like my mother.  
自我记事起，我就一直害怕战争。我没有像我父亲那样去战斗，但他带回家的那些战争碎片，比我想要经历的要多得多。我从未想过要参与其中，只是想掩盖它，像我母亲那样遗忘。

When I was little, real little, we used to play hide and seek – only when mom wasn't home, otherwise she'd be in a foul mood the rest of the night. Home time for mother involved peace and quiet with a book, or passing out on the couch face first so it set her reading glasses crooked on her face.  
我小时候，真的很小的时候，我们经常玩捉迷藏——只有在妈妈不在家的时候，否则她会整晚心情不好。妈妈在家的时候，喜欢安静地看书，或者脸朝下倒在沙发上，把她的阅读眼镜压歪在脸上。

"I'm the best hider in the world," dad would say. "You'll never find me."  
"我是世界上最会躲的人，"爸爸常说。"你永远找不到我。"

It was a challenge – and I was not one to back down. Not ever. I'd always find him by a big toe, sticking out from under a curtain. Or the top of his head peaking up from behind the couch. A pinky finger poking out of a doorway. He always left me little clues.  
这是个挑战——而我从不退缩。从未。我总能通过他露在窗帘下的一只大脚趾，或是从沙发后探出的头顶找到他。还有从门缝里伸出的粉红小指。他总是给我留下小小的线索。

_I found you, dad. 我找到你了，爸爸。_

Maybe I'd never lost him. Maybe I'd just stopped looking. It was easier than floundering in that wide ocean between us.  
或许我从未真正失去他。或许我只是停止了寻找。比起在那片横亘在我们之间的汪洋中挣扎，这样更容易些。

The following days drag out in long tendrils, mimicking the bloated trails of exhaust left behind by the airplanes screeching over Washington. I can't think, can't focus. Work and faking human interaction becomes more of a chore than usual. Carrie notices – and shuts off from me. No one wants to deal with a person who carries around so much weight, especially when they know how heavy it can be. Serious emotions aren't something you confront or deal with. You just bury them away and pretend nothing is wrong. Except I'm starting to slip and it exudes itself in this invisible aura. Everyone keeps a quiet distance.  
接下来的日子拖得漫长，像飞机在华盛顿上空尖啸而过留下的臃肿尾迹。我无法思考，无法集中注意力。工作和假装与人互动变得比平时更加繁琐。嘉莉注意到了——并开始疏远我。没有人愿意和一个背负如此沉重负担的人打交道，尤其是当他们知道这负担有多重时。严肃的情感不是你面对或处理的东西。你只是把它们埋起来，假装一切正常。只是我开始有些失控，这种情绪化形成了一种无形的气场。每个人都保持安静的距离。

Marina knows my schedule and packs her things while I'm gone. She even leaves the key behind. No note, just empty spaces, like she never existed. I may as well have imagined her this whole time. I don't let myself miss her. That's a right I don't deserve. My inbox piles up, more than I've ever let it in the past year. I take double what I'm supposed to for my anti-nightmare pills, but they don't help much. Somehow all of it bleeds through, soaking everything in sweat – more than my dreams have in years. I can't even be bothered to make coffee in the morning and end up buying that pumped together crap from the cafe down the street.  
玛丽娜知道我的日程，趁我不在时收拾好她的东西，甚至连钥匙都留下了。没有字条，只有空荡荡的空间，仿佛她从未存在过。或许这段时间我一直在幻想她。我不允许自己想念她，那是我不配拥有的权利。我的收件箱堆积如山，比过去一年里的任何时候都多。我服用了双倍的抗噩梦药片，但效果甚微。不知怎的，一切都渗透进来，让一切都被汗水浸透——比多年来我的梦境还要多。早上我甚至懒得煮咖啡，最终还是去街角的咖啡馆买了那种机器调制的劣质咖啡。

Another day passes before I decide to call my father.  
又过了一天，我才决定给父亲打电话。

The line connects after the first ring, catching me off guard. I was hoping he might not pick up again. My foot explores the bumps of the warped linoleum in the kitchen that maintenance keeps blowing off.  
电话在第一声响后就接通了，让我措手不及。我本希望他可能再次不接电话。我的脚在厨房里探索着翘起的油毡地板上的凸起，维修人员总是对此置之不理。

"So mom made it home okay and everything?" I ask after we trade hellos. One of those stupid questions you ask when you don't know what the hell else to say.  
"所以妈妈安全到家了，一切都好吗？" 我们互相问候后，我问道。这种愚蠢的问题，当你不知道该说些什么鬼话时就会问出口。

"Yeah," dad sighs, "put herself right back to work."  
"嗯，" 爸爸叹了口气，"她立刻又投入工作了。"

"Of course." I shake my head. It's always been her escape. If her and dad were fighting over pills or bills, she'd take on extra hours at the lab, get lost in whatever research she was doing at the time. I guess she needed that time away from my father, away from us.  
"当然。" 我摇了摇头。这向来是她的逃避方式。如果她和爸爸因为药片或账单争吵，她就会在实验室加班，沉浸在她当时正在做的研究中。我想她需要那段时间远离父亲，远离我们。

My father's thinking the same thing. "I don't think she'd know what to do with herself if she wasn't working."  
我父亲也是这么想的。“我觉得如果她不工作，都不知道该怎么打发时间。”

The Kazuya from a couple of weeks ago would have been furious, livid at his plaintive tone. What right did he have to talk that way about her when he doesn't even work? Just gets by on VA disability checks he doesn't deserve. The two weeks ago Kazuya might have lashed out, if he was pumped up with enough medicated courage. Not now. I can't even get the strength to feel much resentment anymore. Talking is taxing enough, but somehow needed. I know that much.  
几周前的和也可能会暴跳如雷，对他的哀怨语气怒不可遏。他有什么资格那样说她，他自己连工作都没有？只是靠着不该得的退伍军人伤残补助金过活。两周前的和也可能会在药物壮胆下爆发，但现在不行了。我连感到怨恨的力气都没有了。说话已经够费劲了，但不知为何又是必要的。这一点我还是知道的。

I used to be blind to the destructive ways my mother dealt with things when I was younger, never really acknowledging it until I was older and moving out. It was always dad's fault. He was the one who couldn't forget. He was the one making us miserable. Try as she might, my mother couldn't deal with it as well as she thought, leaving us both helpless in the end.  
我年轻时对母亲处理问题的方式所带来的破坏性影响视而不见，直到长大离家后才真正意识到。总是父亲的错。他是那个无法释怀的人。他是让我们痛苦的原因。尽管母亲尽力而为，但她处理得并不如自己所想的那样好，最终我们俩都无助地陷入了困境。

"So... how are you feeling today?" I ask, having let the line slip into silence just a little too long. The couch swallows me as I collapse in it.  
"那么...你今天感觉怎么样？" 我问道，不知不觉中让电话那头陷入了过长的沉默。我瘫倒在沙发上，仿佛被它吞没。

"Fine... I'm sorry, about–"  
"还好...对不起，关于–"

"Forget it," I say, a little too forceful. As is becoming normal, the line falls into a buzzing drone. Not talking is just how we've learned to deal with one another, I suppose.  
"别提了，" 我语气稍显强硬地说。电话中再次陷入嗡嗡的杂音，沉默不语似乎成了我们习惯的相处方式。

"I, uh..." I stutter, catching myself when I realize I'm biting at my nails. Sitting on my hand is only marginally better. "I looked up that ship. It was actually the USS _Over the Rainbow_."  
"呃，我..." 我结巴着，意识到自己在咬指甲时及时停了下来。把手放在身下只是稍微好一点。"我查了那艘船。实际上是彩虹之上的 USS 号。"

He grunts, a tired attempt at a laugh. "Funny name for a battleship."  
他咕哝了一声，试图用疲惫的笑声掩饰。"战舰有这么滑稽的名字。"

"That was how you and mom first met, right?"  
"那不就是你和妈妈第一次相遇的地方吗？"

"It was our first sortie together too," he says, without a second thought. "Fifth Angel attacked, sank a lot of ships before we were able to deploy." There's nothing restrained behind his tone this time, nothing holding him back. He goes on to recount how my mother dragged him over to the cargo ship trailing along with the fleet, just to show off her Eva. There are so many questions I want to ask – too many. I bite them all back. I don't want him to shutdown again.  
"这也是我们第一次共同出击，"他毫不犹豫地说道，"第五使徒来袭，在我们部署之前就击沉了许多船只。"这一次，他的语气中没有任何克制，没有任何保留。他继续讲述我母亲是如何拽着他来到跟随舰队的货船上，只为炫耀她的 Eva。我有太多问题想问——太多了。我咬紧牙关，把它们全都咽了回去。我不想让他再次沉默。

All the same, I can't sit anymore and start pacing by the couch. When he pauses, I decide it's as good a time as any to chime in. "I saw a picture of mom's Eva... was yours there?"  
尽管如此，我再也坐不住了，开始在沙发旁踱步。当他停顿时，我决定这是个插话的好时机。"我见过妈妈 Eva 的照片……你的也在那儿吗？"

"No, I went into your mother's with her. They had it outfitted with B-Type equipment, though. Wouldn't work in water, just lock up – shut down all motor systems."  
"没有，我和你母亲一起进入了她的 Eva。不过它配备了 B 型装备，虽然不能在水下工作，只会锁定——关闭所有动力系统。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Just wasn't made for it. They were designed to be land-based intercept systems. The Angel had us between its teeth after we fell in the ocean."  
“天生就不适合。它们原本设计用于陆基拦截系统。我们坠入海洋后，那只天使就把我们咬在嘴里了。”

The Angel? Teeth? "What did it look like?" I ask, head quirking when I realize I don't actually know what an Angel is. Don't have a single clear image of one in my head. They're more or less great big indistinct blobs. It's embarrassing. I should know better than anyone, shouldn't I?  
“天使？牙齿？它长什么样？”我问道，当我意识到自己其实并不知道天使是什么时，头微微一偏。我脑海中没有一个清晰的形象，它们或多或少都是些模糊的大块头。这挺尴尬的。我应该比任何人都清楚，不是吗？

"Sure as hell didn't have wings or a halo," dad says, a bit defensive. His voice is hard now. He doesn't want to talk about the war anymore. I don't press him.  
“当然没有翅膀或光环，”爸爸有些防备地说，语气变得强硬。他不想再谈论战争了。我也没再追问。

So I try a different approach. "Do you, um... do you have any of that in your book?"  
于是我尝试换个方式。“你，呃... 你书里有没有那种内容？”

"Book?" he bumbles, testing the word. I can hear him scratching at his chin.  
“书？”他结巴着，试探这个词。我能听到他在挠下巴。

"Yeah, I mean... I remember you were always writing on your computer. I guess I always thought you were putting a book together or something."  
“是的，我是说... 我记得你总是在电脑上写东西。我猜我一直以为你在整理一本书之类的。”

I can see him nodding as he says, "Autobiography, but... it's not important. No one wants to read that."  
我看到他点头说道：“自传，但是……不重要。没人想读那个。”

Probably waves his hand at the air too. I shrug. My nails look very enticing. "I might."  
可能还对着空气挥了挥手。我耸耸肩。我的指甲看起来很诱人。“我可能会读。”

"It isn't finished." “它还没完成。”

"Well, how much more do you have to do?"  
“那么，你还有多少要做？”

A loud sigh crackles over the phone and I hear him shift. He's getting frustrated now, but when he talks again, it's steady – if not begrudging. "Last year, docs diagnosed me with the early stages of Dementia, not sure which kind. Brain damage they said, from all the pills. I'm having trouble remembering a lot of things now. So it doesn't matter, the book won't get finished."  
电话那头传来一声沉重的叹息，我听到他在移动。他现在变得不耐烦了，但当他再次开口时，语气却平稳——尽管有些勉强。“去年，医生诊断我处于痴呆早期，不确定是哪种类型。他们说是药物导致的脑损伤。我现在记不住很多事情了。所以无所谓了，这本书完不成了。”

I wish his tone wasn't so flippant, so dismissive with this railgun cracking revelation. "Mom didn't say anything..."  
我希望他的语气不要这么轻率，不要这么轻易地否定这个重磅消息。“妈妈什么都没说……”

"That's because she doesn't know... and that's the way it's going to stay," he says, a little more patient. Then he laughs and it's bitter. "'_Just something else you'll never finish._' That's what she said when I first started it. Guess she was right. Usually is."  
"那是因为她不知道...而且事情就会这样保持下去，" 他说，语气稍微耐心了一些。然后他笑了，却是苦涩的。"'只是另一件你永远完成不了的事。' 那是我刚开始时她说的。猜她是对的。通常都是。"

I want to say 'sorry' or 'I didn't know', but really, anything I could say would simply be far too inadequate – meaningless. He doesn't want an empty apology. I don't know what he wants. What the hell do you say to your estranged father who's just admitted he has Dementia?  
我想说'对不起'或者'我不知道'，但事实上，任何我能说的话都太过不足——毫无意义。他不需要空洞的道歉。我不知道他想要什么。面对一个刚刚承认自己患有痴呆症的疏远父亲，你该说什么鬼话？

He sighs again. "If you really want to do some reading, try a book called Impact. It was written by Harry Kearsarge, colleague of your mother's."  
他又叹了口气。"如果你真的想读点什么，试试一本叫《冲击》的书。作者是哈里·基尔萨奇，你母亲的同事。"

"Sure, sure," I mumble, still grappling with the news. Can I even be sure that he has it? What if it's a misdiagnosis? He sounds pretty certain. I wonder what type it is, but it really doesn't matter. Either way it's something degenerative and incurable. His brain will slowly rot away until he can't remember us anymore. Until he forgets how to write or read or talk. His body will shutdown because his brain is dying piece by piece. There's medication and ways to make it less severe – but one way or another my father is going to die in a hospital bed someday, wondering who the woman and young man at his bedside are. And he's only 54. Hard for it to be anything other than all the pills, especially if he really did almost OD a few years ago like mom says.  
"“当然，当然，”我咕哝着，依旧难以接受这个消息。我能确定他真的得了吗？会不会是误诊？他听起来非常肯定。我不知道是什么类型的，但其实这并不重要。无论如何，这都是一种退化且无法治愈的疾病。他的大脑会慢慢腐烂，直到他不再记得我们。直到他忘记如何写作、阅读或说话。他的身体会因为大脑一点点死亡而停止运作。有药物和方法可以减轻症状——但无论如何，我的父亲总有一天会躺在医院的病床上，不知道他床边的女人和年轻人是谁。而他才 54 岁。这很难不让人联想到那些药丸，特别是如果他真的像妈妈说的那样，几年前差点过量服用。”

I'd always prayed to God to make my father better. To make it so he wouldn't remember the war anymore.  
我总是祈祷上帝能让我的父亲好起来。让他不再记得战争。

What a cruel son-of-a-bitch.  
真是个残忍的混蛋。

I want to ask him how far along it's progressed. He said early stages, so I guess that means he could have anywhere from six to ten years before it gets really bad. There's something else I need to know first.  
我想问他病情进展到什么程度了。他说还在早期阶段，所以我猜这意味着他可能还有六到十年的时间才会变得很糟糕。在此之前，我还有别的事情需要了解。

"Dad... do you want me to call you again tomorrow?"  
“爸……你想让我明天再给你打电话吗？”

He grunts, yet I think there's a smile in his voice. "Do you _want_ to call me?"  
他咕哝了一声，但我觉得他的声音里带着笑意。“你想给我打电话吗？”

"I'll take a look at the book."  
我会看看那本书。

### Interlude X

My father's infatuation with his garden began roughly around the same time as his episodes. He'd never bothered to take care of the house or our lawn beforehand, caught up surviving at his job with the news agency before they fired him.  
我父亲对花园的痴迷大约始于他的病情发作之时。在那之前，他从未费心打理过房子或草坪，一直忙于新闻机构的工作，直到被解雇。

It started with a bougainvillea, which is just as evil as its name looks. The thing was covered with inch long needle-sharp thorns to protect the leathery vines that grew flowers the prettiest shade of purple, hiding its true nature to any outsider. Growing to disproportionate sizes in mere weeks – its stalks bulged more than a pro-wrestler's 'roided arm – it wasted no time trying to consume our house. No matter how many times my father clipped away at it, the vines would come back twice as long and twice as vicious.  
一切始于一株三角梅，正如其名所示，它同样邪恶。这植物浑身长满了寸许长的针状尖刺，保护着那些生长着最美丽紫花的坚韧藤蔓，对外人隐藏其真实本性。它以惊人的速度生长，短短几周内便变得异常庞大——茎干膨胀得比职业摔跤手的肌肉还要夸张——毫不犹豫地试图吞噬我们的房子。无论父亲修剪多少次，藤蔓总会以双倍的长度和凶猛卷土重来。

It was left behind when we moved, of course. Then in Flagstaff he planted those pointed orange things that look like cranes with neon plumes, which never really took well to the climate. Not like the flamevine that just as greedily consumed everything it touched like the bougainvillea, thankfully lacking any nasty fangs. After we finally settled in Tucson, my father decided to give up on the weeds and any of the more tropical shrubs for good. Our backyard in Catalina went from a barren wasteland to a hub of little crops for radishes, carrots, cabbages, tomatoes – if you can think of it, we probably had it. If my father wasn't in his room, he was out in his garden.  
当然，这是我们搬家时留下的。后来在弗拉格斯塔夫，他种了那些尖尖的橙色植物，看起来像带着霓虹羽冠的鹤，但它们并不适应那里的气候。不像火焰藤那样贪婪地吞噬着所触及的一切，幸好没有那些讨厌的尖刺。最终我们在图森安顿下来后，父亲决定彻底放弃那些杂草和更热带的灌木。我们在卡塔利娜的后院从一片荒芜之地变成了小农作物的中心，有萝卜、胡萝卜、卷心菜、西红柿——只要你能想到的，我们大概都有。如果父亲不在他的房间里，那他一定在花园里。

For a time I was jealous of those plants, who had somehow managed to garner more attention from my father than I ever could – no matter how many temper tantrums I threw when I was younger.  
有一段时间，我嫉妒那些植物，它们不知怎么地赢得了父亲比我能得到的更多的关注——无论我小时候发了多少次脾气。

"Why's dad like gardening so much?" I asked one day while helping my mother with the dishes. She looked up to the window where I was watching him from, a far away, but warm expression gracing her usually hard and stoic exterior.  
“为什么爸爸这么喜欢园艺？”有一天我帮妈妈洗碗时问道。她抬头看向窗户，我从那里看着他，她的脸上露出了平时坚硬而沉默的外表下少见的遥远而温暖的表情。

"Only one way to find out," she said, touching my back for a light push.  
“只有一种方法能找到答案，”她说着，轻轻碰了碰我的背，给了我一个轻推。

So outside I went. 于是我走了出去。

Frau had passed away not too long ago and I hadn't been going out into the hills so much since then. My room, cushioned with with the music from the player I'd received at ten, was far more appealing. Her grave was lost somewhere in the sprawls of trees and trellises, or so I liked to think. I knew exactly where that spot was. I'd dragged her there.  
弗劳不久前去世了，从那以后我就不怎么去山上了。我的房间里，播放着我十岁时收到的音乐播放器的音乐，显得格外舒适。她的墓地迷失在树木和藤架的蔓延之中，或者我是这么认为的。我其实清楚地知道那个地方在哪里。是我把她拖到那里的。

I was barefoot while walking across the hard, pebble riddled dirt, trying to find where my father had disappeared to. He was kneeling by the roses, hands going about their careful work. He allotted extra care to those glowing crimson buds. Those and the lilacs. Mother's favorite. There was always a vase of them sitting on our kitchen table. Beside me were bushels of pink-red and purple flowers, which may as well have been giant fuzz pillows from afar.  
我赤脚走在坚硬、布满小石子的泥土上，试图寻找父亲消失的地方。他正跪在玫瑰丛旁，双手小心翼翼地忙碌着。他对那些闪耀着深红色光芒的花蕾格外关照。那些和丁香花，都是母亲的最爱。我们的厨房桌上总是摆着一束。我身边堆满了粉红和紫色的花束，从远处看，它们就像巨大的绒毛枕头。

"Do you like the azaleas?" I jumped at my father's voice. He was staring at me and the flowers called my attention back, absorbing me in their light. I shook my head anyway and he grunted, a half-smirk poking at his mouth. Pink and purple weren't boy colors. He didn't care.  
“你喜欢杜鹃花吗？”父亲的声音让我吓了一跳。他盯着我，以及那些吸引我注意力的花朵，让我沉浸在它们的光彩中。我还是摇了摇头，他哼了一声，嘴角露出一丝半笑。粉红和紫色不是男孩的颜色。他并不在意。

"Be careful," he said as I reached a hand out, taking a knee beside me. "Their leaves and nectar are toxic."  
“小心点，”当我伸手去触摸时，他说道，同时跪在我身边。“它们的叶子和花蜜是有毒的。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"It's just how they protect themselves," he said, hands reaching between the open, bell-shaped buds to snap off dead stalks. "In China, they call it the 'thinking of home bush'. They'll be in bloom all over Japan this time of year."  
"这只是它们保护自己的方式，"他说着，双手伸进开放的钟形花苞间，折断枯萎的茎秆。"在中国，人们称之为'思乡树'。这个季节，日本各地都会开满这种花。"

_The homeland_. Over the ocean there was a half flooded series of long islands, sunken and bombed out cities left over from a forgotten era. Were its beaches like those in Panama, rough but brushed with the touch of the sea and the roar of the winds? Were its mountains green and thick with summer musk, or scorching and dusty like Arizona?  
故土。越过大洋，有一串半淹没的长岛，沉没的、被炸毁的城市遗迹，来自一个被遗忘的时代。它的海滩是否像巴拿马那样，粗糙却带着海风的轻抚和风的咆哮？它的山脉是绿意盎然、充满夏日麝香，还是像亚利桑那那样炎热而尘土飞扬？

"Here," father said, handing me his old pair of clippers. "It's your job to take care of them now, okay?" Some rust had spotted the blades and the rubber on the handles was worn away to the rough metal underneath. He _never_ let mom take care of anything in his garden. He saved that for me.  
"给，"父亲说着，递给我他那副旧剪刀。"现在照顾它们是你的任务了，好吗？"剪刀刃上有些锈迹，手柄上的橡胶已经磨损，露出了下面的粗糙金属。他从不让妈妈打理他的花园。他把这个任务留给了我。

The backyard became a world in and of itself – separate from the house and my father's episodes. They didn't exist out there, not that I ever saw. They couldn't find us amidst the rich yellow plywood and cool, coffee brown dirt. The radiance of the flowers kept all of that at bay.  
后院自成一个世界——与房子和我父亲的那些发作隔离开来。在那里，我从未见过他们的存在。他们无法在丰富的黄色胶合板和凉爽的咖啡色泥土中找到我们。花朵的光辉将所有那些隔绝在外。

He was planting watermelons that year and we had to wait long months for the vines to wander and grow their bulbous fruits. Most of our time was spent with our fingers dipping into the soil, caking dirt under our nails and ripping out weeds that looked deceptively similar to the watermelon's budding vines.  
那年他在种西瓜，我们得等上漫长的几个月，让藤蔓蔓延生长，结出圆滚滚的果实。大部分时间，我们用手指插进土壤，指甲下积满泥土，拔除那些看似与西瓜嫩藤极为相似的杂草。

"There's nothing more satisfying than helping something grow," my father had said, letting me water them for the first time. The melons had bloated to juicy plump orbs, their vines curling and thick. "Someone showed me once, all before you were born. It took me a long time to understand."  
“没有什么比帮助某物成长更令人满足的了，”父亲曾说，让我第一次给它们浇水。西瓜已经膨胀成多汁的圆球，藤蔓卷曲而粗壮。“有人在我出生前就教过我这一切。我花了很长时间才理解。”

Just like Aunt Misato's villa, the garden became a place to shut down whenever mother was hard on me. If I was being yelled at – not the over exaggerated kind of yelling kids whine about, but the kind full of a very real anger and very real reprimands – I had to stand with my hands behind my back and maintain perfect eye contact with her. When I was being scolded, she wasn't my mother anymore. She was "ma'am" and if I faltered in this protocol in the slightest, my punishment would be worse. I was often confined to my room, left with nothing but schoolwork to do.  
就像美里阿姨的别墅一样，每当母亲对我严厉时，花园就成了我逃避的地方。如果我被大声训斥——不是孩子们抱怨的那种夸张的喊叫，而是充满了真实愤怒和真实训诫的那种——我必须双手背在身后，保持与她完美的眼神接触。被责骂时，她不再是我的母亲，而是“女士”。如果我在这种规矩上稍有差池，惩罚会更严重。我常常被关在房间里，除了做作业别无他事。

It was after one such incident that I retreated to the garden for shelter, getting lost in the azaleas as my father tended the roses.  
在一次这样的事件后，我逃到花园寻求庇护，迷失在杜鹃花丛中，而父亲正在照料玫瑰。

"Why's she have to be such a bitch all the time?" I mumbled, her words still burning me, even out by the bright flowers. I'd never said anything like that about her before, least of all to my father. I'd never trusted him that much. It just felt good to spit hate at her, even if she wasn't around to hear it. I didn't have the courage to say that to her face, not for another six years.  
“她为什么总是这么刻薄？”我喃喃自语，她的话依然刺痛着我，即便是在这鲜花盛开的地方。我以前从未对她说过这样的话，尤其不敢对父亲说。我从未如此信任过他。向她发泄恨意感觉很好，即使她不在场听不到。我还没有勇气当面对她说这些，还要再等六年。

"She doesn't mean to be that way," he answered, quietly. I sat in the dirt next to where his expert fingers snagged dead petals and brittle branches from the rose bushes. I thought he must have liked the sting of the thorns to handle them without gloves. Or maybe he'd just gotten good at not getting hurt. His fingers pinched one of the sharp barbs, snapping a long fang off to show me. "The roses have thorns to protect themselves, like the azaleas."  
"她并非有意如此，" 他轻声回答。我坐在他身旁的泥土上，看着他熟练的手指从玫瑰丛中挑出枯萎的花瓣和脆裂的枝条。我想，他一定是喜欢那种被刺扎痛的感觉，才会赤手空拳地摆弄它们。又或许，他早已习惯了不让自己受伤。他的手指捏住一根尖锐的刺，折断了一根长长的尖牙，向我展示。"玫瑰有刺是为了保护自己，就像杜鹃花一样。"

"Do you cut your fingers up a lot?"  
"你经常割伤手指吗？"

"A lot." "经常。"

"If it's painful, why do you do it?"  
"如果这很痛苦，你为何还要做？"

"Because when you take care of them, they bloom." he snipped one of the roses from its bush and placed it in my palm, nodding me off to the house, where my mother was hunched over a stack of papers in her musty, drab office. I entered with trepidation. It wasn't her favorite like the lilacs and I was still sour at her for my most recent tongue lashing. But when I brought her that little red flower, she could've lit up the whole house with her smile. Dad knew how much it would mean to her coming from me.  
"因为当你照顾它们时，它们会绽放。" 他从灌木上剪下一朵玫瑰，放在我的掌心，示意我向屋内走去，那里我母亲正弯腰在她的阴暗、单调的办公室里处理一堆文件。我带着忐忑的心情走进去。她不像喜欢丁香那样喜欢玫瑰，而且我还在为她最近的严厉斥责而耿耿于怀。但当我把那朵小红花递给她时，她的笑容足以照亮整个屋子。爸爸知道这对我来说意味着什么，也知道这对我母亲意味着什么。

He wasn't a man that smiled much, but he smiled then.  
他不是一个经常笑的人，但那时他笑了。

He made everything okay. 他让一切都好起来了。

One day in November, he'd ended up in the hospital with a broken leg and a concussion. Fell off the roof fixing up a patch of shingles, snapping his tibia right below the knee. Had to use a cane for a while after the cast came off. Even today he has a slight limp from the bone never setting quite right again.  
十一月的一天，他因腿部骨折和脑震荡住进了医院。从屋顶摔下来修理瓦片，小腿胫骨就在膝盖下方断裂了。石膏拆掉后，他不得不拄了一段时间的拐杖。即便到了今天，那块骨头再也没有完全愈合，他走路还有点跛。

I tried to take care of the garden when he couldn't, but it was too much and I didn't understand all the plants like he did. I couldn't even tend to the roses without ripping my fingers open. I never showed him that. He didn't like blood. So I stopped looking after them, frustrated with their thorns and their graying petals.  
当他无法照顾花园时，我尝试接手，但那负担太重，我不像他那样了解所有的植物。我甚至照顾不了玫瑰，每次都会把手指划破。我从没让他看到这些。他不喜欢血。所以我放弃了照顾它们，对那些刺和逐渐褪色的花瓣感到沮丧。

The doctors had him on a lot of painkillers for those eight weeks his leg mended and all it seemed to do was make his mood swings worse. To the point where he stopped coming outside altogether. His condition had never diminished to begin with, only subsided from time to time. The flowers were starting to die and I didn't know how to save them. Even the azaleas began to wither. That stung more than the thorns of the roses. It was my job to take care of them.  
医生给他开了许多止痛药，那八周里他的腿在愈合，但这些药似乎只是让他的情绪波动更严重。以至于他完全不再出门。他的状况从未真正好转，只是偶尔有所缓解。花朵开始凋谢，我不知道如何挽救它们。甚至连杜鹃花也开始枯萎。这比玫瑰的刺还要刺痛我。照顾它们是我的职责。

"Don't let my flowers die," he'd said, a hand snagging my shoulder as I walked by, the fact that he was out of his room a rarity once more. Cold sweats kept him up in the night and he wasn't sleeping so well again. I could see how tired he was, how much life had been sucked out of him in just the past few weeks. Or maybe he'd always looked that way and I just never noticed.  
"别让我的花凋谢，"他曾说，一只手抓住我的肩膀，当我走过时，他走出房间已是难得一见的景象。冷汗让他夜不能寐，他又开始睡不好了。我能看出他有多疲惫，仅仅在过去的几周里，生命力似乎就被抽干了。或许他一直看起来那样，只是我从未注意到。

"Kazuya. If something ever happens to me, don't let my flowers die, you hear?" he said again, a bit of desperation in his voice as his eyes searched mine. "Promise me."  
"和也。如果我出了什么事，别让我的花凋谢，明白吗？"他又说了一遍，声音中带着一丝绝望，他的眼睛寻找着我的目光。"答应我。"

The garden had become his new drug and he craved it with the same fervent need. As every flashback and nightmare fought for dominance over his reality, it was the one constant he was ever allowed to keep – and he couldn't stand the idea of losing it.  
那花园已成了他的新瘾，他对它的渴望如同烈火般炽热。每当回忆与噩梦争夺着他现实的主导权，那是他唯一被允许保留的恒常之物——而他无法忍受失去它的念头。

Hesitating, I nodded back, trying not to crumble under the weight on my shoulder.  
我犹豫着点头回应，努力不让肩上的重担将我压垮。

_I promise_. 我保证。

It was winter and the roses weren't in bloom. Come spring time, it didn't matter. They died anyway.  
正值冬季，玫瑰并未盛开。待到春日来临，也无所谓了。它们终将凋零。

### Chapter 11: December 10
_Impact: the Technological Evolution and Moral Ambiguity of Post Second Impact Nations  
第二次冲击后时代的技术革新与道德模糊_

In 2003, there was a particular house in Osaka prefecture, Japan. The Nishiguchi house, like old houses everywhere, held secrets. Stories whispered in the shadows, tales etched in dark wood, confidences that if exposed would diminish the teller and scar the listener.  
2003 年，在日本大阪府有一座特别的房子。西口家，如同各地的老房子一样，藏着秘密。阴影中低语的故事，深色木头上的刻痕，那些一旦揭露便会削弱讲述者并伤害听者的私密。

In 1991 the Japanese stock market crashed. Equity and asset prices fell. Banks and insurance companies had storage units packed to the ceiling with books of bad debt. The nation fell into a crippling stagnation.  
1991 年，日本股市崩盘。股票和资产价格下跌。银行和保险公司堆满了坏账账簿的储藏室直达天花板。国家陷入了严重的停滞状态。

There wasn't very much use for an embryologist like Toshiro Nishiguchi, fresh out of Nagoya University, and aiming to fill the Nobel peace prize-winning shoes of his father. Instead, Toshiro struggled as a pharmacist at a local drug store chain up until 2000. In the following year, the JSSDF was under investigation for war crimes in Sumatra. Entire coastal prefectures had been taken underwater and Tokyo was little more than a black crater.  
像刚从名古屋大学毕业、立志继承父亲诺贝尔和平奖得主衣钵的西口俊郎这样的胚胎学家，其实并没有太多用武之地。相反，西口俊郎在 2000 年之前一直在当地一家连锁药店做药剂师。次年，日本自卫队因在苏门答腊的战争罪行而受到调查。整个沿海地区都被淹没，东京也不过是一个黑色的弹坑。

Japan was on the brink of utter collapse.  
日本正处于崩溃的边缘。

There was not much use for an embryologist like Toshiro Nishiguchi, who had so thoroughly dedicated his life to such a specific branch of biology, toiling away on the boat cities of Imabari in the wake of Second Impact. Until a particular UN joint research laboratory erected itself in the Hakone region, in need of such a very particular biologist. What the gap between 2000 and 2003 entailed for our intrepid embryologist is hard to pin down in detail. He was married late in 2001, taking in a step daughter with the union. On August 19th of 2003, the former had been missing for two months and the latter purportedly hadn't shown up for school in nearly a year.  
像西口俊郎这样一生致力于如此特定生物学分支的胚胎学家，在第二次冲击后在今治的船城上辛勤劳作，其实并没有太多用处。直到联合国联合研究实验室在箱根地区建立，急需这样一位特定的生物学家。2000 年至 2003 年间，我们这位勇敢的胚胎学家经历了什么，很难详细说明。他在 2001 年底结婚，并收养了一个继女。2003 年 8 月 19 日，前者已经失踪两个月，而后者据说已经近一年没有上学了。

That day, Mr. Nishiguchi left his house in Osaka prefecture and never came back. He was found on an isolated island off the coast hanging from a maple tree, a note tucked in his pocket, scrawled with a short message:  
那天，西口先生离开了他在大阪府的家，再也没有回来。人们在海岸外的一个孤岛上发现了他，悬挂在一棵枫树上，口袋里塞着一张纸条，潦草地写着简短的遗言：

_I was never fond of towns, houses, society or, it seems, civilization.  
我从未喜欢过城镇、房屋、社会，似乎也包括文明。_

His wife and step daughter were never found. He was, as we now know, in part responsible for developing the cloning phases for the biologically based Evangelion weapon system.  
他的妻子和继女从此下落不明。正如我们现在所知，他在生物学基础的 EVA 武器系统克隆阶段开发中负有部分责任。

In many ways, Mr. Nishiguchi adequately frames the mindset of post Third World War Japan–  
在很多方面，西口先生恰如其分地描绘了第三次世界大战后日本的心态——

"Langley." I jump, a knee banging against the underside of my desk. Pip stands across from me, eyes not quite as sleep deprived as usual. "Planning on taking Chief's place? Desk is shaping up real nice. Whole Department's backlogged."  
"兰利。" 我吓了一跳，膝盖撞到了桌底。皮普站在对面，眼睛不像平时那么疲惫。"打算接替主任的位置吗？桌子收拾得挺不错。整个部门都积压了不少工作。"

I close the book and move it out of sight, other hand rubbing my knee. The in-pile has reached new heights, my very own leaning tower. The empty, sterile and sometimes dust-laden space on my desk has now been occupied by smaller, disorganized piles of paperwork. So much for being Department Manager.  
我合上书，把它移到视线之外，另一只手揉着膝盖。待处理的文件堆得越来越高，简直成了我自己的斜塔。我桌上原本空旷、冰冷、有时还积满灰尘的空间，现在被一堆堆杂乱无章的文件占据。部门经理的头衔算是白搭了。

"Guess I've been distracted lately."  
"最近大概是分心了吧。"

Pip takes a sip from his coffee, the equivalent of a shrug. His pale, yellowish fingers take the book up from where I tried to hide it under my monitor. On the cover is a pair of webbed, golden wings. I'm glad my father gave me the writer's name, otherwise I never would have found it in the mind-numbingly long list of books similarly titled _Impact_.  
皮普从他的咖啡中抿了一口，相当于耸了耸肩。他那苍白泛黄的手指从我试图藏在显示器下的地方拿起那本书。封面是一对金色的网状翅膀。我很庆幸父亲告诉了我作者的名字，否则我永远也不会在那些同样以《冲击》为题的冗长书单中找到它。

"Impact," Pip says, tossing it back atop my desk. "Didn't peg you for that _Culto di Cassius_ shit."  
"《冲击》，"皮普说着，把它扔回我的桌上。"没想到你会看那种卡西乌斯教派的玩意儿。"

Shamal and Fredric glance over from their desks and I frown, hiding the book again. "I'm not. It's supposed to be about the Angel War."  
沙玛尔和弗雷德里克从他们的办公桌那边瞥了一眼，我皱起眉头，再次把书藏了起来。“我没有。这本书应该是关于天使战争的。”

"Isn't that grade school stuff? You absent that day Langley? Home schooled?"  
“那不是小学的内容吗？那天你没来上课吗，兰利？还是在家自学的？”

It isn't easy to glare at someone like Pip, mostly because his dead-on-the-inside expression makes you feel stupid for even trying. So I work my jaw, tapping my fingers instead of chewing on them. "You're pretty talkative today."  
对皮普这样的人瞪眼并不容易，主要是因为他那死气沉沉的表情让你觉得自己尝试瞪眼很愚蠢。所以我只是动了动下巴，用手指敲打着桌面，而不是咬着它们。“你今天话真多。”

Another sip-shrug. "D-ten. Dad was a firefighter in Newark, before the riots. Heavy drinker, real asshole. Kinda hated the guy. Died last year."  
又是一口酒，耸了耸肩。“D-十。我爸以前是纽瓦克的消防员，暴乱之前。酗酒，真是个混蛋。有点讨厌那家伙。去年去世了。”

Newark. It wasn't enough that most of it had burned down in the 1960s and was subjected to some nasty rioting in the same decade, but displaced Japs had turned the city into a warzone. A lot of dead firefighters. Nobody lives there now except the homeless and the criminally-inclined poor. Most of it is abandoned. Today's the anniversary.  
纽瓦克。1960 年代大部分被烧毁，同十年间还遭受了严重的暴乱，但这些还不够，被驱逐的日本人把这座城市变成了战场。许多消防员丧生。现在除了无家可归者和犯罪倾向的穷人，几乎没人住在那里。大部分地区已被废弃。今天是周年纪念日。

"Sorry to hear that," I say, carefully. If anyone would have reason to hock spit and curse at me for looking Japanese, I suppose it would be Pip. Instead, he stares into his mug and dumps the brown slop he calls coffee into my trash can.  
“听到这个我很难过，”我小心翼翼地说。如果有人因为我是日本人而对我吐口水咒骂，我想那应该是皮普。然而，他只是盯着他的杯子，把他称之为咖啡的棕色糊状物倒进了我的垃圾桶。

"Old man was sick of living anyway. Drank himself to death."  
"老头反正也活腻了。把自己喝死了。"

The relative quiet between us is measured – weighted. I can't say I know Pip, not even as a coworker. He's just our resident blunt and to-the-point kind of asshole. I've seen him chuckle _once_ and it was at dead baby jokes on the net. But for him to still be standing at my desk tells me the subject isn't something he tosses about lightly.  
我们之间的相对安静是经过衡量的——沉重的。我不能说我了解皮普，甚至作为同事也不算了解。他只是我们这里那种直来直去、不拐弯抹角的混蛋。我只见过他笑一次，还是在网上的死婴笑话时。但他还站在我桌前，这告诉我话题不是他会轻易提及的事情。

"You miss him?" I ask.  
"你想他吗？" 我问道。

Pip doesn't answer for a long, strangled moment.  
皮普沉默了许久，仿佛被扼住了喉咙。

"Hard to miss a man I never knew," he says, dropping the coffee mug into my can too. With that, he shambles off and I peer into the trash bin, where I can read the red, bolded letters printed on the cup: _World's Greatest Dad_.  
“一个我从未认识的人，想忽视也难，”他说着，将咖啡杯也扔进了我的垃圾桶。随后，他拖着沉重的步伐离开，我朝垃圾桶里望去，只见杯子上印着鲜红粗体字：世界最棒老爸。

I pretend to work for the next six hours, making my manila pile a little neater. Now it's a very organized stack of unfiltered case files. Class-A Manager. I'm sure I'll be chewed out by the Chief later, but I just don't care anymore. He could fire me right now and I don't think I'd blink an eye. Not with this book in front of me. It's the first real piece of the war I've ever bothered to take in, even if it never really talks about the conflict itself. I'm okay with that. Baby steps.  
接下来的六个小时里，我假装在工作，把我的马尼拉文件堆整理得更整齐些。现在，这是一摞非常有序的未筛选案件文件。一流经理。我确信稍后会被局长训斥，但我已经不在乎了。他现在就可以解雇我，我想我也不会眨一下眼。有这本书在面前，这是我第一次真正关注战争的片段，尽管它从未真正谈论冲突本身。我对此感到满意。一步一步来。

Harry takes entire chapters to deal with background development of the Evangelions. It's disturbing that nations who held themselves as sophisticated and socially advanced had decided the _Hitlerjugend_ wasn't such a bad idea after all and brought the program up to 21st century standards. I phase out of some parts, wondering what kind of training an Eva pilot must've been put through. Not even Harry knows for sure.  
哈利用整整几章来处理福音战士的背景发展。令人不安的是，那些自诩为文明进步的国家竟然认为希特勒青年团的主意并不坏，甚至将这一项目提升到了 21 世纪的标准。我跳过了一些部分，好奇一个 Eva 驾驶员究竟要经历怎样的训练。就连哈利也不确定。

By the end of the day, I've entered a few new classifications in our servers, and read at least a hundred pages. Back at my apartment, I force myself to wait another hour or so before dialing home. I'm excited to tell my father what I've read so far, nervous too.  
一天结束时，我在服务器上输入了几个新的分类，并至少阅读了一百页。回到公寓后，我强迫自己再等一个小时左右才拨通家里的电话。我兴奋地想告诉父亲我迄今为止读到的内容，同时也感到紧张。

"It was actually the Sixth Angel," I say after he answers. "The one that attacked the Pacific Fleet, I mean."  
“实际上是第六使徒，”他在接电话后我说道，“我是说袭击太平洋舰队的那一个。”

The book described it as something like a Mosasaur, some old prehistoric fish – except the Angel's teeth were easily the size of an Eva's arm. Said they punched right through the fortified armor. Jesus, I'm a freaking kid again, all too eager to share my knowledge.  
书中将其描述得像是一种莫萨龙，某种古老的史前鱼类——只不过这使徒的牙齿轻易就有 EVA 的手臂那么大。据说它们能直接穿透加固的装甲。天啊，我又像个急切分享知识的小孩一样了。

"Was it?" he asks, thoughtful. "I know the one before it looked like a big diamond. Guess that was the Fifth."  
“是吗？”他若有所思地问，“我知道前一个看起来像个大钻石。估计那就是第五使徒。”

Harry spent exactly one sentence explaining it was an octahedron, but I don't correct him, fumbling for the name instead. My fingers snap. "Ramiel."  
哈利只用了一句话解释说那是个八面体，但我没有纠正他，而是摸索着那个名字。我的手指一弹，“雷米尔。”

"Yeah, my third sortie." “是啊，我的第三次出击。”

"I also read that they hooked up the Evas with cables," I say, trying to reign in my amusement. I know everything was pretty run down and slapped on back then, but I never suspected the most powerful WMDs of the 21st century would have to be plugged into the wall outlet. I suppose no one ever thought they would be operated by kids either.  
“我也读到过，他们用缆线连接了 EVA，”我试图控制自己的笑意，“我知道那时候一切都相当简陋，但从未想过 21 世纪最强大的大规模杀伤性武器居然得插在墙上的插座里。我想也没人预料到它们会由孩子们来操作。”

"It was the only way Nerv could power them. Hooking up a nuclear reactor inside a machine made for close quarters combat didn't seem too bright an idea. Especially not in the middle of a city. So they used cables. Ended up screwing us over more often than not. Without them, you only had five minutes of power from the internal batteries. Coil range was short too and you'd get stuck if you didn't keep track of it. Then you'd have to unplug and jack in a new one – _if_ there was another plug nearby."  
“那是 Nerv 唯一能给它们供电的方式。在专为近距离战斗设计的机器内部安装核反应堆，听起来并不明智，尤其是在城市中心。所以他们用了电缆。结果往往适得其反。没有电缆，你只能从内置电池中获得五分钟的电力。线圈范围也很短，如果不注意就会卡住。然后你得拔掉旧的，插上新的——如果附近有另一个插座的话。”

"Did that ever happen to you?"  
“那事发生在你身上了吗？”

A sardonic chuckle answers me first. "No. Angels usually cut the damn thing off before I could do much of anything. Happened to your mom once. We were moving into position around an Angel, right in the city, and I got impatient. I think she tried to save me." the last part he adds hesitantly and I hear him shift over the line.  
他先是一声嘲讽的轻笑回应我。“没有。天使通常在我能做些什么之前就把那该死的东西切断了。你妈妈有一次遇到过。我们当时正围绕一个天使在城市里移动位置，而我有些不耐烦了。我想她是想救我。”他犹豫地补充最后一句，我听到电话那头他挪动了一下。

I meander into the kitchen, searching for coffee. "Save you from what?"  
我漫步走进厨房，寻找咖啡。“救你免于什么？”

"The Angel," he says, pausing and sounding a little more exasperated this time. "I don't remember its name. It had a shadow that could suck you up into it. That's what happened to me."  
"那个天使，" 他说，这次停顿了一下，听起来更加恼火。"我不记得它的名字了。它有一个影子，能把人吸进去。我就是这么被吸进去的。"

"Did that one have teeth too?"  
"那个也有牙齿吗？"

"No. It was a big black and white striped ball – floating up in the sky."  
"没有。它是一个黑白条纹的大球——飘在空中。"

I blink, trying to build a mental image. So far the book hasn't talked much about the Angels. Harry doesn't seem interested in the battles themselves.  
我眨了眨眼，试图在脑海中构建一幅画面。到目前为止，这本书对天使的描述并不多。哈利似乎对战斗本身并不感兴趣。

"How did you get out?"  
“你是怎么逃出来的？”

"What do you care what your old man did in some stupid war?" he asks, the twinge of a sneer there. It takes me aback, like it did yesterday. He still doesn't trust me.  
“你为什么在乎你老爸在一场愚蠢的战争中做了什么？”他问道，语气中带着一丝嘲讽。这让我感到意外，就像昨天一样。他仍然不信任我。

I suppose it's justified. I've said some pretty awful shit over the years. Still, I want to throw my phone out the window. Stinging words try and tempt my tongue into giving them voice. I clamp my mouth shut and, with deliberate movements, I lie back on the bed, free arm stiff at my side. Staying upright is hard.  
我想这是有道理的。这些年我说了不少难听的话。尽管如此，我还是想把手机扔出窗外。刺痛的话语试图引诱我的舌头让它们发声。我紧紧闭上嘴，故意地躺回床上，空着的手臂僵硬地放在身侧。保持直立很难。

"So when are you going to tell mom?" I manage after a while.  
"那么，你打算什么时候告诉妈妈？" 我过了一会儿才开口问道。

"What?" "什么？"

Ah, I've surprised him. 啊，我让他感到意外了。

"About the Dementia." “关于痴呆症。”

He grumbles a bit, rueful now. "She won't know for a while, not if I can help it."  
他咕哝了几句，现在有些懊悔。“她不会马上知道，如果我能帮忙的话。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"I don't want her to worry," he mutters, but his tone gives him away.  
“我不想让她担心，”他低声说，但语气却泄露了他的心声。

"You're a pretty lousy liar, dad," I droll, doing my best not to sound accusatory. While I certainly learned how to pretend to be happy from my parents, lying has never been a well-honed art for the Soryu men, not with a woman like my mother. You could be talking to her from across the world with a voice modulator – and she'd still know if you were bullshitting her.  
"你是个相当糟糕的骗子，爸爸，"我打趣道，尽量不显得是在指责。虽然我确实从父母那里学会了假装快乐，但对于索留家的男人来说，撒谎从来不是一门精湛的艺术，尤其是面对像我母亲这样的女人。即使你用变声器从世界的另一端和她通话——她依然能察觉你是否在胡扯。

My father sighs. 父亲叹了口气。

"Kazuya... do you like yourself?" he asks. The question makes the line bleed out, because I don't know how to answer. "Are you happy with who you are?"  
"和也...你喜欢自己吗？"他问道。这个问题让我的思绪一片混乱，因为我不知道如何回答。"你对自己感到满意吗？"

"Yeah, I guess," I say, chewing on a finger. Then my nerves become razors, splitting into me and releasing that resentment I keep pushing down. "Why? Got some fatherly advice after all these years? Going to tell me how to live my life right?" I hop off the bed, heart beating faster. "Tell me _dad_, what should I do?"  
"是啊，我想是吧，"我边说边咬着手指。随后我的神经变得像剃刀一样锋利，分裂开来，释放出我一直压抑的怨气。"怎么？这么多年后终于有了些父亲的建议？打算教我怎么过日子吗？"我从床上跳下来，心跳加速。"告诉我，爸爸，我该怎么做？"

"What you _should've_ done is taken me out back and hit me over the head with our shovel," he growls.  
"你本该做的，是把我带到后院，用我们的铲子敲我的头，"他咆哮道。"

A cold avalanche may as well have swept through my apartment.  
一股寒流仿佛雪崩般席卷了我的公寓。

Back when we buried Frau, I saw him standing down in that grave with her – a pair of corpses. As much as I might have wished it, dreamed of it, I never wanted to be the one standing over his tombstone – not like those other kids at the military base in Jacksonville.  
在我们埋葬弗劳的那会儿，我看见他站在那坟墓里，和她一起——一对尸体。尽管我可能曾希望过、梦见过，但我从不想成为站在他墓碑前的那个人——不像杰克逊维尔军事基地的那些孩子。

There was one night, out by the dark palmettos and flame vines in our old Panama house, where someone had interrupted the clacking of the loose screen door out front. A broken window and smashed-in door later, some asshole made off with our T.V. and a toaster. Dad went out and bought a handgun the next day – forty-five caliber Smith and Wesson. It quickly became his own bit of insurance – a way to make those threats of suicide all the more present. I know it didn't start that way, but that's what his brain twisted it to be. An escape route. _I can always go. I can always leave if I want to._  
有天晚上，在我们老巴拿马家的黑暗棕榈树和火焰藤蔓旁，前门的松动纱门嘎吱作响被人打断。窗户破碎，门被砸烂后，某个混蛋偷走了我们的电视和烤面包机。第二天，爸爸出去买了一把点四五口径的史密斯威森手枪。它很快就成了他自己的一种保险——让那些自杀的威胁变得更加真实。我知道一开始并非如此，但他的大脑把它扭曲成了这样。一条逃生路线。我随时都可以走。如果我想，我随时都可以离开。

He wouldn't shout that he was going to blow his brains out, not like in Catalina. In fact, it was how quietly it all happened that made it so much worse.  
他不会像在卡塔利娜那样大喊要炸掉自己的脑袋，事实上，这一切发生得如此悄无声息，才让它变得更加糟糕。

"I'm going down to the beach," he'd say, walking out with that gun at his hip. Sometimes he wouldn't come back until morning. Mother stayed out on the porch with her pack of Newports, emptied by the time he got home. She got tired of that real quick. One day took his gun, drove out to the beach and hurled it into the ocean.  
“我要去海边，”他会这么说，腰间别着那把枪就出门了。有时他直到早上才回来。母亲就坐在门廊上，抽着她的新港烟，等他到家时烟盒已经空了。她很快就厌倦了这一切。有一天，她拿走了他的枪，开车到海边，把它扔进了大海。

When we moved out to Catalina, when they would fight and he had nowhere to escape except out the front door, I used to wish he'd died in that goddamn war. I came so close to telling him too. But a small sliver of me was afraid, as always, that those words to him might be my last.  
当我们搬到卡塔利娜岛时，每当他们争吵，他无处可逃只能从前门出去，我常常希望他在那该死的战争中死去。我差点就对他说出口了。但内心深处总有一丝恐惧，担心这些话会成为我对他说的最后一句话。

"I must be the world's greatest dad, huh?" he says, bringing me into the present again. I can hear how tired he is of talking, of everything. Like this is it for us. I could hang up right now, and that really would be the end of it. We'll go on staying out of one another's lives, until one day he forgets me and I put him six feet under, hating him all the same. But I don't want to be angry anymore. I'm tired too.  
“我一定是世界上最伟大的爸爸，对吧？”他说道，把我拉回现实。我能听出他有多厌倦谈话，厌倦一切。仿佛这就是我们的结局。我现在就可以挂断电话，那真的就是结束了。我们将继续过着互不干涉的生活，直到有一天他忘记了我，而我将他埋在地下六英尺，依然恨着他。但我不想再生气了。我也累了。

I'm so tired of being miserable.  
我厌倦了这种痛苦的生活。

"Guess that makes me the world's greatest son."  
"这么说来，我算是世界上最孝顺的儿子了。"

He makes a cough that might've been the start of a laugh and I feel a crooked smile come free, though it doesn't last. I step onto the linoleum, picking at that warped square from spilled coffee long nights ago. I never got to know this man, Shinji Soryu. Who he was, what he valued in life. There were bits and pieces. Parts of a man who was kind and had a gentle heart.  
他咳了一声，可能是想笑，而我嘴角不由自主地勾起一抹歪斜的微笑，尽管转瞬即逝。我踏上那块亚麻油地毡，手指拨弄着那块因久远前咖啡洒落而变形的方块。我从未真正了解过这个人，真治·创。他是什么样的人，他珍视什么。只有零星片段。一个善良且心怀温柔的人的片段。

"Why'd you do it, dad?" I ask, throat raw. "Why'd you always lock yourself up in your room?"  
"你为什么要这么做，爸爸？" 我嘶哑着嗓子问，"为什么你总是把自己锁在房间里？"

For the most part, I've always known where I stood with my mother – never with my father. Up until I was sixteen, I had started to assume that he just hated me. That there must have been something wrong with me. When I realized that he did care, I didn't know what to think. I'd trusted him and been betrayed so many times before. I decided it was better to push him and those feelings away.  
“我会听到一些声响，闻到某种气味，”他停顿了一下，努力寻找合适的词句，“就像我又坐在驾驶舱里一样，仿佛在与使徒战斗。这一切都……涌上心头。”他叹了口气，我能感受到他的不情愿。

"I'd hear a noise, catch a whiff of some smell," he stops, struggling for words. "And it was like I was sitting right back in the entry plug again. Like I was fighting the Angels. It all just... overflowed." he sighs through his nose and I can feel his reluctance.

"I didn't want to hurt you," he says, and I think I hear a bit of hurt there too. As if that's something I should have realized. How could I have? Most memories I have of my father can be associated with the door to his room. I used to draw on it too, just to make him mad, just to get him to look at me and yell at me. Rotten things like '_liar_' or '_crazy old man_'. It never worked, bringing down mother's wrath instead. As punishment she would have me hold stress positions, sometimes with an armful of books or something else just as heavy. The sitting position was her favorite.  
"我不想伤害你，" 他说，我似乎也听出了他话语中的一丝伤感。仿佛这是我本该察觉到的。我怎么可能知道呢？关于父亲的记忆大多与他的房门有关。我曾在这扇门上涂鸦，只为惹他生气，只为让他看我一眼，对我大吼。那些糟糕的字眼，比如“骗子”或“疯老头”。但从未奏效，反而招来了母亲的怒火。作为惩罚，她会让我保持压力姿势，有时怀里还要抱着一堆书或其他同样沉重的东西。坐姿是她最喜欢的惩罚方式。

"Your mother said to me once, in Panama, after she tossed out that old forty-five," he goes on, trying to fill the silence for both of us. "She said, _'you've got a son to take care of. You can die later'_. Your old man was a real fool back then, Kazuya."  
"你母亲曾在巴拿马对我说过一次，就在她扔掉那把旧的点四五手枪之后，" 他继续说道，试图为我们俩填补沉默。"她说，'你有个儿子要照顾。你可以晚点再死'。那时候，你父亲真是个大傻瓜，和也。

"Was?" "曾经？"

"Still is," he grumbles and I know there's a smile this time. "Smartass."  
"还是一样，" 他咕哝着，我知道这次他笑了。"自作聪明。"

I'm not sure why, but that makes me smile too. They're exactly alike, he and mom. So hard to deal with, so stubborn. In their own ways of course.  
我不确定为什么，但这让我也笑了。他和妈妈简直一模一样。那么难以相处，那么固执。当然，各有各的方式。

As I grew older, I came to realize how scared I was of getting close to anyone. Because I hurt people so much and so well that it became second nature. I hated being that way. When I couldn't reign in that anger and anxiety, I found ways to hurt myself instead. I knew if I didn't, I'd end up catching someone else in the whirlwind. Someone far less deserving.  
随着年龄的增长，我逐渐意识到自己有多害怕与人亲近。因为我伤害别人太深太狠，几乎成了本能。我讨厌那样。当我无法控制那股愤怒和焦虑时，我找到了伤害自己的方法。我知道，如果我不这样做，最终会把无辜的人卷入这场风暴。那些远不该承受这一切的人。

When I was with Carrie, we used to fight about everything. Stupid, little, insignificant things like which route to take to work, where to go out that night, cleaning around our respective apartments. When I started to feel like I was slipping, I'd pop a few pills and let her rail into me instead of arguing. I wouldn't try and reach out and reason with her as she told me what a terrible person I was. If I didn't put up a fight, if I just let her hurt me and get it out of her system, everything would be fine. We could keep going on. One day things would be better.  
和 Carrie 在一起时，我们曾经为所有事情争吵。愚蠢的、微不足道的琐事，比如上班走哪条路，晚上去哪儿玩，各自公寓的清洁问题。当我开始感觉自己要失控时，我会吞几片药，让她对我发泄，而不是争论。我不会试图去和她讲道理，当她告诉我我是个多么糟糕的人时。如果我不反抗，如果我只是让她伤害我，让她发泄出来，一切都会好起来的。我们可以继续下去。总有一天事情会变好的。

That was just make believe, and all it did was push Carrie further away from me. So she started hiding my pills. I screamed at her then, made threats, lost control – like my father and his episodes.  
那只是自欺欺人，结果只是让 Carrie 离我更远。于是她开始藏我的药。我那时对她大喊大叫，发出威胁，失去控制——就像我父亲和他的那些发作。

"Do you think you'll come down for Christmas this year?" he asks, switching gears. We've both had enough of the war for tonight.  
“你觉得今年圣诞节会回来吗？”他转换了话题。今晚我们都受够了这场争吵。

"Hell, I don't know. We've never been big on it. You know how mom gets."  
“见鬼，我不知道。我们家从不讲究这些。你知道妈妈那脾气。”

"I know." "我知道。"

We never had a tree in the living room, never put up colored lights or exchanged presents. Mother couldn't stand it.  
我们从未在客厅摆过圣诞树，从未挂过彩灯或交换礼物。妈妈受不了这些。

On Christmas Eve my parents would send me over to Misato's so they could have the house to themselves. The next day, me and mom would laze about in the living room watching sports. There's only one Christmas I can remember my father ever coming out of his room. He'd settled into his armchair – a huge seat of red leather stuffed to bursting with padding. We called it the Throne.  
圣诞前夜，父母会把我送到美里家，这样他们就能独享房子。第二天，我和妈妈会懒洋洋地坐在客厅看体育节目。我只记得父亲有一次走出他的房间过圣诞。他坐在那把巨大的红色皮革扶手椅上——填充物塞得满满的，我们称之为‘王座’。

He was folding paper in the shape of a crane and I sat on the floor next to him, where he taught me how to make them. He wanted to see if we could manage to make a thousand before the day was up. Mother glanced our way every now and then, content to spend Christmas watching hockey and cursing at the television in her native tongue. I'm pretty sure the only reason she cared for the sport at all was for the violence, and I'm more than pretty sure she just liked getting riled up with all that adrenaline.  
他正在折纸鹤，我则坐在他旁边的地板上，他教我如何折。他想看看我们能否在一天结束前折出一千只。母亲时不时朝我们这边瞥一眼，心满意足地看着圣诞节 hockey 比赛，用她的母语对着电视咒骂。我敢肯定，她对这项运动唯一感兴趣的就是其中的暴力场面，而且我更加肯定，她只是喜欢那种因肾上腺素飙升而激动的情绪。

Whatever team she was rooting for – the Jersey Devils were her favorite – I'd pick the opposite, just for the chance to gloat when my team won. Eventually, as night came crawling, mother made crepes and sat down to fold paper cranes, helping us litter the floor with them.  
无论她支持哪支球队——她最喜欢的是 Jersey Devils——我都会选择相反的队伍，只为有机会在球队获胜时得意一番。最终，随着夜幕降临，母亲做了可丽饼，坐下来和我们一起折纸鹤，帮我们在地板上铺满了这些纸鹤。

On my floor, here in Silver Springs, the linoleum tile's been ripped open by my fingers, bits and pieces torn off and thrown to the side.  
在我现在居住的 Silver Springs 的房间里，地上的油毡瓷砖被我的手指撕开，碎片被扯下并扔到一旁。

"Maybe next year, dad." “也许明年吧，爸爸。”

The eighteenth interim report for the Intelligence Community Analysis Assistance Plan is missing. Not that the project has gained any headway in the last month, but the big wigs like having officially labeled, dry assessments to read over – even if it could all be summed up in a sentence or less – as opposed to twenty-two pages. Communicating with the other offices shared by our department has been enough of a hair-pulling hassle. So everyone is in a sour mood and the Chief gives us all shit.  
情报界分析协助计划的第十八份中期报告失踪了。并非项目在过去一个月里取得了任何进展，但那些高层喜欢阅读正式标注、枯燥的评估报告——即便这些内容可以用一句话概括——而不是长达二十二页的篇幅。与我们部门共用的其他办公室沟通起来已经够让人抓狂了。所以大家心情都不好，主管对我们大发雷霆。

He tells me to, "just sit the fuck down," after I spend a few minutes floundering through papers looking for the damn report. The higher-ups must be getting on his case. The plan itself has proven to be a giant waste of time for the past two years. It's basically a very officially worded _find ways to do your job better_ kind of project. For which the Project Committee has been less than helpful.  
我在文件中翻找了几分钟那份该死的报告后，他让我“他妈的坐下”。高层肯定在给他施压。这个计划在过去两年里证明是个巨大的时间浪费。基本上就是一个用非常正式的语言来寻找提高工作效率方法的项目。而项目委员会一直帮不上忙。

After we've been thoroughly chewed out, the Chief calls for me to stay behind. I can count on my hand the number of times I've seen him out from behind the Great Wall. He's thin, deathly thin, skin wrinkled and wrapped tight to his bones. If that wasn't enough of an indicator that the man is edging into his eighties, he's got this gray, forever frizzed hair clinging to his balding scalp.  
在我们被狠狠训斥一番后，主管示意我留下。我能用一只手数出他离开那堵高墙的次数。他瘦削，极其瘦削，皮肤皱巴巴地紧贴着骨头。如果这还不足以说明他已接近八十岁，那么他那灰白、永远蓬乱的头发紧贴着光秃的头皮，也是一个明显的迹象。

When the last person files out, he leans against the conference desk, fixing me with a pair of beady eyes that glint – dangerously. "Kazuya, you're a hard worker, but no one gives a damn who your father was. Well... maybe some do, but I don't."  
当最后一个人离开时，他靠在会议桌上，用一双闪烁着危险光芒的小眼睛盯着我。"和也，你是个勤奋的人，但没人会在乎你父亲是谁。嗯...也许有些人会在乎，但我不在乎。"

I think I manage to hide my surprise. I hadn't thought I was being so obvious about it. But there isn't much that the CIA considers confidential about its employees. The Chief already knows everything – even has the psych reports from my sessions with the therapists. It's all apart of the screening process. He reaches back and takes something from his opened briefcase, letting it slap down on the table between us.  
我想我设法掩饰了我的惊讶。我没想到自己表现得如此明显。但中情局对其雇员的保密程度并不高。主管已经知道了一切——甚至有我和心理治疗师会谈的心理报告。这都是筛选过程的一部分。他伸手从打开的公文包里拿出一样东西，啪的一声放在我们之间的桌子上。

It's Harry's book. 这是哈利的书。

"We've all got baggage – but rule one is that you don't bring it here."  
“我们都有过去——但第一条规矩是你不能把它带到这里。”

When did he grab it from my desk? It doesn't matter, I knew this was coming. I really shouldn't be surprised.  
他什么时候从我桌上拿走的？没关系，我知道这迟早会发生。我真的不应该感到惊讶。

"You going to fire me?"  
“你要解雇我吗？”

Chief huffs. "If you can't get your act together, I'll have to replace you. You've got a week to get that head on straight."  
长官哼了一声。“如果你不能振作起来，我就得换人了。你有一周的时间把脑袋弄清楚。”

At the very least I'm being given a choice – and a week's notice too. It's tempting. Throw the book out, call mom and dad a few times a month, keep working. Keep _living_. That way, I can just plow through the holidays on my own, empty a bottle of brandy on the Eve, and keep making half-assed forays into the Angel War.  
至少我还有选择权——而且还有一周的通知期。这很诱人。把书扔掉，每个月给父母打几次电话，继续工作。继续生活。那样的话，我可以自己熬过假期，除夕夜喝光一瓶白兰地，继续半心半意地参与天使战争。

"How about the rest of the month?" I ask. Even with the days I've already taken, I still have an entire month's worth of vacation time to use before the year's up.  
“那剩下的月份呢？”我问。即便我已经请了几天假，到年底前我还有整整一个月的假期时间可以利用。

Chief works his jaw, allowing himself a wheezing chuckle and shaking his head. One of his withered hands shoos me out as he turns away, grumbling, "Oh the Committee is going to love this..."  
主任咬了咬牙，发出一阵喘息般的轻笑，摇了摇头。他那枯瘦的手挥了挥，示意我离开，同时转过身去，咕哝着：“哦，委员会肯定会喜欢这个的……”

Go stay with my parents for a few weeks, or lose my job.  
去和父母住几周，还是丢掉工作。

If it wasn't so ridiculously expensive to live in Washington, I might choose the latter.  
如果不是在华盛顿生活贵得离谱，我可能会选择后者。

The next day, I ask my father about A-tens.  
第二天，我向父亲询问 A-tens 的情况。

I've read through more of the book and going by the title, I should have expected Harry would be dealing more with the political end of it all as opposed to the Evas and their battles. It's late in the evening when I call and he seems to be in a better mood, even a little candid.  
我已经读了这本书的更多部分，根据标题，我本该预料到哈利会更关注政治层面，而不是 Eva 和它们的战斗。我打电话时已是深夜，他似乎心情不错，甚至有些坦率。

"Couldn't do it without them," he says, and I recall how often he would wake in a panic trying to find them. "Well, you could synchronize just fine, but you couldn't project commands without the A-tens."  
"没有他们，我做不到，" 他说道，我回想起他曾多少次在恐慌中醒来，试图找到他们。"嗯，你可以同步得很好，但没有 A-tens，你就无法发出指令。"

I stop pouring coffee. "What do you mean synchronize?"  
我停止倒咖啡。"你说的同步是什么意思？"

"Pilots were linked mentally and physically to the Eva. That's how you controlled it, the trade off being sympathetic pain."  
"驾驶员在精神和肉体上都与 Eva 相连。这就是你如何控制它的，代价是感同身受的痛苦。"

I guess I always pictured it like the cockpit of an airplane. How the hell do you connect a person to such a huge machine?  
我想象中它就像飞机的驾驶舱。一个人怎么可能与这么庞大的机器连接起来呢？

"So if the Eva was damaged, you got hurt too?"  
那么，如果 Eva 受损了，你也会受伤吗？

"If your sync-ratio was high enough. Otherwise you could feel the pain, but it wouldn't manifest into any physical trauma. Neural shock would've been enough to kill us a few times."  
如果你的同步率足够高的话。否则你可能只会感到疼痛，但不会造成任何身体上的创伤。神经冲击已经足够让我们死上好几次了。

The half-painted imagery of Toji's story churns up. All that talk of blood and ripping. Does that mean he felt all of that as my father's Eva tore into his? A tremble shivers tight around my stomach and the coffee isn't nearly so alluring anymore. All those marks on my mother's skin. The Eva's wounds were real for her once, too.  
Toji 故事中那半完成的画面在脑海中翻腾。那些关于血液和撕裂的谈论。这是否意味着，当我的父亲的 Eva 撕裂他的身体时，他感受到了所有这些？一阵颤抖紧紧包围着我的腹部，咖啡再也不那么诱人了。我母亲皮肤上的那些痕迹。Eva 的伤口对她来说也曾是真实的。

"Did you... ever get hurt like that?"  
“你……有过那样的受伤经历吗？”

"No, woke up in the hospital more times than I can count, though. They had to stick me in an intensive care pod once."  
“没有，不过我在医院醒来过无数次。有一次他们不得不把我放进重症监护舱。”

The beginning of another question jumps free, only to be cut off by my father. "Your mother says the Rangers are facing off against the Devils this year. I don't keep up with sports, but I know you used to like the Rangers a lot."  
又一个问题刚冒出来就被我父亲打断了。“你妈妈说今年游骑兵队要对阵魔鬼队。我不怎么关注体育，但我知道你以前很喜欢游骑兵队。”

Like is a bit much. I don't keep up with sports either. The only time I ever did was with mom and, the Rangers being the decidedly brutal adversaries of the Devils, naturally I gravitated towards them. One year I ordered a big team banner online and hung it up for Christmas.  
说‘喜欢’有点夸张了。我也不怎么关注体育。唯一关注的那段时间是和妈妈一起，而游骑兵队作为魔鬼队明显残酷的对手，我自然倾向于他们。有一年我在网上订了一面大团队横幅，挂起来庆祝圣诞节。

2041 – Rangers came out on top 6-2. Victory was sweet. I kept that banner up for the rest of the week, taunting my mother every chance I got.  
2041 年——游骑兵队以 6-2 胜出。胜利的滋味真甜。那周剩下的时间里，我一直挂着那面横幅，一有机会就向妈妈炫耀。

"Rotten kid," she'd say, but couldn't keep a smile from me forever.  
“坏小子，”她会说，但笑容终究无法长久藏匿。

I suppose that's all I'll be getting out of my father tonight.  
我想今晚从父亲那里也就只能得到这些了。

Every conversation between us has been like trying to pry a clam open with toothpicks. I'm worried that he just doesn't remember much of it anymore, so he shuts up because he's embarrassed, because we're finally able to come to some understanding and he doesn't have the answers. Or that's just what I want it to be, instead of acknowledging I've turned my back too many times for him to open up – or that I might ever be able to understand anyway.  
我们之间的每一次对话都像用牙签撬开蛤蜊一样艰难。我担心他只是不再记得太多，所以选择沉默，因为尴尬，因为我们终于能达成某种理解，而他却无言以对。或许这只是我希望的解释，而非承认我曾多次转身离去，让他无法敞开心扉——或者我可能永远也无法真正理解。

I crouch down over the eviscerated linoleum from a day ago, picking at the remnants. "What's your favorite memory of mom when you were kids?"  
我蹲在一天前被撕裂的油毡地板上，拨弄着残余的部分。“你小时候最喜欢关于妈妈的哪段记忆？”

He makes a thoughtful noise. "I don't remember much."  
他发出沉思的声音。“我不太记得了。”

Classic line. 经典台词。

"Well, what _do_ you remember?"  
"那么，你记得些什么？"

His tongue clicks and I think he holds back a sigh. I pick the patch of tile clean, revealing a black, stained floor beneath the thin covering. The contrast with the faded beige of the other tiles is sharp and for a while all I can do is stare into it.  
他咂了咂舌，我猜他忍住了叹息。我将那块瓷砖擦得干干净净，露出了下面黑色、沾满污渍的地板，与周围褪色的米色瓷砖形成鲜明对比。一时间，我只能盯着它发呆。

"We were training for a battle," dad says, rough voice softer. "Me and your mom didn't get along so well at first and Misato threatened to take her off the mission. So she stormed off to the convenience store down the street. I went after her and we sat out on a balcony for a while. Well, I was sitting, she was standing, stuffing her face with junk food while she ranted about Misato. Sun was setting I think. We stayed out there for a long time. I remember thinking she was kind of pretty, all worked up like that."  
"我们当时在为一场战斗训练，" 爸爸说道，声音变得柔和了些。"我和你妈妈起初相处得并不融洽，美里威胁要把她从任务中撤下来。于是她气冲冲地去了街角的便利店。我追了上去，我们在阳台上坐了一会儿。嗯，我坐着，她站着，一边大口吃着垃圾食品，一边抱怨美里。我想太阳快要落山了。我们在那里待了很久。我记得当时觉得她那样生气勃勃的样子还挺漂亮的。"

I can hear another voice then, distant and indistinct. It can only be my mother.  
随后，我听到了另一个声音，遥远而模糊。那只能是我的母亲。

Dad chuckles. "I've just been corrected. Apparently, I _have_ and always _will_ think your mother is the most beautiful woman I have ever met from the minute I laid eyes on her."  
爸爸轻声笑道：“我刚被纠正了。显然，从我第一眼见到你母亲起，我就一直认为她是我见过的最美丽的女人，并且永远都会这么想。”

"Naturally," I say, smirking.  
“自然，”我带着一丝笑意说。

Thoughts of Catalina and my last visit fill the nooks and crannies of my small kitchen. I've already taken the month off from work, but I've been debating all day if I actually want to go back to Arizona. Sitting on my coffee table is the photo album mom brought up. She left it here with me, so I could remember how happy I used to be.  
卡塔利娜和我的上一次拜访的回忆填满了我的小厨房的每一个角落。我已经请了一个月的假，但一整天我都在犹豫是否真的想回亚利桑那。坐在咖啡桌上的是妈妈带来的相册。她把它留在这里，让我能记得过去是多么快乐。

"You can let her know I'll be coming down for Christmas," I say, pulling at another tile piece.  
“你可以告诉她，我会回来过圣诞节，”我说着，又拆下一块瓷砖。

"Your room's still here, just the way you left it."  
“你的房间还在那儿，和你离开时一模一样。”

"Really?" "真的吗？"

There's a smile again, and something wistful. "Your mother's been waiting a long time for you to come home."  
脸上再次浮现微笑，带着一丝怅然。“你母亲一直在等你回家。”

### Interlude XI

My mother grew up in a little town called Bernau, just outside of Berlin. A cozy, quiet town with open fields and old forests. Her parents were well off and owned a small manor in the countryside out on its golden pastures, where she lived up until the age of eleven before leaving for Heidelberg University. According to my father, she couldn't remember a single Christmas before the age of five, nor any after it. That year she'd gotten a lump of coal instead of presents for misbehaving, and hasn't liked celebrating it ever since.  
我母亲在一个名叫伯尔瑙的小镇长大，就在柏林郊外。那是一个舒适宁静的小镇，有着开阔的田野和古老的森林。她的父母家境富裕，拥有一座乡间小庄园，坐落在金色的牧场上，她在那里一直生活到十一岁，之后前往海德堡大学。据我父亲说，她不记得五岁前的任何一个圣诞节，也不记得之后的任何一个。那一年，她因为调皮捣蛋而收到了一块煤作为惩罚，而不是礼物，从那以后她就不再喜欢庆祝圣诞节了。

My father never talked about his upbringing, but it was clear the holiday had never been apart of it. Apparently it wasn't a national kind of festivity like it is in America. So it passed like any other day for me.  
我父亲从未谈及他的成长经历，但显然这个节日从未成为其中的一部分。显然，它不像在美国那样是一个全国性的节日。所以对我来说，它就像任何其他日子一样过去了。

Every now and then I was sent down to stay with the Suzuhara's in Louisiana for a week or so. At least before they moved to settle in Hokkaido. It was the end of the year, and I remember thinking how strange their Christmas was compared to mine. They couldn't afford much in the way of presents, not with eight mouths to feed. So their mother usually gave them something handmade – shirts, pillows or stuffed animals for the little ones. We never exchanged gifts back home, so it was awkward that year when there was a present amidst the pile with my name on it. A shirt designed by Hachiro that, by his request, said 'Honorary Suzuhara' in all of his near-illegible kanji.  
每隔一段时间，我就会被送到路易斯安那州的铃原家待上一两个星期。至少在他们搬到北海道定居之前是这样。那是一年的年末，我记得当时觉得他们的圣诞节和我的相比很不一样。他们要养活八口人，所以买不起太多礼物。因此，他们的母亲通常会给他们一些手工制作的东西——衬衫、枕头或者给小孩子的填充动物玩具。我们家从不互换礼物，所以那一年看到一堆礼物中有一个上面写着我的名字，感觉很尴尬。那是一件由八郎设计的衬衫，按照他的要求，上面写着‘荣誉铃原’，用他那几乎无法辨认的汉字。

"An ancient and proud Samurai name," he told me with a grin.  
“一个古老而骄傲的武士名字，”他笑着告诉我。

Even my friends back in Arizona thought it odd I didn't celebrate the holiday, saying it must have been "some weird Japanese thing". There didn't appear to be much of a difference, save for religious trappings I attempted to adopt in secret. But in the end I was just pretending, making yet another shallow attempt to patch up the holes in my identity with conformity. I had only believed in God whenever it was convenient, and prayed to Buddha only to be polite while staying with the Suzuhara's. During my earlier visits, I had scoffed at the idea of taking part in this strange worship, even if most people from the homeland still practiced it.  
即使我在亚利桑那的朋友也觉得我不庆祝这个节日很奇怪，说这一定是“某种奇怪的日本习俗”。除了我试图偷偷采纳的宗教装饰外，似乎并没有太大差别。但最终，我只是在假装，又一次肤浅地试图用顺从来填补我身份中的漏洞。我只在方便的时候才相信上帝，住在铃原家时才为了礼貌而向佛陀祈祷。在我早期的拜访中，我曾嘲笑过参与这种奇怪崇拜的想法，即使大多数来自故乡的人仍在实践它。

"Why do you pray to Buddha?" I had asked Aunt Hikari. Everyone else was asleep and I had woken up for water, finding her there praying at their little shrine. "How's it any different than praying to God? What's the point of praying if you still live in a small house with holes and leaks?"  
“你为什么要向佛陀祈祷？”我曾问过光阿姨。其他人都在睡觉，我醒来喝水时发现她在他们的小神龛前祈祷。“向佛陀祈祷和向上帝祈祷有什么不同？如果仍然住在一个有洞和漏水的小房子里，祈祷的意义何在？”

At first she didn't answer, eyes closed and hands pressed together. Between her palms was a rosary made of pale sandalwood, while her lips uttered words too soft for me to discern. Upon the altar, an empty slot on a bookshelf, there were offerings of water and raspberries. As well as a tupperware container on the right filled with baking soda to hold the incense, the smell of which singed at my lungs. Resting upon a red silk pillow with worn threads was a metal bowl, smoke swirling over it and curling around the Buddha idol in the center. After a moment, she struck the bowl with a wooden stick and I understood then why they called it a singing bowl.  
起初她没有回答，双眼紧闭，双手合十。掌间夹着一串淡黄檀香木的念珠，而她的唇间低语，声音轻柔得让我难以分辨。在书架上的空位，即祭坛上，摆放着水和覆盆子的供品。右侧还有一个装满小苏打的特百惠容器，用于盛放香料，其气味刺痛了我的肺。一个金属碗置于红色丝绸枕垫上，线头磨损，烟雾缭绕其上，缠绕着中央的佛像。片刻后，她用木棒敲击碗，我这才明白为何人们称其为“歌唱碗”。

She smiled that smile of hers, the kind that seemed full of some boundless wisdom, but never judged you for knowing less.  
她露出了那种微笑，充满无尽智慧，却从不因你知之甚少而评判你。

"I don't pray to Buddha. Not in the same way someone might pray to God," she said, the voice of the bell fading.  
“我不向佛陀祈祷。不是以人们向神祈祷的那种方式，”她说道，铃声渐消。

"But you pray like Christians do."  
“但你祈祷的方式和基督徒一样。”

She had giggled at that. "There are many different types of worship, Kazuya. For Buddhism, it is about showing respect towards the things we admire. The shakyamuni is a symbol of human perfection, an ideal to strive for. The aromas of incense remind us of the influence of virtue. The lamps remind us of the light of knowledge and the flowers, which soon fade and die, remind us of impermanence. When we bow, we express outwardly what we feel inwardly; our gratitude for what Buddha has taught us. The point isn't to pray for things, but to have faith in something larger than ourselves."  
她听到这话时咯咯笑了起来。“崇拜有很多种形式，和也。对于佛教来说，这是向我们敬仰的事物表示敬意。释迦牟尼是人类完美的象征，是我们追求的理想。香烟的香气让我们想起美德的影响。灯火象征着知识的光芒，而那些很快凋谢的花朵则提醒我们无常的道理。当我们鞠躬时，我们表达的是内心所感；我们对佛陀教诲的感激之情。重点不在于祈求什么，而在于对超越我们自身的事物抱有信念。”

"But why?" “但为什么呢？”

"I can't answer that for you," she said kindly, shifting to face me while still sitting on her knees. The hand wrapped with her rosary reached out, a finger poking my chest. "That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Whether with God or Buddha, we all have to look within, not without, to find understanding."  
“我无法替你回答这个问题，”她温和地说道，一边调整姿势面对我，仍然跪坐着。她缠着念珠的手伸出来，用手指戳了戳我的胸口。“这是你需要自己去弄清楚的事情。无论是通过上帝还是佛陀，我们都需要向内而非向外寻找理解。”

She kissed the top of my head, a mother to all under her care, and sent me back to bed. I laid wide awake the rest of the night trying to decipher her words. When morning came, she set about her prayers once more, the ring of the singing bowl ushering in the dawn. Aunt Hikari's sons, much to her occasional lament, were not very diligent Buddhists like her. She never impressed such things upon me, however. Either because she was too polite, or because both my mother and father were devout in nothing, and she assumed I would turn out the same anyway.  
她亲吻了我的头顶，对所有她照顾的人如同母亲一般，然后让我回床上睡觉。那一夜我辗转反侧，试图解读她的话语。清晨来临，她再次开始祈祷，颂钵的回响迎来了黎明。姨妈光子的儿子们，虽然她偶尔会为此叹息，却并不像她那样虔诚的佛教徒。然而，她从未将这些强加于我。或许是因为她太过礼貌，又或许是因为我的父母对任何信仰都无动于衷，她认为我也会如此。

But recently I had noticed the trinket my mother had begun to carry with her. The golden cross she tried to hide under her shirts, the chain of which I had glimpsed around her neck beneath the collar of her suits. I wondered about God again, because only a week ago we were told that Grandfather Langley had passed away, and I wondered where he would go. Would he go back to the scar in the sky? Did that mean he would be able to come back again? No one seemed to have an answer, not even the Ecclesiastes and their Third Eye.  
但最近我注意到母亲开始随身携带一个小饰品。她试图将那枚金色十字架藏在衬衫下，而我曾在她的西装领口下瞥见那条链子。我又一次思考起上帝，因为就在一周前，我们得知兰利外公去世了，我好奇他会去往何方。他会回到天际的伤痕中吗？这是否意味着他能够再次回来？似乎没有人能给出答案，就连拥有第三眼的圣经学者们也不例外。

Germany was a dreary and chilly country, at least when I went. It was sometime in September and I was ten. At the funeral home there were crowds and cliques of people I'd never met, and likely never would again. My parents and I were separated from everyone else, both during the wake and the procession to the graveyard. No one paid us much mind, even though my mother was the man's only daughter. It didn't matter to everyone else. Ever since Impact, he had a new life. A new family.  
德国是个阴沉而寒冷的国家，至少我去的时候是这样。那是在九月，我十岁。在殡仪馆里，我见到了许多从未谋面的人，可能以后也不会再见到。我和父母与其他人隔离开来，无论是守灵期间还是前往墓地的队伍中。即便我母亲是那位唯一的女儿，也没人太在意我们。对其他人来说，这并不重要。自从那次撞击事件后，他开始了新生活，有了新家庭。

Afterward, while my mother socialized, more out of a stubborn refusal to be ignored than anything else, we stood off to the side and away from everyone. I'd been watching the other people at the ceremony, many of whom were sporting U.S. Army uniforms. I watched the aunts, cousins and sisters cry when caretakers buried the casket, feeling out of place since I couldn't be as sad as them. I tried to be.  
之后，母亲在社交场合中显得格外坚持，与其说是出于社交需求，不如说是固执地拒绝被忽视。我们站在一旁，远离众人。我一直观察着葬礼上的其他人，其中许多人穿着美国陆军制服。我看着阿姨、表亲和姐妹们在棺木下葬时哭泣，感到自己格格不入，因为我无法像她们那样悲伤。我尽力了。

"How come mom doesn't cry?" I had asked. Not a single tear the entire time, just that small cross in her hand.  
“为什么妈妈不哭呢？”我问道。她全程没有一滴眼泪，只是手里握着一个小小的十字架。

"She's never really gotten along with her father," dad said, distant, hands in his pocket while he followed her movements.  
"她和她父亲一直不太合得来，" 爸爸说，语气遥远，双手插在口袋里，随着她的动作移动目光。

"If she hated him, then why did we come to his funeral?"  
"如果她恨他，那我们为什么要来参加他的葬礼？"

"She didn't hate him... at least not as much as she thought."  
"她并不恨他……至少没有她以为的那么恨。"

"Then she should have just said so."  
"那她应该直接说出来。"

"It's not so easy, Kazuya. Wouldn't you–" he stopped, something pained revealing itself, despite the sunglasses hiding his eyes. We didn't talk the rest of the ceremony. Even then, I knew what it was he was going to ask.  
"没那么简单，和也。你难道不会——" 他顿住了，尽管墨镜遮住了他的眼睛，某种痛苦的情感还是流露了出来。仪式剩下的时间里我们都没再说话。即便如此，我也知道他打算问什么。

_Wouldn't_ _**you**_ _be sad if I was gone?_  
如果我不在了，你不会难过吗？

I didn't give him the answer hanging on the tip of my tongue, reasoning that it would only upset mother. In truth, I didn't know the answer then anymore than I do now. In the moment, I imagine that I am at my father's funeral instead. I imagine that I am like my mother, that I am brave and that I do not cry. In some moments I hold my mother's golden cross and light a candle for him and pray. In others I gather flowers and burn incense and ring the singing bowl.  
我没有将悬在舌尖的答案告诉他，因为那只会让母亲难过。事实上，当时的我并不比现在更清楚答案。那一刻，我幻想着自己身处父亲的葬礼。我幻想着自己像母亲一样，勇敢且不流泪。有时，我握着母亲的金色十字架，为他点燃蜡烛并祈祷。其他时候，我采集花朵，焚香，敲响颂钵。

But in every instance, I feel empty.  
但在每一次，我都感到空虚。

### Chapter 12: December 13

It's happened. 事情发生了。

I've started to miss her.  
我开始想念她了。

The clock on the wall ticks, steadily passing the time in an apartment that is half empty and so very, very quiet. I could turn on the T.V. but there is nothing that I would care to watch, or I could fire up the computer, though there is nowhere on the net that I really need to go. Harry's book sits on the dining table in front of me, the edges already a bit worn from use. It's closed, for now, and I can't even muster the will to read any of it today. The book doesn't answer the questions I have, not in the way that I want. There aren't any shortcuts in life, not when it comes to trying to figure out how to relate to a father you don't know, or trying to figure out why you're so lonely – even though I was as lonely as ever when me and Marina were still together.  
墙上的时钟滴答作响，稳步流逝着时间，在这间半空荡荡、异常寂静的公寓里。我可以打开电视，但没有什么是我愿意看的；或者我可以启动电脑，尽管网上也没有什么地方是我非去不可的。哈里的书就放在我面前的餐桌桌上，边缘已经因为使用而有些磨损。现在它是合着的，我今天甚至提不起劲去读它。这本书没有回答我心中的疑问，不是我想要的那种方式。生活中没有捷径，无论是试图理解一个你不熟悉的父亲，还是试图弄清楚为什么你会如此孤独——即使在我和玛丽娜还在一起的时候，我也同样孤独。

Just this morning I caught myself heating up two mugs of coffee in the microwave. The black flooring, where there used to be linoleum, was sticky under my bare feet, but at least it's stopped smelling like burnt Colombian beans. The french press continues to sit idle.  
就在今早，我发现自己正在用微波炉加热两杯咖啡。原本铺着亚麻油地毡的黑色地板现在黏糊糊的，但至少不再散发着烧焦的哥伦比亚咖啡豆味了。法式压滤壶依旧闲置着。

I check my right wrist, where a watch ticks in-sync with the clock on the wall. Perfect, synchronous clacks of time passing in utter harmony. There is a crack on the glass and the metal that keeps it snug around my wrist has worn away at the edges, showing the light copper beneath the silver paint. The gold inlay has flaked a bit too. It is not a cheap watch, by any means. The fact that I have had it since I was thirteen is testament enough to that.  
我检查了一下右手腕，那里有一块手表与墙上的时钟同步跳动。完美同步的滴答声，时间流逝得如此和谐。表玻璃上有一道裂痕，固定表带的金属边缘已经磨损，露出了下面淡淡的铜色。金色镶嵌部分也有些剥落。这绝不是一块廉价的手表。我十三岁起就拥有它，这足以证明其价值。

There's little else I've carried with me since leaving home. Nearly everything in my apartment is new. The furniture, the appliances, the calendar and clock, as well as the two little wooden elephant figurines on the kitchen bar-top. No pictures on the walls. Marina had put all of those up, gone now. She took the book cases too, along with all the books. She must have gotten her brothers in to help her move everything. The collection of ceramic unicorns she inherited from her grandmother have been whisked away, leaving cordoned off spaces in the carpet. I used to complain about how much space her things took up in our already small apartment.  
自从离开家后，我随身携带的东西寥寥无几。我公寓里几乎所有东西都是新的。家具、电器、日历和时钟，还有厨房吧台上那对小木象摆件。墙上没有挂照片。玛丽娜曾经挂满了这些，现在她走了。她连书架和所有书都带走了，想必是叫她兄弟们来帮忙搬的。她从祖母那里继承的那套陶瓷独角兽也不见了，地毯上留下了被划出的空地。我过去常抱怨她的东西在我们本就狭小的公寓里占用了太多空间。

I was expecting there to be a lot tears out of this. I'd imagined for the past few months what I would say when I told Marina we should part ways, even accepted the fact that when she started to weep and beg me to stay, I would concede, and we would be happy for a month or so. Then we would each fall back into the same routine and be miserable again.  
我原本以为这件事会引发很多泪水。过去几个月里，我一直在想象告诉玛丽娜我们应该分手时会说些什么，甚至接受了当她开始哭泣并恳求我留下时，我会妥协，我们会快乐一阵子。然后我们又会各自回到相同的日常，再次变得痛苦。

Yet here I am, in a studio apartment that feels far too big. For all her faults, Marina was a kind enough soul. She had her own traumas to deal with, but we all do, and in the end I was the one who made her cruel and filled her with insecurities. If I'd been able to love her, surely things wouldn't have turned out this way.  
然而此刻我站在这里，身处一间感觉过于宽敞的工作室公寓。尽管玛丽娜有诸多缺点，但她本性善良。她有自己的创伤需要面对，但谁又没有呢？最终，是我让她变得刻薄，充满不安全感。如果我能爱她，事情肯定不会发展到这一步。

On the table, next to the book, is a new bottle of prescribed anxiety pills. I've taken two this morning, but after going without for a week, I really did need them. Despite the warnings on the capsule, I've also finished off at least four cups of caffeine, mostly because there is nothing else for me to do. I have a flight later in the day, my suitcase is already packed and I don't have work, so aside from the coffee, there's really only one thing left to do until I leave. It's just working up to it that's proving to be a problem. Despite our talks and our awkward laughs, I know one of us is going to pry the wrong way and this ticking time bomb between us is going to burst.  
桌上，书旁放着一瓶新开的处方抗焦虑药。今早我已服下两粒，毕竟停药一周后确实需要它们。尽管胶囊上有警告，我还是喝完了至少四杯咖啡因饮料，主要是因为除此之外我无事可做。今天晚些时候我有一趟航班，行李已经打包好，也没有工作，所以除了咖啡，剩下的唯一一件事就是鼓起勇气去做。尽管我们交谈着，尴尬地笑着，我知道我们中有人会问错问题，而我们之间的这颗定时炸弹终将爆炸。

I take another anxiety pill as I dial my father. When we greet one another, the silence has become less uncomfortable and more a ritual practice of our contact. We each scrounge for what might pass as normal, everyday conversation, like how mother is doing, or I might inquire about his garden, while he asks me how work is. It's the only thing he asks about, since it is the only facet of my life he is at all familiar with.  
我再次服下一颗抗焦虑药，然后拨通了父亲的电话。当我们互相问候时，沉默已不再那么令人不适，反而更像是我们联系中的一种仪式。我们各自搜寻着可能被视为平常的日常话题，比如母亲的情况，或者我会询问他的花园，而他则问我工作如何。这是他唯一会问的事情，因为这也是他唯一熟悉的我生活的一面。

Inevitably, we come to subject both of us have been dancing around.  
不可避免地，我们谈到了双方都在回避的话题。

"So they only had a few Evas, right?" I finally ask, fingers tapping against my knee. "Who else was in your, ah – squadron?" I'm sure I've just made a fool of myself, but I've no idea what one might call a whole unit of Evangelions. It seems like a solid guess.  
“所以他们只有几台 EVA，对吧？”我终于问道，手指轻敲着膝盖。“你的，呃——中队里还有谁？”我确信自己刚才显得很傻，但我实在不知道该如何称呼一整支 EVA 部队。这似乎是个合理的猜测。

I'm relieved when he doesn't correct me. "Well, your mom wasn't transferred over until after the third battle... I knew Rei before that. Rei Ayanami."  
他没纠正我，我松了口气。“嗯，你妈妈是在第三次战斗后才调过来的……在那之前我就认识绫波了。绫波零。”

I know that name. Not from Harry's book, but from that article on the net. "Were you good friends?"  
我知道这个名字。不是从哈利的书上，而是从那篇网上的文章里。“你们是好朋友吗？”

"Not really. At least, not in the sense other people understand. She was real quiet, barely talked to anybody."  
“不算吧。至少不是别人理解的那种。她很安静，几乎不和任何人说话。”

"Guess she, uh, must've liked you then. Did she... ever come back?"  
"看来她当时一定挺喜欢你的。她后来...有回来过吗？"

"No," he says, just a little too quick. He catches himself, and when he speaks again, he sounds like he's spent the last decade smoking. "No, she... she died."  
"没有，"他回答得稍微快了些。他意识到自己的失态，再次开口时，声音听起来像是经历了十年的烟熏。"没有，她...她去世了。"

"Oh... sorry." I mean it too. I shouldn't have assumed, but, there are still plenty of people up in the red scar. I thought maybe–  
"哦...抱歉。"我是真心的。我不该妄加揣测，但，红疤区还有不少人居住。我以为或许...

"It was the Seventeenth Angel," he says, straining as he reaches for something. "This long halo of light. It started to penetrate the Eva – split into it and infect it like a virus. Rei set her core to self-destruct to kill it."  
"那是第十七使徒，"他说着，努力伸手去拿某样东西。"这道长长的光环。它开始穿透 Eva——像病毒一样分裂并感染它。绫波启动了自毁核心来消灭它。"

An Angel of light. How desperate was the war that one of the few machines built to fight them could be sacrificed like that? My echoing and dust-gathering apartment, with its ticking gears, is so far removed from such a world. I'm in a bubble, trying to communicate with the beings outside.  
一个光之使徒。这场战争是多么绝望，以至于用来对抗它们的少数机器之一可以被如此牺牲？我那充满回声和积尘的公寓，伴随着齿轮的滴答声，与这样的世界相距甚远。我身处一个气泡中，试图与外界的生物沟通。

"Where was mom?" I ask. Surely she wouldn't just sit by during a battle like that. Was she injured? Was she close with Rei too?  
"妈妈在哪里？"我问。她肯定不会在那样一场战斗中袖手旁观。她受伤了吗？她和绫波也很亲近吗？

"She couldn't connect to her Eva anymore... couldn't even get it to move. Rei engaged the Angel first and they sent me in as backup, but my power line was cut and it started to infect Unit-one too. There was nothing we could do."  
"她再也无法与她的 Eva 建立联系...甚至无法让它移动。丽首先与使徒交战，他们派我作为后备支援，但我的电源线被切断，也开始感染一号机。我们无能为力。"

Over the line, I can hear the faint sounds of purring, wondering if he's taken Myshka – the cat he claims to hate – into his lap.  
通过电话线，我能听到微弱的呼噜声，不知道他是否把米什卡——他声称讨厌的那只猫——抱在了腿上。

"Did she have any family?"  
"她有家人吗？"

The crackling static between us lasts far too long.  
我们之间噼啪作响的静电持续得太久了。

"No. No one but my father."  
“不，除了我父亲，没有别人。”

I blink. "I... I don't understand, was she your half-sister or something?"  
我眨了眨眼。“我……我不明白，她是你的同父异母妹妹还是什么？”

"Best to just leave this one be, son."  
"最好还是别管这件事了，孩子。"

He's gotten frustrated, changed subjects or outright refused to discuss something further, but he's ever warned me away from it. I stand, heading into the kitchen, which has become some sort of strange refuge with our conversations. Most of the other tiles have been ripped up.  
他有时会感到沮丧，改变话题或干脆拒绝进一步讨论某事，但他从未警告我远离它。我站起来，走向厨房，那里已经成为我们谈话的某种奇怪避难所。大多数其他瓷砖已经被拆掉了。

"Your mother tells me you're still with that girl, Marina," he says before I can think of something to prolong the conversation with. I very much doubt that's what she actually said, but his tone is back to normal, content to forget we ever talked about the pilot named Rei Ayanami.  
"你妈妈告诉我你还在和那个叫玛丽娜的女孩在一起，"他抢在我想到什么来延长对话之前说道。我非常怀疑她真的这么说过，但他的语气恢复正常了，乐意忘记我们曾谈论过那个名叫绫波零的飞行员。

It's hard to speak. Admitting you're alone and unhappy is easy enough in your own head, but saying things like that out loud validates them – makes them real. My eyes betray me, looking to the torn envelope on the counter by the sink.  
开口说话很难。承认自己孤独且不快乐，在心里倒不难，但把这些话说出口，就等于承认了它们的真实性——让它们变得真实。我的目光不由自主地飘向水槽旁柜台上那封撕破的信封。

"No, not anymore," I say, shrugging. There's no point in lying. I stare at the open letter, enjoying the sensation of falling that my peripherals create from the black hole beneath me.  
“不，不再是了，”我耸耸肩说。撒谎毫无意义。我盯着那封展开的信，享受着从我脚下的黑洞中产生的坠落感，这种感觉由我的视野边缘营造出来。

"That's a shame," he says, hesitating, now the one treading on thin ice.  
“那真是遗憾，”他说道，犹豫不决，现在轮到他在薄冰上行走。

"Dad... is there..." I make something between a groan and a sigh, a hand roughing my hair. "Is there something wrong with me?"  
"爸爸...是不是...我..." 我发出介于呻吟和叹息之间的声音，一只手粗鲁地揉着我的头发。"我是不是有什么问题？"

"What do you mean? Are you sick?"  
"你什么意思？你生病了吗？"

"No, I mean... me and Marina broke up a couple weeks ago and..." I pace around, peering at the window and trying not to give into the urge to tear at the linoleum or Yuki's letter. "I hurt her. I know it's because there's something wrong with me. I... I can't keep a relationship with anyone. I always drive them off, or they leave and I don't know... I don't know how to... _fix_ myself."  
"不，我是说...我和玛丽娜几周前分手了，而且..." 我来回踱步，盯着窗户，努力克制住撕扯油毡地板或优树的信的冲动。"我伤害了她。我知道这是因为我有问题。我...我无法维持任何一段关系。我总是把他们赶走，或者他们离开，我不知道...我不知道怎么...修复自己。"

It comes out quiet when I say it. But it's true, I'm broken. That's the only way I can reason feeling like this. The only way I can explain losing Yuki and never getting her back, not the way I always imagined. I'd been able to forget about that for a while. She likes to send me letters, since both of us have always hated talking on the phone and sitting with pen and paper lets her kill an hour or so while out at sea. We'll have five or six conversations going in the same correspondence. Recently, knowing that she's engaged, knowing that she gets to be happy while I wake up alone in the morning, it's been getting harder and harder reading what she writes.  
我说这话时声音很轻。但这是真的，我破碎了。这是我唯一能解释这种感觉的方式。唯一能解释失去由纪并再也无法以我曾幻想的方式找回她的方式。我曾一度能够忘记这一点。她喜欢给我写信，因为我们俩一直讨厌打电话，而用笔和纸让她能在海上消磨一两个小时。我们会在同一封信中进行五六次对话。最近，知道她订婚了，知道她能幸福而我早上醒来却独自一人，阅读她写的东西变得越来越难。

I've never been a good boyfriend, and it looks like I'm not much of a friend, either.  
我从来就不是一个好男友，看起来也不是一个好朋友。

"There's nothing wrong with you," dad tells me, gentle, and I can see those sad eyes of his. "That's just how people are... there's nothing wrong with you."  
“你没什么不对，”爸爸温柔地告诉我，我可以看到他那双悲伤的眼睛。“人就是这样...你没什么不对。”

I don't believe him. 我不相信他。

So I don't say anything. I wish he could see, wish he could admit to how hard those times were. I wonder if he knows – if Misato has told him that his son is just like him. No, he couldn't know. My aunt has always been one to keep secrets.  
所以我什么也没说。我希望他能明白，希望他能承认那些时光有多艰难。我不知道他是否知情——美里是否告诉过他，他的儿子和他如出一辙。不，他不可能知道。我的阿姨总是善于保守秘密。

I listen to the cat hum.  
我听着猫儿发出呼噜声。

"Your mom used to hate me," he says. "Back when we were pilots. Hated my guts."  
“你妈妈以前讨厌我，”他说，“在我们还是飞行员的时候。恨透了我。”

Despite their old arguments, I find this far more difficult to believe. To me, they've always been together and I can't really picture a time when they weren't.  
尽管他们有过争执，我发现这很难相信。对我来说，他们一直在一起，我无法想象他们不在一起的时光。

A bit of a chuckle comes through his end. "You should see this cat right now. He's a real snuggle bug, you know. Always manages to sleep on my face when we go to bed."  
他那边传来一丝轻笑。“你该看看这只猫现在的样子。真是个黏人的小家伙，你知道的。每次我们睡觉时，它总能设法睡在我脸上。”

"Sounds like he's more your cat than mom's."  
“听起来他更像你的猫，而不是妈妈的。”

He huffs. "She won't admit it, but it's true. Little beast peed on my shoes his first day and then he was my best friend. I prefer the dog."  
他哼了一声。“她不会承认的，但这是真的。小家伙第一天就在我的鞋子上撒尿，然后就成了我的好朋友。我更喜欢那只狗。”

I think this is the first real grin I've had in days. That dog always did know how to bring my smiles back. "You remember when Frau used to get real excited whenever we got back?"  
我想这是我几天来第一次真正露出笑容。那只狗总是知道如何让我重展笑颜。“你还记得弗劳每次我们回来时都会变得特别兴奋吗？”

He laughs. "She'd start spinning in circles trying to catch her little nub of a tail."  
他笑了。“她会开始转圈圈，试图抓住她那小尾巴尖。”

Even with thoughts of our old war dog, I can hear it, the act he's putting on for me. He's still thinking about what I said, about what else he could possibly say in return. I'm not sure that I want him to say anything, or what resonance I was trying to achieve by bringing it up. To think that I can't keep those things to myself and just deal with them. He must think me a sorry excuse for an adult.  
即使心中想着我们那只老战犬，我也能听出他在为我表演的把戏。他仍在思考我刚才说的话，想着还能说些什么来回应。我不确定是否希望他说些什么，或者我提起这件事是想达到什么效果。想想我连这些事都藏不住，只能自己处理。他一定觉得我是个糟糕的大人。

"Kazuya..." he says, reaching out only to fall short.  
“和也……”他说着，伸出手却未能触及。

I check my watch and swallow.  
我看了看手表，咽了口唾沫。

"Well, hey, I've got to go. I'll see you soon, okay?" I say, even though my flight isn't leaving for another four hours, and he agrees, reluctantly. I hang up and set the phone on the table, face down, standing in the quiet with nothing to do.  
“好吧，嘿，我得走了。很快再见，好吗？”我说，尽管我的航班还有四个小时才起飞，他勉强同意了。我挂断电话，将手机面朝下放在桌上，站在寂静中无所事事。

The watch on my wrist has stopped ticking.  
我手腕上的手表已经停止了走动。

### Interlude XII

The baseball field at Catalina Foothills High School was a sad affair. For maybe a few months out of the year it would be a spotty green after a new layer of sod grass failed yet again to take to the dry soil. More often than not games turned into a sand storm, coating everyone in a layer of orange grit.  
卡塔利娜山麓高中的棒球场显得颇为凄凉。一年中或许有几个月，新铺的草皮再次未能适应干燥的土壤，使得场地呈现出斑驳的绿色。而更多时候，比赛变成了一场沙尘暴，让每个人都披上一层橙色的沙粒。

I would hang out on the other side of the fence, watching the games by a particularly tall cactus that occasionally graced me with shade. With the winds and the sands, I'd imagine skim-boarding in Florida. Holding that thin plate of wood up to my chest, waiting for the right moment. As the waves spilled over the coast, my body would shiver as I watched the tide suck them back in, until there was just the barest sheen of water clinging to the sands – there! The perfect moment. I'd run and throw the board down ahead of me, streaking over the beach atop it and basking in the sharp spray of the sea.  
我常常会溜到栅栏的另一边，躲在一株特别高的仙人掌旁观看比赛，偶尔它还会赐予我一片阴凉。在风沙之中，我会想象自己在佛罗里达玩滑水板。将那块薄薄的木板抱在胸前，等待着最佳时机。当海浪涌上海岸，我的身体会因观看潮水将它们卷回而颤抖，直到沙滩上只剩下最微弱的水光——就是现在！完美的时刻。我会奔跑并将滑水板向前抛出，骑在上面沿着海滩疾驰，享受着海浪溅起的清凉水花。

Inevitably, the water would recede, and the board would catch in the sand, sending me tumbling down face first. I'd get back up, caked in muck, but determined to watch the shores again, waiting for the next moment to grasp.  
不可避免地，水会退去，滑水板会在沙中卡住，让我一头栽倒。我会爬起来，满身泥泞，但决心再次守望海岸，等待下一次抓住机会的时刻。

That was all just a part of the dream. In reality, I was never very good at predicting the tides. Not those of the ocean, and certainly not those of people.  
那一切都只是梦的一部分。现实中，我从来都不擅长预测潮汐。无论是海洋的，还是人的。

Everyone has at least one bad year of high school. It's a fumbling journey, navigating relationships, figuring out where your place is in the social hierarchy, if anywhere. Most kids had their parents to talk to, or a relative, a friend. Someone. I'd managed to isolate myself from everyone, even Misato, the only person who had ever come close to understanding. Everyone else I knew was too busy wallowing in their own paradigms, as people often do and I didn't know how to seek out help, even if I had ever entertained the notion to past sixteen. I was far too stubborn. All I had was me. For a while, I convinced myself that was all I needed.  
每个人在高中至少都会有一段糟糕的时光。这是一段摸索前行的旅程，在人际关系中寻找自己的位置，无论在社交等级中处于何处。大多数孩子都有父母或亲戚、朋友可以倾诉。有些人。我设法将自己与所有人隔离开来，甚至连唯一接近理解我的美里也不例外。我所认识的其他人都在忙于沉浸在自己的世界里，人们常常如此，而我也不知道如何寻求帮助，即便我曾有过这样的念头，也早已在十六岁之前打消了。我太过固执。我拥有的只有我自己。有一段时间，我甚至说服自己，这就足够了。

The lone hour after school was blissful, with music to drown out the stagnant buzz of Tucson before I inevitably had to return to the front lines. Everyone would sit under the aluminum awnings waiting for our fleet of buses to arrive, the hordes of us without beat up cars of our own, or wealthy parents to buy us camaros and mustangs. Among them, a raggedy girl would be waiting there with her gaggle of outcasts, freckles splashed over her toffee brown skin.  
放学后的独处时光是如此美妙，音乐淹没了图森沉闷的喧嚣，直到我不得不重返前线。所有人都会坐在铝制遮阳篷下，等待我们的公交车队到来，我们这些没有破旧汽车或富裕父母为我们购买科迈罗和野马的人。在他们中间，一个衣衫褴褛的女孩会和她的那群被排斥者一起等待，她那太妃糖色的皮肤上点缀着雀斑。

"Stevie," she'd said the first time we met, with a touch of Georgia drawl. "You know, like Stevie Wonder?" she smelled of cigarettes. That scent of smoldering ash, bitter and stinging cool mint. It was heavenly.  
“斯蒂薇，”我们初次见面时她拖着一丝乔治亚州的口音说道，“你知道的，就像斯蒂薇·旺德？”她身上散发着香烟的味道，那股闷烧的灰烬气息，苦涩而带着刺鼻的薄荷凉意，却出奇地令人陶醉。

I told her I didn't care and she laughed, calling me an asshole. That was nothing new, but I still thought about how good it would feel to sink my knuckles into her face. By the time I was seventeen I'd beaten up plenty of boys, never a girl. It was all of that tension building up at home finally getting out, set off as suddenly as my father's episodes.  
我告诉她我不在乎，她笑骂我是混蛋。这并不新鲜，但我仍忍不住想象着将拳头砸进她脸上的快感。到我十七岁时，已经揍过不少男孩，从未对女孩动过手。这一切都是家中积压的紧张情绪终于爆发，就像我父亲突如其来的发作一样。

Something always set him off. Little, insignificant things. He'd enter a rage, and that fire lanced out to everyone around him. There was no reasoning with him when he was like that. When he screamed about Angels or stood in our front yard thinking he was somewhere else. Like those hurricanes back on the east coast, we just had to wait for the storm to roll over.  
总有事情会激怒他，微不足道的小事。他会陷入狂怒，那股怒火如利箭般射向周围每一个人。他那样时是无法讲道理的。当他尖叫着谈论天使，或站在前院以为自己身在别处时。就像东海岸的飓风，我们只能等待风暴过去。

Sometimes mother caught the worst of it and chose to fight back, even if it only made things worse. So sometimes I never went back after school. Sometimes I didn't listen to music, and just stayed on the bus, looking back at Stevie as she wrote on the backrest with a sharpie, scribbling hearts and secret messages. Leaning across the aisle, she told me she was wearing a thong, indulging in a cruel delight when I blushed. It shouldn't have bothered me so much, but it did, and I hated her for being able to get under my skin so easily.  
有时母亲会遭受最严重的打击并选择反击，即便这只会让情况更糟。所以有时放学后我再也不回去。有时我不听音乐，只是留在公交车上，回头看着 Stevie 用马克笔在后座上涂鸦，画着心形和秘密信息。她越过过道靠过来，告诉我她穿了丁字裤，当我脸红时她享受着残忍的快感。这本不该让我如此困扰，但它确实如此，我恨她能如此轻易地触动我的情绪。

Out by the baseball field where I dreamed of skimming along the coast, I watched as she pressed her ass next to me against the chain fence, blowing smoke in my eyes. She said she'd never seen me smile before. In her hand was a pack of Marlboros, a bud waiting to be plucked from the pack. My mother's old threats rang from a world away, but I took it anyway. Stevie was close enough I could imagine how soft her hoodie would feel, or her neck as I buried my face in her fleshy, sour-sweet aroma.  
在棒球场外，我梦想着沿着海岸滑行，看着她把屁股紧贴着我靠在铁丝网上，朝我眼睛吹烟。她说她以前从未见我笑过。她手里拿着一包万宝路，一支烟等待被抽出。我母亲的旧威胁从遥远的世界传来，但我还是接过了烟。Stevie 近得让我可以想象她的连帽衫会有多柔软，或是当我把脸埋进她那酸甜交织的肉感香气中时，她的脖子会是什么感觉。

I tossed the cigarette and told her to leave, and she did so with a string of insults, all of which explicitly claimed I was gay.  
我扔掉了香烟，让她离开，她便带着一连串侮辱走了，所有这些都明确声称我是同性恋。

On the way home, down unpaved roads riddled with cacti, I filled a plastic bag with prickly pears, purple and ripe. I sat them in a pot of hot water, letting the needle spines stab into my palms as I rubbed them off the stubborn fruit. Mother told me to wear gloves, and I couldn't reason why that angered me. I ended up throwing the pears away, unopened and bare. I spent the rest of the night digging thorns from my fingers.  
在回家的路上，沿着满是仙人掌的土路，我装满了一袋紫红熟透的仙人果。我将它们放在一锅热水里，任由针刺扎进手掌，用力搓掉那些顽固的果刺。妈妈让我戴手套，我却不明白为何这让我生气。最终，我扔掉了那些未曾剥开的果实，赤裸裸地。那一晚剩下的时间，我都在挑手指里的刺。

Stevie came back, all smarmy smiles again. Why? Why did she bother? All the taunts and jibes on the bus home, always putting herself in my space. Why was it so hard to hate her?  
斯蒂维又回来了，又是那副自鸣得意的笑容。为什么？她为何要这样？放学回家的公交车上，所有的嘲讽和挖苦，总是侵占我的空间。为何如此难以恨她？

She turned me around, her arms on either side of my head. She was about as tall as me. A cactus stretched over us, its arms up in surrender, or perhaps it was reaching for the sun. I could see her jaw clench as she inched closer, something fierce and all at once wounded letting itself through her eyes, which I had never bothered to take a good look at. They weren't just dark brown, but black, touched with hidden flecks of pale gold.  
她转过我，双臂撑在我头的两侧。她和我差不多高。一株仙人掌在我们上方伸展，仿佛在投降，又或许是在追逐阳光。我看到她咬紧牙关，一点点靠近，眼中流露出既强烈又受伤的神情，这是我从未仔细看过的。那不仅仅是深棕色，而是近乎黑色，点缀着隐约的淡金色斑点。

I imagined moving to grab her, to take her hips in my hands. Her dry, cracked lips were so close I could taste the menthol on her tongue. I hesitated, and didn't realize I'd been holding onto the fence so tight.  
我幻想着伸手去抓她，双手握住她的腰。她干裂的嘴唇近在咫尺，我几乎能尝到她舌尖上的薄荷味。我犹豫了，没意识到自己一直紧紧抓着栅栏。

By my head, her fingers cinched the metal links together and she asked, "Who'd want to kiss you anyway?"  
她的手指紧扣着金属链，靠近我的头，问道：“谁会想吻你呢？”

What must she have felt when I shoved her? I'm sure the spines of the cactus must have stung as they dug into her shoulder, and the ground chalky and hard as she fell. I had a moment to feel it, like I'd just caught a falling steel beam on my arms, the impending weight of loathing and loneliness. So much passed through her, contorting her expression so that only her anger and hatred were at all translatable.  
当我推开她时，她会有什么感觉？我确信仙人掌的刺一定扎痛了她的肩膀，而她跌落的地方，地面干燥坚硬。那一刻，我感觉自己仿佛用双臂接住了一根坠落的钢梁，即将承受厌恶与孤独的重压。她的情感如此复杂，扭曲了她的表情，以至于只有愤怒和憎恨还能被解读。

Later, out behind the bleachers, I dug my fingers into my stomach. Dragging them deep until I had ugly, bleeding tears of skin.  
后来，在看台后面，我用力将手指插进肚子。深深地划拉着，直到皮肤撕裂，流出鲜血，留下丑陋的痕迹。

At home, the curtains were drawn and the air felt ill. My mother stood on the stairs, the glaring light spilling in from behind setting her in shadow and draping her shoulders in the colors of harvest. She didn't notice me, only watched the door to her room where my father surely sat.  
回到家，窗帘紧闭，空气显得沉闷。母亲站在楼梯上，身后透进的刺眼光线将她笼罩在阴影中，肩上仿佛披着收获季节的色彩。她没注意到我，只是盯着她房间的门，父亲肯定就在里面。

I thought of how I'd pushed Stevie into that cactus. I thought of my father's anger.  
我想起了我是如何把史蒂维推到仙人掌上的。我想起了父亲的愤怒。

I wondered if the war had really made him this way, or if it was just him.  
我在想，这场战争是否真的让他变成了这样，还是他原本就是如此。

**Author's Notes:** next chapter will be up sometime next week. Probably. Looking back on some of the more recent installments, there's definitely stuff I want to change/cut out, but for now I think they serve their purpose. One day I'll come back and make some things a little more cohesive. Have to finish this first. Chapters have never felt as far away as these last seven.  
作者笔记：下一章将在下周某个时候更新。大概吧。回顾最近的一些章节，确实有些内容我想修改或删减，但目前我认为它们仍有其作用。总有一天我会回来让某些部分更加连贯。首先得完成这一章。这些最后的七章从未让我感觉如此遥远。

### Chapter 13: December 15

Not a moment after ringing the bell, little feet stampede down the hall, and there's Nina – swinging the front door open.  
刚按下门铃，小脚丫就噼里啪啦地冲过走廊，接着是妮娜——猛地推开前门。

"Hi, Kazuya! Welcome home!"  
“嗨，和也！欢迎回家！”

It seems I've been expected.  
看来我被期待已久了。

"Uh, hey," I say, glancing to the driveway. Past my rental truck, dad's car is there – mother's is not. Then the girl's words register. "This isn't my house."  
"呃，嘿，" 我说着，目光瞥向车道。在我租来的卡车后面，爸爸的车停在那里——妈妈的车却不见踪影。然后女孩的话才传入我的意识。"这不是我的家。"

Nina tilts her head, reminding me of an owl. "But isn't this where your mom and dad live?"  
妮娜歪着头，让我想起了猫头鹰。"但这里不是你爸妈住的地方吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Then it's your home." "那这就是你的家。"

I don't have more than a second to sputter, before the conversation is already over for her. "Grandpa Shinji! Kazuya's here!" she shouts, skipping down the hall and allowing me in. Even now the form of address doesn't sound quite right, since it's difficult to imagine my father as anyone's grandpa. I wave away just the thought of it, too absurd to entertain. What kind of grandfather would he be anyway? Would I even want my child to know him?  
我连喘息的时间都没有，她就已经结束了对话。“爷爷真嗣！和也来了！”她喊着，蹦蹦跳跳地穿过走廊，让我进屋。直到现在，这种称呼听起来还是不太对劲，因为很难想象我父亲会成为任何人的爷爷。我挥手驱散这个念头，太荒谬了，不值得深思。他到底会是个什么样的祖父呢？我甚至会希望我的孩子认识他吗？

_Since when have you ever considered one of those?  
你什么时候考虑过这些了？_

The house is just the way I left it, though there's no reason it should have changed in only two weeks. The winds have picked up outside, shivering gusts cut off as I close the front door. Something rattles in the kitchen, but the hallway is still, dust particles drifting down the stairs through rays of window light.  
房子和我离开时一模一样，尽管没有理由在仅仅两周内就发生变化。外面的风大了起来，我关上前门，寒风被切断。厨房里有什么东西在响动，但走廊依旧静悄悄的，灰尘颗粒在窗光中沿着楼梯缓缓飘落。

The walls don't feel like they're closing in as I walk into the living room, and the Throne – a huge red leather chair – is in its usual place. Except Nina is tucked between its cushions, a coloring book atop her folded legs. The kingdom has been usurped. Plates clatter as my father stacks them away, the cupboard to his right open. A new smell slithers into my nose, not of musk or dry cat, but of rose and spice. He's brewing coffee, and I take another whiff – something French? Latin American? Close, but this one is distinct – light and airy like the sea.  
走进客厅，墙壁并未让我感到压迫，那把巨大的红色皮椅——王座——依旧占据着它的老位置。只是妮娜蜷缩在椅垫之间，一本涂色书放在她折叠的双腿上。王权已被篡夺。父亲正将盘子叠放起来，右边的橱柜门敞开着，发出叮当作响的声音。一种新的气味悄然钻入我的鼻孔，不是麝香或干猫的味道，而是玫瑰与香料的气息。他在煮咖啡，我又深吸了一口气——是法式？还是拉丁美洲风味？接近，但这款咖啡独特——轻盈如海风。

"Your mother will be back this afternoon," he says, and I didn't realize I was staring. A thought to move tickles my muscles, but I stay where I am on the other side of the bar. He sets another plate away.  
“你妈妈今天下午回来，”他说道，我这才意识到自己一直在盯着他看。想要移动的念头轻触我的肌肉，但我仍站在吧台的另一侧。他又放了一个盘子进去。

"Bourbon?" I ask. “波旁酒？”我问道。

He turns halfway, and I think that might be a slight smirk. He nods. "From Réunion."  
他转过身来，我猜那可能是一丝微笑。他点头道：“来自留尼汪。”

I huff. A French island just off Madagascar. Premium coffee that I've had only once before, but will never forget. Sweet and chocolaty without all of the heavy aftertaste. I'll have to sneak a cup of it later.  
我哼了一声。那是一座靠近马达加斯加的法国岛屿。那里的咖啡我只喝过一次，但终生难忘。甜美且带有巧克力味，却没有沉重的余味。晚些时候我得偷偷喝上一杯。

"Hey, that looks like my daddy's jacket!" Nina crawls her way across the couch to where I'm standing, her fingers brushing over the silver star and bar on my shoulder. "His doesn't have the flag on it either."  
“嘿，那看起来像是我爸爸的夹克！”妮娜从沙发上爬过来，手指拂过我肩上的银星和杠。“他的上面也没有国旗。”

It's probably the same with any other ex-JSSDF that managed to hold on to those things. I guess back then, no Jerry wanted to be caught with anything that might be considered nationalistic. There were 50 million of them in a society that didn't want them and didn't particularly know what to do with them. If they couldn't see the flags and the half-remembered festivals, then all the easier to forget about them.  
对于任何其他成功保留了这些东西的前自卫队队员来说，大概也是如此。我想在当时，没有哪个杰瑞愿意被发现持有任何可能被视为民族主义的东西。在一个不想要他们、也不特别知道如何对待他们的社会中，有五千万这样的人。如果他们看不到国旗和半记忆中的节日，那么就更容易忘记它们。

"Nina, show Kazuya upstairs." my father says, his back to us. She nods and leaps off the couch, trying to climb the steps two by two.  
“妮娜，带和也上楼。”父亲背对着我们说道。她点点头，从沙发上跳下来，试图两步并作一步地爬上楼梯。

I pause at the base of the stairs, by the baluster where my hands once steadily wore away at the paint over the years. Nina's already made it to the top and I start to ascend, the boards creaking with each step. I thought that when I came here, my nerves would be on fire, and it would feel like the mountains were rolling over me again. No such feeling comes, but neither do I feel any comfort from such a familiar place. It is empty, alien.  
我在楼梯底部停下，手扶着栏杆，那里我曾多年稳定地磨损着油漆。妮娜已经到达了顶端，我开始攀登，每一步都伴随着木板的吱嘎声。我以为当我来到这里时，我的神经会像着火一样，感觉就像山峦再次向我压来。但这种感觉并未出现，我也没有从这样一个熟悉的地方感到任何安慰。这里空荡荡的，陌生。

"They let me stay in your room whenever I have to sleep over," Nina says, the door groaning as she enters, twirling over the dark wood floors and humming a nameless tune.  
"他们让我每次留宿时都住在你房间，"妮娜说着，门在她进入时发出吱嘎声，她在深色木地板上旋转，哼着一首无名小调。

I've taken a step back in time, to another boy's room, when he was nineteen and angry at the world. Dark blue curtains and bed sheets, walls unadorned but marked with a few streaks and the occasional dent. There are an array of tools on the desk by his bed, where he used to toy with old watches and their cogs, in love with the oil of their metals and how they clicked and whirled when put together just right. On my left are the bifold closet doors, within which he would hide and draw childish pictures of a happier, made up family.  
我仿佛回到了过去，来到了另一个男孩的房间，那时他十九岁，对世界充满愤怒。深蓝色的窗帘和床单，墙壁未经装饰，却留下了几道划痕和偶尔的凹痕。他的床边桌子上摆满了工具，他曾喜欢摆弄旧手表和里面的齿轮，迷恋金属上的油渍以及它们恰到好处组合时发出的咔嗒声和旋转。在我左边是双折的衣柜门，他曾在里面藏着，画着快乐、虚构的家庭的幼稚图画。

"You can sleep here," Nina says, having already made it somewhat her own. She grabs a purple backpack from the bed. "Grandpa set up a place for me to sleep on the couch in the office. I don't mind. It smells like mine at home."  
"你可以睡在这里，"妮娜说，仿佛这里已经成了她的领地。她从床上抓起一个紫色背包。"爷爷在办公室的沙发上为我准备了一个睡觉的地方。我不介意。那里闻起来和我家一样。"

"Don't you have any family here in Arizona, Nina?" I ask, setting my bag down.  
"你在亚利桑那州没有家人吗，妮娜？" 我问道，放下我的包。

She shrugs. "No, they all live in different countries now. The ones in Japan don't talk to my daddy anymore."  
她耸耸肩。"没有，他们都住在不同的国家。在日本的那边已经不和我爸爸说话了。"

Nina leads me back down stairs and I find myself hoping she isn't lonely, hoping she has friends at school or a mother she can talk to.  
妮娜带我回到楼下，我不禁希望她不会感到孤单，希望她在学校有朋友或者有个能倾诉的母亲。

My father has finished the dishes and sits at the table. That aroma hits me again, making my mouth water. This time, an orange cat sits on the backrest of the couch, awaiting our return. Nina rubs her nose against his and he purrs, sliding his cheek along hers.  
我父亲已经洗完了碗，坐在桌旁。那股香气再次袭来，让我垂涎欲滴。这次，一只橙色的猫坐在沙发背上，等待我们回来。尼娜用鼻子蹭了蹭他，他便发出呼噜声，用脸颊蹭着她的脸。

"Why don't you take Myshka out hunting?" father asks. Her pigtails bounce as she nods, hefting Myshka up in her arms. She lets the tabby rest over her shoulder as they venture outside. I know she doesn't mind being by herself on occasion and even prefers that from time to time. At least all the cat asks of her is scratches under his chin.  
“你怎么不带米什卡出去打猎？”父亲问道。她的辫子随着点头跳动，她将米什卡抱起，让这只虎斑猫趴在肩上，一起出门探险。我知道她偶尔独自一人也不介意，甚至有时更喜欢这样。至少这只猫只要求她挠挠下巴。

"He brought me a cardinal yesterday," dad says, the sun-glare on his glasses hiding an eye. I wasn't sure what I would do once I got here. I also hadn't considered that I might be alone with my father for more than five minutes. Or perhaps I did and just didn't want to think about it. So I contemplate going outside to watch Nina, or returning upstairs and keeping to my old room. That's when I spot a cup of swirling coffee ringed in gold at the seat across from him, a glazed doughnut sitting beside it. Quite the bribe.  
“他昨天给我带了一只红雀，”爸爸说，眼镜上的阳光反光遮住了他的眼睛。我不确定自己来到这里后会做什么。我也没想过可能会和父亲独处超过五分钟。或许我想过，只是不愿去细想。于是我考虑出去看尼娜，或者回到楼上待在我的旧房间里。就在这时，我注意到他对面座位上有一杯金边环绕、旋转着的咖啡，旁边还放着一个糖霜甜甜圈。真是个诱人的贿赂。

_Isn't this what you came here to do anyway?  
这难道不是你来这里的目的吗？_

I sit and try to sip at the bourbon coffee like it's something I have everyday, and not like just the taste of it brings back a thousand bright memories that warm me from head to toe. We sit quietly, while my father watches Nina and Myshka play in his garden, the sunset reflecting off his glasses. A hand fingers the ends of an envelope, squished beneath a brown leather bound book, unmarked and frayed at the edges. Then I realize – I've seen it before. It's the same one from the hospital, when I came down to visit mom.  
我坐下来，尝试着啜饮那杯波本咖啡，仿佛这是我的日常饮品，而不是仅仅一尝便唤起千百个鲜明记忆，从头顶暖到脚底。我们静静地坐着，父亲注视着尼娜和米什卡在他的花园里玩耍，夕阳映照在他的眼镜上。一只手摸索着信封的边缘，信封被压在一本棕色皮革装订的书下，无标记且边缘磨损。随后我意识到——我以前见过它。就是我在医院看望妈妈时见到的那封。

"What's that?" I ask, making a lazy gesture.  
“那是什么？”我问道，懒洋洋地比划了一下。

He looks confused, and then a little embarrassed. Hesitating, he takes the envelope and stows it away under the table, before leaning forward on his elbows. "A journal I used to keep. Just started writing in it again the past few years."  
他看起来有些困惑，随即又显得有些尴尬。犹豫片刻后，他接过信封，将其藏到桌子底下，然后双肘撑在桌上前倾身体。“这是我以前写的一本日记。这几年又开始重新写起来了。”

"Can I read it?" I ask before I can fully think it through, expecting him to say no and to get defensive. Another tripwire snagged.  
“我能看看吗？”我脱口而出，未经深思，预料他会拒绝并变得戒备。又一条警戒线被触动了。

He stares at it for a time. A tension knots itself in the polished wood. His hand settles over the cover, brushing with something intimate. After a rough, bloated pause, he nods. "Yeah... sure."  
他凝视着它许久。紧绷的气氛在光滑的木头上打了个结。他的手轻轻拂过封面，带着几分亲昵。经过一段粗重而漫长的停顿后，他点了点头。“嗯……当然可以。”

He pushes it across to me and there's a strange sort of reverence when I take it, keeping it close to me on the table. I'm tempted to open the ancient tome and read its scriptures now, but that would be impolite, and a private sort of thing I imagine neither of us would like to be in the same room to share. So what should I talk about? Should I ask some more about the war? It's different now that I'm sitting here with him. I was at a much safer distance while in Washington.  
他将它推到我面前，我接过时感受到一种奇异的敬意，将它紧贴在桌上的我身边。我忍不住想打开这本古老的典籍，阅读其中的经文，但那样做显得不礼貌，而且我想我们俩都不会愿意在同一个房间里分享这种私密的事情。那么我该聊些什么呢？是否应该再询问一些关于战争的事情？现在我坐在这里与他面对面，感觉与在华盛顿时相比，距离安全了许多。

I drum my fingers on the table. Stop – hold them in a fist. Then a glance at the envelope in his lap. "I can help you write your book, you know."  
我敲打着桌面。停下——握紧拳头。然后瞥了一眼他膝上的信封。“我知道，我可以帮你写你的书。”

At first, he is little more than surprised, and even seems to consider it for a minute. "I have to take a look at my old journals. You've got one of them. There's only a few pages left."  
起初，他只是有些惊讶，甚至似乎考虑了一会儿。“我得看看我的旧日记。你有一本。只剩下几页了。”

The windows rattle as we fall into silence again, dead leaves skittering over the house. I have emptied my mug and finished half of my doughnut when the front door creaks open, and my mother steps in.  
我们再次陷入沉默时，窗户嘎嘎作响，枯叶在屋外疾走。我喝完了杯子里的咖啡，也吃掉了半个甜甜圈，这时前门吱呀一声开了，母亲走了进来。

"Hey, welcome home," I say and she stops, eyes wide. Her expression falls away to something unreadable and I shift when she only stares at me. Didn't she know I was coming today? Then, the spell broken, she looks away and wipes a sleeve over her mouth and sniffs, muttering something about changing before walking off to her room without a second glance.  
“嘿，欢迎回家，”我说道，她停下脚步，眼睛睁得大大的。她的表情变得难以捉摸，我有些不安，因为她只是盯着我看。她不知道我今天会来吗？随后，这股魔咒被打破，她转过头，用袖子擦了擦嘴，吸了吸鼻子，咕哝着说要换衣服，然后头也不回地走向她的房间。

I look to my father for explanation and he only smiles.  
我向父亲寻求解释，他只是微笑着。

When she comes back, her arms enclose me from behind, hair tickling the back of my neck. She sighs, more content than I've ever known her to be, and I think of reaching up and grabbing her arms to keep her there.  
当她回来时，双臂从背后环抱住我，发丝轻挠着我的后颈。她叹息着，那份满足感是我从未见她有过的，我思忖着伸手抓住她的手臂，让她留在那里。

She steps away before I can and the moment is gone. As she moves aside, I see that she hasn't actually changed at all and takes the chair between us, stealing a few sips from my dad's mug. She tells me she was sorry to hear about me and Marina. I shrug, pretending not to be annoyed.  
她在我能反应之前抽身离开，那一刻便消逝了。她移步一旁，我才发现她其实一点也没变，径直坐在我们之间的椅子上，偷啜了几口我爸的杯子。她告诉我，听说我和玛丽娜的事，她感到很遗憾。我耸耸肩，假装不以为意。

"We just weren't right for each other," I say.  
“我们只是不适合彼此，”我说。

Mom crosses her legs. "I knew you could do better anyway," she says and I'm not sure whether to be happy or offended. I decide on both. My father chuckles and shakes his head, as if to say, _that's not what he wants to hear_.  
妈妈交叉着双腿。“我就知道你能做得更好。”她说道，我分不清是该高兴还是觉得被冒犯。我决定两者都有。父亲轻笑一声，摇了摇头，仿佛在说，这不是他想听到的。

She bristles a bit at this and ripostes by drinking the last of his coffee.  
她对此有些恼怒，反唇相讥地喝掉了他剩下的咖啡。

The light in our kitchen is not amiable like in Harry's bar, nor is it unpleasant like my dreary apartment up north. It's new and somewhere in-between. As it starts to get dark out, a red-cheeked Nina returns with Myshka, who leaves a dead baby snake at my feet. _You are so skinny boy, surely you must be stupid and cannot hunt for yourself. Eat, stupid boy._  
我们厨房的光线既不像哈里酒吧里那般友好，也不像我北边那间阴沉的公寓那样令人不快。它是新的，介于两者之间。天色渐暗时，红着脸的尼娜带着米什卡回来了，米什卡在我脚边留下了一条死掉的小蛇。你这么瘦，肯定很蠢，不会自己捕猎。吃吧，蠢小子。

Conversation is strained, but as dinner is being made, Nina talks plenty for all of us. She's learning about elephants at school. Unstoppable when set on a path, with large ears for them to hear more than speak. I ask her who told her elephants could speak.  
对话有些生硬，但在准备晚餐时，妮娜为我们所有人说了不少话。她在学校里学到了关于大象的知识。一旦踏上这条路就势不可挡，它们的大耳朵能让它们听到比说话更多的声音。我问她是谁告诉她大象会说话的。

"Not with their mouths, silly," she pokes her nose, "but with their trunks." she goes on to tell us they make other sounds people can't hear, some that can only be detected by other elephants from miles and miles away.  
“不是用嘴巴，傻瓜，”她戳了戳鼻子，“而是用它们的象鼻。”她继续告诉我们，它们能发出人类听不到的其他声音，有些声音只有其他大象才能从数英里之外听到。

With dinner finished, Nina and I clean the dishes. I wash, she dries.  
晚餐结束后，妮娜和我一起洗碗。我洗，她擦干。

Exhaustion weighs on my ribs and pulls at my eyes, even though I've done nothing but sit at a table with my parents and indulge in strangled small talk. Except now I'm feeling the tremors of a queasy stomach. I decide to head to bed early.  
疲惫压在我的肋骨上，拉扯着我的眼皮，尽管我只是和父母坐在桌前，勉强进行着窒息般的闲聊。但现在，我感到胃部一阵阵的颤动。我决定早点上床休息。

On the way up, I argue it must be the jet-lag again, since I don't have Marina's soup to blame this time. At the second floor, I turn to see my mother at the bottom of the stairs, one hand on the railing. As with the hallway earlier, she stares, more relaxed than tense this time. A calm, breathing moment that makes me feel a toddler, even standing so high up.  
上楼途中，我辩解这一定是时差反应，毕竟这次没有玛丽娜的汤可以怪罪。到了二楼，我转身看到母亲在楼梯底部，一只手扶着栏杆。和之前走廊上的情景一样，她凝视着，这次比紧张时更放松。一个平静、呼吸的瞬间，让我感觉自己像个站在高处的孩子。

"Uh, night, mom," I say.  
“呃，晚安，妈妈，”我说。

She smiles. "Goodnight, Kazuya."  
她微笑着。"晚安，和也。"

I stay up for another hour, thirty minutes of which are spent staring at the weathered journal in my hands. I decide to open to a random page to start, a few stains marring the paper.  
我又熬了一个小时，其中三十分钟都在凝视手中这本磨损的日记。我决定随机翻开一页开始阅读，几处污渍玷污了纸张。

There is no date, save for a scrawled _2035_ in the upper corner –  
没有日期，除了右上角潦草的 2035 年——

_I go to his room and open the door, watching over him for a while. Just to make sure I haven't actually strangled our son. Just to make sure I'm not the monster my dreams tell me I am. He's inherited my jaw, his mother's chin and a bit of her nose too. His eyes, though... I know somehow he's gotten those from my father.  
我走到他的房间，打开门，静静地观察了他一会儿。只是为了确认我没有真的掐死我们的儿子。只是为了确认我不是我梦中告诉我的那个怪物。他继承了我的下巴，他母亲的颌骨，还有一点她的鼻子。但他的眼睛……我知道不知怎么地，他继承了我父亲的眼睛。_

_I'm going back to bed now. Asuka is still asleep. I've gotten pretty good at not waking her. She doesn't sleep so well anymore, and I think Kazuya knows it.  
我现在要回去睡觉了。明日香还在熟睡。我已经很擅长不吵醒她了。她最近睡眠不太好，我想和也知道这一点。_

_He shouldn't have to live like this.  
他不应该这样生活。_

_He doesn't deserve it. 他不配得到这些。_

The next day, mother takes a quick trip up to Mesa to approve some new procedures at the lab, while dad and I take Nina home in my rental. She doesn't live far. Her mother greets us at the door, wide hips and wavy hair.  
第二天，妈妈匆匆前往梅萨，去实验室审批一些新程序，而我和爸爸则带着妮娜回到她家，我租的车。她住得不远。她母亲站在门口迎接我们，宽阔的臀部和波浪般的头发。

On the way back to the house, I want to ask him about the journal. I want to ask him about the boy he dreams about strangling, or the eyes of his father he can't seem to escape. I stared at them in the mirror this morning, as if imbued with a new, sinister glint. My Grandfather commanded his son out against foreign, cosmic monstrosities and broke everything anyone ever thought they understood about the world. I have no pictures of him. Or, rather, I've never seen one of him.  
在回家的路上，我想问他关于那本日记的事。我想问他关于那个他梦见勒死的男孩，或是他无法摆脱的父亲的眼睛。今早在镜子里，我盯着它们，仿佛被赋予了一种新的、邪恶的光芒。我的祖父曾命令他的儿子对抗外来的、宇宙间的怪物，打破了所有人对世界的认知。我没有他的照片。或者应该说，我从没见过他的照片。

I had trailed a hand down my face, wondering if somehow I'd taken more than just his eyes.  
我用手顺着脸颊滑下，疑惑自己是否不知不觉中连他的眼睛也一并继承了。

In the end, nothing comes of it and while 94.9 blurbs some disjointed 2020's pop, I resolve to read more of the journal. Just thinking about it, I realize how much stronger my father is than me – to let me in like that, even after all we've said to one another in the past. To give me his most private thoughts and let me so casually peruse them, judge them. To judge him.  
最终，这一切都无疾而终，而 94.9 电台播放着支离破碎的 2020 年代流行音乐，我决定继续阅读那本日记。仅仅想到这一点，我就意识到父亲比我坚强得多——即便在我们过去彼此间说过那么多话之后，他仍允许我进入他的内心。将他最私密的思想交予我，任我随意翻阅、评判。评判他。

I don't think I've ever thought of my father as brave up until now. I know I should be ashamed of that.  
直到此刻，我才真正认为父亲是勇敢的。我知道我应该为此感到羞愧。

We've barely spoken all morning. He shifts, restless, and drums his fingers wherever they end up. Once home, he heads out back to the garden and I have the feeling he expects me to follow. We stand out by the azaleas and his bundles of roses, their leaves brittle and brown from the winter chill.  
整个早上我们几乎没怎么说话。他不安地挪动着，手指在任何落下的地方敲打。一回到家，他就往后花园走去，我感觉他希望我跟着。我们站在杜鹃花和一束束玫瑰旁，它们的叶子因冬寒而变得脆黄。

My father speaks first. "I've got six or seven years, at most," he says. From his jacket, he pulls out a fold of papers from the envelope I saw, holding them out to me.  
我父亲先开口了。“我最多还有六七年，”他说。从外套里，他拿出我见过的那个信封里的一叠文件，递给我。

I start to reach for them. "What is it?"  
我伸手去接。“这是什么？”

"An assisted death directive. If the dementia gets worse, you have power of attorney."  
一份协助死亡指令。如果痴呆症恶化，你拥有我的代理权。

My hand stops and the winds may as well be daggers.  
我的手停了下来，风仿佛也变成了利刃。

"If I start to meet certain conditions, then eventually you can take me up to Saint Luke's and a physician will hand me a loaded syringe, and that'll be that. But by then I... I wouldn't be functioning very well, if at all."  
如果我开始满足某些条件，那么最终你可以带我去圣路加医院，医生会递给我一支装满药物的注射器，一切就结束了。但到那时我……我可能已经无法正常运作，甚至完全无法自理。

I keep my arms at my sides, heat pulsing through me despite the numbing chill. "I don't understand."  
我双臂紧贴身侧，尽管寒意麻木，体内却热流涌动。“我不明白。”

_What the fuck. 搞什么鬼。_

"I want you to promise me that... if I really start to go, if I really start to lose it, I want you to make sure they give me that damned needle. Your mother might try and fight it, but I don't want her taking care of me, not like that. She's done that enough."  
“我要你答应我……如果我真的开始不行了，如果我真的开始失控，我要你确保他们给我那该死的针。你母亲可能会试图阻止，但我不希望她那样照顾我，她已经做得够多了。”

_What the_ _**fuck**__, dad__?_ 搞什么鬼，老爸？

"Don't talk like that." "别那样说话。"

"Promise me." "答应我。"

Those eyes have turned hard, and it sounds more like a command than a request. Right now, I'm a soldier being given an order, not a choice.  
那双眼睛变得冷硬，听起来更像是一道命令而非请求。此刻，我是一名被下达指令的士兵，而非拥有选择权的人。

"No, I'm _not_–" “不，我不是——”

He grabs my upper arm, shoving the papers into my palm. Father the soldier is gone just as suddenly, or replaced, or forgotten in place of Shinji Soryu, a man who has dementia and is so scared of losing his mind a second time he's willing to snap the little threads of a relationship he has left with his son.  
他抓住我的上臂，将文件塞进我的手掌。作为士兵的父亲突然消失了，或是被取代，或是被遗忘，取而代之的是真嗣·创，一个患有痴呆症的男人，他如此害怕再次失去理智，以至于愿意切断与儿子仅存的那一点点关系线。

"Kazuya," his gaze drops and he purses his lips, grip tightening. "Just... just promise me, alright?"  
"和也，" 他的目光低垂，双唇紧抿，握力加强。"就... 就答应我，好吗？"

For a while, there's only the clatter of the leaves and even that falls still, until there's only the howling of Arizona's winds rushing through the mountains and valleys. I imagine, at least a dozen times over, decking him and telling him to just–  
有那么一会儿，只有树叶的沙沙声，甚至连这声音也渐渐消失，直到只剩下亚利桑那州的风在山峦和峡谷间呼啸。我幻想过，至少十几次，揍他一顿，告诉他干脆——

To just what? What is it I want from him? This sting, this anger, it isn't hate. I know that too well, and I know that this is something different. If the journal was a hand offered in peace, then these papers are the other holding a gun, punching a bullet through my gut.  
干脆什么？我到底想要从他那里得到什么？这种刺痛，这种愤怒，并不是恨。我对此再清楚不过，我知道这是另一种情感。如果说那本日记是伸出的和平之手，那么这些文件就是另一只手持枪，一枪击穿我的腹部。

I tear my arm free, papers crumpling in a fist. "Fine. But I'm not going to lie to mom. Sure as hell not for you." his shoulders slump, and I'm the one who looks away this time. "You've got to tell her, sooner or later."  
我猛地抽回手臂，手中的文件被捏得皱巴巴的。“好啊。但我不会对妈妈撒谎。绝对不会为了你。”他的肩膀耷拉下来，这次是我移开了视线。“你迟早得告诉她。”

The weariness in his next words plows deeper than any bullet. "Then let it be later, son."  
他接下来的话语中透出的疲惫，比任何子弹都更深地击中了我。“那就晚点再说吧，孩子。”

I can't believe what I'm hearing. Not a word of it. I thought I'd embraced this already. The fact that my father has dementia and... this makes it all so much different. He's put the gun in my hand now. _Am I supposed to make that decision easily when the time comes? Do you think I of all people must be okay with you dying? Is that why you gave this to me?_  
我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。一个字都不信。我以为我已经接受了这一切。我父亲患有痴呆症，而...这使得一切都变得如此不同。现在他把枪交到了我手里。当那一刻来临时，我该如何轻易做出决定？你以为我是所有人中最能接受你离世的那一个吗？这就是你把它交给我的原因吗？

I don't have very long to ponder. A voice heavy with authority makes us both turn and I feel a child again, caught doing something I shouldn't.  
我没有太多时间深思。一个充满权威的声音让我们都转过身来，我感到自己仿佛又成了那个做错事被抓的孩子。

"Why are you having Kazuya make promises when you can't keep your own?" mother asks, stepping from around the tall, brittle azaleas mere feet away, her arms crossed. I wonder how long she's been listening. Her gaze could melt steel and I can't help but be thankful it isn't aimed at me. She's fixated so intensely on my father, I may as well not be here.  
“你自己都做不到，为什么还要让和也许下承诺？”母亲从几英尺外的高大而脆弱的杜鹃花丛后走出来，双臂交叉问道。我不知道她听了多久。她的目光锐利如刀，我不禁庆幸那不是冲着我来的。她如此专注地盯着父亲，仿佛我根本不存在。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

His plea falls on deaf ears. "What about _our_ agreement?"  
他的恳求无人理会。“那我们的协议呢？”

"We were just kids," he says and steps forward, arms open.  
“我们那时只是孩子，”他说着，向前迈步，双臂张开。

She takes shuffling steps back, hurt in her eyes. "Do you even remember?"  
她踉跄后退，眼中流露出受伤的神情。“你还记得吗？”

Always goes for the stab, no mercy. She's probably known about the dementia for as long as he has. The Soryu men have never been very good at keeping secrets. Not from her.  
总是直戳要害，毫不留情。她可能早就知道他的病情，就像他一样。宗像家的人从来都不擅长保守秘密。尤其是对她。

Despite the low blow, he manages a smirk, and closes the distance between them. "I'm not that bad yet."  
尽管受到了打击，他还是勉强笑了笑，缩短了他们之间的距离。“我还没那么糟糕。”

"After all this time I– I can't believe you're– that you're still this–" she hits his chest with the side of her fist, "this _stupid_!" she hits him again. He catches her wrist before the third strike, and her other hand latches onto his.  
“经历了这么多时间，我——我无法相信你——你还是这么——”她用拳头侧面捶打他的胸膛，“这么愚蠢！”她再次捶打他。在第三次击打前，他抓住了她的手腕，她的另一只手紧紧抓住了他。

"I know, I know. I thought that..." he takes her hands in his, feeling the ridges of her knuckles. He makes sure their eyes meet. "We'll go together. Just you and me, okay?" he says, mirth coloring his tone as he tries again for a smile, but she doesn't return it.  
“我知道，我知道。我以为……”他握住她的双手，感受她指节上的凹凸。他确保他们的目光相遇。“我们一起走。就你和我，好吗？”他说道，语气中带着一丝愉悦，试图再次微笑，但她没有回应。

The air between them bleeds. Another argument, silent and much older, happening in that small, wounded space. Eventually, she slides her hands free. "You're a jerk."  
他们之间的空气仿佛在流血。又一次无声且更为久远的争执，在那狭小而受伤的空间里上演。最终，她抽回了双手。“你真是个混蛋。”

We both watch her turn and leave, soon slamming the back door shut. The sound echoes over our hilly tundra, which I'm convinced has gotten a few degrees colder.  
我们都看着她转身离开，不久后重重地甩上了后门。那声响在我们多丘的荒原上回荡，我确信气温又下降了几度。

"Dad... what is she talking about?"  
“爸爸……她在说什么？”

He sighs, staring after her. "After Third Impact... well, we didn't have much to hope for back in the camps. We didn't have anything. We decided that, if we were going to die... we'd die together. I didn't think she took it seriously. Not anymore, at least. We were just kids."  
他叹了口气，目送她离去。“在第三次冲击之后……唉，我们在营地里没什么可指望的。我们一无所有。我们决定，如果注定要死……那就一起死。我以为她没当真。至少不再当真了。我们那时只是孩子。”

I flinch, remembering the papers still clutched in my hand.  
我一颤，想起了手中还紧握着的文件。

A promise to die together.  
一个共赴黄泉的誓言。

My father once made me promise to take care of his flowers if anything ever happened to him, but it looks like their stalks have already started to turn gray again.  
我父亲曾让我承诺，若他遭遇不测，要照顾好他的花儿，但看来它们的茎秆已再次开始泛灰。

### Chapter 14: December 17

The morning is burdened, strained tight on the arresting wires of our sinking aircraft carrier. Dad makes breakfast, but leaves none for himself and heads outside early without a word to my mother, who has seen fit to pretend he doesn't exist.  
清晨沉重，紧绷在我们沉没的航空母舰的制动索上。爸爸做了早餐，却没有给自己留下任何，早早地一言不发就出门了，而我母亲则恰如其分地假装他不存在。

I had forgotten how much I hate this.  
我忘了自己有多讨厌这样。

So we eat in silence and listen to the wind rattle the panes. She makes noncommittal, one word answers when I comment on Nina or ask about Misato's bar, _Unryū_, though she doesn't make eye contact. It's at this point I realize I'm grinding my teeth together, subconsciously trying to keep from being completely pissed off at her, which comes welling up in full bloom. I've never been able to stand this side of her. She can't seriously be angry at me, can she? What did I do but acquiesce to an ailing man's request?  
于是我们沉默地吃着，听着风摇动窗格。当我提到妮娜或询问美里的小酒吧“云龙”时，她用不置可否的单字回答，眼神并未与我接触。就在这时，我意识到自己在磨牙，下意识地试图压抑对她的满腔怒火。我从未能忍受她的这一面。她不可能真的生我的气吧？我不过是顺从一个病弱之人的请求罢了，我做了什么？

Why does she have to shut me out like this?  
为什么她非得这样把我拒之门外？

Mother leaves the table and settles on the couch, not looking at all relaxed or comfortable as she flicks the TV on. It's one of the channels that still broadcasts black and white movies with chipped audio and soap opera drama. This one has a woman in her father's garden, standing by a poisonous plant that kills anyone who touches it. Not her, though. She's made from the same cells as the plant, so anyone that touches her dies of the plant's poison too.  
母亲离开餐桌，坐在沙发上，看起来一点也不放松或舒适，她打开电视。这是一个仍在播放黑白电影的频道，音质破损，充满肥皂剧般的戏剧性。这部影片中，一个女人站在她父亲的花园里，旁边是一株能毒死任何触碰者的有毒植物。但她不会，因为她与那植物由相同的细胞构成，所以任何触碰她的人也会因植物的毒而丧命。

I step over to the couch, hesitating when she only stares at the TV. I decide it's safe to sit down on the other end. My anger has never gotten me anywhere with my mother in the past. I thought it would hurt less to fight her, not knowing what a burden it was to hurt her back. Every time, though I resented it, I swallowed my pride and made it up to her, because one of us had to.  
我走到沙发旁，犹豫了一下，因为她只是盯着电视看。我决定坐在另一头是安全的。过去，我的愤怒从未让我在母亲面前取得任何进展。我以为与她对抗会让我少受些伤害，却不知这反而成了她的负担。尽管我心怀怨恨，但每次我都咽下自尊，向她弥补，因为总得有一个人这么做。

"Dad told me about the camps," I say, even though it's a lie. They've never spoken to me about the camps, but it sounds better than 'Dad told me you made a suicide pact'. She doesn't say anything. She always has something to say.  
"爸爸跟我提过那些营地，" 我说，尽管这是个谎言。他们从未跟我谈及营地的事，但听起来总比'爸爸告诉我你们订了自杀协议'要好。她什么也没说。她总是有话要说。

"You're not really going to go through with it, are you?" I ask.  
"你不是真的打算这么做，对吧？" 我问道。

Her gaze drifts to me, downcast, and that is answer enough. I wedge myself closer, nearly touching her. My body doesn't cooperate and I end up sitting my hands on my thighs, reliving those nights in Florida when I would beg her to stay and promise me that she'd never leave.  
她的目光飘向我，低垂着，这已经足够回答。我挤得更近了些，几乎要碰到她。我的身体不听使唤，最终我把手放在大腿上，回想起在佛罗里达的那些夜晚，我恳求她留下，向我保证她永远不会离开。

"You wouldn't stay, even for me?"  
"你甚至不愿意为我留下吗？"

She makes a quiet, heartbroken noise, sullen as if a child being scolded. "I'll always stay for you," she says, placing her hand on mine. "I'm your mother."  
她发出一声低沉而心碎的呻吟，像一个被责骂的孩子般闷闷不乐。“我会永远为你留下，”她说着，将手放在我的手上。“我是你的母亲。”

Just the word, the sound of it, pulls her back from whatever dark abyss she was peering into. She's the only woman I know who can take strength from just a word, and draw herself back together, even when the glint in her topaz eyes is missing. I turn my hand over to take hers, placing the other atop it.  
仅仅是一个词，它的声音，就将她从凝视的任何黑暗深渊中拉了回来。她是我所知的唯一一个仅凭一个词就能汲取力量，并重新振作起来的女人，即便她那托帕石般的眼睛失去了往日的光芒。我翻过手来握住她的手，另一只手覆盖其上。

"Aren't there any treatments?" I ask. Last night I made some sorry excuses for research on the web. Under the 'treatments' tab was a blank space with a red-highlighted sentence that said – _help contribute to this stub!_ – but, "I've read about some new procedures being tested over in Spain."  
"难道没有治疗方法吗？" 我问道。昨晚我在网上做了些敷衍的研究。在'治疗方法'标签下，有一个空白区域，上面用红色高亮显示了一句话——帮助完善这个条目！——但是，"我读到过一些在西班牙进行的新测试程序。"

Mother takes her hand back and sits straight. "They're still experimental – and not to mention unethical."  
母亲收回手，坐直了身子。"那些还处于实验阶段——更不用说不道德了。"

If it had been about anything else, I might have smiled at her posturing. There's a real edge in her voice, something bitter. The odd patchwork of procedures available vary widely depending on where you go and almost none of them are practiced in America. One talks about cloning and using some kind of memory backup apparatus, like people are spongy, walking computers. Another talks about regeneration, which apparently never manages to fully replace the atrophied lobes of the brain. But it _can_ work. Everything is there for it to work.  
如果这涉及到其他任何事情，我可能会对她那副姿态报以微笑。她的声音里有一种真实的尖锐，带着苦涩。可用的零散手术方法因地点而异，几乎在美国都没有实施。一种说法是关于克隆和使用某种记忆备份装置，仿佛人们是柔软的、行走的计算机。另一种说法是关于再生，据称这种方法从未能完全替代大脑中萎缩的脑叶。但它可以奏效。一切条件都已具备，它能够奏效。

"Have you even looked into them?" I ask.  
“你甚至都没去了解过吗？”我问道。

"No, Kazuya," she says, barking a laugh, "no, of course I wouldn't have researched a thousand different ways to stop the Dementia from slowly rotting at my husband's brain. Of course I haven't debated taking him to one of those experimental labs overseas a hundred times over so that they can use him up and throw him away – just for the chance that their experiments might _actually_ work."  
“不，和也，”她大笑着说，“不，我当然没有研究过上千种阻止痴呆症慢慢侵蚀我丈夫大脑的方法。当然也没有上百次地考虑过带他去海外那些实验机构，让他们把他用完就扔——只为了一点他们实验可能成功的希望。”

I try not to take her scathing words to heart. It was a stupid question before I even formed the thought. She doesn't mean it, I know.  
我尽量不把她的尖锐言辞放在心上。在我还没形成这个念头之前，这问题就已经很愚蠢了。我知道她不是真心的。

"What if they do?" I ask.  
"如果他们真的做了呢？" 我问道。

She shakes her head. "You don't understand. Those fools over in Zaragoza... what they want would do a lot of good for a lot of people, but the way they want to achieve it is selfish – and selfish people with the kind of knowledge they have always do harm."  
她摇了摇头。"你不明白。那些在萨拉戈萨的傻瓜们……他们想要的东西确实能造福很多人，但他们实现目标的方式太自私了——拥有那种知识又自私的人，总是会带来伤害。"

"Does it really matter if there's a chance it'll make him better?"  
"如果有可能让他变得更好，这真的重要吗？"

"Of course it does," she snaps, though it comes out more as a sigh. "Even if we managed to regenerate the failing parts of his brain, those memories would already be gone."  
“当然会，”她厉声说道，但听起来更像是一声叹息。“即使我们设法再生了他大脑中衰竭的部分，那些记忆也已经消失了。”

I fold my hands together and look out the window, nerves bouncing in my legs. Here we have a real solution and she's turning away from it, making up excuses. Metaphysics has come a long way since my mother entered the field, how couldn't she support the very science she's taught and studied?  
我双手交叠，望向窗外，双腿因紧张而颤抖。我们有了一个真正的解决方案，她却拒绝接受，找着借口。自母亲进入这个领域以来，形而上学已经取得了长足的进步，她怎么可能不支持她所教授和研究的科学呢？

That's not even what it's really about. Not for her. There's more than just a disagreement with foreign ethics in her words, a history of heated arguments between colleagues – perhaps even former students.  
这甚至不是问题的真正所在。对她来说不是。她的言辞中不仅仅是对异国伦理的异议，还有同事间激烈的争论——或许甚至是与曾经的学生的争执。

I huff through my nose. If I'd paid more attention to it when I was younger, maybe then I would have something to contribute to this instead of asking more clueless questions. If I had become a professor like my mother wanted, maybe I could have helped him.  
我哼了一声。如果我年轻时多加留意，或许现在就能有所贡献，而不是问更多无知的问题。如果我像母亲期望的那样成为教授，也许就能帮上他。

"I guess you're right," I say, following the rigid patterns of her burgundy plaid shirt. One button at the top is undone, where I see a golden cross. Her fingers rise up to touch it, its edges already rounded from years of idle worry.  
“我想你是对的，”我说，目光顺着她那件深红色格子衬衫的刻板线条移动。最上面的一颗扣子没扣，我瞥见一枚金色十字架。她的手指抬起，轻触着它，边缘因多年无谓的忧虑而变得圆润。

"Can you imagine being able to live as only half the person you were before?" she asks and I shrug.  
“你能想象只活成从前一半的自己吗？”她问，我耸了耸肩。

"Might be nice," I say. "Maybe make for a kind of fresh start."  
"或许不错，" 我说。"也许能带来一种全新的开始。"

"But he wouldn't be the same."  
"但他不会是原来的样子了。"

"Is that really so bad?"  
"那真的有那么糟糕吗？"

"It is," she whispers. "是的，"她低声说道。

In the movie, the girl's lover has been injected with the poisonous cells of the plant so that they can be together. But he is horrified by it and drinks an untested antidote that only ends up killing him instead. Stricken with grief, she drinks the antidote too – and they die together.  
在电影中，女孩的爱人被注入了这种植物的毒细胞，以便他们能在一起。但他对此感到恐惧，喝下了一种未经测试的解药，结果反而害死了自己。她因悲痛欲绝，也喝了同样的解药——最终他们一起死去。

"I think he's tired," mom says, watching as the girl's father, maddened with anguish, grabs the toxic plant. There, the three of them make a ring of corpses around it, nothing left but pain and death to remember them by.  
"我想他累了，"妈妈说道，注视着女孩的父亲因极度痛苦而疯狂地抓住那株毒草。就这样，他们三人围绕着它形成了一个死亡的圆环，留下的只有痛苦和死亡作为他们的记忆。

"So, what are you going to do?"  
"那么，你打算怎么办？"

"I won't make him hang on. I just... after the war, your father was all I had. We weren't very happy at the time, but it was better than trying to face my family. They could never understand."  
"我不会让他一直等待。我只是...战后，你父亲是我唯一的依靠。那时我们并不幸福，但总比面对我的家人强。他们永远无法理解。"

We sit for a while longer, watching the plight of Jaffrey Pyncheon, obsessed with the legend of treasure hidden within a house stolen by his family generations ago. His brother Clifford knows better, fighting those legends with slander against their thieving grandfathers.  
我们又坐了一会儿，看着贾弗雷·品契翁的困境，他沉迷于家族几代前偷来的房子里藏有宝藏的传说。他的兄弟克利福德更明白真相，用诽谤来对抗那些关于他们偷窃成性的祖父的传说。

"What a pity men must inherent their ancestor's ignorance instead of their wisdom!" he says, all pomp and bluster as he storms out.  
“多么遗憾啊，人们必须继承他们祖先的无知而非智慧！”他大声说道，带着夸张的愤怒冲了出去。

Muttering something about taking a walk, and feeling just a tad guilty as mother reluctantly nods, I head out back. I don't like all this talk of my father dying like he's only got days instead of years. It makes me feel as though I'm running out of time too. Because, slowly, it's begun to dawn on me that I may never be able to wrap my head around the Angel War. That makes me feel guilty, because it means whatever my parents went through was more terrible than I can ever imagine.  
咕哝着说要出去走走，母亲不情愿地点头时，我感到一丝内疚。我不喜欢他们谈论我父亲即将离世，好像他只剩下几天而不是几年。这让我觉得自己也在倒计时。因为，慢慢地，我开始意识到我可能永远无法理解天使之战。这让我感到内疚，因为这意味着我父母经历的恐怖超出了我的想象。

I find him in middle of scraggly watermelon vines, a pair of cutters in his hand. He doesn't move to cut anything with them.  
我在杂乱无章的西瓜藤中间找到了他，他手里拿着一把剪刀。但他并没有用它们去剪任何东西。

"She's still pretty steamed at you," I say, coming to stand a few feet away.  
“她还在生你的气呢，”我说着，走到几英尺外站定。

He nods. "She'll come around, when she's ready."  
他点点头。“等她准备好了，自然会想通的。”

With a sigh, he stands, giving up on whatever meditation he was trying to achieve. He motions for me to follow, sitting down on the bottom back patio step. The one at the top suits me just fine. The cold isn't the bone-chilling freeze it was yesterday, and is the more pleasant balance of frost and warmth I'm fond of.  
他叹了口气，站起身来，放弃了原本试图进行的冥想。他示意我跟上，坐在后院台阶的最底层。我还是更喜欢顶层的台阶。今天的寒冷不再像昨天那样刺骨，而是我喜欢的霜寒与温暖恰到好处的平衡。

"Did your mom ever tell you you used to visit her?" my father asks, staring over the crops. "Before she got pregnant?"  
"你妈妈有没有告诉过你，你小时候常去看她？" 我父亲望着庄稼问道，"在她怀孕之前？"

He's feeling reminiscent today. I can't hold back a scoff. "Come on, dad. What the hell does that even mean?"  
他今天似乎很怀旧。我忍不住嗤之以鼻，"得了吧，爸。那到底是什么意思？"

"I'm serious." he throws a glance over his shoulder, tapping the cutters to his forehead. "She used to say it was like she could feel someone touching her thoughts before she slept – making her smile even when she didn't feel like it." he turns to the garden and makes a satisfied nod. "You made her smile _a lot_."  
"我是认真的。" 他回头瞥了一眼，用切割器敲了敲额头，"她以前常说，睡觉前总觉得有人在触碰她的思绪——即使她心情不好，也能让她微笑。" 他转向花园，满意地点了点头，"你让她笑了很多。"

"Well, I don't remember her smiling much when I was a kid."  
“嗯，我记得小时候她笑得不多。”

"_I_ remember," he says, indignant. "Even got a little jealous for a while. When you came along it was like you'd stolen her love from me. You were tough competition and I couldn't compete. Never had a chance." I can hear the grin in his voice. The brown sunflower stalks sway and the villa creaks. Myshka comes padding up, laying down between my father's feet. "She never wanted kids, you know," he says, quieter. "Get pissed off if we even talked about it, which wasn't often anyway."  
“我记得，”他愤愤地说，“有段时间我还小小地嫉妒了一下。你一来，就好像把她的爱都抢走了。你是个强有力的对手，我根本比不过。从来就没机会。”我能听出他声音里的笑意。棕色的向日葵茎秆摇曳，别墅吱嘎作响。米什卡慢悠悠地走过来，躺在我父亲脚边。“你知道吗，她从来就不想要孩子，”他压低声音说，“要是我们提起这事，她会气得要命，不过我们本来也不常提。”

I did know, in a way. Mommy's Happy Accident, after all.  
某种程度上，我是知道的。毕竟，妈妈的那次快乐意外。

He sighs and leans on his knees. "So she took it in stride when the doctors told her not to get her hopes up. She'd been spending the years before that convincing herself she didn't want kids, which was mostly true. Spent the ones up until you were born telling herself it could never happen anyway." when he looks back at me, dreams from days that seem lifetimes ago come with that dizzying haze of deja vu. When he would stand by the house with that adoration brimming from every inch of his being, a glimpse of Shinji Soryu before the Eva destroyed our home. "You made her pretty damn happy, Kazuya."  
他叹了口气，双手撑在膝盖上。“所以当医生告诉她不要抱太大希望时，她很坦然地接受了。在那之前，她花了好几年时间说服自己不想要孩子，这基本上是真的。直到你出生前，她一直告诉自己这根本不可能发生。”当他回头看我时，那些仿佛是前世记忆的梦境伴随着令人眩晕的既视感涌来。他站在房子旁，全身洋溢着崇拜之情，那是真嗣·索留还未被 Eva 摧毁我们家园时的模样。“你让她非常幸福，和也。”

A few questions fight to blurt out, yearning for more, but I keep them to myself in that pleasant pause between us, which quickly becomes choked. IIf only I could be more like Myshka and communicate with purrs and claws and be understood.  
有几个问题争先恐后地想要脱口而出，渴望了解更多，但我把它们藏在心里，在我们之间愉快的停顿中，这很快变得窒息。要是我能更像米什卡，用咕噜声和爪子交流，并被理解就好了。

"What about you, dad?" I ask before the moment can slip away. "Did I make you happy? Did I make you proud?"  
“那你呢，爸爸？”我赶在那一刻溜走之前问道，“我让你感到幸福吗？我让你感到骄傲吗？”

"You've always made me proud," he mutters.  
"你一直让我感到骄傲，"他低声说道。

I shake my head, despite the hope stirring there. "Yeah, big screw up in the CIA shuffling paperwork."  
我摇了摇头，尽管心中涌起了一丝希望。"是啊，在中央情报局搞砸了文书工作，真是个大错误。"

"Well... you wanted to help people, right? Be apart of something bigger?"  
"嗯...你不是想帮助别人吗？成为更伟大事业的一部分？"

"That was part of it, I guess."  
"我想那是其中一部分吧。"

He grunts. "That's more than I ever did. I got into the Eva because I felt like they made me. I didn't do it for anything noble. I did it because it was what they wanted me to do. Because I felt guilty."  
他咕哝了一声。“我比你做得多。我进入 Eva 是因为我觉得他们塑造了我。我并不是为了什么崇高的理由。我这么做是因为他们希望我这么做。因为我感到内疚。”

"Mom said you fought Angels to protect people."  
“妈妈说你战斗天使是为了保护人们。”

"That was always a part of it. In reality, I was never that selfless about it. Not until it was too late."  
"那一直是其中的一部分。实际上，我从未那么无私过。直到为时已晚。"

Thinking back to when I was fourteen and how daunting and confusing the world was, even if it wasn't normal, or very functional, I had a family and home and return to. My dad lost his mother and from what I know of his father, I'm not sure that they were ever very close.  
回想我十四岁时的情景，世界是多么令人生畏和困惑，即便那不正常，也不太健全，我还有家可归。我父亲失去了母亲，据我所知，他和父亲的关系也从未很亲近。

My father didn't have anything.  
我父亲一无所有。

"I mean... you were just a kid, right?" I ask.  
"我的意思是... 你那时只是个孩子，对吧？" 我问道。

"Yeah," he says with a wry chuckle. "Just a stupid kid fighting a war he didn't know a thing about."  
"是啊，" 他带着一丝苦笑说，"只是个愚蠢的孩子，卷入了一场他一无所知的战争。"

"Well... I don't think I could have done that."  
"嗯... 我觉得我做不到那样。"

Dad doesn't respond and another patient pause stretches between, while he picks peeling rubber from the handles of his clippers.  
爸爸没有回应，又一次漫长的沉默在两人之间蔓延，他正从剪刀柄上剥下脱落的橡胶。

There were stories they used to tell us in college, about how Africa used to be before Third Impact. A man comes to a village and shoots a boy's mother. He shoves an assault rifle into his hands and says, "Go. Go and fight or else your tribe will die."  
大学时，他们常给我们讲第三冲击前非洲的故事。一个男人来到一个村庄，枪杀了男孩的母亲。他把一支突击步枪塞到男孩手里，说：“去吧，去战斗，否则你的部落将灭亡。”

The UN just dressed it up with uniforms and a cause.  
联合国不过是给它披上了制服和冠冕堂皇的理由。

Shaking his head, my father stands and I'm starting to get used to seeing that smirk on his face. His hand grips my shoulder as he climbs the steps, giving it a squeeze before sliding away, Myshka right at his heels. The air is sweet and fresh in my lungs and for a time Arizona doesn't look quite so dismal and forsaken. I have skipped lunch and the sun has started its descent towards Kitt Peak before I feel the inclination to head back in.  
父亲摇了摇头，站起身来，我开始习惯他脸上那抹得意的笑容。他踏上台阶时，手紧握我的肩膀，用力一捏后滑开，米什卡紧随其后。空气清新甜美，充盈我的肺腑，一时间亚利桑那州看起来不再那么凄凉荒芜。我错过了午餐，太阳也开始向基特峰西沉，我才感到该回去了。

On my old nightstand, his journal rests. After today it no longer feels difficult to read. Yes, it's hard to go through the struggles outlined on every page, but I am eager to do it now. I'm repaying a debt by getting to know my father this way, by delving into all of the things he is not ready to relive again.  
在他旧床头柜上，那本日记静静躺着。今天之后，阅读它不再感到困难。是的，每一页记录的挣扎都让人心痛，但我现在渴望去读。我通过这种方式了解父亲，深入探究那些他尚未准备好再次面对的往事，以此偿还一份情感的债务。

As I progress, he doesn't talk about the beaches quite so much, doesn't write about going there in the middle of the night and sitting on the dunes, entertaining the vague notion of swimming out into the dark waters with the tide. Nor does he write about the trivialities of his old jobs, the hard stares and snide remarks. Treated less like some second class citizen and more akin to a sick murderer of children who doesn't deserve to walk among free men.  
随着我继续阅读，他不再那么频繁地提及海滩，不再写下深夜前往那里坐在沙丘上，怀着模糊的念头随潮水游向黑暗水域的情景。他也不再写关于旧工作的琐事，那些冷酷的凝视和尖刻的评论。他受到的对待不再像一个二等公民，而更像是一个不配与自由人同行的残害儿童的病态凶手。

No, these last ten pages have been barren, sometimes just a word or two and rarely more than a paragraph. There's a long period where he doesn't write in it at all, until I find a page with just one sentence, no date, scribbled as if just the effort of writing it was too much.  
不，这最后十页内容贫乏，有时仅有一两个词，很少超过一段。有一段时间他根本没写任何东西，直到我发现一页上只有一句话，没有日期，潦草得仿佛连写下它的力气都嫌太多。

_I saw him again tonight. He was sitting in the chair across the room, throat slit open, and he smiled at me.  
今晚我又见到了他。他就坐在房间对面的椅子上，喉咙被割开，却朝我微笑。_

He's mentioned this other boy before. I know it's not me, as I'm usually mentioned by name or as 'my son'. There's a tangible guilt pressed into the paper on these entries, just one of the many things that has stayed with my father after all these years.  
他之前提到过另一个男孩。我知道那不是我，因为我通常被提及名字或称为‘我的儿子’。在这些记录中，有一种明显的愧疚感压在纸上，这只是多年来一直伴随着我父亲的众多事情之一。

We're up in the attic today, rifling through dusty boxes looking for some of his older journals. On the ladder below I plan out a script to a one-act play where I ask him about the boy he crushes or strangles.  
今天我们在阁楼上，翻找着积满灰尘的箱子，寻找他的一些旧日记。在下面的梯子上，我构思了一出独幕剧的剧本，打算问他关于他迷恋或扼杀的那个男孩的事情。

Up here it's dark, moldy and far too dusty for my nose's liking. A pair of flashlights stand on the floor at our feet, casting a firelight glow into the rafters and chasing the wolf spiders to their hideaways, where they watch us with insect disinterest.  
这里昏暗、发霉，灰尘多得让我鼻子受不了。我们脚边放着一对手电筒，投射出火光般的亮光，照进屋梁，驱赶着狼蛛躲进它们的藏身之处，它们以昆虫特有的漠然注视着我们。

Dad throws aside another box, full of old shoes. We're trying to find the books he used to keep back when they still lived in Boston. The next box he grabs, its packing tape untouched, seems to be the one we're after. He slides a razor over the top and I get the heady feeling of cracking open a time capsule, like we're a pair of archaeologists happening upon long lost religious texts.  
爸爸扔掉又一箱旧鞋，我们正试图找到他以前在波士顿时保存的那些书。他接下来抓起的那个箱子，封箱胶带完好无损，似乎就是我们寻找的目标。他用剃刀划开顶部，我感到一种打开时间胶囊的兴奋，仿佛我们是一对考古学家，偶然发现了久已失传的宗教文献。

There are drawings in some of these too. They depict things I've only heard second-hand accounts of from the cult worshipers out in Cali and parts of China, the things their churches call Lilith and Adam and Eva. They are something I would expect from a child's mind instead of a man in his early twenties.  
其中一些画作也包含在内。它们描绘了我仅从加州和中国部分地区的邪教信徒那里听到的二手描述的事物，那些他们教堂称之为莉莉丝、亚当和夏娃的东西。这些画作更像是出自孩童之手，而非一个二十出头的年轻人。

I forget the script and ask, "Who was he?"  
我忘记了剧本，问道：“他是谁？”

Tugging free a black, faceless book from the mess, he brushes some dust away and parts its stiff pages. He's been expecting this question.  
他从杂乱中抽出一本黑色、无脸的书，拂去些许尘埃，翻开那些僵硬的页面。他早已预料到这个问题。

"The records said he was the Fifth Child," he says. "Another pilot like us. That was a lie... I didn't know that until later."  
他说：“记录上说他是最小的孩子，”他解释道，“和我们一样的另一位驾驶员。那是个谎言……我后来才知道。”

His focus is possessed by the old journal. He's searching for something, grazing each page as if touching the memories themselves.  
他的注意力完全被那本旧日记所吸引。他在寻找着什么，轻抚每一页，仿佛在触碰那些记忆本身。

"What happened to him?" I ask.  
“他怎么了？”我问道。

My father's hands stop on a worn page that was ripped in half at some point and then taped back together. There's no shiver or emotion as, in a small breath, he says, "I killed him."  
父亲的手停在了一页磨损严重的书页上，那页书不知何时被撕成两半，后又用胶带粘合。他语气平静，没有颤抖或情感波动，轻声说道：“我杀了他。”

It's no one I recognize, not from any articles or news paper clippings, but clearly it's someone my father knew. The drawing isn't a master piece, though I get the sense of a lithe boy with long, messy hair. Only one part of it is colored – the eyes. They're a harsh crimson.  
这个人我不认识，无论是从任何文章或剪报中都没见过，但显然是我父亲认识的人。这幅画并非杰作，但我能感觉到画中是一个身材纤细、长发凌乱的男孩。只有一部分被上了色——眼睛。它们是刺目的猩红色。

"Seventeenth," he says, tapping the paper. "It was him. The Sixteenth Angel was the one that killed Rei. Kaworu... _he_ was the Seventeenth."  
"第十七使徒，" 他敲着纸张说，"就是他。第十六使徒是杀死绫波的凶手。渚薰...他是第十七使徒。"

If he wasn't captured by the drawing, he might have caught my shoulders jerking, or my eyes widening. I'm glad he isn't looking at me. Weren't the Angels supposed to be monsters? How could they have ever looked like us? For my father, the way he talks about this boy in his journal, how he's holding that frail, abused drawing now. That wasn't some enemy to be destroyed. Not to him.  
如果不是被那幅画吸引，他或许会注意到我肩膀的颤抖，或是眼睛的睁大。我很庆幸他没有看向我。使徒不应该是怪物吗？他们怎么可能看起来像我们？对我父亲来说，他在日记中谈及这个男孩的方式，以及他现在紧握着那幅脆弱、受虐的画作的样子。那不是什么该被消灭的敌人。对他来说不是。

"Foolish, isn't it? That I could forget something like that." he opens his right hand, staring at his bare palm. When it starts to quiver, he turns it over and smears his flesh over the led, blurring the picture. "I used to lie awake at night thinking 'It should've been me'."  
"真是愚蠢，不是吗？我竟然会忘记这样的事。" 他张开右手，凝视着光秃秃的掌心。当它开始颤抖时，他翻转手掌，用肉体涂抹在铅笔痕迹上，模糊了画面。"我曾夜不能寐，想着'本该是我'。"

"I'm glad," I say, stuttering. "T-that it wasn't you, I mean. I'm glad."  
"我很高兴，" 我结结巴巴地说，"我的意思是，幸好不是你。我很高兴。"

He nods, barely, and stares down at the picture. Then he closes the journal and makes something of a chuckle. "Yeah. Me too."  
他微微点头，几乎难以察觉，目光落在照片上。随后他合上日记，发出一声似笑非笑的声音。"是啊，我也是。"

The boxes are packed away again and we leave the wolf spiders to attend their silent vigil over this somber domain, where all secrets and memories forgotten are kept.  
箱子再次被打包好，我们留下狼蛛继续守护这片寂静的领域，这里收藏着所有被遗忘的秘密和记忆。

That evening my mother and father make amends, in that strangely quiet and honest way of theirs. I am eight years old again, watching them from down the hall through a cracked door.  
那个傍晚，我的父母以他们那种奇特的、安静而真诚的方式和解了。我又变成了八岁的孩子，从走廊的裂缝门缝中窥视着他们。

"Don't you trust me?" she asks, sitting so that their knees touch. She is harder than iron and stone, but with his hand on her knee, my father melts all that away.  
“你不信任我吗？”她问道，坐下时他们的膝盖相触。她坚硬如铁石，但父亲的手放在她的膝盖上，这一切都融化了。

"Of course I do. You know I do."  
“当然信任。你知道我信任你。”

The way he looks at her carries the weight of his words more than his voice ever could, and speaks so deeply of their bond. She places her hand on his and he lifts it to plant a gentle kiss on her knuckles. A soft smirk comes free.  
他看她的眼神比任何言语都沉重，深深诉说着他们之间的羁绊。她将手放在他的手上，他抬起手，温柔地吻在她的指节上。一丝淡淡的微笑浮现。

"I might hate you more... but I suppose I won't love you any less," she says.  
“我或许会更恨你……但我想，我也不会少爱你一分，”她说道。

I think it's meant as a joke, one shared only between them. Yet there's always a little bit of truth in everything we say. He smiles, truly smiles, and takes her in his arms while she clings to his shirt. Later, when I check on them, they will have fallen asleep on the couch together and I will go to bed as well, a younger part of myself more content with this old house.  
我想这是他们之间的一个玩笑，只有他们能懂。然而，我们所说的每句话里总有一丝真实。他笑了，真心的笑了，将她拥入怀中，而她紧抓着他的衬衫。后来，当我去查看他们时，他们会一起在沙发上睡着，而我也会去睡觉，年轻的自己对这个老房子感到更加满足。

For now, I sit in my room and read more of dad's journal. His entries are sporadic and not often dated, leaving me to do the guesswork and making me feel a bit like a case worker again.  
眼下，我坐在自己的房间里继续阅读父亲的日记。他的记录零散且日期不详，让我不得不猜测，这种感觉又让我像回到了案件调查员的身份。

For this entry, there is no guessing.  
这一篇，无需猜测。

_I picked him up. He looked into my eyes, I looked into his – and we stayed that way for a long time, just staring at each other. That's when I knew. From that minute on I knew I'd gone through my whole life to reach this very moment. I'd gone through hell and terror, just to meet him.  
我抱起了他。他凝视着我的眼睛，我也凝视着他的——我们就这样长时间地对视着。那一刻，我明白了。从那一分钟起，我明白自己走过了整个人生，只为抵达这一刻。我经历了地狱般的恐怖，只为遇见他。_

_My son. 我的儿子。_

_Is it wrong of me to be scared of him? I've always told Asuka that I would never trust myself as a father. But when he looks at me with those bright, curious eyes... it's like I've got two hearts beating in my chest. There's this whole new life in my hands and it makes me believe that I can be a good man for once.  
我害怕他，这有错吗？我一直告诉明日香，我永远不会相信自己能成为一个好父亲。但当他用那双明亮、好奇的眼睛看着我时...我感觉胸中仿佛有两颗心脏在跳动。我手中握着全新的生命，这让我相信，我终于可以成为一个好人。_

_I want to be that man more than anything.  
我比任何时候都渴望成为那样的人。_

_For him. 为了他。_

### Chapter 15: December 19

"I don't think this is a good idea," I say, belatedly catching the volume of my voice and glancing back at the girl in the next room, still pleasantly oblivious.  
"我觉得这不是个好主意，"我迟疑地压低了声音，回头瞥了一眼隔壁房间的女孩，她依旧愉快地浑然不觉。

"Why?" mother asks. "Nina likes you."  
"为什么？"妈妈问。"妮娜喜欢你。"

"But _I_ don't like kids."  
"但我并不喜欢小孩。"

"Neither did I once," she says, pinching my cheek. She gives a wan smile when I smack her hand away. "Sometimes I still don't."  
"我以前也没做到过，"她说着，捏了捏我的脸颊。当我拍开她的手时，她露出一丝苍白的微笑。"有时候我现在也做不到。"

"She's old enough to watch herself."  
"她已经够大了，可以自己照顾自己了。"

"I might agree, but your father has a session up at the VA today and I have another _useless_ board meeting that requires my physical presence. The Satsuma's trust us to take care of her." and there is that air of finality I've never heeded. Beyond her, past the open door and the front porch, my father is leaning against her corvette, the black journal we found yesterday held at his side.  
"我可能会同意，但你父亲今天在退伍军人医院有会诊，而我还有一个毫无意义的董事会会议需要我亲自出席。佐津美的事就交给我们了。" 她的话语中带着一种我从未听从过的决断。在她身后，穿过敞开的门和前廊，我父亲正靠在她的克尔维特车上，昨天我们找到的那本黑色日记本被他夹在身侧。

"They shouldn't rely on other people to do that."  
"他们不该依赖别人来做那件事。"

"Why are you making such a big deal out of this?" she asks, crossing her arms.  
""你为什么对此这么大惊小怪？"" 她问道，双臂交叉。

Another protest half-baked as reason curls up and dies before I can speak it. After a drawn out minute under glaring morning light barbed with irritation, my mother gathers up her purse and manages to look more exasperated than annoyed. _My boy_. Her sigh and slight grimace seem to say. _My strange, troublesome boy_.  
又一次抗议，理由尚未成型便已夭折，我还没来得及开口。在刺眼的晨光和烦躁的氛围中，漫长的一分钟过去了，母亲拿起她的钱包，显得更多的是无奈而非生气。我的孩子。她的叹息和微微的皱眉似乎在说。我那古怪、麻烦的孩子。

"It's not going to kill you to look after a _nine-year-old_ until four o'clock," she says and I roll my eyes, wishing I hadn't. How easily we fall into old routines.  
"照顾一个九岁小孩到四点钟又不会要了你的命，"她说道，我翻了个白眼，后悔自己不该这么做。我们多么轻易就陷入了旧日的习惯。

She touches my shoulder to call my attention, and at least there's a gentleness to her tone as she says, "Take her into the city, go out and get some sun for once – you're so pale."  
她轻触我的肩膀以引起我的注意，至少她的语气中带着一丝温柔："带她进城去，出去晒晒太阳——你白得吓人。"

"You're one to talk," I grumble. She's set me off balance again. "I distinctly remember you having a tan when I was younger."  
"你倒是说得轻巧，"我咕哝道。她又一次让我失去了平衡。"我清楚记得你在我小时候也是晒得黝黑的。"

"Such a sweet boy, always reminding his mother just how old she is," she pinches my cheek again and, for good measure, digs her nails in this time.  
“真是个贴心的孩子，总是提醒他妈妈有多老，”她再次捏了捏我的脸颊，这次还用指甲掐了一下，以示强调。

"_Ow_." jerking back, her hand is gone before I can even think of smacking it, a scowl following her out the door and burrowing into it after she leaves.  
“哎哟。”我猛地往后一缩，她的手已经抽走了，我还没来得及拍开，她出门时留下的一脸不悦深深地刻在了门上，直到她离开。

At least she isn't so quiet and distant today, which has become an all too familiar occurrence since we've started talking again. No, this morning at least, she's only her usual levels of standoffish and irritable. That's good. Rather difficult to communicate with than sullen and depressed.  
至少她今天不那么沉默和疏远，自从我们重新开始交谈以来，这种情况已经变得太过常见。不，至少今天早上，她只是保持了她一贯的冷淡和易怒。这还不错。总比闷闷不乐和抑郁要好沟通些。

Besides, my mother is, what has also been a trend since I was old enough to comprehend the word _rivalry_, right. How she would gloat if she ever had access to such thoughts, which is why I will never speak them. It is in silence that I will accept that there is nothing unreasonable about what she has asked of me today. As if it's really so inconvenient looking after a child, even if it is someone else's.  
再说了，我母亲从我能理解‘竞争’这个词开始，就一直是个潮流引领者，不是吗？如果她知道这些想法，肯定会得意忘形，所以我绝不会说出口。我会在沉默中接受她今天对我的要求并无不妥。好像照顾一个孩子，哪怕是别人的，真的有那么不方便似的。

I just wish there had been more warning.  
我只希望有更多的预警。

"Sorry," Nina says when I turn around, standing there with her hands behind her back. "I don't mean to be a burden."  
“对不起，”当我转过身时，妮娜站在那里，双手背在身后说道，“我不想成为负担。”

The guilt is instant and heart-crushing.  
愧疚感瞬间袭来，令人心碎。

"No, it's just..." I rub the back of my neck. "I didn't think you'd like being around someone like me."  
"不，只是……" 我揉了揉后颈。"我没想到你会喜欢和我这样的人待在一起。"

"What do you mean?" she asks in her owlish way. She said once that we were the same, and seemed pleased enough by that, having found such a rare commonality in someone. I suppose she even thought we were friends, in a way.  
"你这是什么意思？" 她用她那像猫头鹰般的方式问道。她曾说过我们是一样的，似乎对此感到高兴，能在某个人身上找到如此罕见的共同点。我想她甚至认为我们是朋友，某种程度上。

I shrug, mouth twitching. "I'm not a very nice person."  
我耸耸肩，嘴角微微抽动。"我不是个很好的人。"

Nina returns the gesture, her long hair, not bound in its usual pigtails, swaying. "Everyone is mean every once in a while. That doesn't make you not-nice," she says and smiles, childishly blissful at the flip of a switch as she steps forward to take one of my hands in her smaller pair. "I think you're really nice."  
妮娜回以同样的动作，她那未扎成平常双马尾的长发轻轻摇曳。"每个人偶尔都会有点刻薄。这并不代表你不好，"她说着，露出了孩子般纯真的笑容，仿佛开关一拨就变得无比快乐，她向前一步，用她那双小手握住我的一只手。"我觉得你真的很善良。"

I lift an eyebrow. "You've only met me two times."  
我挑了挑眉。"你只见过我两次。"

"So?!" she balks, even pouting a little. "I can tell."  
"那又怎样？！" 她退缩了，甚至有点撅嘴。"我能看出来。"

Her hands bounce mine to punctuate her claim and I pull it away, putting on a practiced smile. Nina's just a little kid, with eyes like mine, but what does she know? How could she understand? She'll learn one day. In a few years, she'll grow up and she'll see that people aren't good just because you believe it or pray hard enough. Today, she'll see that I'm no different and will look at me like she's looking at me now, confused, and maybe a little hurt.  
她用手拍了拍我的手以强调她的观点，我抽回手，摆出一个练习过的微笑。妮娜只是个小女孩，眼睛和我一样，但她知道什么呢？她怎么能理解？总有一天她会明白的。再过几年，她会长大，她会明白人们并不因为你相信或祈祷得足够努力就变得善良。今天，她会看到我和其他人没什么不同，会用现在这种困惑，或许还有点受伤的眼神看着我。

We stand at odds in the hallway, while Myshka sits patiently at the far end and watches.  
我们在走廊里僵持不下，而米什卡耐心地坐在远处观望。

"Well, what do you want to do?" I ask, almost hiding a sigh.  
"那么，你想做什么？" 我问道，几乎藏不住一声叹息。

Nina pokes her lips and peers at Myshka. "Usually I go with _Abuela_ to Mesa, or I help Grandpa in the garden."  
妮娜噘起嘴，看着米什卡。"通常我会和外婆一起去梅萨，或者帮爷爷在花园里干活。"

"Abuela?" "外婆？"

Nina smiles and snickers. "Asuka doesn't like it when I call her Grandma. So I told her Abuela means Auntie," she says, so impishly delighted by her own cleverness.  
妮娜微笑着窃笑。“明日香不喜欢我叫她奶奶。所以我告诉她 Abuela 意思是阿姨，”她说道，对自己的机智感到无比得意。

Despite being in the heart of winter, and the snows that coat the desert mountains, I can feel a familiar heat seeping in through the windows.  
尽管正值隆冬，沙漠山脉被白雪覆盖，我仍能感觉到一股熟悉的暖意透过窗户渗入。

"How about a swim?" I ask.  
“去游泳怎么样？”我问道。

"Okay!" Nina jumps and runs upstairs to gather her things. It's still too cold to use our pool here. We'll have to go elsewhere.  
"“好嘞！”妮娜跳起来，跑上楼去收拾东西。这里的泳池还是太冷了，没法用。我们得换个地方。”

I drive us down to the Sportsplex in south Tucson near Las Vistas, passing by the old Restoration Center; built in the Post Second Impact era when eco-systems had died out globally and scientists dedicated their lives to repairing the damage they'd done. Now it's a tourist attraction.  
"我开车带我们去了南图森的体育综合中心，靠近拉斯维加斯，途经旧恢复中心；那是在第二次冲击后建立的，当时全球生态系统已经崩溃，科学家们倾尽一生修复他们造成的损害。如今它成了一个旅游景点。”

Of the complex's ten baseball diamonds, three of them have games running. Nina says she and her dad sometimes come here to watch the local teams compete, making bets on players.  
"综合中心的十个棒球场中，有三个正在进行比赛。妮娜说她和她爸爸有时会来这里观看当地球队的比赛，还会对球员下注。”

"I've only lost once," she says, complaining that he still owes her two-hundred dollars from the last bout.  
"我只输过一次，"她说，抱怨他上次比赛还欠她两百美元。

It's near Littletown, which began as a tiny host of suburbs that stretched its legs into a largely Japanese extension of Tucson, touching boarders with the Indian reservation and an abandoned open pit mine where they used to hold festivals. About 39% of Arizona's demographic is Japanese nowadays. Dad once said it was higher before we moved out here.  
它靠近小城镇，这个地方起初只是一些郊区的集合，逐渐扩展成一个主要由日本人构成的图森市延伸区，与印第安保留地和一个废弃的露天矿坑接壤，那里曾举办过节日庆典。如今，亚利桑那州约有 39%的人口是日本人。爸爸曾说，在我们搬到这里之前，这个比例更高。

"They all wanted to get east," he said. "Get away from the camps and into the dirt-cheap ghettos where there was work and a slightly lower chance of getting stabbed or robbed."  
"他们都想去东部，"他说。"逃离集中营，进入那些工作机会多、被刺或被抢几率略低的廉价贫民窟。

The place started as a JRRI settlement and was put together by a classroom of schizophrenic five-year-olds. Living complexes were little more than giant prefab blocks stacked atop one another – cargo containers furnished for people. As more buildings were erected, more roadways and support structures had to be knocked down, expanded – and knocked down again. The interiors became a tight, claustrophobic maze of cramped, narrow hallways that always seem to be in a state of disrepair. While the streets and alleys turned into an extension of this cluttered, disorganized layout, spawning an intricate network of smoke-filled bars and gang-riddled parking garages.  
这个地方起初是一个 JRRI 定居点，由一群患有精神分裂症的五岁儿童的教室拼凑而成。居住区不过是巨大的预制块堆叠在一起——为人们配备的货物集装箱。随着更多建筑的建立，更多的道路和支持结构不得不被拆除、扩建——然后再次拆除。内部变成了一个紧密、幽闭的迷宫，狭窄的走廊总是处于失修状态。街道和小巷变成了这种杂乱无章布局的延伸，衍生出一个充满烟雾缭绕的酒吧和帮派横行的停车场的复杂网络。

They called it _Chīsai_ and most of American-bred Tucson kept it out of sight and out of mind for a while. Jerry settlements had developed a stigma for being cultish, even though Third Impact fanaticism had spanned across all races and cultures.  
他们称之为‘细致’，大多数美国培育的图森人一度将其置于视线之外，心不在焉。杰瑞定居点因其宗派性质而蒙上了污名，尽管第三次冲击的狂热已经跨越了所有种族和文化。

Out here, the hustle and bustle of the crowds by the fields and the indecipherable words of the announcers over the loud speakers takes me back to when Misato brought me into Littletown. It was to see one of their festivals, in the years they still bothered to have them before the Migrant Rush to the homeland.  
在这里，田野旁人群的喧嚣和扩音器中播音员难以辨认的话语，让我回想起 Misato 带我来到小城的那一刻。那时是为了参加他们仍在举办的节日之一，在移民潮涌向故土之前。

The city council had decided it would be beneficial for the 'preservation of Japanese culture' to hold the annual traditions that had, up until then, been celebrated in the provinces of their birth. They agreed upon the _Gion Matsuri_, though most of the younger Jerries couldn't tell you what that was or why it was important, any hard meaning lost as it quickly turned into a mish-mash of regions itching to adhere to their particular brand of provincial piety.  
市议会认为，为了'保留日本文化'，举行那些直到那时还在其诞生省份庆祝的年度传统活动是有益的。他们选择了祇园祭，尽管大多数年轻一代的日本人无法告诉你那是什么，或者它为何重要，任何深刻的意义都随着它迅速变成各地区急于坚持其特定地方虔诚的混杂而丧失。

Eventually, it simply became the _Rikōru-sai_. The Recalling Festival.  
最终，它简化为利光祭。回忆节。

There were no temples to offer reverence to the Shinto gods, very few priests and almost no shrine maidens, much to the resentment of the older generation.  
这里没有神社供奉神道教的神灵，僧侣寥寥无几，巫女更是近乎绝迹，这让老一辈人颇为不满。

"_This is Japan,_" the festival said. "_What is left of it._"  
“这里是日本，”节日如是说，“仅存的日本。”

The stair-like tiers of the mine were lined with glowing paper lanterns and girls draped in green, pink and purple kimonos. People dressed as Samurai rode horses down into the pits where the food stalls were and, in some gaping hole dug out for industry in Arizona, reenacted the Fourth Battle of Kanawakajima with plastic sets of lamellar armor painstakingly corded and sewn together in sand-riddled homes.  
矿井的阶梯状层级上挂满了发光的纸灯笼，身着绿、粉、紫三色和服的女孩们点缀其间。装扮成武士的人们骑马深入矿坑内的食品摊位，在亚利桑那州某个为工业挖掘的巨大洞穴中，用塑料制成的扎甲道具，费尽心思地串联缝合，在家中沙尘弥漫的环境里，重现了第四次川中岛之战的场景。

It was our very own coliseum.  
那是我们自己的竞技场。

Most of Littletown gathered in the morning and the men, lacking in traditional garb and settling for no shirts and white headbands, pulled giant wooden floats that rolled on wheels six feet around. Often they would get stuck in the sand and extra runners were needed to lay down wooden slats ahead of them. A grueling task, but an honored one. The floats were decorated with tapestries and lanterns while singers and flute players danced on top of them.  
小城的大多数居民清晨聚集，男人们没有传统服饰，只穿着无袖上衣和白色头带，拖着巨大的木制浮台，这些浮台的轮子有六英尺宽。他们常常陷在沙子里，需要额外的跑者在他们前面铺设木板。这是一项艰苦的任务，但却是光荣的。浮台上装饰着挂毯和灯笼，而歌手和笛手则在上面跳舞。

A boy no older than me at the time ran down the sand ramp barefoot and climbed up the largest float, where he drew a sword twice his size and cut a rope as thick as my leg in one stroke. The dirt slopes shook with bells and cheering as the _Matsuri_ began in earnest.  
一个当时和我年纪相仿的男孩赤脚跑下沙坡，爬上最大的浮台，他拔出一把比自己还大的剑，一挥之下砍断了一根和我腿一样粗的绳子。随着铃声和欢呼声，祭典正式开始了。

A fat-faced stall worker said a Magister used to pick a son from the merchant families to be dressed in Shinto robes and isolated away from the city for weeks undergoing purifying ceremonies in the temples. On the way to the float, he rode on horseback and was not allowed to touch the ground, though the worker couldn't recall why. Something about a Phoenix, he said, handing me a skewer of charcoal grilled chicken doused in sweet sauce.  
一个胖脸的摊贩告诉我，曾经有位执政官会从商贾家族中挑选一个孩子，穿上神道教的袍子，被隔离在城外数周，在寺庙中进行净化仪式。前往花车途中，他骑在马上，不得触地，尽管摊贩记不清原因。他提到了凤凰，一边说着，一边递给我一串涂满甜酱的炭烤鸡肉串。

More floats passed by and women Misato told me were from Morioka danced behind them, thumping and clacking their drums and singing in a nasally, drawn out way. Their faces were painted white, eyes lined in black mascara and lips dabbed with crimson, ghostly figures that moved as if in a trance. The intonation of their hymn, high and ethereal in presence, rang clear and chilling alongside the bells. To me, it seemed they were casting a spell over all of Arizona.  
更多的花车经过，米萨托告诉我，那些来自盛冈的女子在后面跳舞，敲打着鼓，用鼻音拉长的唱腔歌唱。她们的脸涂得雪白，眼线涂着黑色睫毛膏，嘴唇点上鲜红，如同幽灵般，动作仿佛处于恍惚之中。她们的圣歌音调高亢而缥缈，与铃声交织，清晰而令人寒颤。在我看来，她们似乎在为整个亚利桑那施下咒语。

A boy escorting a mock Shinto shrine, walking with a swagger that was half arrogance and half the fanned out shoulders of his haori, tried to explain it. His dialect was one I could barely discern but the tale, from what I gathered, involved a legend about a demon and a place called Iwate.  
一个护送模拟神社的男孩，走路时带着半分傲慢半分和服外褂扇形肩的姿态，试图向我解释。他的方言我几乎听不懂，但据我所知，这个故事涉及一个关于恶魔和名为岩手的传说的传说。

The city-goers of Tucson, those that were little enough to remember climbing out of the _Rikōru-sai's_ dusty coliseum, will explain such stories to outsiders and, in just as many broad strokes, splash together a blurred painting of Pima County, where people practice a cultural reverence that is neither American, nor Hispanic, nor Japanese nor Indian.  
图森市的居民，那些还记得从里库鲁-赛尘土飞扬的竞技场爬出来的孩子们，会向外人讲述这样的故事，同样用粗犷的笔触，勾勒出一幅模糊的皮马县画卷，那里的人们实践着一种文化敬畏，既非美国式，也非西班牙式，亦非日本式或印度式。

So for some, Kino Sportsplex is a place grounded in the old and familiar.  
因此，对某些人来说，基诺体育综合体是一个根植于旧日熟悉之地。

Changing inside, I find we are the only ones making use of the heated indoor pool, far too large for just two people. Nina, having a moment ago been so excited to wear her purple one-piece with the pink butterflies, pensively regards the veritable ocean.  
在更衣室内，我发现我们是唯一使用这个宽敞到足以容纳两人的室内恒温泳池的人。尼娜，刚刚还兴奋地穿上她那件带有粉色蝴蝶的紫色连体泳衣，此刻却若有所思地凝视着这片宛如海洋的水域。

I curse my mother for the third time in a day.  
我一天之内第三次咒骂我的母亲。

She was hesitant to come out of the changing room too, turning the last thirty minutes into an awkward, half-hearted bit of coaxing on my part. In the end, it was her own resolve more than anything I said that got her standing here now.  
她也不太愿意走出更衣室，最后三十分钟在我这边变成了尴尬、半心半意的哄劝。最终，让她站在这里的，更多的是她自己的决心，而非我说的任何话。

Nina sits at the edge and dips her legs in, swaying side to side, pensive still. Sitting beside her, I catch a discoloration lapping on the surface where her legs swing. Blinking, I realize the yellow splotches are on the skin of her shins and thighs.  
尼娜坐在边缘，将双腿浸入水中，左右摇摆，依然若有所思。我坐在她旁边，注意到她晃动的腿周围，水面泛起了一片异色。眨眼间，我意识到那些黄色斑点是在她的胫部和大腿上。

"What happened to your legs?" I ask.  
"你的腿怎么了？" 我问道。

Nina stops kicking her feet and draws them back, perhaps thinking I might forget if I can't see.  
妮娜停止踢腿，把脚缩了回去，也许她以为如果我看不见，就会忘记这件事。

"I was... burning stuff outside with nail polish yesterday and... daddy yelled at me," she says. "I didn't mean to make him mad."  
"我昨天在外面用指甲油烧东西...然后...爸爸对我大吼大叫，" 她说。"我不是故意惹他生气的。"

"Did he...?" "他...？"

"No!" she flinches, embarrassed by the echo of her voice. "Daddy wouldn't... he wouldn't do that. I know he wasn't _really_ mad at me. Mama said it smells like cordite. I don't know what that is. I didn't know it would..."  
"不！"她畏缩了一下，为自己的声音回响感到尴尬。"爸爸不会...他不会那么做的。我知道他其实并没有真的生我的气。妈妈说有股硝烟味。我不知道那是什么。我没想到会..."

I consider asking her if she gave herself those bruises, but I already know the answer to that. Though I keep trying to deny it, we really are the same. So why can't I figure out how to make her smile and laugh again? This is why I shouldn't be around children. I knew my mother was wrong about all this.  
我想问她那些瘀伤是不是自己弄的，但我已经知道答案了。尽管我一直试图否认，我们真的很相似。那为什么我就是想不出办法让她再次微笑和欢笑呢？这就是我不该接近孩子的原因。我知道我妈妈在这件事上错了。

One of Nina's hands presses on my sternum.  
妮娜的一只手按在我的胸骨上。

"He says... it's like a fire, in his chest. He tries to control it, but sometimes he can't. I know he wouldn't ever hurt me on purpose. I know he's trying his best." Nina takes her hand away, leaning to brush over her bruises. "I have to try my best too."  
“他说……就像胸口有团火。他试图控制，但有时做不到。我知道他不会故意伤害我。我知道他在尽力。”妮娜收回手，俯身轻抚自己的瘀伤。“我也必须尽力。”

Does she always hurt herself like this? Looking at my stomach, I can still make out the faded lines from ripped skin. There's nothing wrong with you, Nina, I want to say. It's not your fault.  
她总是这样伤害自己吗？看着我的腹部，我仍能辨认出皮肤撕裂后留下的淡痕。妮娜，你没问题，我想说。这不是你的错。

"Can you swim?" I ask.  
"你会游泳吗？" 我问道。

"Duh," Nina sneers, allowing something of herself to return. She stands and looks down at me with her hands on her hips. "I can touch the bottom of the pool. It's ten feet, you know."  
"废话，" 妮娜嗤之以鼻，流露出些许本性。她站起身，双手叉腰俯视着我，"我能在泳池底站稳。你知道的，水深十英尺。"

After a moment of debate, I push her in.  
经过片刻的犹豫，我一把将她推了下去。

Her squeal is swallowed by the water. Bobbing back up, she sputters and whines, "Meanie!"  
她的尖叫被水吞没。浮上水面，她喷着水，抱怨道，“坏蛋！”

"I told you I'm not nice," I say with a laugh.  
“我说过我不是好人，”我笑着回答。

"You have to let me push _you_ in now so we can be even!"  
“现在你得让我推你进去，这样我们就扯平了！”

"I'll throw you right back in if you try."  
"你敢试试，我就把你扔回去。"

So, of course, she tries – and goes flying when I jump to my feet and pick her up. We repeat this several times, until it becomes a game to see just how high and how far I can toss her, while she smiles ear to ear and shakes with infectious giggles. We stop maybe an hour later when it feels like my arms are melting and I realize – too late – that I've let my guard down as she tackles my legs, bucking my knees and sending us both into a weird, splashy tumble.  
所以，她当然尝试了——当我跳起来把她抱起时，她飞了出去。我们重复了好几次，直到这变成了一场游戏，看我能把她抛得多高多远，她笑得合不拢嘴，咯咯的笑声极具感染力。大约一个小时后，我们停了下来，那时我感觉手臂像要融化一样，我才意识到——太晚了——我放松了警惕，她扑向我的腿，猛地撞向我的膝盖，把我们俩都摔进了一场奇怪的、水花四溅的翻滚中。

Laughing, she latches onto my shoulders and hangs off my back, shouting, "You're a horse now!"  
她大笑着，紧紧抓住我的肩膀，挂在我背上，大喊："你现在是一匹马了！"

I neigh accordingly. 我随之嘶鸣一声。

Our skin is pruning by the time we dry and dress, trying to make one another laugh by doing impressions of old people on the walk to the baseball fields. Here the air is hot and musky from a few hundred bodies and their breath on the air. As we sit in the stands, there's the _plink_ of a bat on ball that sets the crowd in an uproar.  
当我们擦干身体并穿上衣服时，皮肤已经泡得皱巴巴的，我们试图通过模仿老年人的样子在去棒球场的路上逗对方笑。这里的空气因几百人的呼吸而变得闷热且带有霉味。我们坐在看台上，球棒击中球的声音引发了人群的欢呼。

By the time we make it back home, it is past four and I am short one-hundred dollars.  
当我们回到家时，已经过了四点，而我少了整整一百美元。

Settled in the Throne, dad scrolls through the news on his PDA, while mother frowns at a spread of papers in the kitchen.  
坐在王座上，父亲用他的 PDA 浏览新闻，而母亲则在厨房里对着一堆文件皱眉。

"There you are," she says, taking off her reading glasses. "How did it go?"  
“你在这儿，”她摘下阅读眼镜说道，“怎么样？”

"Fine," I answer, cut off from anything further as Nina bursts past me and climbs up into a seat, recounting our escapades in overflowing detail while my mother listens with a patient smile. Her eyes squint with amusement every time Nina calls her _Abuela_.  
“挺好的，”我回答，还没来得及说更多，妮娜就从我身边冲过去爬上座位，滔滔不绝地讲述我们的冒险经历，而我母亲则带着耐心的微笑倾听。每当妮娜叫她阿布埃拉时，她的眼睛都会因笑意而眯起。

Father sets his PDA on the coffee table when I sit on the couch and flicks the T.V. on. He turns to watch his wife and their charge. Yoshiya said he could come by to pick her up earlier, but she hasn't expressed the desire to return home and my parents have said they do not mind.  
当我坐在沙发上，父亲将他的 PDA 放在咖啡桌上，并打开了电视。他转过身来，注视着他的妻子和他们的被监护人。吉泽说过他可以早点过来接她，但她并没有表现出回家的愿望，而我的父母也表示不介意。

"Come on," mom says, tying her hair up as she stands. "Let's get dinner started."  
“来吧，”妈妈说着，站起身来把头发扎起。“我们开始准备晚餐吧。”

Nina follows and they begin mincing vegetables. Mother calls them by their German name as they do and Nina repeats the words in a sing-song fashion.  
妮娜跟着她，两人开始切菜。母亲用德语称呼这些蔬菜，妮娜则用唱歌般的方式重复着这些词。

"_Zwiebeln_~!" "洋葱~！"

"_Knoblauch_~!" "大蒜~！"

My father leans into his Throne, absently circling a finger around the buttons of the remote. At ease.  
我父亲靠在他的宝座上，心不在焉地用手指绕着遥控器上的按钮。悠然自得。

I reconsider bringing up the line of questions that has at dark, quiet intervals during the past few days resurfaced to drag my thoughts into sky-swallowing canyons. Even here, just as everything seems right and at peace, it coils around my mind, repeating the same reading of my father's journal. When I learned that I have the eyes of my grandfather.  
我重新考虑提出那些问题，它们在过去几天里不时在黑暗寂静的间隙中浮现，将我的思绪拖入深不可测的峡谷。即使在这里，当一切似乎都正确且平静时，它仍缠绕在我的脑海中，重复着对父亲日记的解读。当我得知我拥有祖父的眼睛时。

"Hey, dad?" “嘿，爸爸？”

He straightens and turns, pulled away from somewhere. "Hm?"  
他挺直身子转过身来，从某个地方被拉了回来。“嗯？”

"What was Ge–" a memory cuts my voice, of the last time this name was used in our home. I stare at the remote sitting atop his armrest. "What was your father like?"  
"刚才是说——" 一段记忆切断了我的声音，那是这个名字最后一次在家中被提起。我盯着他扶手上放着的遥控器。"你父亲是个怎样的人？"

Dad purses his lips and shrugs, turning his gaze to the television. "I don't know," he says, a practiced nonchalance putting his posture more rigid than it was before. He starts to nibble at the flesh of his forefinger and tries very hard to be thoroughly interested in the football game on TV. "He sent me to live away from him when I was four," he says after a touchdown, hand folded into a fist so that I can see his ring. "We didn't talk or see each other for years."  
爸爸抿了抿嘴唇，耸耸肩，目光转向电视。"我不知道，"他说，一副习以为常的漠然态度让他的身姿比之前更加僵硬。他开始啃咬食指的肉，努力表现出对电视上足球比赛的浓厚兴趣。"他四岁时就把我送走了，"他在一次触地得分后说道，手握成拳，让我能看到他的戒指。"我们多年没有交谈或见面。"

"Why?" I ask, and see the same dark, vacant expression thirteen-year-old Shinji once wore in a photo.  
"为什么？"我问，看到了一张照片中十三岁的真嗣曾带着的同样深沉、空洞的表情。

"My mother died." “我母亲去世了。”

In the kitchen, while Nina hums and slides chopped vegetables into a bowl, mother prepares the stove and, with a measured smile, intentionally does not look our way.  
在厨房里，尼娜哼着小曲，将切好的蔬菜滑入碗中，母亲则准备着炉火，带着一丝刻意的微笑，有意不朝我们这边看。

There are four opaque, orange bottles standing at attention on the work desk in my room, a hundred and twenty tablets in each of them. Every little pill is a bite-sized bit of emotional stability.  
我房间的工作台上，整齐排列着四瓶不透明的橙色瓶子，每瓶装有一百二十片药片。每一小粒药丸都是一小口情感的稳定剂。

The first one, Lithium, spreads into the central nervous system, reducing norepinephrine and increasing serotonin – the laughable part being no one really knows the exact mechanism it relies on. _It just works_. And that's fine, because all _I_ need to know is that I'll be far less susceptible to suicidal tendencies.  
第一种药物，锂剂，会扩散到中枢神经系统，减少去甲肾上腺素并增加血清素——可笑的是，没人真正知道它依赖的确切机制。它只是有效。这很好，因为我只需要知道我将大大减少自杀倾向的风险。

Then there's Prazosin, blocking the effects of adrenaline on the body, which tend to impart the not-so-awesome sensation of dying while I dream.  
然后是普萘洛尔，阻断身体对肾上腺素的影响，这种影响在我梦中往往会带来一种不太美妙的濒死感。

Ah, and of course there are the antidepressants. This is another fun one they don't know the mechanism for either, but it suppresses the re-absorption of serotonin, keeping it in the reservoir for longer, which means happy feelings _all_ the time. Each therapist I've gone to has said they're meant as a temporary solution and that further cognitive therapy is recommended.  
啊，当然还有抗抑郁药。这也是一个他们不知道机制的有趣药物，但它抑制了血清素的再吸收，让它在储存库中停留更久，这意味着快乐的感觉随时都有。我见过的每一位治疗师都说它们是临时解决方案，并建议进一步进行认知疗法。

Well, that just doesn't work nearly as well.  
嗯，这样效果就不太好了。

And the benzos. They take the transmitters of all those nerve-twitching, nail-biting feelings you don't want and just – cut them off for a while. From this bottle I take two. This isn't recommended, but one tablet doesn't have quite the same effect anymore.  
还有苯二氮平类药物。它们会切断那些让你神经紧张、咬指甲的不愉快感觉的传递物质，就那么——暂时切断。从这瓶药里我吃两片。这并不推荐，但一片已经没有以前那种效果了。

This is how my days have traditionally begun, and here it's no different. Except, after this morning's shower, I enter to see my father standing in my old room, right by the desk with one of the bottles in his hand.  
这就是我传统上一天的开始，在这里也没什么不同。只是，今天早上洗完澡后，我走进房间，看到我父亲站在我以前的房间里，就在桌子旁边，手里拿着一瓶药。

"Got these a couple weeks ago, huh?" he asks and my stomach flips. His back is partially to me. I manage to keep spiteful words down, right in my chest where they start to burn holes.  
"几周前弄到的，是吧？" 他问道，我胃里一阵翻腾。他的背部分对着我。我勉强压下恶毒的话语，它们在我胸中开始灼出洞来。

"So what?" I tug on the collar of my blue shirt, made out of led now instead of cotton.  
"那又怎样？" 我拉了拉蓝色衬衫的领子，现在是用铅而不是棉制成的。

He shakes it. "Half empty already."  
他摇了摇它。"已经半空了。"

"I get very anxious," I say, berating myself for having not seen this coming. My father isn't a meddler, preferring to keep to himself rather than stick his nose where it doesn't belong – the complete opposite of my mother. When he does, it's always in the worst way and at the worst time. He may think himself discreet and clever, but I've caught his glances to my jacket pockets, seen the pieces being sorted together behind his eyes.  
"我变得非常焦虑，"我说，责怪自己没有预见到这一幕。我父亲不是个爱管闲事的人，他更喜欢独善其身，而不是把鼻子伸到不该去的地方——和我母亲完全相反。当他真的插手时，总是最糟糕的方式和最不合适的时机。他可能自以为谨慎且聪明，但我已经注意到他瞥向我夹克口袋的目光，看到他眼中拼凑线索的片段。

"You don't need these," he says, again not a question or a suggestion. An order.  
"你不需要这些，"他再次说道，不是疑问也不是建议。这是一个命令。

"I'll be the judge of that, thanks."  
"我自有分寸，谢谢。"

His hand tightens around the capsule. "I won't let you take these anymore," he says, facing me fully now, hard and unwavering.  
他的手紧紧握住胶囊。“我不会再让你拿走这些了，”他完全面对着我，坚定不移地说道。

"That's **not** your decision to make," I snap, ready to tear into him as I move to take the bottle.  
“这不是你说了算的，”我厉声反驳，准备冲上去夺回瓶子。

He grabs the front of my shirt with a strength I'd thought diminished. "You wanna' end up like your old man?"  
他用我以为已经减弱的力量抓住我的衬衫前襟。“你想变得像你老爸那样吗？”

Fear, in skin-crawling, shuddering waves just about keeps me paralyzed as I relive those nights my father shattered plates and made the walls shake with his voice.  
恐惧，如爬满肌肤、颤抖不止的波浪，几乎让我动弹不得，当我重温那些夜晚，父亲摔碎盘子，用他的声音让墙壁震动。

"_Get off me_." I tear his hand away and he staggers into my desk, knocking the bottles to the floor. "I actually need these," I snarl, if only to keep from shutting down. I want him to hit me, like my mother. I need his rage to hurt me, so I can finally label him scum-of-the-earth and be rid of this useless anxiety and this faulty hope.  
"放开我。"我猛地甩开他的手，他踉跄撞上我的书桌，瓶瓶罐罐应声落地。"我真需要这些，"我咆哮道，只为不让自己崩溃。我希望他打我，像我母亲那样。我需要他的愤怒来伤害我，这样我才能最终给他贴上人渣的标签，摆脱这无用的焦虑和错误的希望。

"So does every other addict," he breathes, visibly calming himself.  
"其他每个瘾君子也是如此，"他喘息着，明显在努力平复情绪。

"What the hell do you know? Where were you five years ago, huh? A fucking hospital for lunatics because you tried to kill yourself one too many times."  
"你他妈知道什么？五年前你在哪儿，嗯？在一个该死的疯人院，因为你一次又一次地试图自杀。"

The feeling is cathartic and terrible.  
这种感觉既宣泄又可怕。

"Keep taking your damn pills, then," he growls, setting the benzos upright on the work table and marching out of my room.  
"那就继续吃你的该死的药吧，"他咆哮着，把苯二氮平放在工作台上，然后大步走出我的房间。"

Mother walks up to the threshold just as he leaves, having come up to investigate. She knows everything at a glance, expression cloudy as she touches a hand to the door frame. Nina is on the stairs behind her, curious, but withdrawn.  
母亲在他离开之际走到门槛前，本是上来查看。她一眼便知一切，表情阴沉地用手触摸门框。妮娜在她身后的楼梯上，好奇却又退缩。

Embarrassed, annoyed, fuming, I bite the inside of my cheek and start picking up pill bottles before I can say something else stupid. Maybe I was wrong to think I could be comfortable here – or that I'd made any leaps and bounds with him. Hear some war stories, read a few journal entries, and we're as good as new, right?  
我感到尴尬、恼怒、愤怒，咬着内颊，开始捡起药瓶，以免再说出什么愚蠢的话。也许我错了，以为自己能在这里感到自在——或者以为我和他之间有了什么进展。听几个战争故事，读几篇日记，我们就和好如初了，对吧？

How do we keep doing this?  
我们怎么还能继续这样做？

"Your father loves you, Kazuya," mother says, making me pause, though I try to hide it. "He doesn't know how to show it, but he loves you."  
“你父亲爱你，和也，”母亲说道，让我不由得停下脚步，尽管我试图掩饰。“他不知道如何表达，但他爱你。”

She doesn't say anything more and heads back down stairs, her voice adopting a bubbly tone that echoes around the house as she tries to pretend, for Nina, that all is still as it should be.  
她没有再说什么，转身下楼去了，她的声音变得欢快起来，回荡在屋子里，她试图在妮娜面前假装一切如常。

At least it didn't turn into another lecture, another argument, where she sits on that forever-high horse of hers and I throw mud clods in the form of insults. Maybe she's learned that I won't listen, that my pride is too much like hers.  
至少这没有演变成另一场说教，另一场争吵，她坐在她那永远高人一等的马上，而我则以侮辱的形式投掷泥块。也许她已经明白我不会听，我的骄傲和她如出一辙。

My pride. 我的骄傲。

---

My father does what he knows best and avoids his family. It's hard to blame him much now. More and more I come to see how alike we are, and how I seek out solitude the same way. Sometimes I can't stand other people. Sometimes I just need to be alone. I'm not sure what I'd even say to him if we talked right now anyway, but that one is nothing new.  
我父亲做着他最擅长的事，避开家人。现在很难过多责怪他。我越来越意识到我们有多么相似，我也同样寻求独处。有时候我无法忍受其他人。有时候我只是需要独处。即使我们现在交谈，我也不确定能对他说些什么，但这并不新鲜。

I have occupied the Throne when he enters the living room, motioning for me to stay put when I jump to stand. He sits on the couch, in the same spot I was when I asked him what my grandfather was like.  
当他走进客厅时，我已坐在王座上，他示意我别动，当我起身时。他坐在沙发上，就在我之前问他祖父是什么样子的那个位置。

"How long?" he asks, knitting his hands together in his lap and peering at me over the rim of his glasses with what can only be a hopeless sort of resignation. "The pills. How long?"  
"多久？" 他问道，双手在膝上交织，透过眼镜框边缘以一种近乎绝望的顺从神情看着我。"那些药。多久了？"

The Throne feels too large. "Five years," I say, crossing a leg, shrugging a shoulder. _No big deal_, my body says, because I know what he's really asking about. "They diagnosed me with Secondary PTSD maybe three years ago."  
那王座显得过于空旷。"五年了，"我说，翘起一条腿，耸了耸肩。没什么大不了的，我的身体如此表示，因为我明白他真正想问的是什么。"大概三年前，他们诊断我患有继发性创伤后应激障碍。"

The words physically shake him and he closes his eyes, a hand coming up to his face. I've seen my father cry, seen him crumble into a shuddering mess after another terrible episode. What I've never seen is one of those jagged cracks actually split into him before. His fingers weave up into his hair and for a moment there are no masks, there are no barriers, no words. There is just a man, who has tried and struggled so much and been defeated time and again.  
这些话仿佛实实在在地震撼了他，他闭上眼睛，一只手捂住脸。我见过父亲哭泣，见过他在又一次可怕的剧变后崩溃成颤抖的一团。但我从未见过那些锯齿状的裂痕真正在他身上裂开。他的手指插入发间，有那么一刻，没有面具，没有隔阂，没有言语。只有一个男人，他曾尝试过、挣扎过无数次，却一次又一次地被击败。

"I'm sorry," he says, shaking his head, eyes wet.  
"对不起，" 他摇着头说，眼里含着泪。

"For what?" “为了什么？”

"Everything," he breathes.  
"所有的一切，" 他喘息着说。

Without realizing it, I've leaned forward in the armchair and my father is nearer than I remember, close enough to reach out and touch. I twine my hands together. The words are there, in the back of my throat – trapped. Forgiveness isn't a commodity I've ever dealt in. Grudges are easier to hold – and easier to sell as justified.  
不知不觉中，我已向前倾身在扶手椅上，父亲比我记忆中的更近，近到可以伸手触及。我双手交缠在一起。那些话就在我喉咙后头——被困住了。原谅从来不是我交易过的东西。怨恨更容易持有——也更容易被证明是合理的。

I nod, lips pursed as he and I find other places to look for the next ten minutes.  
我点点头，双唇紧闭，接下来的十分钟里，他和我都找了别的地方去看。

"Did someone really spit at you?" I say, feeling far too lucid and, as a result, far too aware of a quiet that needs filling.  
“真的有人朝你吐口水吗？”我说，感觉过于清醒，因此也过于意识到需要填补的寂静。

He blinks, once – twice. "What?"  
他眨了眨眼，一次——两次。“什么？”

"Your journal. You wrote about someone spitting on you as you walked off a plane in Ottawa."  
你的日记。你提到在渥太华下飞机时有人朝你吐口水。

Another string of blinks, then his shoulders shift – he recalculates.  
他又眨了几下眼，然后肩膀动了动——他在重新估量。

As long as we don't talk about before, about the pills or his dementia, or anything in the here and now, we'll be okay. The war, which seems to have opened this dark rift where I cannot find it in myself to forgive my father, ends up being the only way to close it – as it is the only way I know how to communicate with him.  
只要我们不谈过去，不提那些药片或他的痴呆症，也不触及当下任何事情，我们就能相安无事。那场战争，似乎在我心中撕开了一道黑暗的裂缝，我发现自己无法原谅父亲，最终却成了弥合这道裂缝的唯一途径——因为这是我唯一知道如何与他沟通的方式。

"The stewardess, actually." he scratches under his chin, stiff, guarded now. Leaning forward, he takes his glasses off and cleans the lenses with his shirt, swiping a thumb across his eye. "I still remember when they were escorting us into the courthouse. Through the windows I caught a glimpse of all the people filling up the square. Thousands of them." he says, debating a frown as he lets his glasses hang precariously from his fingers between his knees. Behind me, he stares out of the windows for a time before pointing. "They all had these signs that said things like '_baby killers_' or '_no trial_', '_justice for genocide_'. One group had this banner the size of a bus that read '_death penalty for pilots_'."  
"“其实是空姐。”他挠了挠下巴，显得僵硬而戒备。他身体前倾，摘下眼镜，用衬衫擦拭镜片，同时用拇指抹了抹眼睛。“我至今还记得他们带我们进入法院时的情景。透过窗户，我瞥见了广场上挤满了人。成千上万。”他说着，皱眉思索，让眼镜在他手指间摇摇欲坠地挂着。他凝视窗外片刻，然后指向外面。“他们举着各种标语，比如‘婴儿杀手’或‘无需审判’，‘为种族灭绝伸张正义’。有一群人举着一面巴士大小的横幅，上面写着‘飞行员死刑’。”

This I've never heard before. The disdain that filled those who found out his birth name was something I'd known about since I was young, but I've never been told these people had once amassed in the thousands to pray for his death, or that anyone had ever spat at him. No one would ever treat a soldier like that today, not here at least. Then again, I suppose most soldiers don't take part in conflicts that result in the end of the world.  
这是我从未听说过的。那些得知他本名后充满鄙夷的人，我从儿时起就有所耳闻，但我从未被告知这些人曾成千上万地聚集，祈求他的死亡，或是有人曾向他吐口水。如今，至少在这里，没有人会这样对待一名士兵。不过，我想大多数士兵并未参与导致世界末日的冲突。

"It was like they'd forgotten we were fighting the Angels before Third Impact," he says, glaring at something I can't perceive. "I thought we were doing something right back then. I thought we were saving people. No one seemed to care about that."  
"就好像他们忘了我们在第三次冲击前是在与使徒作战一样，"他说着，瞪着某个我看不见的东西。"那时候我以为我们做的是对的。我以为我们在拯救人们。但似乎没人关心这一点。"

My father isn't so prideful like my mother, but he has it, letting it flourish in small, decisive ways – and this is one blow that's chipped away at it too many times to be measured. He might not have been proud of what he'd done during the war, but after everything – he felt like maybe it meant something. Not in his journals, where he is tortured and dragged down by it. Over time, he has looked back on the war, seen something good to come from it all and taken solace in the fact that maybe, just maybe, he'd done something right all those years ago.  
我父亲不像我母亲那样骄傲，但他也有自己的骄傲，让它在细微而果断的方式中生长——而这已经是太多无法计量的打击之一。他可能并不为自己在战争中所做的事感到自豪，但经历了这一切之后——他觉得也许那意味着什么。不是在他那些被折磨和拖垮的日记里。随着时间的推移，他回顾那场战争，看到了从中产生的一些美好，并从中找到了慰藉，也许，仅仅是也许，那些年他做对了些什么。

And why not? Protecting humanity? What other cause in the world is more noble? What a mantle that must have been to hold at so young. That might not be the way he saw it, but... well, maybe he deserves to be at least a little proud.  
为什么不呢？保护人类？世界上还有比这更高尚的事业吗？在那么年轻的时候承担这样的重任，一定很沉重。也许他并不这么看，但...嗯，也许他至少应该感到一丝自豪。

_"No one cares you fought in some stupid war,"_ I had said, only thirteen. Shame burns my cheeks.  
"没人关心你打过什么愚蠢的战争，"我当时才十三岁，羞愧让我的脸颊发烫。

He certainly doesn't deserve to be spit at.  
他当然不值得被人吐口水。

"Looking back on it," dad says, sliding his glasses back on. "I was pretty lucky to have your mom then. I'm not sure I would have made it through otherwise."  
"回想起来，"爸爸说着，重新戴上眼镜。"那时有你妈妈在身边，我真的很幸运。否则，我不确定自己能否挺过来。"

The only thing I can think to say is, "You're an odd pair."  
我唯一能想到的话就是，“你们真是一对奇怪的组合。”

He manages a smirk. "I used to wonder if it was really love. We were the only ones who could care for each other. We still do."  
他勉强挤出一个微笑。“我曾经怀疑这是否真的是爱。我们是唯一能彼此关心的人。现在依然如此。”

"After almost forty years of putting up with you? Has to be love."  
“忍受了你将近四十年？这一定是爱。”

That makes him laugh, remembering something he doesn't share. "We learned that, after a while."  
这让他笑了起来，想起了某个他未曾分享的事情。“我们过了一段时间才明白这一点。”

So I ask, "Didn't you say she hated you when you were kids?"  
于是我问道：“你不是说过她小时候讨厌你吗？”

Dad looks over his shoulder, just in case there is a red-maned spy lurking about. "Mostly," he answers, shifting and becoming subdued. "When she was an Eva pilot, there wasn't room for anything else in her life."  
爸爸回头看了一眼，以防有红发间谍潜伏在附近。“大多数时候，”他回答道，语气变得低沉。“当她成为 EVA 驾驶员时，她的生活中没有其他空间了。”

The conversation me and her had before she left D.C. comes drifting back. "She used to be pretty proud of it, right? What changed?"  
她离开华盛顿前我们之间的对话又浮现在脑海。“她曾经为此相当自豪，对吧？是什么改变了？”

"She was hit in a bad way once," he says, quiet, as though speaking of it any louder might make it real again. "Well, much more than once, but... this was different. It was just after the Fourteenth Angel. The whole GeoFront was still a mess after the last battle. They had me on the pilot roster, but Unit-one was on ice."  
“她曾遭受过一次严重的打击，”他轻声说道，仿佛说得再大声些就会让那一切重现。“嗯，不止一次，但……这次不同。就在第十四使徒事件之后。整个 GeoFront 在那场战斗后还是一团糟。我被列入了驾驶员名单，但初号机被冻结了。”

"What's that mean?" “那是什么意思？”

"Cryo-stasis. In case it went out of control again. They sat me in the plug before the battle, on standby. But in reality, only your mom and Rei were actually active."  
"冷冻休眠。以防它再次失控。他们在战斗前让我进入插入栓，处于待命状态。但实际上，只有你妈妈和丽是真正活跃的。"

"Wait, it went out of control? Like a weapons malfunction?"  
"等等，失控？像是武器故障那样吗？"

"No..." he shakes his head, where I see him cut up bits of the story. With reluctance, he tries to explain. "The Evas were made from an Angel they found in Antarctica, and sometimes they went nuts – took control. That's why NERV had to put the armor on them. Some of the plates acted like restrains that way. Signal dampeners and the like."  
"不..." 他摇摇头，我看到他断断续续地切割着故事的片段。带着不愿，他试图解释。"EVA 是用他们在南极找到的天使制造的，有时候它们会发疯——夺取控制权。这就是为什么 NERV 必须给它们装上装甲。有些装甲板起到了束缚的作用，像是信号阻尼器之类的。"

I've always wondered why I machine could bleed, assuming Toji must've gotten something wrong. Harry never really explained what made them biological weapons systems, either. Or maybe I just never read far enough.  
我一直好奇为什么机器会流血，猜想可能是冬二搞错了什么。哈利从未真正解释过是什么让它们成为生物武器系统，要么就是我可能没读到足够深入的部分。

The Evas weren't just machines.  
EVA 不仅仅是机器。

They were living monsters.  
它们是活生生的怪物。

"We didn't know all that back then," he goes on, massaging his palm with a thumb, "me and your mom. We knew they had biological components, but we thought they were just machines too. That's what everyone told us."  
"那时候我们并不知道这一切，" 他继续说，用拇指按摩着掌心，"我和你妈妈。我们知道它们有生物组件，但我们以为它们也只是机器。大家都这么告诉我们的。"

He's hiding something from me. By the sidelong dips of his eyes, which only meet mine for a moment or two, though never when he speaks. Or the fidgeting of his hands, which he cannot keep idle. He isn't lying to me – but he isn't telling my everything either.  
他在对我隐瞒什么。从他眼角的斜视可以看出，他的目光只与我短暂相交一瞬，而且从不在他说话时。还有他那不安分的手，总是无法保持静止。他没有对我撒谎——但他也没有告诉我全部真相。

"So what happened?" I ask, hesitant to push.  
"那么发生了什么？" 我问，犹豫着是否要追问。

My father makes a lazy gesture up. "The Angel was in orbit. We couldn't hit it with any of our weapons. Positrons just dispersed on its field. Command tried to lure it closer and your mom launched against orders. Couldn't stand the idea of Rei taking point."  
我父亲懒洋洋地向上做了个手势。“天使号在轨道上。我们的武器都无法击中它。正电子在其力场中只是散开。指挥官试图引诱它靠近，而你妈妈违抗命令出击了。她无法忍受让丽站在最前线的想法。”

"Why?" “为什么？”

"She was always like that, putting herself in harms way. Just to prove that she could do it. Always getting hurt."  
“她总是那样，将自己置于危险之中。只是为了证明她能做到。总是受伤。”

A smirk finds its way free. He catches it and gives one of his own, nodding – _I know_.  
一丝讥笑不由自主地浮现。他捕捉到了，回以一笑，点头——我懂。

In a way, it's reassuring knowing that even back then my mother was much like she is today. Perhaps mellowed out some from what my father has told me, but still proud, arrogant and all too overbearing. A constant force of change and forward momentum, regardless of right or wrong.  
某种程度上，知道我母亲那时就和现在一样，令人感到安心。也许如父亲所说，她已经柔和了一些，但依旧骄傲、自负且过于强势。无论对错，她始终是推动变革和前进的恒定力量。

"The Angel..." dad sighs, elbows on his knees and hands clasped together, making me think of a man in prayer. "It was able to get inside her head... it messed with her mind, made her see things, tore away at her memories." he shakes his head. "I remember sitting in the plug and just... I begged them to launch me, but they wouldn't. She just... stopped after a while. Stopped moving, stopped screaming. Misato cut my feed after that."  
“那个天使……”爸爸叹息道，双肘撑在膝上，双手合十，让我想起一个正在祈祷的人。“它能进入她的脑海……扰乱她的心智，让她看到幻象，撕裂她的记忆。”他摇了摇头。“我记得坐在插入栓里，只是……我恳求他们让我出击，但他们不肯。她过了一会儿就……停止了。不再移动，不再尖叫。之后美里切断了我的通讯。”

Again I am reminded of Toji's story – about how the Angels could infect the Evas and control them. I try to picture an alien, made of sinewy folds and wrapped with arcing bands of light that it wears like armor, breaking into my head and scrambling up my brain. The image is an absurd one, and as much pain as there is when my father speaks of it, I wish I could know the real thing.  
我又想起了真治的故事——关于天使如何感染 EVA 并控制它们。我试图想象一个由肌肉般的褶皱构成、被弧光带环绕如同穿着盔甲的外星生物闯入我的脑海，搅乱我的大脑。这画面荒谬至极，尽管父亲提及此事时我感到痛苦，但我真希望能亲身体验那真实的一切。

"Why didn't they eject the plug?"  
"他们为什么不弹出插头？"

"Your mom had herself linked into the circuit – direct system overrides through the command chair. They couldn't eject her remotely. She wouldn't let them. They weren't sure if the feedback from the disconnect would hurt her or not anyway while she was under the Angel's field."  
"你妈妈把自己连接到了电路中——通过指挥椅直接系统覆盖。他们无法远程弹出她。她也不会让他们这么做。而且他们不确定在使徒的领域内断开连接的反馈是否会伤害到她。"

"Then how did they kill it?"  
"那他们是怎么干掉它的？"

"They sent Unit-zero, Rei's unit, down to Terminal Dogma for a weapon. The Lance of Longinus, they called it. Found it buried with the First Angel and it cut right through the Fifteenth's A.T. Field. Lost the thing out in lunar orbit just to kill it." Dad straightens, appearing to drift through the photos that still hang on our walls – built up with memories of a family. "Your mom, though... in some ways, she wasn't really the same after that."  
"他们派了零号机，绫波的机体，下到中央教条区去取一件武器。他们称之为朗基努斯之枪。在第一使徒身边找到它，它直接穿透了第十五使徒的绝对领域。为了消灭它，那东西最终遗失在月球轨道上。" 爸爸挺直了身子，仿佛在那些依旧挂在我们墙上的照片中漂浮——那些照片积攒着一家人的回忆。"但你妈妈，尽管如此...在某些方面，她自那以后就再也不是原来的她了。"

The statement hangs between us. Upstairs, we can hear movement, reminding us that there is still life here.  
这句话悬在我们之间。楼上，我们能听到动静，提醒我们这里仍有生命存在。

I can sense there's more he wants to say, though he keeps silent again. He's been sitting on it the entire conversation, which has all been a pretext to put us on speaking terms once more. And so that I can withdraw from the notion of forgiveness. It had been easy enough to forget, to push it into the cold outside and bite my tongue, up until he told me about having to sit by and listen to my mother's screams.  
我能感觉到他还有更多想说的，尽管他又保持了沉默。整场对话中他一直憋着不说，这一切都只是为了让我们重新开口交流。同时也是为了让我放弃原谅的念头。直到他告诉我不得不坐在一旁听着我母亲的尖叫声之前，这一切都很容易被遗忘，被推到寒冷的外面，咬紧牙关。

With it comes a weariness in him that I hadn't noticed before, sitting in his shoulders and etched in his face, and I know that my mother was right the other day when she said he was tired. Something that is all too heightened by talk of old battles. Yet here I am, being selfish again and asking for more.  
随之而来的是他身上一种我之前未曾注意到的疲惫，压在他的肩上，刻在他的脸上，我知道那天我母亲说得对，他说他累了。这种感觉在谈论旧日战斗时尤为强烈。然而，我又一次自私地索取更多。

My father pushes on his knees as he stands, cartilage cracking, and mumbles something about finding my mother to take Nina home.  
父亲用手撑着膝盖站起身，关节咔咔作响，嘴里咕哝着要去找母亲带尼娜回家。

"Hey, I–" my heart thunders, and my fists are tight. I've stood up without witnessing the motion. He's about to disappear around the corner. "I forgive you, by the way."  
“嘿，我——” 我的心跳如雷，拳头紧握。我不知何时已经站了起来。他正要消失在转角处。“顺便说一句，我原谅你了。”

He stops, but doesn't turn. Rather, I only see a part of his face as it drifts to the side. Slowly, the weight I saw in his shoulders crumbles away. It doesn't make him look smaller or weak, but instead plain, in his black slacks and turtleneck, an ordinary man who both saved and ended the world. Or so some say.  
他停下脚步，却没有转身。我只能瞥见他侧脸的一部分。慢慢地，我之前在他肩上看到的沉重感逐渐消散。这并没有让他显得更小或更弱，反而让他看起来平凡无奇，穿着黑色长裤和套头衫，一个既拯救了世界又终结了世界的普通男人。或者，这就是某些人的说法。

I don't have very good memories of this place or any of our other homes, since the Eva has always been a part of them in some twisted way. Living on through its pilots. I can't just put it behind me. I can't forget missing a mother and wishing for a father when I was growing up.  
我对这个地方或我们其他家的记忆并不美好，因为 Eva 总是以某种扭曲的方式存在于其中。通过它的驾驶员延续生命。我无法将它抛诸脑后。我无法忘记在成长过程中对母亲的思念和对父亲的渴望。

All the same, from now on, maybe I can at least try to understand.  
尽管如此，从现在开始，也许我至少可以尝试去理解。

His feet shift, but only bring him around halfway, where he searches my face. For what, I'll never know.  
他的脚挪动了一下，却只让他转到了一半，在那里他搜寻着我的脸。为了什么，我永远不会知道。

Neither of us look away.  
我们谁也没有移开目光。

"Thank you, son," he says and, for a few twilight seconds, we stay that way.  
“谢谢你，孩子，”他说道，在暮色中的几秒钟里，我们就这样停留着。

A pair of small feet stomp down the stairs, accompanied by the jingling of Nina's backpack. Mother is not far behind as they enter the hallway by the front door, drawing his attention away. The front door creaks. Keys ring.  
一双小脚噔噔地下着楼梯，伴随着尼娜背包的叮当声。母亲紧随其后，走进前门过道，吸引了他的注意。前门吱嘎作响。钥匙叮当作响。

I decide to ride along as we take Nina home.  
我决定陪着一起送尼娜回家。

_August 13, 2026 2026 年 8 月 13 日_

_Sometimes, I can still feel it. We both can. Asuka talks about going to get one of those surgeries – deep brain stimulation – but that's all talk. She keeps taking the pain meds anyway. So do I.  
有时候，我还能感觉到。我们俩都能。明日香谈起去做那种手术——深脑刺激——但那只是说说而已。她还是继续服用止痛药。我也一样。_

_They make everything too numb. Make the air heavy, like I'm drowning. But without them, I feel my flesh melt and peel open, and my muscles itch, no matter how raw I scratch the skin. Nerve spasms come and go. There's really no predicting it. At least I'm not dropping bowls and cups anymore.  
它们让一切都变得麻木。空气变得沉重，就像我在溺水。但没有它们，我感觉自己的肉体在融化、剥落，肌肉痒得不行，无论我怎么抓破皮肤。神经痉挛时来时去。真的无法预测。至少我现在不再摔碗摔杯了。_

_It's not so bad anymore.  
现在没那么糟糕了。_

_I had thought the same thing back in Tokyo-3, when Kaji was still looking after his watermelons and in a brief hour everything didn't seem so bad. I still miss those walks home from school.  
在东京-3 时，我也曾有过同样的想法，那时加持还在照看他的西瓜，短短的一小时里一切似乎都没那么糟糕。我仍然怀念放学后回家的那些散步。_

_My doubts and fears were pushed away. Piloting had become a part of me. I felt at peace and at home inside the entry-plug. The Eva was a part of me.  
我的疑虑和恐惧被推到了一旁。驾驶 Eva 已成为我的一部分。我在插入栓里感到平静和自在。Eva 也是我的一部分。_

_It wasn't that I had no fear. I was still scared of dying, of getting hurt or waking up in the hospital again. But I understood that people were counting on me to survive. For the first time people expected greatness of me – the Invincible Third Child.  
并不是我不害怕。我仍然害怕死亡，害怕受伤或再次在医院醒来。但我明白人们指望我活下去。人们第一次期待我展现非凡——无敌的三号孩子。_

_Before the Twelfth Angel came, I thought that I was finally ready to fight them.  
在第十二使徒到来之前，我以为自己终于准备好与它们战斗了。_

_As it turned out, I couldn't have been more wrong.  
结果证明，我错得离谱。_

### Chapter 16: December 22

My father has another session at the VA today and he's letting me tag along.  
我父亲今天在退伍军人事务部还有一场会诊，他让我跟着一起去。

It's a distant drive through parched soil, pale and gritty – not at all the kind of rich red and orange others think of when imagining Arizona. Rains rolling down from the mountains every once in a blue moon sprinkle bits of life that struggle to sap something from the sands, only to crack and dry out, creating patches of brittle and brown vegetation – cacti standing among them as grave markers.  
这是一段遥远的路程，穿越干涸的土地，苍白而粗糙——完全不是人们想象中亚利桑那州那种富饶的红橙色。偶尔从山间滚落的雨水，稀稀落落，洒下些许生命的种子，它们挣扎着从沙土中汲取养分，却最终干裂枯萎，形成一片片脆弱的棕色植被——仙人掌矗立其间，宛如墓碑。

Our conversation is just as barren and populated mostly by passing landmarks. Traffic gets clogged on I-10 once we hit Phoenix proper, the Southern Mountains close behind. He drives us into a rigid complex peppered with palm trees – a hospital that has gone to great pains to not look like a hospital – and parks under one of the many awnings that double as an array of solar panels.  
我们的对话同样贫瘠，大多被沿途的地标所填充。一旦进入凤凰城，I-10 号公路上交通便开始拥堵，南部的山脉近在咫尺。他将我们驶入一个点缀着棕榈树的刚硬建筑群——一家竭力不让自己看起来像医院的医院——并停在了众多兼具太阳能板功能的遮阳篷下。

The wind grows colder as we step out. My father walks ahead of me. "Not so bad for a hospital for lunatics, huh?"  
我们踏出室外，风变得更冷了。父亲走在我前面。“对一个疯人院来说还不算太糟，是吧？”

Ah. Now we're making jokes. "Cozy."  
啊，现在开始开玩笑了。“挺温馨的。”

An American flag waves over the roundabout, ringing against its tall pole. A gathering bell calling everyone in. The place isn't so different from the hospital I visited my mother at only last month. It is well kept, but more lively in the fake, amazon green plants along the ceiling high windows and under the open skylights. The smell is sharp, almost dry and mingled with something between tar and warm car seat leather. Attendants flit through the hallways, ever busy, or see to the men and women sitting in the waiting area.  
一面美国国旗在环形交叉口上方飘扬，撞击着高耸的旗杆。像是在召唤所有人聚集的钟声。这个地方与我上个月探望母亲的那家医院并无太大差别。它维护得很好，但假亚马逊绿植沿着高高的窗户和开放式天窗下显得更加生机勃勃。空气中弥漫着一种尖锐、几乎干燥的气味，混合着焦油和温暖汽车座椅皮革的味道。工作人员在走廊间穿梭，总是忙碌着，或是照料坐在等候区的男女们。

At the clerk's desk is a woman with chocolate hair that flows so loosely she often has to tuck it behind her ears, which are of the small and compact variety. She is much younger than me and calls everyone 'sugar'. My father puts on a smile as he checks in and the girl, Kate, nods him down the main corridor, though he moves with an already ingrained sense of destination.  
在服务台前，坐着一位巧克力色头发的女士，发丝如此松散，她常常需要将其挽至耳后，那耳朵小巧玲珑。她比我年轻许多，对每个人都亲切地称呼为‘甜心’。我父亲办理入住时露出了微笑，而那位名叫凯特的女孩点头示意他沿着主走廊前行，尽管他已凭着本能知晓目的地。

Veterans pass as we walk. Most appear to be in their sixties or older, frizzled hair gray and skin slowly shrink-wrapping tight around their bones. Their hats, shirts and jackets are decorated with branches and unit designations. The conflicts they fought in, whether or not they were POWs or how many tours they served. Most, in fact, are former soldiers of the Third World War in 2001. Most just call it the One Year War now. They wear these markings and badges with pride, nodding and smiling to us.  
我们行走间，退伍军人陆续经过。多数人看起来六十多岁或更年长，卷曲的头发灰白，皮肤逐渐紧缩包裹着骨骼。他们的帽子、衬衫和夹克上装饰着枝条和部队标识，记录着他们参与的冲突、是否曾是战俘或服役次数。实际上，大多数人都是 2001 年第三次世界大战的老兵，如今大多数人简称其为‘一年战争’。他们自豪地佩戴着这些徽章和标识，向我们点头微笑。

Everyone but my father, it seems, has something to identify them as a veteran.  
似乎除了我父亲，每个人都有某种标识证明他们是退伍军人。

He takes us through an unmarked oaken door that's chipped at the bottom and inside are at least a dozen others. Most have the same hard lines under their eyes and around their mouths. Some are far older and a handful are very young, like Yoshiya, a late returnee. He spots us right away, greeting my father with his ever enthusiastic grip on life.  
他带我们穿过一扇未标记的橡木门，门底已有些许剥落，门内至少还有十几个人。大多数人的眼睛下方和嘴角周围都有着同样的坚毅线条。有些人年纪更大，也有几个非常年轻，比如晚归者由纪也。他立刻发现了我们，热情洋溢地握住我父亲的手，活力四射。

He grins and clasps my hand. "Well look what the cat dragged in."  
他咧嘴一笑，紧握我的手。“看看是谁来了。”

"Mr. Yoshiya." We shake and, despite bracing my grip, my hand is again nearly crushed in his.  
“由纪也先生。”我们握手，尽管我已准备好握力，但手还是几乎被他捏碎。

He laughs. "Yoshiya is fine, bud. My little girl's been telling some stories about you." He holds the shake long enough for me to make a light tug away and shares a glance with my father. I get the sense of being silently talked about.  
他笑了。“约希亚就好，伙计。我家小丫头一直在讲你的故事呢。”他握着我的手摇了很久，直到我轻轻往回一扯，然后和我父亲交换了一个眼神。我感觉他们在我背后悄悄议论着什么。

"Ah..." “啊……”

"Still as talkative as ever." Finally, my poor hand is released and he claps me on the upper arm before turning his full attention to my father.  
“还是那么健谈。”终于，我那可怜的手被放开了，他拍了拍我的上臂，然后完全转向我父亲。

The others start to move in. They are, each of them, vessels for their profession. Confidant gaits, broad shoulders and lean muscles honed by their experiences. Truth be told, my father looks utterly out of place, yet they shake his hand and pat his shoulder and pull him into burly bear hugs with loud, hearty laughs. Here he is welcomed like a long lost brother. Like family.  
其他人开始围拢过来。他们每个人，都是各自职业的化身。自信的步伐，宽阔的肩膀和精瘦的肌肉，都是经历磨砺的结果。说实话，我父亲在这里显得格格不入，但他们还是握住他的手，拍拍他的肩膀，用响亮而热情的笑声将他拉入熊抱。在这里，他像一个久别重逢的兄弟一样受到欢迎。像家人一样。

Not all of them are members of the disbanded JSSDF, and I am told every week they get new members, some of which come and go, while others feel inclined to stay. Yoshiya says talk therapy isn't for everyone.  
并非所有人都是解散的日本自卫队的成员，我听说他们每周都有新成员加入，有些人来去匆匆，而另一些人则愿意留下。吉田说，谈话疗法并不适合每个人。

Mixed in with the younger men is a woman, an ex-Marine, who was deployed to the Philippines – where Kensuke had once sent us postcards of paradisal coasts. Her original home is in Laredo, Texas – right on the Mexican border. She smiles with big lips and, barely edging in a 5 feet, is feisty. Much to the gathered troop's amusement. Her Japanese is a little broken, but passable. I ask her why she's the only woman here, to which she explains she's only stopping in to visit, since men and women are generally kept to their own wards while at the hospital.  
在年轻男子中混杂着一位女性，她曾是海军陆战队员，被派往菲律宾——那里曾是健介寄给我们天堂般海岸明信片的地方。她的家乡在德克萨斯州的拉雷多，紧邻墨西哥边境。她微笑时嘴唇宽大，身高勉强达到五英尺，性格泼辣，让聚集的队伍感到有趣。她的日语有些生硬，但还算过得去。我问她为什么她是这里唯一的女性，她解释说，她只是顺道来访，因为在医院里，男女通常被分在不同的病房。

This dumbfounds me and she laughs.  
这让我愣住了，她笑了起来。

"PTSD is a little different for women than it is for men," she says. "It wouldn't make sense for us to be mixed in the same therapy groups. We process things differently."  
“创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）对女性的影响与男性有所不同，”她说，“把我们混在同一个治疗小组里并不合适。我们处理问题的方式不同。”

One vet, wearing a U.S. Navy cap that says 'Roof Rat', parts a crooked grin. "Well, that and she's a jarhead." He scrambles a finger by his head.  
一位戴着写着“屋顶鼠”的美国海军帽的老兵咧嘴一笑，“嗯，还有她是陆战队的。”他歪着头，用手指比划了一下。

"_Conyo_!" she fights to contain an open mouthed grin, nailing the vet with a sloppy back-handed whack to the ribs that leaves me breathless, but one that he takes in stride and with a big laugh. She says something else in Spanish and the others chuckle, and when she departs, the vibrancy in the troop melts away with her.  
“Conyo！”她努力抑制住张大嘴巴的笑容，用笨拙的反手一击打在兽医的肋骨上，让我屏息，但他却从容应对，放声大笑。她又用西班牙语说了些什么，其他人轻声笑了起来，而当她离开时，队伍中的活力也随之消散。

In a corner of the room are a few old and likely thrift store bought armchairs, where I take up a post, watching everyone begin to settle at the long table in the center nearest the windows. Despite the welcome, there is a lingering sense – that all present feel but none acknowledge – that I don't quite belong here. Not in the sense that I don't need therapy. I may, in slight, offhanded thoughts, be considering making a dedicated effort at the process, instead of walking out the minute I hear something I don't like.  
房间的一角摆放着几把旧的、很可能是二手店买来的扶手椅，我占据了一个位置，看着大家开始在靠近窗户的长桌中央落座。尽管受到欢迎，但仍有一种挥之不去的感觉——在场的人都感受到了，但无人承认——我不完全属于这里。并不是说我不需要治疗。我可能在不经意间想过，要努力投入这个过程，而不是一听到不喜欢的话就立刻离开。

No, there is a world these men have inhabited that I can't comprehend. I've gone through the standard army training and paramilitary courses, sure, but I'm not a soldier.  
不，这些男人所处的世界是我无法理解的。我确实经历了标准的军队训练和准军事课程，但我不是一名士兵。

"Were you in the army?" jerking, my hip whacks the backrest of an armchair, one of the veterans beside me now. He's decked in a faded green jacket of his own, which is frayed at the collar.  
"你当过兵吗？" 我猛地一惊，胯部撞上了扶手椅的靠背，旁边的一位老兵现在正看着我。他穿着一件自己磨得褪色的绿色夹克，领口已经磨损。

"Huh?" I look to my own jacket, where his eyes linger about, evasive of mine. "Oh, no, this belonged to my aunt," I say.  
"啊？" 我低头看向自己的夹克，他的目光在那里徘徊，避开了我的视线。"哦，不，这是属于我姑姑的，" 我说。

"Katsuragi..." he grunts, reading the worn name-tag, and becomes reserved. He scratches at his head, covered by a black bandana with white kanji that is too faded in places to read, though I would guess is an old unit motto. Stitched into his jacket is the name: _Nagato_. He is one of the younger ones, with a flat jaw to match his flat face.  
"Katsuragi..." 他咕哝着，读着磨损的名字标签，变得沉默寡言。他挠了挠头，头上戴着一条黑色头巾，上面有白色的汉字，但有些地方已经褪色到无法辨认，尽管我猜这可能是旧部队的座右铭。他的夹克上绣着名字：Nagato。他是比较年轻的一个，下巴平坦，脸也平平。

"So that must be your dad there, huh?"  
"那肯定是你爸在那儿吧，嗯？"

I offer him an even smile and hope something compels him to leave. "Yeah."  
我朝他露出一个平和的微笑，希望有什么能促使他离开。“是的。”

"I was there, you know," he says, still not quite able to make eye contact. I stand straighter.  
"你知道，我当时在场，"他说，仍然不太能直视我的眼睛。我站得更直了。

"What?" "什么？"

"Tokyo-three, I mean," he says, hand itching at an empty pocket inside his jacket. "Or, the GeoFront, whatever it was. I was there when those white Evas came down. Your mom fought em' all after," Nagato glances at my father, "after her cable was cut."  
"东京-三号，我是说，" 他边说边用手在夹克内袋摸索，那里空无一物。"或者，地底都市，随便它叫什么。那些白色 Eva 降临的时候，我就在那里。你妈妈在……" 长门瞥了一眼我父亲，"在她缆绳被切断后，与它们全部战斗。"

"White Evas?" I ask. I know there were more than the handful I've heard about, and that at some point they fought each other, but no one's ever given me a hard number.  
"白色 Eva？" 我问道。我知道不止我听说过的那几台，而且它们在某一刻互相战斗过，但从未有人给我一个确切的数字。

Nagato nods, slowly. "The Mass Produced ones. Unmanned. She tore 'em up like they were made of paper."  
长门缓缓点头。"量产型。无人操控。她把它们撕得像纸一样。"

"Then how did she lose?"  
"那她是怎么输的？"

"She ran out of power," he says, stifling a shrug and playing it off by rolling his shoulder. He stares at the others across the room. "Then they got back up."  
"她耗尽了力量，" 他说着，压抑住耸肩的动作，转而用肩膀的滚动来掩饰。他盯着房间另一头的其他人。"然后他们又站起来了。"

My heart is pounding in my ears. All those scars. "But... how?"  
我的心在耳边狂跳。那些伤痕。 "但是...怎么回事？"

"Don't know why. Don't know how. They just did. But she–"  
"不知为何。不知如何。他们就是那样。但她——"

Yoshiya clasps Nagato's shoulder, nearest me, his arm a guard rail between us. "She was doing what she was trained to do," he says, with his cheery disposition that, now more than before, appears artificial. Nagato, a slightly shorter man, bows his head a little. "Some of the guys in the Air Division still hold a grudge, but that is them, not us, right?" he holds Nagato there for a moment and at last the man's eyes dart to mine, flashing with a bit of resentment. Whether for me or Yoshiya I can't be certain.  
吉安紧紧抓住离我最近的永野的肩膀，他的手臂像一道护栏隔在我们之间。“她只是在执行她的训练任务，”他说道，带着他那现在比以往更显虚假的愉快态度。永野，一个略矮的男人，微微低头。“空军的一些人仍然心怀怨恨，但那是他们，不是我们，对吧？”他让永野在那里停留了一会儿，最终那人的目光闪烁着一丝怨恨，转向了我。我不知道这怨恨是针对我还是吉安。

He nods. "Right." 他点头。“对。”

Yoshiya's tight smile stretches and he steers his fellow vet back to the group. Ever a shepherd tending to his herd. Nagato, while distant, appears more comfortable when amidst them instead of apart.  
吉泽的紧绷微笑舒展开来，他引导着他的战友回到人群中。永远像一位牧羊人照料着他的羊群。长门虽然疏离，但在他们中间似乎比独自一人时更为自在。

How is it my father is more welcome with people who'd once been ordered to kill him on sight, than with people he'd saved by piloting the Eva? It makes me furious, beyond reason. A strange enough feeling that I am subdued for the next hour, maybe coming off as somber while the ex-Special Forces ease into the session. I'm surprised when none of them, especially my father, ask me to leave. It reminds me of a sermon. Yoshiya is the priest and this is his communion, evoking something precious and sacred. Everyone but my father speaks, save for an encouraging word or two when the others struggle for words.  
为何我的父亲在那些曾被命令一见他就杀的人中比在他用 Eva 救下的人中更受欢迎？这让我愤怒至极，无法理喻。这种奇怪的感觉让我在接下来的一个小时内都显得沉默寡言，或许看起来有些忧郁，而前特种部队成员们逐渐融入了这次聚会。令我惊讶的是，他们中没有一个人，尤其是我的父亲，要求我离开。这让我想起了布道。吉泽是牧师，这是他的圣餐，唤起了某种珍贵而神圣的东西。除了我的父亲，每个人都发言了，只是在其他人难以启齿时给予一两句鼓励。

They talk about some of their experiences, what they see the most, what comes up in their nightmares. One pulled corpses from a mass grave in Chongzuo. He and his platoon were in charge of counting and identifying the bodies. "Five-hundred and four," he says. "I still remember. It was five-hundred and four."  
他们谈论了一些自己的经历，最常看到的是什么，噩梦中出现的是什么。其中一人从崇左的大规模坟墓中拖出尸体。他和他的排负责清点和辨认尸体。“五百零四具，”他说，“我至今还记得。是五百零四具。”

Another saved a little girl from a burning building during the recapture of Medan. They both ended up in the hospital with terrible burns. He still has patches of discolored, bleach-white skin from the grafting. The girl died of her wounds in the bed next to his.  
另一位在夺回棉兰的战斗中救了一个小女孩，从燃烧的建筑物中逃生。两人都因严重烧伤而住进了医院。他至今还留有植皮后斑驳的漂白般白皙的皮肤。那女孩则在他隔壁的病床上因伤势过重而去世。

The point, I think, is to relive the trauma until it stops having a hold over them. The ex-JSSDF talk less about the Siege of Tokyo-3, or any stirring event in particular, and simply talk. About wives, jobs, and children. Simply being around people who can relate and who understand is a therapy in and of itself.  
我认为，关键在于反复经历这些创伤，直到它们不再对他们产生影响。前日本自卫队成员们谈及第三次东京攻防战或其他激动人心的事件时越来越少，他们更多地谈论妻子、工作和子女。仅仅是周围有能理解并感同身受的人，本身就是一种治疗。

I could have understood, couldn't I? If only my father had ever talked to me about it. I excuse myself and slip out the door, landing heavy in one of the seats out in the hall, where the air is chilled.  
我本可以理解的，不是吗？如果我父亲曾和我谈过这些。我借口离开，悄悄走出房门，沉重地坐在走廊里冰冷的椅子上。

No, I couldn't have been like Frau and simply offered company, or been like those other men in there and have accepted him and his traumas without question. I was just a child who couldn't comprehend, and we are both still a little bitter after all this time.  
不，我不可能像弗劳那样，只是提供陪伴，也不可能像里面的那些男人一样，无条件接受他和他的创伤。我只是个无法理解的孩子，而时至今日，我们俩都还有些怨气。

When the session is over and we are walking out into the parking lot, I offer again to drive, which he waves a hand at and grumbles. We merge onto I-10 for a second time. The mountains are faded in the clear, endless blue sky, and I have to squint to try and see the entrance to Fat Man's Pass as we leave Phoenix. The radio burbles and whispers as it did on the way here.  
当会谈结束，我们走出停车场时，我再次提出开车，他摆了摆手，咕哝着拒绝了。我们再次汇入 I-10 公路。群山在清澈无垠的蓝天中渐渐淡去，我眯起眼睛试图寻找巨人通道的入口，当我们离开凤凰城时。收音机像来时一样发出咕噜咕噜的低语。

I notice my father's grip twitches on the wheel, subtly jostling the car every so often, which hits with the force of roller coaster when going 80 miles an hour.  
我注意到父亲握着方向盘的手不时微微颤动，偶尔让车子轻轻晃动，这在以每小时 80 英里的速度行驶时，感觉就像过山车一样强烈。

"Dad?" I put a hand on his arm and he blinks rapidly. His breathing picks up. "Dad, maybe you should pull over for sec."  
“爸？”我把手放在他的手臂上，他快速眨眼。他的呼吸急促起来。“爸，也许你应该靠边停一会儿。”

He jerks again, trying very hard to focus on steering straight, even if he's actually somewhere miles and miles away. I grip his arm tight and he flinches. We turn hard. The seat-belt lock kicks in as I lurch forward, punching some of the air from my lungs and bruising into my shoulder. The stop throws me back into the seat. Dust rolls. Cars streak by.  
他再次猛地一震，努力集中精神保持直线行驶，尽管他的思绪实际上已飘到了千里之外。我紧紧抓住他的手臂，他畏缩了一下。我们急转弯。安全带锁住了，我向前一冲，肺里的空气被挤出，肩膀撞得生疼。停车把我甩回座位上。尘土飞扬。车辆疾驰而过。

"_Fuck_," I gasp, choking on ragged breaths. My father stares into his lap, hands still tight on the wheel. He's trembling. The vehicle shakes with the passing blur of traffic. For a while we just sit there, and my body is able to come back down to a normal tempo, nerves alert for danger. Today was a bad day to start weening off the anxiety meds. My father relaxes, but otherwise doesn't move.  
“该死，”我喘息着，艰难地呼吸。父亲盯着他的大腿，双手仍紧握方向盘。他在颤抖。车辆随着过往的车流摇晃。我们静静地坐了一会儿，我的身体逐渐恢复正常的节奏，神经紧绷，警惕着危险。今天开始减少抗焦虑药物可不是个好日子。父亲放松了些，但除此之外没有动。

"Why, uh... why don't I drive, huh?" I ask.  
“呃，为什么不由我来开车呢？”我问道。

He nods, but doesn't speak. We switch spots and he tries in vain to hide his embarrassment. There are comforting words or phrases for this, I think. Whatever they are, I don't have them, and it's infuriating.  
他点点头，但没有说话。我们交换了位置，他试图掩饰自己的尴尬。我想，应该有些安慰的话语或短语可以用。但无论是什么，我都没有，这让我感到无比沮丧。

We drive down to where Tucson and _Chīsai_ become an indistinguishable mass of civilization, on the northern edge of the city closer to the Foothills. We both decide, in a form of communication comprised of half finished sentences and then an unspoken agreement, to pay a certain someone a visit before returning to Catalina.  
我们驱车前往图森和奇赛逐渐融合成一片难以分辨的文明地带，位于城市北部靠近山麓的地方。我们通过一种由未完的句子构成的交流方式，然后达成了一种默契，决定在返回卡塔利娜之前拜访某个人。

Tucked down an alleyway amid a sea of neon banners is Misato's bar: _Unryū._ Cloud Dragon. The alley is larger and cleaner than I remember, the windows and doors tagged with far less color bleeding spatters of spray paint. The beads hanging over the entryway are emerald and teal instead of the kanji-singed sandalwood I remember, a black dragon standing guard on drapes of white. It's quiet for the time of day, save for a smattering of office workers from the skyscraper a block over sneaking drinks during their lunch breaks. They sit at the red cushioned alcoves thinly shielded with strands of linked metal discs, a haze of smoke making the low-light lanterns glow, as though we are walking through a memory: nights spent here busing tables for Misato instead of going home, washing dishes in the back or kicking my feet at the bar; a squared ring set in the middle and flanked by four posts at its edges where the ceiling is lower.  
隐藏在霓虹灯海中的一条小巷里，便是美里的小酒馆：云龙。这条巷子比我记忆中的更宽敞、更干净，窗户和门上喷漆的斑驳色彩也少了许多。入口处的珠帘不再是记忆中刻着汉字的檀香木色，而是翡翠绿与青色相间，一条黑龙守护在白色的帘幕上。这个时段本该热闹非凡，但除了隔着一条街的摩天大楼里偷偷溜出来喝午餐饮料的上班族外，这里异常宁静。他们坐在红色软垫的隔间里，隔间仅以一串串金属圆片串联的帘子轻掩，烟雾缭绕中，低照度的灯笼发出柔和的光，仿佛我们正穿梭于一段记忆之中：那些夜晚，我在这里为美里端盘子，而不是回家，在后厨洗碗或在吧台边踢着脚；中间有一个方形的舞台，四周由四根柱子支撑，天花板在这里略显低矮。

Behind the bar my Aunt drones a greeting, not looking up from her phone, cigarette bud pinched in the same fingers. When her bored eyes come up to see her fresh custom, they light up and she smiles. As we sit she reaches across the bar to grab my face and slaps a kiss on my cheek, laughing.  
吧台后，我姨妈机械地打着招呼，眼睛没离开手机，烟蒂夹在同一根手指间。当她那无聊的目光抬起，看到新来的顾客时，眼睛一亮，笑了。我们坐下时，她伸手越过吧台，抓住我的脸，在我脸颊上亲了一口，笑了起来。

Then she pushes me, still playful. "Took you long enough to come see me."  
然后她依然调皮地推了我一下，"你来得也太晚了。"

"The old man's a handful," I say, jabbing a thumb at dad. Something artificial creeps into my bones and stiffens my face. I pretend there is not a tightrope beneath us.  
“那老头儿可不好对付，”我说着，用拇指指了指爸爸。某种做作的感觉悄悄爬上我的骨头，让我的脸僵硬起来。我假装我们脚下没有一条绷紧的绳索。

Misato pretends along with me. "Oh, I believe it."  
美里也跟着我一起假装。“哦，我相信了。”

Dad's shoulders sag and he taps a cheek. "No kiss for me then?"  
爸爸的肩膀垂了下来，他轻拍着脸颊。“那我就不亲了？”

She swats at the air. "I see you all the time, what about you?"  
她挥手驱赶着空气。“我经常见到你，你呢？”

It's good to see that my father hasn't forgotten the act either. The sentiment, I can sense, is at least genuine and while Misato pours us drinks and leans forward on the bar, smoking, we are allowed to carry on like we have always been this way. Dad and I can set aside his panic attack in the car, tuck it away in a box upstairs and deal with it when the time comes, as we have a tendency to do.  
很高兴看到我父亲也没有忘记这一套。我能感觉到，至少这份情感是真挚的。当美里为我们倒酒并倚靠在吧台上抽烟时，我们被允许继续这样，仿佛我们一直如此。爸爸和我可以把他在车里的恐慌发作暂时搁置，把它收进楼上的盒子里，等到时候再处理，就像我们习惯做的那样。

I'm glad that for once I was there to help him do at least that much.  
我很高兴这次至少我在场，能帮他做到这一点。

"A little early in the day for a drink, isn't it?" I ask, taking the glass of cherry-oak liquor anyway, tipped in at only half an inch. I give it a sniff too, just to be sure she hasn't given me whiskey as a joke.  
“这么早喝酒，是不是有点不合适？”我问道，还是接过了那杯只有半英寸深的樱桃橡木酒。我还闻了闻，只是为了确认她没有开玩笑给我倒威士忌。

"Never," she says, with a grin so big I could mistake it for barring her teeth. My hand stops when my father grabs his glass and downs it in one gulp. He sets it down firmly on the bar and Misato refills it just so, while I take a bashful sip from my own.  
“从不，”她笑着说，那笑容大得我差点以为她在龇牙咧嘴。我父亲一把抓住酒杯，一饮而尽，然后重重地将杯子放在吧台上。Misato 恰到好处地为他续杯，而我则羞涩地抿了一口自己的酒。

_Unryū's_ handful of bartenders and waitresses start shuffling in for their shifts. One of them is a thin, gangly man who speaks the same choked and drawling Japanese I grew up around but was never encouraged to mimic. His hair is silver and might have even been black once if the more mottled shades of gray are anything to go by. Misato nudges her chin at him and touches the back of her hand to his shoulder in familiar greeting. He hums, looking tired like Pip back in D.C., but not in a way that makes me think part of his soul is being sapped away at day by day. Other things have worn at him, sure, but he just doesn't appear to care much either way. I watch him light a cigarette with one hand and tie an apron with the other as he moseys behind the bartop.  
Unryū的几名调酒师和服务员开始陆续来上班。其中有一个瘦高个儿的男人，他说话时那种沙哑拖沓的日语口音，和我从小到大听惯的相似，但从未被鼓励模仿。他的头发是银色的，如果那些斑驳的灰色能说明什么的话，或许曾经是黑色的。Misato 用下巴示意他，并亲切地用手背碰了碰他的肩膀。他哼了一声，看起来像 D.C.的 Pip 一样疲惫，但并不让我觉得他的灵魂正一天天被抽走。当然，有些事情确实磨砺了他，但他似乎并不太在意。我看着他用一只手点燃香烟，另一只手系上围裙，悠闲地走到吧台后面。

Misato changes her dialect when she speaks to him. "No smoking at the bar, Aoba."  
Misato 跟他说话时换了方言。“Aoba，吧台禁止吸烟。”

"Sure, Major," he grumbles, not unkindly, and takes a hard drag from his bud before stuffing it out in the nearby ashtray. He nods, almost absently, to my father. "Shinji," he says, tired eyes settling on me. "This your boy?"  
"当然，少校，" 他咕哝道，语气并不刻薄，从烟蒂上深深吸了一口，然后将其掐灭在附近的烟灰缸里。他点点头，几乎是心不在焉地，向我父亲示意。"真嗣，" 他说，疲惫的眼睛落在我身上。"这是你的儿子吗？"

"Kazuya," I answer. Aoba doesn't offer a hand to shake, or make anything of my standoffish tone.  
"和也，" 我回答。青叶没有伸出手来握手，也没有对我的冷淡语气做出任何反应。

"Makes me feel fucking old," he says, a smile in his eyes, and ambles away while shaking his head.  
"这让我感觉自己老得要命，" 他说，眼中带着笑意，一边摇头一边慢悠悠地走开了。

"Shigeru," my father explains. "Used to be one of the techs in the Command Center."  
"茂," 我父亲解释道。"曾经是指挥中心的技师之一。"

He must have started here sometime in the past eight years, since most of the people I remember have moved on elsewhere, replaced now by unfamiliar faces. One of the few left from my youth is Kirisaki, a brittle woman who's slang-riddled shouting echoes out of the kitchen.  
他一定是在过去八年中某段时间来到这里的，因为我记得的大多数人都已经离开去了别处，现在被不熟悉的面孔所取代。我年轻时留下的少数人之一是桐崎，一个说话带刺的女人，她的喊叫声在厨房里回荡。

Later, Aoba takes off his apron and tunes a sleek sienna guitar in the corner, frame worn and chipped. A hand throwing back his long, tangled hair, he plucks at the chords, finding his way into a light melody that scratches softly at the edges. The dusky song blankets an already dreamlike bar, setting the afternoon regulars in a subdued hush.  
后来，青叶脱下围裙，在角落里调试着一把光滑的赭色吉他，框架磨损且有缺口。他一手捋回自己凌乱的长发，弹拨着和弦，渐渐融入一段轻盈的旋律，轻柔地划过边缘。这昏暗的曲调覆盖了本就梦幻般的酒吧，让下午的常客们陷入一片沉静。

My father excuses himself, leaving me and Misato to sit and listen while she takes yet another one of her infrequent breaks, sparing only a moment to rinse a pilsner glass. Across the way, by the kitchen, is a small little bamboo tree hooked with paper charms, the smell of fried foods wafting by. Even if I've never had a good understanding of the culture, Misato's bar has always seemed to ache for another place, settling for a shallow representation of it instead. Like the old festivals.  
父亲告退，留下我和美里坐下聆听，她又抽空去洗了个皮尔森啤酒杯，这不过是她难得的休息时光中的一瞬。对面厨房旁，挂着纸符的小竹树旁，油炸食物的香气飘来。尽管我对这种文化从未真正理解，美里的酒吧却总像在渴望另一个地方，只能满足于浅显的模仿。就像那些古老的节日。

"Hey... have you ever thought about going back to Japan?"  
“嘿……你有没有想过回日本？”

Misato takes a moment to consider as she fills the glass from the tap, setting it down on the table to my left, a half inch of foam sitting comfortably at the top. Turning back, she shrugs. "Sometimes... but I probably won't ever go. When I was a kid, we moved around a lot because of my father's work. I had a lot of homes that never really felt like it. Japan's changed. There's really no point in going now."  
美里从水龙头接满一杯，放在我左边的桌上，半英寸的泡沫恰到好处地浮在顶部。她转过身，耸了耸肩。“有时候会想……但我大概永远不会回去。小时候因为父亲的工作，我们经常搬家。我有过很多住处，但从未真正有家的感觉。日本变了。现在回去真的没什么意义。”

"So you won't ever go? Not even just to see it?"  
"所以你永远不会去吗？哪怕只是去看看？"

"Maybe someday. Before I die." She snaps her fingers, expression changing from melancholic to chipper in an instant. "I know – I'll set up a shrine in Hokkaido! Send my ashes there when I kick the bucket, alright?"  
"也许有一天吧。在我死之前。" 她弹了下手指，表情从忧郁瞬间转为开朗。"我知道了——我会在北海道建个神社！等我去世后，把我的骨灰送到那里，好吗？"

A laugh. "Sure." 一阵笑声。"当然。"

An idea seeds there, the thought of seeing a home that never belonged to me. For the last five years, Hachiro has been pestering me about coming out to visit him and the boys. Says he has a kid now. A little girl who's going to be turning three in January.  
一个念头在那里萌芽，想象着去看一个从未属于我的家。过去五年里，八郎一直缠着我，让我去拜访他和那些男孩们。他说他现在有个孩子了，是个小女孩，一月份就要满三岁了。

It would be nice to see them again, him and Katsuo. All of them, really. Would be a good excuse to finally go visit Hiro's grave, too.  
再次见到他们会很美好，他和胜夫。所有人，真的。这也是个好借口，终于可以去看看弘的墓了。

"I'm sorry," I say, finishing off my second glass. In one sense to Hiro, in a more immediate way, to Misato.  
“对不起，”我说，喝完了第二杯酒。一方面是对弘，更直接地，是对美里。

She flicks her hair back. "Hm?"  
她轻甩头发，“嗯？”

Her silky locks are free tonight, no care given to a braid or even a lazy tie up. The low lighting is easier on her edged features, hardened by years of warfare and struggle, though her chin is still rounded just so, skin tight but succumbing to deep wrinkles. I imagine it is why she haunts here so often, surrounded by her drowning drink and soft shadows.  
今晚她的秀发如丝般柔滑，未束成辫子，甚至连随意的扎起都未曾顾及。昏暗的灯光对她棱角分明的面容更为柔和，那是多年征战与挣扎留下的痕迹，尽管她的下巴依旧圆润，肌肤紧致却难掩深深的皱纹。我想这便是她为何常流连于此，被沉溺的饮品与柔和的阴影所环绕。

Finally, she gives me a crooked, but patient look.  
终于，她给了我一个歪斜却耐心的眼神。

"For not staying in touch," I say.  
“因为没保持联系。”我说。

An upward quirk touches the corner of her lips, pale pink. Fingers toy with the treated wood of the bartop. "Does that make you feel better about it?" Her tone is borderline playful, just as I am used to and probably more fond of than I can stand.  
她嘴角微微上扬，粉唇苍白。手指摆弄着吧台上经过处理的木头。“这么说会让你感觉好些吗？”她的语气近乎戏谑，一如往常，或许我比自己能承受的还要喜欢。

A chuckle starts in my chest but doesn't make it out beyond a puff of air. I take my glass and shake it. "A little bit."  
我胸中涌起一阵轻笑，却只化作了一声轻叹。我拿起酒杯摇了摇。“稍微好一点。”

Misato obliges, touching the neck of a fat bottle to the rim, twisting it expertly as she pulls away. Not a drop spilled. She steps to the side as I, thinking of my father's bold start, throw the drink back – and spew burning whiskey across the bar. My Aunt cackles in the corner as I sputter.  
美里顺从地照做，将一个胖瓶子的瓶颈轻触杯沿，熟练地旋转着拉开。一滴未洒。她侧身让开，我回想起父亲的大胆开场，猛地将酒一饮而尽——随即喷出一道燃烧的威士忌，洒满了吧台。我的阿姨在角落里咯咯笑个不停，我则呛得直咳嗽。

"Consider us even," she says.  
“就算我们扯平了，”她说道。

Despite the fire numbing in my nose and the distraught gurgling in my stomach, I can't help but laugh between fits of coughing. I missed this place.  
尽管烈火在鼻腔中麻木，胃里翻江倒海，我还是忍不住在咳嗽间歇笑出声来。我怀念这个地方。

My father returns and we both decide it's time to go back home before mom starts blowing up our phones wondering where we are.  
父亲回来了，我们俩都觉得是时候回家了，不然妈妈就要开始疯狂打电话问我们在哪儿了。

"Come by later tonight," Misato says as we walk out. "And bring your ma'! It's Sports Pool night!"  
“今晚过来吧，”我们出门时美里说道，“带上你妈妈！今晚是运动池之夜！”

Mother has just gotten back by the time we pull into the driveway, and is sure to be exhausted. So I'm surprised when she's all at once very giddy at the idea of a night out, overflowing with an enthusiasm I can't recall beyond the age of six. We do not tell her about the incident in the car.  
我们到家时，母亲刚回来，肯定已经筋疲力尽。所以当她突然对晚上出去玩这件事异常兴奋，洋溢着一种我六岁以后就再也没见过的热情时，我感到很惊讶。我们没有告诉她车上的那场意外。

As the sky darkens, mother changes and touches up a bit of makeup, though she's never been one to wear very much in the first place. She is dressed in a black skirt and white blouse, a choker snug around her neck. It makes her look years younger.  
随着天空渐渐暗淡，母亲换上衣服并稍稍补了点妆，尽管她原本就不常浓妆艳抹。她身着黑色裙子和白色衬衫，颈间紧扣着一条项圈，这让她看起来年轻了许多。

Father wears slacks and one of his cuffed dress shirts, throwing on a deep red tie as well. Mother says something to him in German as she fixes his shirt and touches his hair, the only word of which I catch is _Schatzi_, hooked to the end as if staking a claim.  
父亲穿着休闲裤和一件卷起袖子的正装衬衫，还随手系上了一条深红色的领带。母亲用德语对他说了些什么，同时整理他的衬衫并轻抚他的头发，我只听清了结尾的“Schatzi”，仿佛在宣示所有权。

He pauses and, with some effort, says, "_Danke, liebling_."  
他停顿了一下，费了些劲儿说道：“Danke, liebling。”

For me, khakis and an ocean blue dress shirt will do, the sleeves rolled up because I can't stand to feel like I'm back at work.  
对我来说，一条卡其裤和一件海蓝色的衬衫就够了，袖子卷起来，因为我受不了感觉像回到了工作岗位。

"_So scharf_," Mother coos, playing with the corners of my shoulders, pleased. These words I remember, from when she used to dress me up for events and special occasions. "Look at that," she'd say, ruffling my hair and attacking my cheek with a kiss. "My little monster turned into a man. _So scharf_."  
“真帅气，”母亲轻声细语，摆弄着我肩膀的边缘，显得很满意。这些词我记得，她过去常在为我打扮参加活动和特殊场合时这么说。“看你这模样，”她会揉乱我的头发，亲吻我的脸颊，“我的小怪物长成男子汉了。真帅气。”

We drive down into the city again, taken in by the clustered buildings set with bright, artificial light where we can no longer see the stars or the sliver of red out by the moon. Mother drives and the two of them seem more at ease, despite us being out in public, where once we had to worry something might set off an episode. They seem to share more in this moment. A feeling of nostalgia, maybe – of comfort.  
我们再次驱车进入城市，被密集的建筑和明亮的人工灯光所吸引，再也看不到星星或月亮旁的那一抹红色。母亲开车，他们俩似乎更放松了，尽管我们在公共场合，曾经担心某些事情可能引发状况。此刻，他们似乎分享了更多。或许是怀旧之情，也许是舒适感。

Mother is upbeat and talks the whole way. As we step out of the car, I can't hold in a growing warmth and chuckle, nudging my chin at her. "What are you so happy about?"  
母亲一路上兴高采烈，喋喋不休。当我们下车时，我忍不住心中的暖意和笑意，用下巴轻轻碰了碰她，问道：“什么事这么开心？”

She beams, coming between me and my father and hooking an arm through each of ours. _My men_. Her smile says. Down the sidewalk, tucked between the amber street lamps and a peculiar red-faced heat, she is practically aglow.  
她笑容满面，走到我和父亲中间，分别挽起我们的手臂。她的笑容仿佛在说：“我的男人们。”在人行道上，被琥珀色的街灯和一张红扑扑的怪脸夹在中间，她几乎在发光。

_January 2, 2033 2033 年 1 月 2 日_

_Kazuya flinched away from me this morning before I took him to school. Asuka says I slipped again last week, screamed at him for something and banged on his door when he shut himself in. I don't remember doing that. For two days she kept her distance outside of mentioning bills and house duties, and I didn't leave our room save to eat, watching the escalating firefights between militants in Ankara and wondering if Misato is out there somewhere. Other than that, I don't recall much of last week at all.  
今早送和也去学校之前，他避开我了。明日香说我上周又失控了，因为某件事对他大吼大叫，还在他把自己关在房间里时猛敲他的门。我不记得有这回事。接下来的两天里，除了提及账单和家务事，她都与我保持距离，而我除了吃饭几乎没离开过我们的房间，看着安卡拉不断升级的武装冲突，心里想着美里是否也在那里的某个地方。除此之外，我对上周的记忆几乎一片空白。_

_When I speak to him now, he is apprehensive, and won't come very close to me unless his mother is in the room too. She has to prompt him to give me a hug before I leave for work now.  
现在我和他说话时，他显得很紧张，除非他妈妈也在场，否则他不会靠我太近。现在我上班前，他妈妈得提醒他给我一个拥抱。_

_The flashbacks are getting worse.  
闪回的记忆越来越严重了。_

_Driving to work is becoming a chore. It's like – it's like trying to steer while falling asleep at the wheel. Sometimes I just park a mile away at the gas station and walk the rest of the way. If I keep my head down and don't look up at the buildings, that usually calms me enough to withstand another of Mr. Alleyne's tirades about the Japanese's poor work ethic once I get there. Even at home I feel it in my shoulders, pulling on my nerves. Like I'm on the edge of snapping. Asuka will ask me about the mortgage, or bring up Kazuya's school or just – just talk to me and I lose it. I think it might be these new pills. They're not working right, and I know Asuka is just waiting for the opportunity to get on my case about them. She's only biding her time for Kazuya's sake.  
开车去上班变得越来越烦人。就像——就像在方向盘上打瞌睡时试图控制方向一样。有时我干脆把车停在加油站一英里外，然后步行过去。如果我低下头，不去看那些建筑物，通常能让我平静下来，足以忍受阿尔莱恩先生关于日本人工作态度不佳的又一次咆哮。即使在家，我也能感觉到肩膀上的紧张，牵动着我的神经。就像我快要崩溃了。明日香会问我关于抵押贷款的事，或者提起和也的学校，或者只是——只是和我说话，我就失控了。我想可能是这些新药的问题。它们不起作用，我知道明日香只是在等待机会来指责我。她只是在为和也的缘故而等待时机。_

_He's just a boy, afterall.  
他毕竟只是个孩子。_

_Maybe it's better if he stays away from me.  
也许他离我远点会更好。_

### Chapter 17: December 24

My father didn't wear a uniform. He didn't have a helmet or dog tags and he's never held a rifle in his life. He hasn't marched through jungles or desert valleys, wondering if the next IED is meant for him. Hasn't watched bullets make chunks of meat out of a company of friends. His war was different, but just as visceral as all of the conflicts before it. When he finally made his way out, when he was able to stick his head up above the water and breathe, everyone waved off the sacrifices he had to make and the wounds he had to endure. They told him he was useless for fighting in such a thoughtless war against the Angels. I was one of them.  
我父亲从未穿过军装，没有戴过头盔或军牌，一生中从未握过步枪。他没有穿越过丛林或沙漠峡谷，不知道下一个 IED 是否是冲着他来的。没有目睹过子弹将一队朋友变成血肉模糊的碎片。他的战争不同，但同样激烈，如同之前的所有冲突。当他终于得以喘息，探出水面呼吸时，所有人都对他的牺牲和承受的创伤视而不见。他们说他在这场无意义的战争中对抗天使是毫无用处的。我曾是他们中的一员。

Upstairs on my work table, sitting right next to the pills, is the death directive he gave me over a week ago. The envelope is still crinkled a bit, otherwise untouched. I've thought of "losing" it, just getting rid of the thing or telling him I want nothing to do with it. He's been in his room in the evenings, but with the door open, fingers working diligently at his computer.  
楼上我的工作台上，就在药丸旁边，放着他一周前给我的死亡指令。信封仍有些皱，其他部分则未曾触碰。我曾想过“丢失”它，干脆扔掉或告诉他我与此无关。他晚上一直在房间里，门开着，手指在电脑上勤奋地工作。

"How much more do you have to go?" I ask from the doorway.  
“你还要做多少？”我在门口问道。

"Maybe ten pages or so," he says, an over the shoulder glance inviting me in.  
"大概十页左右吧，" 他说着，回头一瞥，邀请我进入。

His little corner isn't the same as it used to be. Not just because the photos are gone or because it's been painted the same sunshine yellow I grew up with. His space is uncluttered, set with purpose. A place he can be comfortable and drift instead of drown.  
他的小角落已不复从前。不仅仅是因为照片消失了，或是被涂成了我童年记忆中的阳光黄。他的空间井然有序，布置得别有用心。一个他可以舒适自在、漂浮而非沉溺的地方。

"So when do I get to read it?"  
"那我什么时候能读到它呢？"

A tenderness eases over his eyes. He stands, clasping my shoulder. "Someday."  
他的眼中流露出温柔。他站起身，紧握我的肩膀。“总有一天。”

There's still so much he isn't ready to dredge up again. I think I can understand, at least a little. I think of all that I know now, how much of it I have yet to know, and it amazes me he was ever able to sit down and put it all to paper. That he was ever able to come back from any of it. I want to help put a close to that chapter of his life, and maybe let him have a few years of peace before he goes. First, there's something I need to see.  
他仍有许多未准备好再次面对的往事。我想我能理解，至少一部分。想到我现在所知的一切，还有多少未知等待我去了解，不禁惊叹他曾如何坐下来将这一切付诸笔端。他是如何从那些经历中走出来的。我希望能帮他结束那段人生篇章，或许让他能在离开前享受几年安宁。但首先，有件事我必须去看看。

My last therapist asked why I wanted to know about the war. I always thought it would let me know my parents and grasp some sense of who I thought they must have been. That can't ever really happen. For that, I have to go where it all unfolded. If I want to catch a glimpse of those people my parents used to be, I have to go where the war was.  
我最后一位心理治疗师曾问我为何想了解那场战争。我一直以为这能让我了解父母，抓住一些对他们曾经模样的感知。但这永远无法真正实现。为此，我必须去往一切展开的地方。如果我想一窥父母曾经的样子，我必须去往战争发生的地方。

I have to see it.  
我必须亲眼看看。

The sky melds from dawn to dusk, slow and touched with an ease I'm not used to. Somehow the shadows along the mountains are foreboding as I debate over and over how to go about this. Dad's entangled mom in a game of _Go_ at the kitchen table. She hates board games. The only one I've ever seen her play is scrabble. She likes putting a puzzle together with limited pieces. That and she likes to cheat with the rule that German words count too.  
天空从黎明渐入黄昏，缓慢而带着我不习惯的从容。不知为何，山脉间的阴影在我反复思索如何进行此事时显得不祥。爸爸在厨房桌子上与妈妈下围棋，她讨厌棋盘游戏。我唯一见她玩过的就是拼字游戏。她喜欢用有限的字母拼出单词。除此之外，她还喜欢利用规则漏洞，允许使用德语单词。

Dad is playing as black, snapping pieces down quickly and decisively, while mom agonizes over each white piece she commits to the grand strategy.  
爸爸执黑棋，迅速而果断地落子，而妈妈则对每一步白棋的投入都犹豫不决，深陷于这场宏大战略的思考中。

Standing in front of my parents in the glare of the back windows – where I start to bake – the words burn and the reasoning I'd planned on sharing out loud, to make sense of it, turns into a lot of useless thinking.  
站在父母面前，被后窗的强光照射着——我开始感到炙热——那些话语如同火焰般灼烧，我原本打算大声分享的推理，试图理清一切，却变成了一大堆无用的思考。

"I'm going to Tokyo-3," I say and both of them stop talking about, what was it? the lifespan of cats? "I mean, Hakone, the crater..."  
“我要去东京-3，”我说道，他们关于猫的寿命的讨论戛然而止。“我是说，箱根，那个火山口……”

Neither of them says a word, at first. With the temperature inside and the fireplace going, I'm starting to sweat. It would be nice if I could actually blame the heat. I start to itch for pills I spent a back and forth with half an hour before.  
他们起初都没有说话。屋内的温度和壁炉的火光让我开始出汗。如果能把这一切归咎于炎热该多好。我开始渴望那些半小时前还在犹豫是否服用的药丸。

"What for?" mother asks, incredulous. "It's just a big hole in the ground," she says, in a way that suggests it's much more than just a big hole in the ground. It has to be. I haven't been able to stop thinking about how Yoshiya put himself between me and Nagato. Before he could finish talking about that last battle. What didn't he want me to hear?  
"为什么？" 母亲难以置信地问。"那不过是个大坑罢了，" 她说，语气中暗示着这远不止是个大坑。必须如此。我无法停止思考，吉泽是如何挡在我和长门之间的。在他还没来得及讲完那场最后的战斗之前。他不想让我听到什么？

"Do you... not want me to go?" I ask.  
"你...不想让我去吗？" 我问道。

"I don't see why that matters," she says, expression dancing between cloudy and scathing. "You're going regardless, aren't you?"  
"我不明白这有什么关系，" 她说，表情在阴沉和尖刻之间变换。"你无论如何都会去的，不是吗？"

"Maybe." I don't tell her I've already bought the ticket.  
“或许吧。”我没告诉她我已经买好了票。

She hums, tosses some of her hair back and focuses instead on the game. "If you'd like to see an empty crater in the middle of nowhere, that's your choice."  
她哼了一声，甩了甩头发，转而专注于游戏。“如果你想看一片荒芜之地的空洞，那是你的选择。”

I look to my father, who has also been reabsorbed in the game, chin pinched between his thumb and index. Considering the board and his pieces, he sets a black stone down between hers.  
我看向父亲，他也重新沉浸在游戏中，下巴夹在拇指和食指之间。他考虑着棋盘和棋子，将一枚黑子放在她的棋子之间。

"_Scheisse_!" "该死！"

Dad wipes a hand over his mouth, trying to hide his mirth. She fumes, in a way we can't help but laugh at and, feeling cornered, she pouts and starts to play the game by herself.  
爸爸用手抹了抹嘴，试图掩饰他的笑意。她气鼓鼓的样子让我们忍不住笑出声来，感到被逼到墙角的她噘起嘴，开始自己玩起了游戏。

"I don't like either of you," she grumbles. As much as she jokes, it's another of her many facades, put up to hide her melancholy.  
"我谁也不喜欢，"她咕哝着。尽管她是在开玩笑，但这只是她众多伪装之一，用来掩盖她的忧郁。

Standing, Dad steers me outside and Myshka pads atop the table to console his adoptive mother. The watermelon vines are looking healthier today. I nudge some of the shriveling bits with a foot.  
站着，爸爸带我走到外面，Myshka 则跳上桌子安慰他的养母。今天的西瓜藤看起来更健康了。我用脚轻轻推了推一些枯萎的部分。

"There's something I want you to see in Hokkaido," dad says, a hand on my back as we walk.  
“在北海道有样东西我想让你看看，”爸爸说着，手搭在我的背上，我们一同走着。

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"They found it just off the shoreline. A part of your mother's Eva."  
“他们在海岸线附近找到了它。是你母亲的那台 Eva 的一部分。”

Even now the word sends shivers down my spine. Sure, I've seen pictures, heard some stories, but this is going to be real. A part of my mother I've never seen in person before. The part of her only he knows.  
即便此刻，这个词仍让我脊背发凉。当然，我看过图片，听过一些故事，但这次将是真实的。这是我从未亲眼见过的母亲的一部分。那个只有他才知道的部分。

I'm finally going to see the Eva.  
我终于要见到 Eva 了。

"Why don't you come with me dad? We can see it together."  
“爸爸，你为什么不跟我一起去呢？我们可以一起看。”

He takes his hand away, resting it in a pocket. The thought stirs a chord in him. Until he shakes his head. "No, I... no. I don't want to see it again." He jabs my chest. "I want _you_ to see it."  
他把手抽回，插进口袋里。这个念头在他心中激起了一阵涟漪。直到他摇了摇头。“不，我……不。我不想再看到它。”他戳了戳我的胸口。“我要你去看。”

He's just as uncertain about the trip as mom. They've tried for so long to move past it. To be more than throw away toy soldiers. I don't want us to be defined by the war anymore.  
他对这次旅行同样犹豫不决，就像妈妈一样。他们尝试了很久，想要超越过去，不再只是被抛弃的玩具士兵。我不想我们再被战争所定义。

"Okay, dad. I will." “好的，爸爸。我会的。”

The first time I ever saw Japan was sitting in Mr Ryan's second period history class, through grainy film dried of color. It showed us a country in its prime, preparing to go to war. I saw the cherry blossom trees floating at the edges of the old Sengoku castles, while soldiers paraded through the temple districts in traditional Samurai garb. Women and children in Osaka danced for the Tenjin Matsuri, long before it had been taken under water. Back when Japan had bowed to an Emperor.  
我第一次见到日本，是在瑞安先生第二节历史课上，透过褪色的模糊胶片。它向我们展示了一个处于鼎盛时期、准备开战的国家。我看到樱花树在古老的战国城堡边缘飘落，士兵们身着传统武士装束在寺庙区列队行进。大阪的妇女和儿童在淀川河祭之前翩翩起舞，那时的日本还向天皇鞠躬。

Since then, I've had this vision of what Japan is supposed to be. Even after the Great Defeat, it was a nation that clutched doggedly to its culture and ideals. I can't remember wanting anything more than that. To have a place and a people that belonged to me.  
从那时起，我就有了对日本应有的样子的想象。即使在战败之后，它也是一个紧紧抓住其文化和理想不放的国家。我记不清还有什么比这更渴望的了。拥有一个属于我的地方和人民。

Even that image was soured by the war which, through my father, showed me some horrible, dark place that would inevitably leave me broken. So I have this notion. This absurd idea that if I go to the islands, I can take a piece of my father back with me – and maybe make us both a little more whole.  
即便是那幅景象，也被战争所玷污，通过我的父亲，向我展示了一个可怕的、黑暗的地方，它注定会让我支离破碎。所以我有了这个念头。这个荒谬的想法，如果我去了那些岛屿，我就能带回一部分我的父亲——也许能让我们俩都更完整一些。

The plane tilts, light gees pushing me into the cushioned seat. As we pass over the southern tip of Hokkaido, I can see Old Hakodate through the window far below, a lone star fort amidst a half sea-swallowed city standing in memoriam. The new capital, Obihiro, cuts a crescent arc in the island. Even as high up as we are, I can clearly make out the rigid order of skyscrapers, comparable in size only to those in Chicago-2. Each one a province all its own.  
飞机倾斜，轻柔的 G 力将我推向柔软的座椅。当我们飞越北海道南端时，透过窗户可以远远望见下方的旧函馆，一座孤星堡垒矗立在半被海水吞噬的城市中，仿佛在纪念着什么。新首都带广在岛上划出一道新月形的弧线。即便在高空中，我也能清晰地辨认出那些摩天大楼的严整秩序，其规模堪比芝加哥-2 的那些建筑，每一座都自成一省。

The northern island itself has turned white, snow spreading over the mainland and all along the coast facing the Sea of Japan, far down by Kyushu. The mountains, reaching in jagged arcs throughout, stop the ice from pooling its decaying touch to the lush green on the other side.  
北方的岛屿已是一片雪白，雪覆盖了整个大陆，沿着面向日本海的海岸线一直延伸到九州。山脉以锯齿状的弧线贯穿其中，阻止了冰霜将腐朽的触手伸向另一侧郁郁葱葱的绿色。

As we land, the sheer size and scope of the city becomes daunting. Metal mountains as likely to take me under as any stone peak in Arizona. The smell hits me first. A salted stink, mingled with the sting of sanitizer and the occasional whiff of oil. The airport is bustling, but not overflowing. Customs still takes an hour. The man at the bulletproof glass window stamps my passport and mutters, "welcome home," before waving me along.  
当我们降落时，城市的巨大规模和广阔范围令人望而生畏。金属山峰随时可能将我吞没，其威势不亚于亚利桑那州的任何一座石峰。首先袭来的是气味，一股咸腥的恶臭，混杂着消毒剂的刺鼻和偶尔飘来的机油味。机场繁忙却不拥挤。海关检查仍耗时一小时。站在防弹玻璃窗后的男子在我的护照上盖章，低声说了句“欢迎回家”，随后挥手示意我继续前行。

Welcome home. 欢迎回家。

Every tower appears to grow with every step I take, the sky above belonging to some other world. People don't pay one another much mind. Constant herds moving in singular destinations through compact streets, pretending there is no one and nothing around them. Every sidewalk and overpass has the sense of being apart of a much larger design. Nothing is put down here by accident. All of it has purpose. The very road I walk down is a funnel to red pillars holding arched roofs aloft, stacked atop one another and heavy with an austere sense of age. It's flanked by statues of creatures with wide eyes and mouths barring rows of teeth, exaggerated and colorful. On the other side is a wide bowl with burning incense, from which passing commuters cup the smoke and wave it over their faces.  
每座塔楼似乎都随着我每走一步而生长，头顶的天空属于另一个世界。人们彼此不太在意。不断涌动的群体在狭窄的街道上朝着各自的目的地移动，假装周围空无一人、一无所有。每条人行道和天桥都给人一种属于更大设计的感觉。这里的一切都不是偶然放置的。所有都有其目的。我脚下的道路通向红色柱子支撑的拱形屋顶，层层叠叠，带着一种庄严的岁月感。两侧是眼睛大睁、嘴巴露出夸张彩色牙齿的生物雕像。另一边是一个宽大的香炉，燃烧着香火，过往的行人捧起烟雾，挥洒在脸上。

Everyone bows here too. It feels archaic and forced. Done more out of homage to the way things used to be than because it carries any cultural significance. Even Obihiro, like Misato's bar, aches for a time remembered.  
这里每个人也都会鞠躬。感觉古老而勉强。更多是出于对过去方式的敬意，而非因为它承载了任何文化意义。就连 Obihiro，就像 Misato 的酒吧一样，渴望着记忆中的时光。

I don't dare try and navigate the railways that cut through the city blocks. For now, It's easy enough to hitch a cab through my phone. The driver's Japanese is precise and curt, making me sound, by comparison, uncultured I suppose. He even gnaws his teeth a little, eyebrows bent, when I stutter the address to him.  
我不敢尝试穿越那些切割城市街区的铁路。眼下，通过手机叫辆出租车倒也轻而易举。司机的日语精准而简练，相比之下，我显得颇为粗俗，大概如此。当我结结巴巴地报出地址时，他甚至微微皱起眉头，轻咬着牙齿。

The drive is short and barbed.  
车程短暂而尖锐。

As we pull up to my stop and I step out, I decide to bow. What is too low? What isn't low enough? When does one even bow? _Too late for that now._  
当我们抵达目的地，我下车时，决定鞠躬致意。鞠躬到什么程度才算合适？什么程度又显得不够？何时该鞠躬？现在想这些已经太迟了。

The driver tries very hard not to scowl. As he pulls away, I catch conversation down the sidewalk from a pair of older women, older at least than my mother.  
司机努力不让自己皱眉。当他驶离时，我听到人行道上两位年长女士的对话，至少比我妈年纪大。

"Such foolishness. Foreigners coming over and pretending."  
“真是荒唐。外国人过来装模作样。”

"Should you really be talking that way?"  
“你真的该那样说话吗？”

"It's not as though he speaks it. He's not really Japanese, not anymore. He's been Americanized like the rest of them."  
"他并不说日语。他已经不是真正的日本人了，不再是了。他和他们一样，已经被美国化了。"

"It's a disgrace to the ancestors."  
"这是对祖先的耻辱。"

"Those who have forgotten their heritage don't belong here."  
"那些忘记了自己传统的人，不配留在这里。"

I decide not to say anything and move on. It was a silly thing to do. What was I thinking? I may look Japanese, I may speak it, but I'm just a foreigner here. This isn't home. Not really.  
我决定什么也不说，继续前行。那是个愚蠢的行为。我当时在想什么？我可能看起来像日本人，也能说日语，但在这里我只是个外国人。这里不是我的家。并不真是。

The Suzahara's have moved out of the valleys to the north and into the city proper now. The message from Hachiro points me a hundred floors up one of Obihiro's towering complexes. Being inside one is a thought too odd to wrap my mind around, coming from so low on the ground. The corridors are spacious and lined with shopping centers and restaurants, broken up occasionally by housing blocks.  
铃原一家已经从北部的山谷搬到了市区。八郎的信息指引我前往带广市一座高耸建筑的百层之上。从地面如此低处进入其中，这想法太过奇特，难以理解。走廊宽敞，两侧是购物中心和餐馆，偶尔被住宅区隔开。

Most of the workers and attendants in these miniature towns are from the States. It's easy to tell because of how flat American Japanese sounds, lacking all of the higher inflections, unlike the refugees brought back from China. The former, wearings faces of constant deference, have hands that twitch just before they go to bow. They apologize for what seems like everything.  
这些微型城镇中的大多数工人和服务员都来自美国。很容易辨认，因为他们的日语发音太平，缺乏所有的高音起伏，与从中国带回的难民不同。前者，脸上总是带着恭顺的表情，手在鞠躬前会微微颤抖。他们似乎对一切都道歉。

"Sorry the food is lukewarm."  
"抱歉，食物有点温吞。"

"No I don't have anything cheaper, my apologies."  
"没有更便宜的了，很抱歉。"

"I'm sorry, I know the wrinkles on my shirt are unsightly."  
"对不起，我知道我衬衫上的皱褶很难看。"

"The water isn't cold enough? I'm so sorry."  
"水不够冷吗？真是抱歉。"

"I'm not walking on all fours? Oh how rude, please forgive me!"  
"我没有四肢着地走路？哦，多么无礼，请原谅我！"

Okay, the last one I made up, but that's what they might as well be saying. There's a desperation to be accepted that bleeds into every jittering step and nervous smile, and it's so terribly clear those who survived China and the Balkans have little interest in holding them as equal. Their eyes glaze over when they speak, seeing but not listening. A speck of dust on gold-rimmed glasses.  
好吧，最后一句是我编的，但他们可能也就是这么想的。那种渴望被接纳的迫切感渗透在每一次颤抖的步伐和紧张的微笑中，那些从中国和巴尔干半岛幸存下来的人显然对平等对待他们没什么兴趣。当他们说话时，眼神变得呆滞，看似在看却并未倾听。就像金边眼镜上的一粒尘埃。

It's a relief when I finally see a welcoming face in Aunt Hikari. Her long hair, tied low, is almost down to her waist now. We hug, but as I try to step further in she isn't content to let go. Remembering herself, she steps away, smiling that ever bright smile of hers.  
当我终于看到光阿姨那张亲切的面孔时，心中感到一阵宽慰。她那长长的头发低低地束着，几乎垂到了腰间。我们拥抱了一下，但当我试图再往里走时，她却不愿松手。意识到自己的失态，她退后一步，露出了她那永远灿烂的笑容。

"Look how much you've grown," she says with a sniff, swiping at the edges of her eyes as they redden. She touches me and says it again. That's Aunt Hikari. So emotional. Ambling down the hall is Toji, hair receding and now completely gray, save for a few streaks of black left over.  
“看看你都长这么大了，”她带着一丝哽咽说道，用手擦拭着眼角的红晕。她轻抚着我，又重复了一遍。这就是光阿姨，总是那么感性。走廊里缓缓走来的是冬二，头发已经完全灰白，只剩下几缕黑色的痕迹。

"Hey, I think I remember this guy," he says, rubbing his chin. "What was his name? Kazuki? Kaguya?"  
“嘿，我觉得我记得这家伙，”他摸着下巴说道，“他叫什么来着？和树？卡古也？”

Hikari _tsks_, delivering a light backhand to his chest and still trying not to break into tears. He smiles and puts an arm around her. Apologizing, she retreats to the kitchen to prepare us tea. Toji shakes my hand, laughing.  
光轻叹一声，轻轻拍了拍他的胸口，努力忍住泪水。他微笑着，伸出一只手臂搂住她。她道歉后退到厨房为我们准备茶水。冬二笑着和我握手。

"Here now, you've upset my wife. You're gonna' have to stay the whole year comin' up."  
“瞧瞧，你惹我妻子生气了。接下来这一年你可得留下来赔罪。”

"I think you'd have to fight my mother for that."  
“我看你得先跟我妈打一架才行。”

Toji guffaws, slapping my back as he leads us into the kitchen. "I've offered to do as much before. I tell you, that woman..."  
冬二大笑起来，拍着我的背领我们走进厨房。“我以前也这么提议过。我跟你说，那个女人……”

"Hush," Hikari says, trying to hide behind the guise of stern wife, "you're too easy to goad and she knows it."  
“嘘，”光说，试图用严厉妻子的伪装掩饰，“你太容易被激怒了，她知道这一点。”

"It ain't me who's got a problem," he says, settling down at their square table. Everything is square. From the floor plan, to the kitchen and the tiles and the lights. Even the butsudan, black and lined with gold, is square. Images of cranes and dragons and reeds flow within each box, chimes hanging on either side of the stand where the incense is burned.  
“有问题的不止我一个，”他说着，在他们的方形桌子旁坐下。一切都是方形的。从平面图到厨房、瓷砖和灯光。甚至连佛坛也是方形的，黑色镶金边。每个盒子里都流淌着鹤、龙和芦苇的图像，佛坛两侧挂着风铃，供香燃烧的架子就在旁边。

"So," Toji says, nodding to the shrine, "you Shinto yet?"  
"那么，" 冬二向神社点了点头，"你还信神道教吗？"

_Oh, boy_. I force a chuckle. "Uh, well no. I mean, not really..." anything else dies before it can grow into a fledgling thought. I haven't missed this part of the visits, the partly innocent and partly interrogation-like questions about my faith, or lack thereof.  
哦，天哪。我勉强笑了一声。"呃，不，我的意思是，不太信了..." 其他的想法还没萌芽就夭折了。我并没有怀念这部分的拜访，那些半是天真半是审问式的关于我信仰——或缺乏信仰——的问题。

Hikari spares her husband a withering look and he shrugs. A tray of tea in her hands, she sets it down between us and starts to pour, saying, "So long as you're not with one of those Third Impact cults."  
光子瞪了她丈夫一眼，他耸了耸肩。她手里端着一盘茶，放在我们之间，开始倒茶，说道："只要你不是加入了那些第三次冲击的邪教就好。"

My Aunt doesn't outright disagree with anyone, only politely disapproves – and will certainly tell you how much she disapproves – all without giving you a hard argument. I could probably flip this table and she'd sip her tea and, with a sigh, say, "I don't agree with what you did, but I suppose that's your right to do it."  
我姑妈从不直接反驳任何人，只是礼貌地表示不赞同——而且肯定会告诉你她有多不赞同——但绝不会与你激烈争论。我可能掀翻这张桌子，她也会啜饮着茶，叹口气说：“我不赞同你的做法，但我想那是你的权利。”

"Most of them aren't so bad," I say, shrugging off my jacket and draping it on the backrest.  
“他们大多数没那么糟糕，”我说着，脱下外套搭在椅背上。

Toji huffs. "Tell that to the Wolf Brigade."  
东二哼了一声。“对狼骑兵团说去吧。”

At my questioning glance Hikari makes a flat grimace, which her husband completely misses.  
我投去询问的目光，光露出一个生硬的苦笑，而她的丈夫完全没有注意到。

"It's an organization of temple monks that have a co-policing agreement with the NPA," he explains. "No one openly practices the Trinity religions here."  
“这是一个与国家警察厅有联合执法协议的寺庙僧侣组织，”他解释道，“这里没有人公开信奉三位一体宗教。”

Hikari, thankfully, steers us away from politics and religions, gushing instead about Sakura's wedding coming up next May. She was another late returnee and is still fairly young. I recall a bubbly girl, whom I may or may not have crushed on as an adolescent boy. Back when she used to babysit me and her nephews in Louisiana.  
幸好，光把话题从政治和宗教上引开，转而兴奋地聊起了樱明年五月的婚礼。她也是晚归者之一，年纪尚轻。我记得她是个活泼的女孩，青春期时我可能对她有过好感，也可能没有。那时她还在路易斯安那州帮我照看她和侄子们。

Toji crosses his arms, but nods. "Reese is alright. I'd have preferred someone from the Defense Force, but she's always had a soft spot for sailors like our granddad."  
冬二交叉双臂，但还是点了点头。“丽莎还不错。我本希望她能找个防卫队的，但她一直对像我们爷爷那样的水手情有独钟。”

That's the most flattering praise I've ever heard come out of Uncle Toji's mouth about _any_ of Sakura's boyfriends. 54 years old and he's still the stubborn, overprotective older brother.  
这是我从舅舅冬二嘴里听到的，关于小樱任何一个男朋友最动听的赞美了。54 岁了，他还是那个固执又过度保护的哥哥。

After Hikari makes us riceballs, which I manage not to scarf down like a pig, Toji shows me to the guest room. It's actually just the third youngest's old room, framed paintings done in a wild and abstract style hanging from the walls.  
光姐给我们做了饭团，我尽量没像猪一样狼吞虎咽，随后冬二带我去了客房。其实只是最小的弟弟以前的房间，墙上挂着风格狂野抽象的画作。

The trip out to the main island won't take more than a day and I don't have to meet my contact until tomorrow. People buy passage over all the time through "tour guides", men and women who'll ferry anyone over for a fee. The cost is largely for bribing their way past checkpoints. The UN has kept a token policing force hanging around, none of which really want to be here anymore.  
前往主岛的行程不会超过一天，而我直到明天才需要与我的联系人见面。人们经常通过“导游”购买通行证，这些男女会为了费用将任何人摆渡过去。费用主要用于贿赂通过检查站。联合国维持了一支象征性的警力，但其中没有人真正还想留在这里。

Back in the kitchen we talk more, namely about my parents. Toji rubs the callouses of his finger tips, formed after decades of working the Orleans canals, and asks about dad in a quieter way. Hikari makes us more tea and I feel too rude asking for coffee instead. She doesn't comment much when I mention mother, but listens intently, shoulders high as she holds her tea cup close.  
回到厨房后，我们谈得更多，主要是关于我的父母。Toji 揉搓着他指尖因几十年在 Orleans 运河工作而形成的茧子，以一种更轻柔的方式询问父亲的情况。Hikari 为我们续了茶，我觉得直接要咖啡显得太失礼。当我提到母亲时，她没有多说什么，但听得很专注，肩膀紧绷，将茶杯紧紧捧在手中。

"We'd really like to see them again," Toji says, touching the knee of his prosthetic. No one speaks for a while and the butsudan in the corner draws my stare. Within is a picture of Hiro in his dress blues, so serious and steady. Not at all the curse-slinging hood-rat I grew up with. We were about the same age when we met. He was born in winter and, like Yuki, I found in him someone who struggled to find their place just as much as me. Up until he joined the US Army. Happened the very minute he turned eighteen, completely on a whim. We'd been sitting on his back porch and he was smoking a birthday gift from Hachiro: a pack of Italian cigarettes. Hikari was having it out with him in the house for it.  
"我们真的很想再见到他们，" 东治说着，轻触着他的假肢膝盖。一时间无人言语，我目光不由自主地被角落里的佛坛吸引。里面是浩穿着蓝色军礼服的照片，神情严肃而坚定。完全不是我从小认识的那个满口脏话的小混混。我们相遇时年纪相仿。他生于冬天，就像雪一样，我发现他和我一样，都在努力寻找自己的位置。直到他加入美国陆军。就在他十八岁生日那天，完全是一时冲动。当时我们正坐在他的后门廊上，他抽着八郎送的生日礼物：一包意大利香烟。光正在屋里和他争吵。

Hiro stood up, flicked his bud to the sidewalk and said, "Fuck it."  
浩站起身，将烟蒂弹到人行道上，说："去他妈的。"

He marched right down to the recruitment office and the next morning, hot off a fight with his father, boarded the bus out to basic. They made up when he finished training and from every night on, Toji would annoy the patrons in bars across Louisiana talking about his son the Army man. We'd joke that it wouldn't be long before he was in all the Cajun city jazz. "Who 'dat Jerry Army man? Hiro-man! Hiro-man!"  
他径直走向征兵办公室，第二天早上，在与父亲大吵一架后，他登上了前往新兵训练营的巴士。他完成训练后，父子俩和好了，从那以后，每晚东治都会在路易斯安那州的酒吧里，向顾客们炫耀他的陆军儿子，惹得众人烦不胜烦。我们开玩笑说，不久他就会成为卡津城爵士乐的常客。"谁是那个杰瑞陆军男？浩男！浩男！"

"He'd have been twenty-seven a few days ago," Hikari says, a smirk failing to reach. Toji takes her hand, and that at least brings her sad smile free.  
"他几天前刚满二十七岁，"光说，一丝讥笑未能成形。真治握住她的手，至少这让她露出了悲伤的微笑。

For six years I've been cut off from the world. I was apart of it, but not living in it, shuffling from one needless task to the next trying to find my way. I could have made the time to come to the funeral. I should have made time. Hiro deserved that.  
六年来，我与世隔绝。我曾是其中一员，却未曾真正生活其中，从一个无谓的任务游走到下一个，试图找到自己的方向。我本可以抽出时间参加葬礼。我应该抽出时间。广值得那样。

He deserved to have another person there to remember him.  
他值得有另一个人在那里记住他。

---

Nightlife in Obihiro crawls with neon light, blending together and blossoming amber-gold off the windows. Motorcycles scream by as I walk out, streets echoing with the hoots and hollers of their riders. One of them has a red jacket with the numbers 02 painted in white on the back. A pair of police cars aren't far behind.  
带广的夜生活被霓虹灯笼罩，交织融合，窗户上映出琥珀金色的光晕。我走出时，摩托车呼啸而过，街道回荡着骑手们的呼喊声。其中一人穿着红色夹克，背后用白色油漆涂着数字 02。几辆警车紧随其后。

Panels that, during the day showcase directories and broadcast the goings-on in a city too large for itself, display public announcements made by a woman with a smile that's too bright as she encourages citizens to be wary of cultist activity and report any suspicious behavior to the authorities. They roll by in armored trucks and on the gardened skyways, or at intersections where I can spot the wolves, decked in black riot armor with air filter masks and goggles. The reflective plating makes them glow red in the electric light.  
白天展示城市指南和播报城市动态的屏幕，现在显示着一位笑容过于灿烂的女性发布的公共通知，她敦促市民警惕邪教活动，并向当局报告任何可疑行为。这些通知通过装甲卡车和花园天桥滚动播放，或在能看见全副武装的黑衣狼群的十字路口，他们戴着空气过滤面具和护目镜。反光板在电光下泛着红光。

As I walk, I sense the city changing. Not even the wolves can witness every narrow street or crowded underpass. From somewhere on the next block over, I can hear drums, a pounding rhythm that feels like a heartbeat. Obihiro is divided into 49 special wards. Each with its own identity in a place no one can say for sure where Japan begins or ends.  
我行走着，感觉到城市的变化。即便是狼也无法见证每一条狭窄的街道或拥挤的地下通道。从下一个街区某处，我能听到鼓声，一种仿佛心跳的强烈节奏。带广被划分为 49 个特别区。每个区都有其独特的身份，在这个地方，没人能确切地说出日本从哪里开始或结束。

Crossing through Otofuke, the hiss of the rail cars above the city's deep canyons turn into a roar, somehow drowned out by the shouting of stumbling drunks and alleyway singing parlors. Their cadence melds with Memuro, where merchants chant their limited-time-only sales on fresh goods, enticing families to gather around bowl shaped trash-bins while ripping at crab shells or sinking their teeth into the spilling juices of watermelons. A fat, bloated economy where consumers purchase as hungrily as the melon eaters stuff their faces.  
穿过音更，城市深谷上方列车的嘶鸣声变成了咆哮，不知怎的被蹒跚醉汉的叫喊声和巷弄歌唱室的歌声淹没。它们的节奏与芽室融合，那里商贩们吟唱着限时特卖的生鲜商品，吸引家庭围坐在碗状的垃圾桶旁，撕扯蟹壳或咬进溢出的西瓜汁。一个臃肿的经济体，消费者购买起来如饥似渴，就像吃瓜者塞满嘴巴一样。

Talking over everything are the adverts, men with boisterous voices shouting down to the inhabitants all there is to buy and make their lives wonderful and carefree. Behind these and sitting beneath the industrial towers are store fronts extending on the walkways ten stories up. They fade as one enters Shimizu, put under by the droning chorus of monks making their way through these pillars of civilization with all the unhurried intent of a river cutting through a gorge. The bells of the shrines, carried with them to purify the city, drape chills over my shoulders with each jingle.  
广告声此起彼伏，男人们用响亮的声音向居民们叫卖着各种商品，让他们的生活变得美好而无忧。在这些广告背后，工业塔下坐着一排排商店，沿着人行道延伸至十层楼高。随着进入清水市，这些商店逐渐消失，被僧侣们穿过这些文明支柱时那不紧不慢的吟唱所掩盖，宛如河流切割峡谷一般。神社的钟声，随他们而来净化城市，每响一次都让我肩头感到一阵寒意。

It's here that I brave the railways rather than face the taxi drivers and their sneers, navigating a circuit board network out to Mount Tsurugi. The place has been turned into Obihiro's graveyard, a cemetery built atop tiers like the walls of Japan's old castles. Each level has a crooked order to it, jagged with square pillars of varying sizes and not unlike the city whose dead it houses.  
正是在这里，我宁愿冒险穿越铁路，也不愿面对出租车司机和他们轻蔑的嘲笑，穿过错综复杂的铁路网前往剣岳。这个地方已被改造成带广的墓地，一座建在层层叠叠如日本古城墙般的阶梯上的公墓。每一层都有一种扭曲的秩序，参差不齐的方形柱子大小不一，与它所安葬的城市死者颇为相似。

Here I meet a man I don't have to worry about bows or handshakes with. We hug in a way that seems more like a contest to break one another's back than a warm greeting. Hachiro steps back, holding my shoulders and grinning his father's grin. He has his long hair combed back now, a halfhearted attempt to hide a growing bald spot.  
在这里，我遇到了一个不必担心鞠躬或握手的人。我们的拥抱更像是一场试图折断对方脊背的比赛，而非热情的问候。八郎退后一步，抓住我的肩膀，露出了他父亲般的笑容。他现在把长发梳向脑后，这是对逐渐秃顶的半心半意掩饰。

"Goddamn Kazuya, it's good to see you," he says.  
“该死的和也，见到你真好，”他说。

"Wish I could say the same."  
“真希望我也能这么说。”

He chortles, stepping back and motioning at the bag by my feet. "What'd you bring?"  
他轻笑一声，后退一步，指着我脚边的袋子问道：“你带了什么来？”

"Only the best." It was difficult to find, but I managed to hunt down a bottle of Canadian Whiskey. It's been a favorite of the Suzahara's ever since I smuggled some down from Misato's stash. For Hiro, I'll suffer the swill.  
“只有最好的。”这瓶加拿大威士忌可不好找，但我还是设法弄到了一瓶。自从我从美里那儿偷偷带了些回来，它就成了铃原家的最爱。为了 Hiro，我愿意忍受这劣酒。

It isn't long before the second eldest, Katsuo, shows up – bringing Masaru and Noboru with.  
没过多久，次子胜夫就出现了——还带着丸和信也一起。

"Hey, Hachiro!" Katsuo calls, "how did you get your chains off? Won't Rina be sending out a search party?"  
"嘿，八郎！" 胜夫喊道，"你怎么解开锁链的？里奈不会派人搜寻吗？"

Hachiro's expression clouds. He doesn't like talking about his wife. This prompts a bout of less-than-brotherly insults, which is – even after all this time – nothing out of the ordinary. He and Katsuo have been fighting since they were kids.  
八郎的表情阴沉下来。他不喜欢谈论他的妻子。这引发了一阵不那么兄弟般的侮辱，即便过了这么久，这仍是家常便饭。他和胜夫从小打到大。

"Alright, quit pissing around and walk, huh? We're here to see Hiro." Masaru, peacekeeper since he was twelve, says with a laugh and a touch to Hachiro's shoulder. He's sharper than his brothers, toying with the cuffs of a fitted suit. What does he do now? Something in Network Marketing, I think.  
"好了，别闹了，走吧，嗯？我们是来看浩的。" 作为和平使者的真丸笑着说，拍了拍八郎的肩膀。他比他的兄弟们更敏锐，摆弄着合身西装的袖口。他现在做什么？我想是网络营销之类的工作。

"Where's Rokurou?" Hachiro asks, scouting the troop.  
“Rokurou 在哪儿？”八广问道，环视着队伍。

"He's at some fucking rally in Nakasatsunai district," Katsuo says, throwing a hand, "protesting the Wolf Brigade."  
“他在中札内区参加某个该死的集会，”胜雄挥了挥手说，“抗议狼队。”

"I oughta' go down there hand him over to 'em. 'Here officer, please arrest my idiot brother...'"  
“我真该去那儿把他交给他们。‘警官，请逮捕我这个白痴弟弟吧……’”

Masaru shrugs. "He's going through that whole idealist phase. He'll get over it once he grows up a little."  
Masaru 耸了耸肩。“他正经历那个理想主义阶段。等他再长大一点就会明白了。”

Noboru shakes his head. "All he's doing is upsetting mom..."  
Noboru 摇了摇头。“他这样做只会让妈妈难过……”

It's unanimously agreed then that tonight their next stop will be to the rally to knock some sense into their younger brother. Already waiting by Hiro's grave are Takeshi and Akio, who has just turned 17. Hanging off the arm of the former is a girl who, by the jeering and absolute disregard for manners, has already been taken on as a sister by the others. Hachiro likes her 'cause she can hold her liquor.  
于是大家一致同意，今晚的下一站就是去集会上让他们的弟弟清醒清醒。在 Hiro 的墓前，Takeshi 和刚满 17 岁的 Akio 已经等候多时。前者手臂上挂着一个女孩，她因为那嘲弄的态度和对礼节的完全无视，已经被其他人当作了妹妹。Hachiro 喜欢她，因为她酒量不错。

Akio is quiet, but loosens up when his brothers gather around, as if given permission to be himself.  
秋生平时沉默寡言，但当他的兄弟们聚在一起时，他似乎得到了做自己的许可，变得放松起来。

A hand brushing his shaved head, he asks, "Is Rokurou–?"  
一只手轻抚着他剃光的头，他问道：“六郎他——？”

"Forget it," Hachiro snaps. "We're going out later to belt him."  
“别提了，”八郎厉声道，“我们晚点出去揍他一顿。”

Akio swells, only to close his mouth, protest leaving as an unheard sigh. At Masaru's prodding, he reluctantly talks about his progress with the temple, where he is training to be a monk. I've never known the older brothers to do more than scoff at the idea of upholding the family religion, but when it comes to Akio, they're excited and all too proud. Like when Hiro left for the Army.  
明夫的抗议化为无声的叹息，他闭上了嘴。在真丸的催促下，他勉强谈起了自己在寺庙的修行进展，他正在那里接受成为僧侣的训练。我从未见过兄长们对维护家族宗教的想法有过比嗤之以鼻更多的反应，但提到明夫时，他们却异常兴奋和自豪。就像当年弘去参军时一样。

Drinking begins promptly. Even Akio takes a shot. With Hachiro around there's no getting past it. He pours several drinks for Hiro to the praise and shouts of his brothers. Then, a moment of quiet prayer is allowed to pass as Noboru lights the incense. It doesn't last very long as Hachiro downs one of Hiro's shots and passes the other to Katsuo, who begrudgingly accepts.  
饮酒立即开始。就连明夫也喝了一杯。有八郎在场，谁也躲不过去。他为弘倒了几杯酒，赢得了兄弟们的赞扬和欢呼。随后，随着昇点燃香火，大家短暂地静默祈祷。但这并未持续多久，因为八郎喝掉了弘的一杯酒，并将另一杯递给了克巳，后者不情愿地接过。

Takeshi balks. "You– you can't drink those! You have to leave them for his spirit or something. What was the point?"  
武志吃惊地说：“你——你不能喝那些！得留给他的灵魂什么的。这有什么意义？”

Akio's face falls, the very image of wise sage. "It is the intent that is important," he says, pressing his hands together and bowing.  
秋雄的脸色一沉，活脱脱一个智者的形象。“重要的是意图，”他说着，双手合十鞠了一躬。

Hachiro winks. "See? The monk says so. Hiro would want me to drink it."  
八郎眨了眨眼。“看吧？和尚都这么说了。宏会希望我喝的。”

The more they drink, the more stories that are shared about Hiro. Akio has few, but listens eagerly as Katsuo and Hachiro argue over the details of their escapades. From girls to nightclubs to gang fights along the New Orleans canals.  
他们喝得越多，关于宏的故事也就越分享越多。秋雄的故事不多，但他热切地听着胜雄和八郎争论他们冒险的细节。从女孩到夜总会，再到新奥尔良运河旁的帮派斗殴。

A police patrol calls out to us. Noboru fumbles with the whiskey and Akio looks ready to throw up. Hachiro puts on that easy charm of his, walking up to them with a swaggering gait.  
一辆警车向我们喊话。信雄手忙脚乱地摆弄着威士忌，秋雄看起来快要吐了。八郎则摆出他那轻松自如的魅力，大摇大摆地走向警察。

The eldest Suzahara can make a friend out of anyone. You could drop him in the most hateful, racist, poor slum in South America and without knowing a lick of Spanish he'd have everyone sharing a drink and laughing in fifteen minutes.  
须原家的大哥能和任何人交上朋友。你把他扔到南美洲最仇恨、最种族歧视、最贫穷的贫民窟里，哪怕他一句西班牙语都不会，也能在十五分钟内让所有人一起喝酒、开怀大笑。

He accomplishes that, minus the drinking, in only a minute with the pair of cops. Posture lax, expressions bright and at ease, one would think they and Hachiro have been old buddies for years now. As they leave, the brothers decide it's time to go. Raising one last drink to Hiro, they set off – the younger boys stumbling to the laughter of the elders. A troop of clowns, to be sure.  
他确实做到了，虽然没有喝酒，只用了一分钟就和那两个警察打成一片。姿态放松，表情明朗且自在，让人以为他们和八郎已经是多年的老朋友了。告别时，兄弟们决定是时候离开了。他们向弘举杯致意，随即启程——年轻的弟弟们踉跄前行，引得长辈们哄笑。真是一群小丑，毫无疑问。

Later, Hachiro sends me a picture of Noboru sitting next to Rokurou, an arm thrown over his shoulder and each sporting some bruises, though the latter definitely has the worst of it. Katsuo sits next to them, smoking, and bleeding from his nose. Far in the background are the crowds of protesters and their flags.  
后来，八郎发给我一张照片，信坐在六郎旁边，一只手臂搭在六郎肩上，两人都带着些瘀伤，但显然六郎的伤势更重。胜夫坐在他们旁边，抽着烟，鼻子上还流着血。远处是抗议的人群和他们的旗帜。

The next morning, before I go to the meeting area, I venture into the heart of downtown. It's actually the most open space in the city, a garden filled plaza ringed with government buildings. The plants and trees are cropped low, so that even across the courtyard one can always see the red pillar in the center of it all. A nexus point. No one going anywhere in the city can hope to miss it. Even the trains passing at the edges can hold it in plain sight. If only for a moment.  
第二天早上，在我前往会议地点之前，我冒险进入了市中心的中心地带。这里实际上是城市中最开阔的空间，一个被政府大楼环绕的花园广场。植物和树木都被修剪得很矮，因此即使隔着庭院，人们总能看到中央那根红色的柱子。这是一个枢纽点。在城市中行走的任何人都不可能错过它。即使是边缘经过的火车也能清晰地看到它。哪怕只是一瞬间。

The walk to reach it feels like a lifetime, until I'm standing far beneath a ten story tall red slat, marked with segments of black and orange. The hunk of metal is scarred and dented in some areas, never refurbished or restored to whatever condition it was in before. Cleaned and preserved, yes, but left in its half-decayed state, as a reminder of everything it'd gone through in its unremembered war. Commuters give it a wide berth, while visitors and tourists get right up close, needing to see it and touch it. Crowds of them, reaching out just to graze it with the tips of their fingers.  
走向它的每一步都仿佛跨越了整个生命，直到我站在那高达十层的红色横梁之下，横梁上交错着黑色与橙色的标记。这块金属巨物在某些地方留下了伤痕和凹陷，从未被翻新或修复回它曾经的模样。它被清洁和保存着，但仍保持着半衰败的状态，作为对其在遗忘的战争中所经历一切的提醒。通勤者们远远避开它，而游客们则紧贴上前，迫切地想要看到它、触摸它。人群涌动，伸出手指只是轻轻掠过它的表面。

It sits on an obsidian block, where one can stand and see their own colorless reflection. At my height, cutting across my chest, reads – _In memory of the Angel War and those who fought it in our place._  
它坐落在一个黑曜石基座上，人们可以站在那里看到自己无色的倒影。在我胸前的高度，刻着这样一句话——纪念天使之战及那些为我们而战的勇士。

It's just one of the shoulder pylons, the one part of it they found somewhere out by the shore. I read in an article it housed these projectiles the size of a bus. The pylon itself is huge and gives me a glimpse of the hulking mass that must've been the Evas. I can almost see the head, right between two of these armored pillars, red plate bright in the shimmer of fire and summer sun. It's one thing to see pictures of it stalking through a city block, quite another to stand up to a physical piece of it. They were giants. Titans.  
这只是其中一个肩部支架，他们在海岸边某处发现的那个部分。我在一篇文章中读到，它内部装载着巴士大小的导弹。这个支架本身就非常巨大，让我得以一窥那些庞大机体——Eva 的真容。我几乎能看到头部，就在这两根装甲柱之间，红色装甲板在火光和夏日阳光的闪烁下显得格外耀眼。看着它在城市街区中游走的图片是一回事，而亲眼见到它的实物又是另一回事。它们曾是巨人，泰坦。

It's still hard to believe they were operated by people so small and unprepared for combat. What must it have been like, watching them battle each other? It leads me to wonder where the other pieces are. Why there's only this lonely sliver of it left.  
仍然难以置信，这些庞然大物是由那些渺小且未经过战斗训练的人操控的。亲眼目睹它们相互搏斗，会是怎样的情景？这让我不禁思考，其他部分都去了哪里。为何只剩下这孤独的一片。

"She used to be awful proud of being a pilot," dad had said, sitting on our back porch and looking over his winter garden. "That was all she had back then. It was who she was."  
“她曾经非常自豪于自己是一名驾驶员，”爸爸坐在后门廊上，望着他的冬季花园说道，“那是她当时的一切。那就是她的身份。”

The sky is gray here, gripped in a cold that cuts deeper than any of the valley winds in Arizona. I reach out to touch the glass stone.  
这里的天空灰蒙蒙的，被一种比亚利桑那山谷任何风都要刺骨的寒冷紧紧抓住。我伸出手去触摸那块玻璃石。

"Hey, mom." “嘿，妈妈。”

---

I meet my contact at the docks in the southern industrial block, drenched in the smell of oil and dead fish. There are two others already waiting there when I step out on the long concrete loading platform; a man who's much younger than me, and a woman. She wears a red coat with a hood, long black hair tucked within. The man nods, but doesn't bow, or thankfully feel inclined to trade names. The woman stares out at the sea, visible only through a gap at the neck of the river where it bleeds out into the ocean.  
我在南工业区的码头与我的联系人会面，那里弥漫着油污和死鱼的气味。当我踏上那条长长的混凝土装卸平台时，已经有两个人在那里等候了：一个比我年轻得多的男人和一个女人。她穿着一件带帽子的红色外套，长长的黑发藏在里面。男人点了点头，但没有鞠躬，也没有贸然交换名字。女人凝视着大海，只能通过河口的一道缝隙看到，那里河水汇入海洋。

Our "tour guide" as he joked on the site, waddles up from the lower docking platforms decked in a heavy coat and beanie. Through a scraggly-haired face he grins, but no one bows or shakes hands. We've already paid him half the fee – the rest he takes once we get there.  
我们的“导游”，正如他在网站上开玩笑的那样，穿着厚重的外套和针织帽，从较低的停靠平台蹒跚而来。透过一头乱糟糟的头发，他咧嘴笑着，但没有人鞠躬或握手。我们已经付了他一半的费用——剩下的他会在我们到达后收取。

"Name's Henmei, if you cared to know," he says and motions for us to follow, then stops. "You're not any of those, uh, Trinity nuts are you? I don't carry them to Honshu. Jin'll boat you over if that's the case, but I'm keeping the money."  
“如果你们想知道的话，我叫 Henmei，”他说着示意我们跟上，然后停了下来。“你们不是那些，呃，Trinity 狂热分子吧？我不带他们去本州。如果是那样的话，Jin 会载你们过去，但钱我得留下。”

The three of us shake our heads and Henmei relaxes. "Good, then let's get on board the _Nihon-Maru_."  
我们三人都摇了摇头，Henmei 放松下来。“好，那我们上 Nihon-Maru 号吧。”

The ship with such a noble name is an old speed boat, maybe used for racing, but painted over to stand out far less. He steers us out of the bay and into the open sea. The spray of the water is chilling and I regret not bringing something with a hood. Several times we're stopped by military patrols, who are persuaded to look the other way. They seem to know Henmei well.  
这艘拥有如此高贵名字的船是一艘旧快艇，或许是用于赛艇的，但已被重新粉刷，不再那么显眼。他驾驶着我们驶出海湾，进入开阔的海域。水花飞溅，寒意袭人，我后悔没带上带帽子的衣物。几次我们被军方巡逻队拦下，但他们被说服视而不见。他们似乎对 Henmei 颇为熟悉。

No one speaks under the buzz of the engine, not until we reach a tiny dock on the tip of Honshu at a place called Aomori. Here, he has a re-purposed military truck, the back draped over with green canvas. We board and I am reminded of people in a different era who were taken far out to the tundras in these transports to be shot. The back at least has a port so we can see Henmei. As we drive, he explains that most of Japan has been sealed off and abandoned for the past twenty-nine years, save for the parts of Kyushu not flooded or utilized as a UN naval port. There aren't really any settlements beyond Fukushima, except for Matsumoto, which is more of a construction colony anyway – a gathering place for all the corps hired out for rebuilding and scavenging. One might find pockets of refugees from Indonesia here and there too, squatting in old towns. The UN has been pretty lax with its gate-keeping policy, as evidenced by our relatively easy passage.  
引擎的嗡嗡声下无人言语，直到我们抵达本州尖端一个名为青森的地方，那里有一座小码头。他有一辆改装过的军用卡车，后部覆盖着绿色帆布。我们登车，我不禁想起另一个时代的那些人，他们被用这种交通工具运送到遥远的冻土上枪决。至少车厢有一侧是敞开的，我们可以看到外面的景色。行驶中，他解释说，过去二十九年里，日本大部分地区已被封锁并废弃，除了未被淹没或用作联合国海军港口的九州部分地区。福岛以外几乎没有定居点，除了松本，那更像是一个建筑殖民地——各家公司聚集于此，从事重建和 scavenging 工作。偶尔也能发现来自印度尼西亚的难民，他们栖身于废弃的城镇中。联合国在门户开放政策上相当宽松，正如我们相对容易的通行所证明的那样。

Ever so slowly, Japan has started to come back to life.  
日本正缓缓地开始恢复生机。

I always thought the islands outside of Hokkaido would be scorched, barren places. But it's beautiful here. Clouds of snow converge from the mountain tops, hiding them in their mist and giving the impression that we're crossing realms, the only barrier between which is an endless sprawl of trees frothed with ice.  
我总以为北海道外的岛屿会是焦灼荒凉之地。但这里美不胜收。雪花如云雾般从山顶汇聚而下，将山峰隐匿于迷雾之中，仿佛我们正穿越诸界，唯一的屏障便是那无尽蔓延、冰霜覆盖的林海。

Entire cities lie abandoned, buildings having fallen into disrepair, their decay aided by roving bands of returnees in the earlier days. All of it lies empty now, ghost towns, each one of them. The scenery changes as we take an old highway by the coast. Many of the island's shoreline prefectures were taken under water after Second Impact and it takes me a while to realize we're actually driving along the side of one of those mountains that looked to be floating in the sky, passing by the crooked remnants of a dozen cities. Out in the dark waters is the top of what must have been a temple, still plated in gold despite decades alone and untended.  
整座城市被遗弃，建筑日渐破败，早年间游荡的归乡者加速了它们的衰败。如今这一切空空如也，成了鬼城。我们沿海岸的旧高速前行，景色不断变换。第二次冲击后，许多岛屿的海岸县市沉入水下，我花了些时间才意识到我们正沿着一座看似悬浮于天际的山峰行驶，途经十几个城市的扭曲遗迹。黑暗的海面上，一座寺庙的顶端依稀可见，尽管历经数十年无人问津，依旧金光闪闪。

The red coat woman shifts as we jar over a bump, gripping tight to something. In her lap is a bronze urn with maple leaves scattered across it.  
红衣女子在我们颠簸过一处凸起时挪动了一下，紧握着某物。她膝上放着一个铜罐，散落着几片枫叶。

"Bringing my grandad back home," she says, catching my stare. "It took a long time, but we finally made it over."  
"带我爷爷回家，" 她察觉到我的目光，说道，"花了很长时间，但我们终于到了。"

Her Japanese sounds subdued. A native unused to speaking it. I'm not sure what to say, but she speaks for both of us. I learn that her name is Kei. She was an orphan at four and raised by her grandfather until he died three years later. Then she was sent to live at a Tenshido Revelation Church in Glasgow. She was raised during what she calls the Puritan Revivalist movement, an attempt to pull up the last roots of Catholicism and, by extension, Tenshido Monotheists left over from the religious bludgeoning that had groups at each other like common street gangs after Scotland's Riot Act was repealed.  
她的日语听起来有些生涩，显然不习惯说这种语言。我不知道该说什么，但她替我们俩开了口。我得知她名叫惠，四岁时就成了孤儿，由祖父抚养长大，直到他三年后去世。之后，她被送到格拉斯哥的一所天志道启示教会生活。她在所谓的清教复兴运动期间长大，这是一场试图铲除天主教残余势力以及随之而来的天志道一神论者的运动，这些宗教团体在苏格兰骚乱法案被废除后，像街头帮派一样互相争斗。

"So, I became one of the faithful," she says, glancing at the back of Henmei's head. He doesn't seem to hear us over the jostling of the truck.  
"于是，我成了其中的一员，" 她瞥了一眼哼美的后脑勺，他似乎没听到我们的谈话，因为卡车的颠簸声太大了。

"Do you still believe?" I ask.  
"你依然相信吗？" 我问道。

She turns, looking at me sidelong. "How can I not? It was real. It happened."  
她转过身，斜眼看着我。"我怎能不信？那是真实的，它发生了。"

"So you think there's some spirit called Lilith still hanging around?"  
"所以你认为有个叫莉莉丝的幽灵还在徘徊？"

At my smirk, her smile grows a bit. She sets the urn in a bag between her feet, wearing nothing but stockings and a long black skirt, of all things. "In Tenshido, Lilith isn't a person so much as she is a light of the soul. What makes us... us, I suppose." in her lap now is a sketch pad, where she draws circles within circles, three of them forming a triangular formation. "We, people, are Lilith, broken apart in fields of light. It's not so different from the stars in the sky, really."  
看到我的微笑，她的笑容也稍稍扩大了些。她将骨灰盒放入脚间的袋中，只穿着长筒袜和一条长长的黑色裙子，真是出乎意料。“在 Tenshido 中，Lilith 与其说是一个人，不如说是灵魂之光。我想，这就是让我们成为我们的原因。”她现在膝上放着一本素描本，在上面画着层层叠叠的圆圈，三个圆圈形成一个三角形排列。“我们，人类，是 Lilith，在光之原野上破碎。这其实与天上的星星并无太大差别。”

"I've never heard it that way before," I say, watching her wrap the symbol within the core of an apple.  
“我以前从未听过这种说法，”我说，看着她将符号包裹在苹果的核心中。

"That's because most people need something literal." around the apple, a snake eats its own tail while seven disembodied eyes watch. "They need something tangible to hear them and guide them."  
“那是因为大多数人需要一些具体的东西。”围绕着苹果，一条蛇吞食着自己的尾巴，而七只无实体的眼睛在旁注视。“他们需要一些有形的东西来倾听和引导他们。”

"So have people and Lilith always been connected and we just never knew?"  
"所以人类和莉莉丝一直都有联系，只是我们从未知晓？"

Even with the rumbling of the truck, her touch is sharp, wrist moving with the jumps and turns more than trying to control them. "You could say that. No one understood what her light was until the war. Until the world-eater gave us the choice."  
即便在卡车隆隆的响声中，她的触碰依然敏锐，手腕随着跳跃和转向的动作移动，与其说是试图控制，不如说是在顺应。“你可以这么说。直到战争之前，没有人理解她的光芒意味着什么。直到世界吞噬者给了我们选择。”

"The world-eater?" "世界吞噬者？"

"The Eva. Unit-one." "初号机。"

One of the orbs in her sketch, cut with slits that might be eyes, has a maw of square teeth ever so slightly parted. As though it's on the edge of a grin.  
她素描中的一个球体，被切出了可能是眼睛的裂缝，有一张微微张开的方形牙齿的嘴。仿佛它正处在微笑的边缘。

"I'm not sure I can believe all that."  
"我不确定我能否相信这一切。"

Some of her black hair falls, swinging to touch the paper. "You don't have to."  
她的一缕黑发垂落，轻轻摇曳触碰到纸张。“你不必如此。”

Her pencil scratches on the final touches, hand stowing her stray locks away. She tears the page off and hands the little diagram to me. A small arrow points to one of the circles just beyond the radius of the bigger three: a little black shadow.  
她用铅笔做最后的修饰，手将散乱的发丝拢回。她撕下那页纸，递给我这个小图表。一个小箭头指向大圆圈外的一个小圆：一抹小小的黑色阴影。

Next to it reads – _This one is Kazuya, the Stubborn Traveler._  
旁边写着——这是和也，倔强的旅人。

Smirking, I look back to find her set into the paper again, trying to hide one of her own. We sit together in the quiet carried by the breeze, fading as the world molds from a serene, white covered landscape to dark green forests and alpine meadows.  
我带着一丝得意的微笑回头看去，发现她又埋头于纸张之中，试图隐藏自己的一份。我们静静地坐在一起，任由微风带来的宁静渐渐消散，世界从一片洁白宁静的雪景转变为深绿的森林和山地草甸。

The boy, Chikuma, likes to play the harmonica. Sad melodies that remind me of home. He tells us he's from Colorado, only speaking when prompted. He is shy, I can sense, catching the patient smiles that flicker here and there.  
那个男孩，千贺，喜欢吹口琴。悲伤的旋律让我想起了家乡。他告诉我们他来自科罗拉多，只有在被问及时才会开口。我能感觉到他的羞涩，捕捉到他偶尔闪现的耐心微笑。

"So, why did you come?" Kei asks. She's focused on me now, innocently intent. Her coat is just a little too big for her and I wonder how old she is. Surely too young and pretty for me.  
“那么，你为什么来这里？”圭问道。她现在专注地看着我，带着天真的认真。她的外套对她来说稍显大了些，我不禁好奇她到底几岁。肯定太年轻，也太漂亮，不适合我。

"It's really not so important."  
"这真的没那么重要。"

Kei quirks her head with that knowing, patient look. My lips work a smile and I shake my head. She leans in, egging me on.  
惠以那种了然于心、耐心等待的神情歪了歪头。我嘴角牵起一丝微笑，摇了摇头。她凑近了些，鼓励我继续说下去。

"My parents were in the Angel War," I say, trying to gauge her reaction. "They were pilots."  
"我的父母参加了天使战争，"我说，试图观察她的反应。"他们是飞行员。"

Her brown eyes twinkle and, half in jest, she appears to give my answer deep consideration. "There weren't that many of them active, were there?"  
"她的棕色眼睛闪烁着光芒，半开玩笑地，她似乎对我的回答深思熟虑。“他们活跃的数量并不多，对吧？””

Again, my lips twitch. "No, so then I guess they would be _the_ pilots."  
"我的嘴角再次抽动。“是的，所以我想他们应该是飞行员。””

She crosses her legs and bounces a knee. "You'll have to forgive me if I'm a little skeptical."  
"她交叉双腿，轻轻地弹动膝盖。“如果我有点怀疑，你得原谅我。””

"You don't have to believe me," I say, finally lending her that cunning smile she gave me earlier. Kei bites her lower lip to stifle a giggle, sliding her hair back. She looks away, out to the highway. A flock of cranes flies over the water.  
"你不必相信我，"我终于回以她早先那狡黠的微笑。圭咬着下唇忍住笑意，将头发向后捋去。她转头望向高速公路。一群鹤在水面上空飞过。

"My grandad used to tell me stories," she says after they become distant. "He lived on the outskirts of Gotenba in one of the mountain temples."  
"我爷爷以前常给我讲故事，"她等它们远去后说道，"他住在御殿场郊外的一座山寺里。"

"There was one battle, before Tokyo-three was destroyed by the other Angels. He said the Eva nearly landed on his house, so close he could feel the heat from its armor and the arms of the Angel. They were made of energy, or light. They cut through buildings like butter and the Eva grasped them to keep it at bay, wrestling the giant. My grandfather said he could see the Eva's skin ooze and bubble. It threw the Angel down the mountain and, with nothing but a small blade, cut through its heart. For a while there was the imprint of a giant left in the mountain side. He said nothing really grew there after that."  
"在第三新东京市被其他使徒摧毁之前，有一次战斗。他说 EVA 差点砸到他的房子，近得他能感受到其装甲的热量和使徒的手臂。那些手臂由能量或光构成，如同切黄油般穿透建筑物，而 EVA 则紧握它们以阻止其逼近，与巨人搏斗。我爷爷说他能看到 EVA 的皮肤渗出并冒泡。它将使徒摔下山，仅凭一把小刀，刺穿了其心脏。那段时间，山腰上留下了一个巨大的印记。他说那之后那里几乎什么也没再长出来。"

When she looks back and softens, I realize I've been staring. Watching the sway of her hair and the way her hands move through them. How dark but bright her eyes are all at once. I look elsewhere.  
当她回首并露出柔和的神情时，我才意识到自己一直在凝视。注视着她发丝的摇曳，以及双手穿梭其中的姿态。她的眼睛如何同时显得深邃又明亮。我移开了视线。

"Which ones?" “哪些？”

The question startles me and I turn back. Her heels click against one another.  
这个问题让我一惊，我转回身。她的高跟鞋相互敲击着。

"Which ones did your mother and father pilot?" Kei asks.  
“你父母驾驶的是哪几架？” 圭问道。

"Unit-two was my mother's. Unit-one was my father's."  
“二号机是我母亲的。一号机是我父亲的。”

Examining her shoes, boots with loose strings, she nods, but says nothing more. We pass forests of thousand year old cedars. Overgrown societies of Sakhalin spruces, Sakhalin firs, blue firs, and Yezo spruces mixed with broadleaved birches, oaks, and maples. Beneath them is a dense undergrowth of mosses and lichens. Kei points out a deer watching us.  
她低头检查着自己的鞋子，一双鞋带松散的靴子，点了点头，但没有再说什么。我们穿过一片千年古杉林。茂密的萨哈林云杉、萨哈林冷杉、蓝冷杉和北海道冷杉与阔叶的桦树、橡树和枫树交织在一起。它们下面是茂密的苔藓和地衣。圭指着一只正在观察我们的鹿。

It's not until we rove through old Tokyo that my visions of scorched earth become real. There are little hand crafted monuments all along the outskirts of the road as we pass into what the orthodoxy brands holy ground, left by other pilgrims who've made the journey. Mostly wicker figurines and crosses of varying size. A crooked graveyard that goes on for miles as far as I can see.  
直到我们漫步于旧东京，我对焦土的幻想才变得真实。随着我们进入正统教义所称的圣地，沿途的外围布满了小巧的手工纪念碑，这些都是其他朝圣者留下的。大多是大小不一的柳条人像和十字架。在我视线所及之处，有一片歪歪扭扭的墓地绵延数英里。

Henmei stops and we climb out, joints aching. A light drizzle starts to come down, tickling my neck and dashing the water with ripples along the beach, just down the hill from where we are. Further off, I can see shadows protruding from the waves. Not buildings. In fact, they look more like crosses.  
姮美停下脚步，我们爬出车外，关节隐隐作痛。细雨开始飘落，轻拂我的脖颈，海面上泛起涟漪，就在我们所在的小山脚下。更远处，我能看到波浪中凸起的影子。不是建筑物。实际上，它们看起来更像十字架。

"What are those?" “那些是什么？”

Henmei, hanging out of the driver side door with his pistol, shrugs. "No one's really sure. Bigwigs say they're just dead Evas. Shin Seiki say they're the remains of an old god, or some shit like that."  
痕美从驾驶座车门探出身子，手里握着枪，耸了耸肩。“没人真的确定。大人物们说它们只是死去的 EVA。新世纪派说它们是某个古老神明的遗骸，或者类似的东西。”

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

"It was the last battle of the war, I think."  
“我想，那是战争的最后一战。”

Kei latches onto her right arm. "The Red Sacrament," she says, her gaze speaking volumes greater.  
凯紧紧抓住她的右臂。“红色圣礼，”她说，目光中蕴含着更深远的意义。

The hush of the waves is much louder here, like in Panama. There are wooden posts, maybe the remains of homes or a dock, jutting along the beach. They trickle up the hill, where I can see the imprint of tank treads left in the dirt.  
海浪的静谧在这里显得格外响亮，就像在巴拿马一样。海滩上矗立着木桩，或许是房屋或码头的遗迹，沿着海岸线蜿蜒而上。它们延伸至山丘，我可以看到泥土中留下的坦克履带痕迹。

My mother was here. There was a battle she fought and lost in this place. Once, she had faced monsters here too. They both had. Maybe not in this exact spot, but as close as I'll ever get. Turning, I find Kei waiting for me.  
我的母亲曾在这里。她在这片土地上战斗过，也失败过。曾经，她也在这里面对过怪物。他们两人都曾面对过。也许不是在这个确切的地方，但已经是我能接近的最近距离了。转身时，我发现圭在等我。

"Where do I go?" I ask Henmei. He points to the hill, where Chikuma has already started up into the mists crawling over the rocks, the singing of his harmonica leaving a trail for us to follow. It isn't steep, but the walk from the road is long. Henmei says we can't go through the cities to see it.  
“我该去哪儿？”我问 Henmei。他指向山丘，只见千早已经踏入岩石上缭绕的雾气中，他的口琴声为我们留下了一条追踪的路径。山坡并不陡峭，但从公路走来的路途却很漫长。Henmei 说我们不能穿过城市去看它。

"Too many falling buildings. That and the squatters. Sometimes you find more than just rabid packs of dogs."  
太多倒塌的建筑了。还有那些非法占据者。有时候你找到的不只是狂吠的狗群。

So he drove us out to this barren mountain side. With each step gravity becomes harsher and the air comes in thinner. Chikuma's playing gets louder, until we crest the top, finding him sitting on a boulder playing out his harmonies.  
于是他开车带我们来到这片荒凉的山坡。每走一步，重力似乎更加严酷，空气也越发稀薄。千早的演奏声越来越响，直到我们登上山顶，发现他正坐在一块巨石上，奏出和谐的旋律。

Here, the earth stops, opening up to a black, drowning maw so large the other side is hidden on its own horizon as the rim arcs out. It's like we've walked to the edge of the world, so vast and consuming my eyes sting just trying to take it all in. Vertigo hits next and no amount of blinking clears the colorless splotches away. I fall more than sit down, tingling senses needing to feel hard ground beneath me, else I might tumble in. Particles drift through the weak beams of light trying to penetrate the shadow.  
在这里，大地仿佛到了尽头，裂开成一个深邃的黑色深渊，如此巨大以至于对岸隐藏在了自己的地平线之外，边缘弧形向外延伸。我们仿佛走到了世界的边缘，如此广阔无垠，以至于我试图一览无余时眼睛都感到刺痛。接着是眩晕袭来，无论怎么眨眼都无法驱散那些无色的斑点。我与其说是坐下，不如说是跌坐下来，颤抖的感官需要感受到坚实的地面，否则我可能会跌入其中。微弱的阳光试图穿透阴影，尘埃在其中飘荡。

I understand. To some degree. I finally see the gaping void my father has been struggling to climb out of since the war ended. It howls, echoing with an emptiness that can never be filled. It ate everything and everyone whole, swallowed up my mother so she was almost never seen again. This is as deep and terrible as any scar on her arm.  
我理解，某种程度上。我终于看到了战争结束后，父亲一直在努力爬出的那个深渊。它咆哮着，回响着一种永远无法填补的空虚。它吞噬了一切，吞没了我的母亲，以至于她几乎再也没有出现过。这就像她手臂上任何一道深邃而可怕的伤疤。

This is eternal, unmistakable proof of their struggle here.  
这是他们在这里挣扎的永恒而明确的证明。

Something warm glides down to touch my lips.  
有什么温暖的东西滑落，触碰到了我的嘴唇。

Kei wraps her arms around me from behind and starts to sing. I don't know the song, but the words tell a story about a girl who carries a baby over a mountain dawn to dusk at the behest of a noble lord, wishing for the day she can finally go home.  
圭从背后环抱住我，开始唱起歌来。我不熟悉这首歌，但歌词讲述了一个女孩遵照贵族的命令，从早到晚背着婴儿翻山越岭，期盼着有一天能回家的故事。

When my tears stop, and her song has run its course, she kneels beside me, urn in hand. She twists the top off and stares into the blackness. The weight on her thoughts is darker than any pit. Heavier than any ocean. A foreigner like me on an island far away.  
当我的泪水止住，她的歌声也已结束，她跪在我身旁，手中捧着骨灰坛。她拧开盖子，凝视着里面的黑暗。她心中的重担比任何深渊都要深沉，比任何海洋都要沉重。就像我这个异乡人，身处遥远的岛屿。

Lifting her head, Kei tosses the ashes free.  
圭抬起头，将骨灰洒向空中。

They float away into the dark below and she hugs the urn as we watch. Long enough for the clouds to sweep the sun away and darken with rain. Long enough for it to reach us as flecks of snow, a damp kind of cold that soaks the earth and never dries out. The kind that freezes your hands and feet off.  
它们飘入下方的黑暗中，她紧紧抱着骨灰盒，我们一同凝视。时间久到足以让云层遮蔽阳光，因雨水而变得昏暗。久到足以让它们化作雪花般的碎屑，带来一种湿冷的寒意，浸透大地，永不干涸。那种寒冷能冻僵你的手脚。

Kei doesn't move as I stand, still gazing into this abyss created by war.  
当我起身时，圭一动不动，依旧凝视着这场战争所造就的深渊。

When I hold out my hand to her, she contemplates it as though it is some otherwordly object, attached to a strange, alien thing with a human likeness. When our eyes meet, she seems to make a decision. With unsure fingers, she takes my hand.  
当我向她伸出手时，她仿佛在审视一件异界之物，连接着一个有着人类外貌的奇异生物。当我们的目光相遇，她似乎做出了决定。带着不确定的手指，她握住了我的手。

Chikuma, our quiet witness, leads us back down.  
千岁，我们沉默的见证者，引领我们返回山下。

"I come every year to play songs for my mother," he says. Without him I'm sure me and Kei would've been lost on this mountain side. She stares at the ground as we walk.  
"每年我都会来这里为母亲演奏歌曲，"他说道。没有他，我和慧肯定早已在这山腰迷失方向。她一边走一边凝视着地面。

"My father died when I was eleven," he continues, never once looking back. "Two years later, mom came all the way out here to the crater and threw herself in. I wonder how long it took her to reach the bottom?"  
"我十一岁时父亲去世了，"他继续说着，从未回头。"两年后，母亲来到这里，径直跳进了火山口。我在想，她到底花了多长时间才到达底部？"

Neither of us has an answer and he doesn't expect one.  
我们俩都没有答案，他也不期待有答案。

"She used to like it when I played."  
“她以前喜欢听我弹琴。”

Kei, fixing to the slim red arc creeping through the gray-blue sky as she looks up, nods. "I'm sure part of her still does."  
看着天边渐渐染上灰蓝中的一抹细红，Kei 点头道：“我相信她心里仍有那份喜爱。”

Henmei is leaning against the rear of his truck, patiently awaiting our return. The engine gurgles as we board and before we leave, Kei hesitates, setting her grandfather's urn down by the side of the road. I help her in when she runs back. Chikuma falls asleep on the return trip, while me and Kei watch a crater called Tokyo-3 disappear on the horizon.  
边见正靠在他的卡车后部，耐心等待我们归来。我们上车时，引擎咕噜作响，启程前，圭犹豫了一下，将她祖父的骨灰盒放在路边。她跑回来时，我扶她上车。返回途中，筑摩睡着了，而我与圭则望着名为第三新东京市的巨大坑洞在视野中消失。

As we come in range of Fukushima and civilization, my phone starts to chirp with delayed messages and missed calls. Most are from my father.  
当我们接近福岛和文明地带时，我的手机开始响起延迟的消息和未接来电。大部分来自我的父亲。

I dial and he picks up before the first ring.  
我拨打电话，他在第一声铃响前就接了起来。

"Kazuya?" "和也？"

"Dad? What's wrong?" "爸爸？怎么了？"

"You need to come home. It's your mother."  
"你得回家。是你妈妈的事。"

### Chapter 18: December 27

In my dreams, we have a different life.  
在我的梦中，我们过着另一种生活。

Sitting on my father's shoulders I can brush the tops of the sea grape trees, round leaves arcing over the boardwalk and painting it with jagged patches of shade. He lets me down when we reach the sand so I can race him over the dunes, while mother calls for us to watch for sand burs. The sun is burning on the beach, each step more stinging than the last. We don't care.  
坐在父亲的肩膀上，我能够触及海葡萄树的顶端，圆形的叶子在木板路上方弯曲，用锯齿状的阴影点缀着它。当我们到达沙滩时，他让我下来，这样我就可以在沙丘上与他赛跑，而母亲则呼唤我们要小心沙刺。阳光在海滩上灼烧，每一步都比上一步更刺痛。我们不在乎。

I beat my dad to the pier, built atop granite shards of boulder, coated with barnacles where the water laps between them. He's taller and bigger than me, so climbs up faster. He leans over and pulls me to the surface of the sun-blazed rocks. Stingrays skirt the edges by the shallows, where it's cooler. Laying flat, we dip our hands in, fingers gliding over their smooth spines as they sail by to greet us. I warn him about their barbed stingers, which I have just learned about in school. But he tells me not to worry, because he knows the rays. They're gentle, and wouldn't let us touch them if they didn't want to.  
我比父亲先到达码头，它建在花岗岩碎片的巨石上，水流在它们之间轻拍，覆盖着藤壶。他比我高，比我大，所以爬得更快。他俯身将我拉到阳光炙烤的岩石表面。黄貂鱼在较凉爽的浅水边缘游弋。我们平躺着，将手伸入水中，手指滑过它们光滑的脊背，它们游过来向我们致意。我警告他关于它们的倒刺，这是我刚在学校学到的。但他告诉我不用担心，因为他了解这些黄貂鱼。它们很温和，如果不想让我们触摸，就不会让我们靠近。

Mother lounges just out of the water's reach, hair tied up and silver sunglasses shielding her eyes – so she can watch us comb the shallows for shells. She catches me as I run up, taking the small shell I've found just for her. I have picked it because it's the same shade as her hair.  
母亲坐在离水边不远的地方，头发束起，银色太阳镜遮住了她的眼睛——这样她就能看着我们在浅滩上寻找贝壳。我跑向她时，她接过了我特意为她找到的小贝壳。我之所以选择它，是因为它的颜色和她头发的颜色一样。

"It's nice, but I have nowhere to put it," she says.  
“很漂亮，但我没地方放，”她说。

"I'll find more and make you a necklace," I say, and her tenderness deepens a little more.  
“我会找到更多，给你做条项链，”我说，她的温柔又加深了一些。

"What if I want just this one? What will you make the necklace out of?" she asks. Not because it concerns her, rather, she just likes to hear my answers.  
“如果我就想要这一个呢？你会用什么来做这条项链？”她问道。并非因为她真的关心，而是她喜欢听我的回答。

I pause. "I'll become a deep sea diver and find you the biggest, prettiest pearls."  
我顿了顿。“我会成为一名深海潜水员，为你找到最大、最漂亮的珍珠。”

I grab her hand, and hook her pinky with mine. There are no scars on her arm, and I make my childish promise.  
我抓住她的手，用我的小指勾住她的小指。她的手臂上没有伤疤，我许下了孩子气的承诺。

Father crunches up from behind, kneeling on the towel beside her. He's just taken a dive in the sea, bits of it dribbling from his hair.  
父亲从后面弯腰过来，跪在她旁边的毛巾上。他刚从海里跳出来，头发上还滴着水珠。

"Go away, you're all wet!" Mother cries, laughing. He weaves his fingers through her hair, part because he knows she hates the wetness on her ears, part because he likes the feel of her hair. She whines, but with a smile, and he kisses the top of her head.  
“走开，你浑身都湿透了！”母亲笑着喊道。他用手指穿过她的头发，一部分是因为他知道她讨厌水滴进耳朵，一部分是因为他喜欢她头发的触感。她抱怨着，但脸上带着笑，他亲吻了她的头顶。

I want to go out into the waves with him too. I want to see how far and how deep we can go. I'm not afraid. Mother snags me before I do, rubbing more sunscreen to my back. She comes out into the water with us. We go far, all the way to a waiting sandbar, where the waves are clear again and we can stand so it's only up to our waists – my shoulders. The current carried us way down the shoreline, but we know where we are.  
我也想和他一起冲进海浪中。我想看看我们能走多远，能潜多深。我不害怕。母亲在我行动前抓住了我，又在我的背上涂了些防晒霜。她跟着我们一起走进水里。我们走得很远，一直到了一个等待着的沙洲，那里海浪再次变得清澈，我们可以站立，水只到我们的腰部——我的肩膀。海流把我们带到了海岸线的远处，但我们知道自己在哪里。

Back at our teal towel, underneath the shade of an umbrella, we lie down and I fall asleep between them as the sun takes me away into the sky. We sleep and nothing wakes us.  
回到我们的青色毛巾上，在遮阳伞的阴影下，我们躺下，我在他们之间入睡，阳光将我带入天空。我们沉睡，没有任何事物唤醒我们。

In my dreams, the war never happened.  
在我的梦中，战争从未发生。

Even as the airplane skirts the surface of the tarmac, I can't shake off that blanket of sun, or the easy give of the sand. Arizona has been covered in a blur of white. The frozen rain comes down in thick, wet sheets, sinking a damp and numbing cold into the red earth. A heavy ceiling of gray clouds still pours it down, and doesn't look like it intends to stop.  
即使飞机掠过跑道表面，我也无法摆脱那层阳光的覆盖，或是沙子的轻松触感。亚利桑那州被一片模糊的白色所笼罩。冰冻的雨水以厚重的湿帘形式倾泻而下，将一种潮湿而麻木的寒冷渗入红土之中。厚重的灰色云层依旧倾泻着雨水，看起来并不打算停止。

I ease into my seat, letting everyone pass by. The dream fades to nothing but icy winds, gone from my grasp, try as I might to recall them. It feels familiar, like a dream I've had before. Part of it, I think, is from a memory.  
我缓缓坐下，任由众人从身旁经过。梦境渐渐消散，只剩下冰冷的寒风，尽管我竭力想要回忆，它们却已从指尖溜走。这感觉似曾相识，仿佛是曾经做过的梦。我想，其中一部分源自一段记忆。

Memory has always been a sad sort of thing to me. Not because of the hurt that it tends to keep, but because of how intangible and fleeting it is. I can walk down Tucson's streets, tell you what I did and where, remember the faces with me, what they said. They're nothing special, and I can recall them easier than anything else I might have thought more important. Things that should have been more deeply carved.  
记忆对我而言，总是带着一丝哀愁。并非因为其中常存的伤痛，而是因为它如此虚无缥缈、转瞬即逝。我可以在图森的街道上漫步，告诉你我做了什么、去了哪里，记得那些与我同在的面孔，他们说了什么。这些并不特别，我回忆起来比任何我认为更重要的事情都要容易。那些本应更深刻铭刻的事物。

Memory is weak, when you look at it. Memory is just neurons – touch, smell, sight – bunched together in sequence. They fire, recreating the sensation that forged them, summoning shadows and vague impressions.  
记忆，当你审视它时，显得脆弱。记忆不过是神经元——触觉、嗅觉、视觉——按顺序聚集在一起。它们激发，重现塑造它们的感觉，召唤出阴影和模糊的印象。

Every time I smell cigarettes, a hundred different bundles fire. The images follow me out of the airport and down the street, guiding my senses away from the biting freeze. I think I have it then, the moment from my dream, with my mother. How much of it is real, I can't say anymore. Sometimes the synapses repeat so often, they lose their vibrancy, like a painting cracking and fading over time.  
每次闻到香烟的味道，无数记忆片段便如火花般闪现。这些画面引领我走出机场，沿着街道前行，让我的感官远离刺骨的寒冷。我想我捕捉到了那个梦境中的瞬间，与母亲在一起的时刻。其中有多少是真实的，我已经无法分辨。有时神经元反复重放，它们便失去了鲜活，如同随着时间开裂褪色的画作。

It was afternoon, on the edge of twilight. The sun was at that perfect precipice where it melted away into everything around us, casting it all in gold and heat. Gnats dance beyond the screened windows, which were open to let the breeze in. Wind chimes coo in the sunset, bells signaling the close of day. Humid, sunny Florida.  
那是黄昏时分，夕阳正处在那完美的临界点，渐渐融入四周，将一切都镀上金辉和暖意。蚊虫在纱窗外飞舞，窗户敞开以迎接微风。风铃在夕阳中轻鸣，铃声宣告着白昼的结束。闷热而阳光明媚的佛罗里达。

Sitting at the kitchen table, my mother stares down the road that leads to the coast. Father has taken his truck out to the beach again. One hand has a cigarette, and the other props her chin, mind somewhere far and secluded. So wrapped in thought the world around her might as well be imagined. Her hair is just a little longer than it was last year. She's let it grow some. My mother is beautiful.  
坐在厨房桌前，母亲凝视着通往海岸的道路。父亲又开着卡车去了海滩。她一手夹着香烟，另一手托着下巴，思绪飘向遥远而幽静的地方。如此沉浸在思绪中，周围的世界仿佛都成了想象。她的头发比去年稍长了一些。她让它长了一些。我的母亲很美。

Filling her eyes again, she turns, and when she looks at me, it's as if the mere sight of me fills some missing piece in her. It's hard to see her face, cast in shadow by the fading light. But with just a look, I know that I am loved more than I will ever understand.  
泪水再次盈满她的眼眶，她转身望向我，那一刻，仿佛我的存在填补了她心中缺失的一角。夕阳的余晖将她的面庞笼罩在阴影中，难以看清。但仅是一瞥，我便明白，这份爱超越了我所能理解的范畴。

I jump into the chair next to her, my feet dangling. There's a green lizard on the window. Another memory hazes to the surface.  
我跳进她旁边的椅子，双脚悬空晃荡。窗上趴着一只绿色的蜥蜴。一段模糊的记忆随之浮现。

I'd found one once, on a broad leaf by the grapefruit bunches. Mom was picking them from the tree, stretching on the tips of her toes to hook them in a small basket atop a ten-foot pole. The spotted bark scraped up my feet as I came down, this new creature caught in my hand. Mother's cheeks were flushed, even with the straw hat to shade her.  
曾有一次，我在一串葡萄柚旁的宽大叶片上发现了一只。妈妈正从树上摘取它们，踮起脚尖，用一根十英尺长的杆子顶端的小篮子勾住果实。我走下时，树皮上的斑点刮伤了我的脚，而手中这只新奇的小生物被我紧紧握住。母亲的脸颊因兴奋而泛红，尽管有草帽为她遮挡阳光。

I remember she shook her head when I opened my hand to show her. "You have to let it go," she said. Without whining or pouting, I solemnly nodded my head, more sad than anything. Dad had told me how rare they were. How the brown lizards, not native to Florida, ate them.  
我记得当我张开手给她看时，她摇了摇头。“你得放它走，”她说。我没有抱怨或撅嘴，只是郑重地点了点头，心里更多的是难过。爸爸曾告诉我它们有多么稀有。那些棕色的蜥蜴，并非佛罗里达的原生物种，会吃掉它们。

The guilt in her was unmistakable. She put her hands under mine. "He'll be okay," she said, coaxing my thumbs loose, and together we watched it dart into the ferns. I never saw one again until now, thinking they were extinct.  
她内心的愧疚显而易见。她把手放在我的手下面。“它会没事的，”她说，轻轻地让我的拇指松开，我们一起看着它窜进了蕨丛中。直到现在，我再也没有见过一只，以为它们已经灭绝了。

I wonder then if it's the same one we let go?  
我在想，那会不会就是我们放走的那一只呢？

Mother stares at me, appearing to track each muscle and bit of hair, as though trying to etch every line to a memory. One of her hands opens up to me on the table.  
母亲凝视着我，仿佛在追踪每一块肌肉和每一丝发丝，试图将每一条纹路刻入记忆。她的一只手在桌上向我展开。

"What would make you happy – right now?" she asks.  
“什么会让你现在感到快乐？”她问道。

At first, I don't answer, giving her question considerable thought. I play with her hand on the table, then reach for the other. She gives it and I try to enclose both of them in my small ones. My mouth moves, but I can't hear my own voice.  
起初，我没有回答，认真思考她的问题。我玩弄着她在桌上的手，然后去握另一只。她递给我，我试图用我小小的手包裹住它们。我的嘴动了动，却听不见自己的声音。

"Are you sure that's enough?" she asks.  
"你确定这样就够了？" 她问道。

I nod and shake her hands to punctuate. She moves them, playing with my fingers. Then she smiles. I can always make her smile. She hooks a pinky with mine.  
我点头并用她的手来强调。她移动双手，玩弄着我的手指。然后她笑了。我总能让她笑。她用小指勾住我的。

"Then it's a promise." "那这就是个承诺了。"

The hospital is too quiet when I enter. Too empty. Every hall is lighted, cast in clean radiance. If not for the clerk at the front desk, I'd have assumed the place was deserted. Each footstep sounds louder than the last.  
我走进医院时，这里静得过分，空荡荡的。每条走廊都灯火通明，洒下一片洁净的光辉。要不是前台有职员在，我几乎以为这地方已经废弃了。每走一步，脚步声都比前一步更响亮。

Memory is fragile. 记忆是脆弱的。

It doesn't matter how long my parents have been together. Or even how early they became so close. Soon my father's brain won't be able to sustain the neurons that hold his memories together. Soon, he'll forget she ever existed in his world. I nearly put her, both of them, out of mine, and I'm not the one with dementia.  
无论我父母在一起多久，甚至他们有多早就开始亲密无间，这些都不重要了。很快，我父亲的脑海将无法维持那些维系记忆的神经元。很快，他会忘记她曾存在于他的世界里。我差点也将他们从我的世界中抹去，而我并不是那个患有痴呆症的人。

What will people think of them in a hundred years time? Who will remember them? Will they see a pair of broken people, doing the best they could in a world that threw them to the wayside? Or will they see a man and woman who, against all odds, despite their suffering, built a home?  
一百年后，人们会如何看待他们？谁还会记得他们？他们会看到一对被世界抛弃、竭尽全力挣扎的破碎之人吗？还是会看到一对男女，尽管历经苦难，却依然在逆境中筑起了家园？

The thought locks me stiff at her door. Room 222.  
这个念头让我在她门前僵住了。222 号房间。

Her eyes are closed when I enter.  
我进去时，她的眼睛是闭着的。

I almost don't see my father sitting at her bedside, head bowed. He's just as late to notice me at the door, turning slowly and staring like I've just walked out of a dream. I feel like I have. I've been drowning in that pit named Tokyo-3 for so long, forgetting the good memories I had under the pile of black ones. The only ones I really kept.  
我几乎没注意到父亲坐在她床边，头低垂着。他同样晚了一步才注意到我在门口，缓缓转过头来，仿佛我刚从梦中走出来。我感觉自己确实如此。我在那个名为东京-3 的深渊里沉溺了太久，遗忘了那些美好的记忆，被一堆黑色的记忆掩埋。只有那些，我真正保留的。

The Eva's shadow is long and dark.  
Eva 的影子又长又暗。

Mother's hair is still its bright tint of orange-red, fighting the bland, colorless landscape outside her window. She's so very still. At rest, it looks like. I step up to her bedside, a hand on my father's shoulder. Her chest rises softly.  
母亲的头发依旧是那明亮的橙红色，与窗外单调无色的景象形成鲜明对比。她静止不动，仿佛在休息。我走到她床边，一只手搭在父亲的肩上。她的胸膛轻轻起伏。

Later, she'll say, "I told him not to call you back. I told him I was fine. It was just chest pains this time." but now, she opens her eyes. They flutter and find me, and I know that she's been waiting for me. Like she promised.  
后来，她会说：“我告诉他不要给你回电话。我告诉他我没事。这次只是胸口疼。”但现在，她睁开了眼睛。眼帘轻颤，找到了我，我知道她一直在等我。就像她承诺的那样。

"Hey, mom," I say, soft as I come closer, touching her hand. "I'm here... I'm home."  
“嘿，妈妈，”我轻声说道，走近时触摸她的手。“我在这里...我回家了。”

I lean over the bed and take her in my arms. She seems so much smaller than I remember. At first, her movements are heavy with sleep, but soon she clings tight to me. I know not everything is healed. There are still ugly words and twisted emotions I can't ever take back. Scars too deep to be closed. But I don't have to live in them anymore. I can cross the waters out to that sandbar. I can leave the Evas and their war in the sea.  
我俯身在床边，将她拥入怀中。她似乎比记忆中瘦小了许多。起初，她的动作因困倦而沉重，但很快她就紧紧抱住了我。我知道并非一切都已痊愈。那些丑陋的话语和扭曲的情感，我无法收回。伤痕太深，无法愈合。但我不再需要生活在其中。我可以跨越水域，到达那片沙洲。我可以离开 Eva 们和它们在海上的战争。

Mother holds me, chasing the cold away. Father watches us with his gentle, but bright smile, like in my dreams. Neither of us let go, and I feel the wetness on her cheeks as she buries her face in my neck.  
母亲拥抱着我，驱散了寒冷。父亲用他那温柔而明亮的微笑注视着我们，就像在我梦中一样。我们谁也没有放手，我能感觉到她脸颊上的湿润，她将脸埋在我的脖颈间。

"Welcome home." “欢迎回家。”

### Epilogue

Asuka Marie Amemiya was in charge of holding the flowers. Just this morning she had seen to their selection, inspecting each petal for rot and blemishes. Only the healthiest would do.  
明日香·玛丽·雨宫负责捧着花束。就在今早，她还亲自挑选了这些花，仔细检查每一片花瓣是否有腐烂或瑕疵。只有最健康的花才能入选。

As the railcar squealed into its station, the round sun flowers fell on her face and she fumbled as they boarded, caught by mama's hand on her back. Asuka sneezed, hearing one of her soft chuckles as she tried to wipe her nose, and then they were off.  
当轨道车尖叫着驶入车站时，向日葵的圆脸映在她的脸上，她手忙脚乱地上了车，被妈妈的手轻轻扶住后背。明日香打了个喷嚏，听到妈妈轻声的笑，她试图擦鼻子，随后他们便出发了。

She had only been to Hokkaido a handful of times, that she could remember at least. The cherry trees were bare this time of year in Japan's numbing, white winters – nothing like papa's home back in Arizona. More like the winters in Scotland, where mama took her to see Les and Marie. That's where her middle name came from. Papa joked that he and mama had flipped a coin for what her first would be.  
她记得自己只去过北海道几次。在日本这冰冷、白雪皑皑的冬季，此时的樱花树光秃秃的——与亚利桑那州的爸爸家大相径庭。倒更像苏格兰的冬天，妈妈曾带她去那里看望莱斯和玛丽。她的中间名就源自那里。爸爸开玩笑说，他和妈妈为了决定她的第一个名字，还掷了硬币。

She was visiting her other grandparents today, riding the elevated railways that stretched from Furano along the three Daisetsuzan mountains, all the way to the sprawl of Kamikawa. It was over an hour to ride from one end to the other.  
今天她要去拜访另一边的祖父母，乘坐从富良野延伸至大雪山三座山脉的高架铁路，一路直达铺展的上川町。从一端到另一端，乘车需要一个多小时。

Asuka clambered into the seat by the window, where she could watch the snowfall through the forest of marble markers, as if growing to touch the blue sky above. Mama sat on the row behind her, taking her golden orange hair and twining it as they lurched off. Papa settled next to Asuka, watching out the window with her. His black jacket complained as he shifted. It had belonged to his dad a long time ago and still smelled like him too, a bit like coffee musk and dirt. There was a big 01 on the back, and on the shoulder it said _Proud Angel Fighter_. Some of the other passengers nodded to him as they passed.  
明日香爬进靠窗的座位，那里她可以透过大理石墓碑的森林观赏雪花飘落，仿佛它们在生长，试图触及头顶的蓝天。妈妈坐在她后面一排，拿起她金橙色的头发编织着，随着车子颠簸前行。爸爸在明日香旁边坐下，与她一同望向窗外。他移动时，那件黑色夹克发出抱怨声。这件夹克很久以前属于他爸爸，至今仍散发着他的气息，有点像咖啡和泥土的味道。背后印着一个大大的 01，肩部写着“骄傲的天使战士”。其他乘客经过时，有些人向他点头致意。

"You look so much like your grandma," papa said, and Asuka shook her head free of mama's hands, feeling a bit self conscious. He said it often and, much as it embarrassed her sometimes, she never got tired of hearing it. She was ten years old now, but could still hear him saying how proud she should be when she was just a little girl. A boy had made her cry at school, and when papa came to pick her up, she'd been too ashamed to tell him why. She'd asked him if there was something wrong with her name, and he had looked betrayed.  
“你看起来真像你奶奶，”爸爸说，明日香摇摇头摆脱妈妈的手，感到有些不好意思。他经常这么说，尽管有时会让她尴尬，但她从不厌倦听他这么说。她现在十岁了，但仍能记得他曾说，当她还是个小女孩时，她应该感到多么骄傲。在学校，一个男孩让她哭了，当爸爸来接她时，她因为羞愧没有告诉他原因。她问他，她的名字是不是有什么问题，他看起来像是受到了背叛。

"Why would you think that?"  
“你为什么会这么想？”

Asuka had taken her hand away from his, wishing she could wipe that look from his face. They were quiet for a while, and papa slowed his pace so she could keep up. Eventually, she reached for his hand again, and sensed him relax. They went off the road a bit, perking her interest. Finding a budding cactus, papa handed her a plastic bag from his back pocket and she held it open as he started to pluck the prickly pears from their needly thrones. She had tried to do it without gloves, like him, and had ended up with a handful of tiny thorns. At home they would make juice out of them, and Asuka struggled to hide her delight at the prospect, already tasting the bubblegum and watermelon sweetness.  
明日香把手从他的手中抽离，希望自己能抹去他脸上的那种表情。他们沉默了一会儿，爸爸放慢了脚步，以便她能跟上。最终，她再次伸出手去握住他的手，感觉到他放松了下来。他们偏离了道路，这引起了她的兴趣。发现了一株正在生长的仙人掌，爸爸从后口袋里掏出一个塑料袋递给她，她打开袋子，他开始从带刺的王座上摘下刺梨。她曾试图像他一样不戴手套去摘，结果手里扎满了小刺。在家里，他们会用这些刺梨做成果汁，明日香努力掩饰着对这一前景的喜悦，仿佛已经尝到了泡泡糖和西瓜的甜味。

"Your grandpa and grandma saved the world. Did you know that?" he glanced back.  
“你的爷爷奶奶拯救了世界。你知道吗？”他回头看了一眼。

"They did?" she asked, still a bit cross with him. She swayed on her feet.  
“他们真的做到了吗？”她问道，仍然对他有些不满。她摇摇晃晃地站着。

"Yes, many times." “是的，很多次。”

He dropped a few pears in her bag. "When?"  
他往她的包里放了几个梨。“什么时候？”

Papa gave his answer some thought, trying to find it in his search for pears. That boy told her she had a war criminal's name. That's what his daddy said. So she'd scratched his face and called him a liar.  
爸爸认真思考了一下他的回答，试图在寻找梨的过程中找到答案。那个男孩告诉她，她的名字听起来像一个战犯的名字。那是他爸爸说的。所以她抓伤了他的脸，并骂他是骗子。

"A long time ago," he finally said. "When they were very young. Beings called Angels came to Earth and your grandparents fought them."  
"很久以前，" 他终于说道，"那时他们还很年轻。被称为天使的存在降临地球，你的祖父母与他们战斗。"

A war with angels? Asuka had heard of that somewhere before. Later, when she was old enough for the third grade, she would learn about what that was – and how easily she had confused it with stories about the Catholics and their new gods.  
与天使的战争？明日香曾在某处听说过。后来，当她长大到上三年级时，她会了解到那是什么——以及她曾多么轻易地将它与关于天主教及其新神的故事混淆。

"How?" was all she could ask.  
"怎么做到的？" 她只能这样问。

"With their machines," papa said, the bag growing heavy. "Giant machines as tall as skyscrapers." he cursed as a needle sliced his thumb at the crease, sucking at the blood. Asuka offered to kiss it, since that's what mama always did for her cuts and bruises. She knew it didn't actually make them feel better, but it made him smile again.  
"用他们的机器，"爸爸说道，袋子越来越重。"巨大的机器，高耸如摩天大楼。"他咒骂着，一根针在褶皱处划破了他的拇指，他吮吸着流出的血。明日香提出要亲吻它，因为那是妈妈总是为她处理伤口和瘀伤的方式。她知道这并不能真正让他们感觉好些，但那让他再次微笑了。

Tracking back home, he brought her up on his shoulders, bag of prickly pears in one hand and her right ankle in another.  
他扛着她往家走，一手提着装满刺梨的袋子，另一只手握着她的右脚踝。

"What happened?" she asked, diving into his lengthy black hair as she leaned over his head. "How did they win?"  
"发生了什么？"她问道，俯身钻进他那浓密的黑发中。"他们是怎么赢的？"

"One day, when you're older, I'll tell you the story. It was an ugly war, and they went through a lot of terrible things."  
"有一天，等你长大了，我会告诉你那个故事。那是一场丑陋的战争，他们经历了许多可怕的事情。"

"What kind of things?" "什么样的事情？"

"Things no one should ever have to go through. But they were strong, your grandma and grandpa. Even when they didn't want to be. So there's nothing wrong with your name." Papa sounded so proud when he said it.  
"那些不该有人经历的事情。但他们很坚强，你的奶奶和爷爷。即使他们不想坚强的时候。所以你的名字没有错。" 爸爸说这话时听起来非常自豪。"

Now six years older, Asuka didn't have many memories of her grandparents. They were feelings and smells more than anything. But papa always told her how grandma would fuss over her. When he used to visit her while Asuka was away with mama, and grandma would say, "Just you? Where is my little Marie?"  
如今已经六岁，明日香对祖父母记忆寥寥。那些记忆更多是感觉和气味，而非具体事物。但爸爸总是告诉她，祖母是如何宠爱她的。每当他去探望她，而明日香则和妈妈在一起时，祖母总会问：“就你一个人吗？我的小玛丽呢？”

He told her how grandpa used to care for his garden and how he had gentle hands not accustomed to fighting, and how she had fallen in love with his roses. Papa told her a lot of stories about them, as many as he could and as often as he could. Some were happy, some were strange and most were sad. But she always listened, because papa said stories were important. "They last forever," he said, "even when memory starts to fade and there is nothing left to remember but the story."  
他告诉她，祖父是如何照料他的花园，他的手是多么温柔，不习惯争斗，以及她是如何爱上他的玫瑰花。爸爸给她讲了许多关于他们的故事，尽可能多，尽可能频繁。有些故事快乐，有些奇怪，而大多数都很悲伤。但她总是倾听，因为爸爸说故事很重要。“它们会永远流传，”他说，“即使记忆开始模糊，除了故事，再无其他可回忆。”

Boots clapped to a stop by their seats, and Asuka took in a man almost as tall as papa, his uniform dark like the marble pillars outside. Where once the wearer might have been able to fill its edges, he appeared too thin for them now. It looked like a Marine's dress blues, but the badge insignia on his cap was a sakura cherry blossom bordered by two ivy branches instead. Between white gloved fingers he had a cigarette, the other hand rubbing the back of his head. "I'm terribly sorry, but could an old man trouble you for a light?"  
靴子在他们座位旁嘎然而止，明日香打量着一位几乎和爸爸一样高的男子，他的制服深沉如外面的石柱。曾经穿着它的人或许能撑起边缘，现在他却显得过于消瘦。这看起来像是海军陆战队的礼服蓝，但帽徽上的标志是一朵樱花，周围环绕着两枝常春藤。他夹着香烟的手指戴着白手套，另一只手挠着后脑勺。“非常抱歉，不知一位老人能否麻烦您借个火？”

Mama slid her silken black hair aside and roamed in her purse, while papa tried to hide a frown as she offered a bic lighter. She didn't smoke, not cigarettes at least – and much as they tried to hide it, Asuka knew it was the cause of some argument between them.  
妈妈轻轻拨开她那柔滑的黑色长发，在手提包里摸索，而爸爸试图掩饰眉间的皱褶，当她递出一个打火机时。她不抽烟，至少不抽香烟——尽管他们试图隐藏，明日香知道这是他们之间争执的源头之一。

The man cupped his hands and lit the bud, returning the lighter and a yellow grin with it, nudging the tip of his cap. Asuka liked the smell of cigarettes, even if the smoke stung her eyes and made her nose itch.  
男子双手拢住点燃了烟头，归还打火机时露出了黄牙的笑容，轻轻碰了碰帽檐。明日香喜欢香烟的味道，尽管烟雾刺痛了她的眼睛，让她的鼻子发痒。

"Why don't you sit?" mama said, nodding to the empty row across from them. "You must be tired."  
"为什么不坐下呢？" 妈妈说，向对面空着的一排座位点了点头。"你一定累了。"

"Thank you," he said, adjusting his overcoat and collapsing with more weight than Asuka thought possible for his wizened frame. "These old bones only get me so far."  
"谢谢，" 他说，调整了一下他的大衣，然后以一种比明日香认为他那瘦弱的身躯所能承受的更重的重量坐了下来。"这些老骨头只能带我走这么远了。"

"What's your name?" Asuka asked.  
"你叫什么名字？" 明日香问道。

"Saki. What is your name?"  
"沙希。你叫什么名字？"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"Oh? Here, let me look at you." Saki leaned forward and took a long drag from his cigarette, holding her with critical eyes. He blew the smoke away from her. Then, warming up to the idea, nodded. "Ah... yes, I see," he said, reaching out to poke two fingers by her nose. She giggled. "You have fire in your eyes."  
"哦？来，让我看看你。" 沙希向前倾身，深深吸了一口烟，用挑剔的目光打量着她。他朝她吹了一口烟，然后对这个想法感到兴趣，点了点头。"啊...是的，我明白了，"他说着，伸出手指在她鼻子旁轻轻一戳。她咯咯笑了起来。"你的眼睛里有火焰。"

Easing back, he nodded again. "My, yes. You're sure to break many hearts when you grow up, eh?"  
他放松地靠回椅背，再次点头。"哎呀，没错。等你长大了，肯定会伤透不少人的心，嗯？"

"Nuh-uh!" she cried, jumping to her feet, grip tightening around the flowers. "I won't break _any_ hearts!"  
"不！" 她喊道，跳了起来，手中的花束握得更紧了。"我不会伤任何人的心！"

His eyes widened and he gasped. "Never?"  
他的眼睛睁大了，倒吸一口气。"从不？"

"**Never** ever." "绝不。"

Saki had a rasping chuckle. "Well, that's good for you."  
沙希发出沙哑的笑声。“好吧，那对你有好处。”

Papa touched her arm, with that look that told her to behave, and she sat back down, eying mister Saki as a hand slipped into an overcoat pocket. Every so often he glanced up at her while drawing out coin rolls one by one. Quarters, dimes and nickels. Asuka quirked her head at that, content to keep her questions while he tore the paper, counting each American coin in his palm. He started with the nickels.  
爸爸轻触她的手臂，用那种让她规矩的眼神示意，她便坐了回去，目光紧盯着那位沙希先生，只见他的一只手滑进了大衣口袋。他不时抬头看她一眼，然后一个接一个地掏出硬币卷。二十五美分、十美分和五美分的硬币。明日香好奇地歪着头，尽管心中有疑问，但还是耐心等待，看着他撕开纸卷，逐一清点手中的每枚美国硬币。他先从五美分硬币开始。

She nudged her chin out. "What are those for?"  
她微微扬起下巴。“这些是干什么用的？”

"For my friends," he said, gathering the coins in one hand, metal jingling pleasantly. "We grew up in Ohio, after the Angel War."  
"为了我的朋友们，" 他说着，用一只手将硬币拢在一起，金属碰撞发出悦耳的声响。"我们在天使战争后，在俄亥俄州长大。"

"Were you in a war?" she asked.  
"你参加过战争吗？" 她问道。"

Papa hissed. "Asuka..." 爸爸低声呵斥。"明日香……"

Something of a smirk played on Saki's pockmarked face and he sent papa an easing gesture, then set his attention back on her. "Yes, I was," he said, starting to stack the nickels on the shelf of the window. "The First Sino-Balkan War."  
Saki 的麻子脸上掠过一丝得意的笑，他向爸爸做了个安抚的手势，然后又将注意力转回她身上。“是的，我参加了，”他说着，开始在窗台上堆叠起五分硬币。“第一次中巴尔干战争。”

Asuka knew that one. It had happened sometime before she was born, and she could tell anyone where it was on a map. Uncle Hiro had fought over there too. They kept a picture of him up in the hallway at home, but she had never gotten to meet him.  
明日香知道那场战争。那是在她出生前发生的，她能准确地在地图上指出它的位置。广叔叔也曾参战。家里走廊上挂着他的照片，但她从未有机会见到他。

"My grandma and grandpa were in a war too," she said, kicking her feet. "We're going to see them today."  
“我爷爷奶奶也参加过战争，”她踢着脚说，“今天我们要去看望他们。”

Each stack he made went seven high, until he started on the dimes. "Then they are very lucky to have a granddaughter such as you," he said, pausing to take his cigarette away. "If only we could all be so blessed."  
他每叠一摞就叠到七层高，直到开始叠十分硬币。“那么他们有你这样的孙女真是幸运，”他说着，停下来把香烟拿开。“如果我们都能如此受祝福就好了。”

"So who are you visiting, mister Saki?"  
“那么，您要拜访谁呢，Saki 先生？”

The tip of the bud had burned away. Saki ashed it over the floor, and took another drag. Still, his smirk was nostalgic. "Too many to name, child. Too many to name."  
烟蒂已经烧尽。Saki 将烟灰弹落在地板上，又吸了一口。然而，他的微笑仍带着怀旧之情。“多到数不清，孩子。多到数不清。”

After the dimes, he started to count the quarters and set them alongside the others, these with a slow sort of reverence. Each one he tipped to his head, closing his eyes as if in prayer, and set them with care. That was when the puzzle pieces fit – and she remembered. She'd never seen the ritual, but her Aunt Yuki had taught her what it meant. A nickel for training together at boot camp. A dime for serving with them. And a quarter – for being there when they died. Sometimes, people even left pennies if they had nothing to offer but thanks.  
在数完一角硬币后，他开始清点两角五分的硬币，并将它们与其他硬币并排放置，动作缓慢而充满敬意。每一枚他都轻触额头，闭上眼睛仿佛在祈祷，然后小心翼翼地放下。就在这时，拼图碎片合上了——她记起来了。她从未见过这个仪式，但她的姨妈雪曾经教过她这意味着什么。一枚五分硬币代表在训练营共同训练。一枚一角硬币代表与他们并肩服役。而一枚两角五分硬币——则是为了在他们牺牲时在场。有时，人们甚至会留下一分硬币，如果他们除了感谢之外别无他物可赠。

"I'd have a heart attack trying to visit them all," Saki explained, staring out the window now, wearing a softness that made him look younger. "So I sit on the railcars and watch them go by, letting the memories fill my head."  
“要一一拜访他们，我恐怕会心脏病发作，”沙希解释道，目光投向窗外，脸上的柔和让他看起来更显年轻。“所以我坐在轨道车上，看着他们经过，让回忆填满我的脑海。”

Asuka thought of what to say, so much that the clicking of the rails and the whine of the accelerators came between them. She liked to think she always knew what to say, but now she could only stare at the coins, counting them over and over. Saki must've been very lonely. The hiss of the compressors broke the spell, and the words were there for her, warmth blossoming in her heart. For a moment, she allowed papa to hold the flowers for her as they came to a stop.  
明日香思索着该说些什么，以至于轨道上的咔嗒声和加速器的嗡鸣声在他们之间回荡。她喜欢认为自己总能知道该说什么，但现在她只能盯着那些硬币，一遍又一遍地数着。咲一定是感到非常孤独。压缩机的嘶嘶声打破了魔咒，话语涌上心头，温暖在心中绽放。有那么一刻，她让爸爸替她拿着花，当他们停下来时。

"We have to go now," she said to Saki, who inclined his head. Asuka pushed herself up the armrest next to him and planted a kiss on his cheek. "Thank you for what you did."  
“我们得走了，”她对咲说道，咲点了点头。明日香推开他旁边的扶手，在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。“谢谢你所做的一切。”

He laughed. "For you, anything." Saki reached into his overcoat again. "But I think there are two soldiers more deserving of your thanks than I," he said. She held out her hand and he set two coppers in her palm. Closing her fingers around them, she nodded.  
他笑了。“为了你，什么都愿意。”咲再次把手伸进他的大衣。“但我觉得有两个士兵比你更值得感谢，”他说。她伸出手，他把两枚铜币放在她掌心。她合上手指握住它们，点了点头。

Asuka gathered the flowers up in her arms from papa, one last fleeting glance cast at the window sill. She counted fifty-two nickels, forty dimes and thirty-three quarters.  
从爸爸那里，明日香将花束揽入怀中，最后一次匆匆瞥向窗台。她数了五十二个五分镍币，四十个一角硬币和三十三个二十五分硬币。

Out on the seventeenth platform, chilled air lanced over her cheeks, speared down to her hands and over her knees. Even her deep sage green overcoat, papa's present to her last year, didn't keep the cold away. Mama wore little more than a short skirt, long-sleeved shirt and beat up varsity jacket. Both of them wondered how she could stand it. But she'd grown up in the British Isles and Glasgow's winters were much, much colder than this. On trips up there, while trudging through the pure white snow and brushing by old trees, Asuka always caught herself dreaming of papa's hometown in Florida.  
在第十七站台上，寒风刺过她的脸颊，直透双手，掠过膝盖。就连去年爸爸送她的那件深灰绿色大衣也无法抵御寒冷。妈妈只穿了一条短裙、长袖衬衫和一件破旧的校队夹克。两人都好奇她怎么能忍受。但她从小在英伦诸岛长大，格拉斯哥的冬天比这里冷得多。每次去那里，在纯白的雪地中跋涉，擦过古老的树木时，明日香总会发现自己梦想着爸爸在佛罗里达的老家。

As they worked down the steps to ground level, where the markers reached high as a forest, mama placed a hand on her back. "That was nice of you to say, Asuka."  
当他们走下台阶到达地面，那里标记林立如森林般高耸，妈妈把手放在她的背上。“你那样说真好，明日香。”

She nodded, trying to read each name as they passed, like she had done the past two years. She knew she wouldn't remember them, but it seemed respectful anyway. This time, she found her thoughts drifting, the names passing in a blur. "It might not mean much to other people – going somewhere and fighting, I mean. But... it meant something to him."  
她点点头，试图在经过时读出每个名字，就像过去两年她所做的那样。她知道自己不会记住它们，但这样做似乎仍然显得尊重。这一次，她的思绪飘散，名字在模糊中掠过。“对其他人来说，可能意义不大——我是说，去某个地方战斗。但……对他来说，这意义非凡。”

Papa made one his quiet grunts, a pleased sound. "You're right."  
爸爸发出一声轻柔的咕哝，听起来很满意。“你说得对。”

The walkways were cleared of snow, excess pushed up between the base of each pillar, just about as tall as Asuka and making her feel, as always, that they were walking through one of the trenches like in her Eastern Front books. She remembered she had been reading one about a German soldier, back at her grandparents house. There wasn't much she could recall about them, and the book hadn't made much sense at her age. Papa had said grandpa and grandma were in a war, but wouldn't tell her which one for a while yet, so she decided to find it on her own. That, and she simply liked to read, even if she didn't understand all the words.  
"走道上的积雪已被清除，多余的雪被推到每根柱子的底部，差不多和明日香一样高，让她一如既往地感觉自己仿佛走在她东部前线书籍中描述的战壕里。她记得自己曾在祖父母家读过一本关于德国士兵的书。关于那些书，她能回忆起的并不多，而且以她的年龄，那本书也很难理解。爸爸曾说过爷爷和奶奶参加过一场战争，但暂时不会告诉她是哪一场，于是她决定自己去找答案。此外，她只是喜欢阅读，即使不是所有词汇都能理解。”

Their house had been a warm place. Arizona was hot most months out of the year, but their living room possessed a firelight glow and smelled of olive oil. Papa held onto grandma's arm, whispering, though Asuka couldn't see their faces past the orange glow coloring the glass of the front door and framing them in black. She was too far to hear what they were saying too, but could see papa's pleading, and could only wonder why grandma just bowed her head, silent.  
他们的家曾是个温暖的地方。亚利桑那州大部分月份都很炎热，但他们的客厅却有着火光般的温暖，弥漫着橄榄油的香气。爸爸紧握着奶奶的手臂，低声细语，尽管明日香无法透过前门玻璃上的橙色光晕看清他们的脸，只能看到他们在黑色轮廓中被框住的身影。她离得太远，听不清他们在说什么，但能看到爸爸的恳求，只能猜测为什么奶奶只是低头不语。

"Who are you?" a gruff voice asked, but not unkind. Asuka turned to her grandpa, sitting in his big red throne. His hair was a bit gray now. In the pictures they had at home, it was still black. His eyes seemed tired too, but were soft behind his bifocals.  
“你是谁？”一个略显粗哑但并不刻薄的声音问道。明日香转向坐在红色大椅子上的爷爷。他的头发现在有些灰白。在家里的照片上，它还是黑色的。他的眼睛看起来也很疲惫，但透过双光眼镜，眼神却很柔和。

"Asuka – Asuka Marie," she said. She liked to use both names. It was the third time today he had asked her that, even though only an hour ago she'd been sitting in his lap talking about her book, and he had wondered why such a sweet girl was reading about such an awful war.  
“明日香——明日香·玛丽，”她说。她喜欢用全名。这是他今天第三次问她这个问题了，尽管一小时前她还在他的腿上谈论她的书，而他还在纳闷为什么这样一个甜美的女孩会读关于这样一场可怕的战争的书。

"Asuka?" grandpa asked. "That's a pretty name."  
"明日香？" 爷爷问道。"真是个好听的名字。"

"I know," she said, lips tight as she kicked her feet. She wished mama would come back from the porch, or that grandma would come sit with her again. They had warned her that grandpa would be this way. It hurt a little each time and she tried not to let him see. They told her there was something wrong with his brain, so he couldn't help it.  
"我知道，" 她回答，嘴唇紧抿，脚不停地踢着。她希望妈妈能从门廊回来，或者奶奶能再次过来陪她坐坐。他们之前就提醒过她，爷爷会这样。每次都让她有点受伤，但她尽量不让爷爷察觉。他们说爷爷的大脑出了问题，所以他控制不了自己。

She looked up and found grandpa grimacing.  
她抬头一看，发现爷爷正皱着眉头。

"What's wrong?" Asuka asked, hoping she hadn't done something to make it worse. His eyes were hooked to her, but didn't see her.  
"怎么了？" 明日香问道，希望自己没做什么让情况更糟的事。他的眼睛紧盯着她，却似乎并未真正看见她。

He sounded far away. "I... I remembered something, or... someone..." his brow worked, as though he'd been asked a difficult question – or given a riddle. A thought struggled to take shape, but never made its way out. Slowly, his gaze wandered the room, a bit of uncertainty pressing his lips together. She wasn't sure why everything scared him so much.  
他的声音听起来很遥远。"我...我记起了一些事，或者...某个人..."他的眉头紧锁，仿佛被问了一个难题——或是给了一个谜语。一个念头挣扎着想要成形，却始终未能表达出来。渐渐地，他的目光在房间里游移，一丝不确定让他的嘴唇紧闭。她不明白为什么一切都让他如此害怕。

"Is it happy?" "是开心的吗？"

Grandpa started. "What?" 爷爷一惊。“什么？”

The corners of her mouth hesitated, but she put on a smirk, a small one. "What you remembered. Is it happy?"  
她嘴角犹豫了一下，但还是勉强扯出一个微笑，小小的。“你记得的那些，是快乐的吗？”

He gave that some thought, then nodded. "I think so," he said, soft enough to snuff out.  
他沉思片刻，然后点点头。“我想是的，”他说，声音轻得几乎要消失。

"Well, if it makes you happy, shouldn't you smile?" she asked.  
"嗯，如果这让你开心，你难道不应该笑吗？" 她问道。

He blinked. Then his shoulders fell, and without any strain at all, Grandpa Shinji smiled too.  
他眨了眨眼。随后他的肩膀放松下来，毫不费力地，真嗣爷爷也露出了微笑。

<p align="center">Shinji Soryu 惣流真嗣<br/>2001 – 2061<br/><br/>Asuka Langley Soryu 惣流·明日香·兰格雷<br/>2001 – 2065</p>
The names and dates were etched in silver and, if not for the medals covering both marker's surface, there would've been nothing to distinguish either of them and the hundreds of other names. Some she recognized, like the Chrysanthemum and the Precious Crown, or the much older Rising Sun. Others were unfamiliar, but just as bright and ornate. She even spotted a few rank chevrons here and there – a corporal, a sergeant, even a lieutenant's bar.  
名字和日期以银色刻印，若非两块纪念碑表面覆盖的勋章，它们与数百个其他名字并无二致。有些她认得，如菊花与宝冠，或是更为古老的旭日。其他的则颇为陌生，但同样闪耀而华丽。她甚至发现了几处军衔徽章——下士、中士，甚至还有一枚少尉的肩章。

Asuka would've liked to meet the visitors and thank them for making the pillars so colorful. For a while, however, she stared high up to their peaks. Down below, her reflection was hidden inside the dark, polished stone. Going down to her knees, she set the fragile little bunches of lilacs in grandma's slot and, shifting her knees, did the same for grandpa's sunflowers.  
明日香本想见见那些访客，感谢他们把柱子装饰得如此五彩缤纷。然而，她却凝视着高耸入云的柱顶，久久不能移开视线。在下方，她的倒影被隐藏在光滑的黑色石头中。她跪下身，将那束脆弱的小紫丁香放在奶奶的位置，然后挪动膝盖，同样为爷爷的向日葵做了同样的事。

The ice was pooling through her pants and freezing her joints bit by bit, soaking her skin. But she didn't care, imagining other places and other times, as best she could – trying to invoke her grandmother's reflection in her place. Mama kneeled beside her and rolled up her right sleeve, closing her eyes and pressing two fingers to the veins at her wrist. Asuka watched her slowly trace them along the white scar that started at her middle finger and reached to her elbow, a prayer lost in the wind.  
冰水正透过她的裤子，一点点冻结她的关节，浸湿她的皮肤。但她毫不在意，尽可能地想象着其他地方和其他时光——试图在心中唤起祖母的倒影。妈妈跪在她旁边，卷起右边的袖子，闭上眼睛，用两根手指按在手腕的静脉上。明日香看着她沿着那条从中间手指延伸到肘部的白色疤痕，缓缓地描绘着，一段被风吹散的祈祷。

Mama said it was a part of her initiation, when she was only a girl like Asuka, but didn't talk about it much beyond that and the few times she visited the Tree of Glass in Memphis. Her and papa, by his own account, had debated it endlessly – since he wasn't devout in anything and thought it best that way. "But your mother, she's stubborn, and eventually... she made me see things a little differently." he didn't mention the Trinity or threaten her with the coiling serpent, like mama sometimes did when she was misbehaving. He did take them to Katsuragi shrine every so often, just on the horizon. From where they were, figures too far to make faces from ascended the steps. Red torii gates led up to it, the rooftops curling at the edges. A single, bright speck amid the monotony.  
妈妈说那是她入会仪式的一部分，那时她还只是像明日香这样的小女孩，但除此之外她很少提及，只偶尔几次提到她在孟菲斯参观过的玻璃树。她和爸爸，据他自己说，曾为此争论不休——因为他对任何事都不虔诚，认为这样最好。“但你的妈妈，她很固执，最终……她让我看待事情的方式有所不同。”他没有提到三位一体，也没有像妈妈有时对她的顽皮那样，用盘绕的蛇来威胁她。他确实偶尔会带他们去葛城神社，就在地平线上。从他们所在的地方望去，那些身影太远，看不清面容，正登上台阶。红色的鸟居门通向神社，屋顶边缘卷曲。在这单调之中，它是唯一一抹明亮的色彩。

"Do you think grandpa and grandma would have liked me?" Asuka asked as papa crouched on her left. Not as a little kid, but as she was now.  
“你觉得爷爷和奶奶会喜欢我吗？”明日香问道，爸爸蹲在她左边。不是作为小孩子，而是像她现在这样。

His incredulous smile told her he hadn't caught her meaning, and she flushed a little. "They _did_ like you," he said, reaching for a pocket. "Grandpa got to hold you when you were just a baby, and grandma couldn't get enough of you."  
他那难以置信的微笑告诉她，他没有领会她的意思，她微微脸红。“他们确实喜欢你，”他说着，伸手去掏口袋。“爷爷在你还是个婴儿的时候抱过你，而奶奶对你爱不释手。”

Asuka tilted her head a little. She had blurry memories of a woman in a hospital bed, sitting up and looking at her with a tired smile, flowers sagging in a vase on the window sill.  
明日香微微侧头。她模糊地记得医院病床上坐着一位女子，带着疲惫的微笑看着她，窗台上的花瓶里花儿垂落。

"Here, look." “来，看这里。”

He showed her a picture on his phone, and she saw what must have been her as a toddler, wide-eyed, but happy all the same while sitting in her grandmother's lap. The woman's hair was much lighter, and she was much older, a gauntness in her neck and her laugh lines more pronounced. But from what Asuka could tell, she had the most wonderful smile in the world.  
他给她看手机上的一张照片，她看到那一定是自己蹒跚学步时的模样，睁大眼睛，却同样快乐地坐在祖母的腿上。那女人的头发淡得多，年纪也大得多，脖颈瘦削，笑纹更加明显。但据明日香所见，她拥有世界上最美好的笑容。

"I wish I could remember," her voice faded to a mumble and she hugged her overcoat tight around. Sometimes, when they stayed for a while in Obihiro, she didn't like listening to the Suzahara's talk about growing up in Tokyo-3 with her grandparents. What they were like when they were only a little older than her. How much everything had changed. It just wasn't fair that everyone else had so many memories of them, while she had so few. She kept trying to convince papa to let her read grandpa's book – she was ten years old already!  
"我真希望能记得更多，"她的声音渐渐低沉，紧紧抱住身上的大衣。有时候，当他们在带广停留一段时间时，她不喜欢听铃原家的人谈论在第三新东京市与祖父母一起长大的经历。他们那时只比她大一点的样子。一切变化有多大。只是不公平，别人都有那么多关于他们的记忆，而她却那么少。她一直试图说服爸爸让她读爷爷的书——她已经十岁了！

"Someday," he'd say, laying a hand on the book, all too amused with her pouting. Asuka didn't understand. They were already learning about Second Impact and the Angel War in school, and she'd been reading about other wars since she was old enough to read, even if she couldn't recall much of those books. If grandma were still around, she would have let Asuka read it. She might have been young, but she knew when she was being spoiled, and if Asuka had wanted something, there was nothing mama or papa could do to keep grandma from indulging her.  
"总有一天，"他会说，把手放在书上，对她撅嘴的样子感到好笑。明日香不明白。他们已经在学校学习第二次冲击和使徒战争，而且她从能读书开始就一直在读关于其他战争的书，即使她记不清那些书的内容。如果奶奶还在，她会让明日香读这本书的。她可能还小，但她知道什么时候被宠坏了，如果明日香想要什么，妈妈或爸爸都无法阻止奶奶宠她。

A thought struck her then. "Why do me and grandma have the same name?"  
这时她突然想到一个问题。"为什么我和奶奶同名？"

"Because..." he fingered the small, golden cross hanging from his neck, face shadowed by melancholy. "because I didn't ever want to forget."  
"因为..." 他轻抚着颈间悬挂的小小金十字架，面容笼罩在忧郁的阴影中。"因为我从未想要忘记。"

He hadn't cried at the funeral, but had sat on the couch at home and sobbed into his hands for an hour after. Mama was there with him, shoulders slumped and eyes red. Asuka sat with him and hugged him too, because it hurt so much to see him that way and she just wanted to make him better, even when all he did was grab her in an awkward embrace and try in vain to dry his eyes.  
他在葬礼上没有流泪，而是在家中沙发上坐下，双手掩面哭泣了一个小时。妈妈陪在他身边，肩膀下垂，双眼通红。明日香也坐在他旁边，紧紧拥抱他，因为看到他那副模样让她心如刀绞，她只想让他好受些，即便他只是笨拙地抱住她，徒劳地试图擦干眼泪。

Asuka took his hand. "It's a good name."  
明日香握住他的手。"这是个好名字。"

A thoughtful noise rumbled from his throat, but he didn't speak and stood. Coming around to his side, mama folded her fingers with his too. As they left, Asuka set a penny each at their markers, then ran to catch up. Papa snared her as she ran to mama and set her on his shoulders. It wasn't often she let him treat her like a little kid anymore, but every now and again entertained him. Certainly not because she, as mama said, enjoyed being a kid too much to act so grown up.  
他喉咙里发出一声深思的低鸣，却没有说话，只是站起身来。妈妈走到他身边，也将手指与他交叠。离开时，Asuka 在每个墓碑前放了一枚硬币，然后跑去追赶他们。爸爸在她奔向妈妈时一把抱住她，将她放在肩上。她已经不常让他这样像对待小孩子一样对待自己了，但偶尔也会迁就他。当然，并不是因为她像妈妈说的那样，太享受当孩子的感觉而不愿表现得那么成熟。

Well, maybe that was a little true.  
嗯，也许那有那么一点真实。

"You have to make me a promise," papa said, shifting his head. "You have to come here every year and bring them flowers. Even when I'm old and gone one day." he held out his pinky and she hooked it with hers. Lilacs for grandma. Sunflowers for grandpa.  
“你得向我保证，”爸爸说着，转过头来，“每年你都要来这里，给他们带花。即使有一天我老了，不在了。”他伸出小指，她用她的小指勾住。紫丁香给奶奶，向日葵给爷爷。

"Promise," she said. "我保证," 她说。

"Don't forget your grandma and grandpa."  
"别忘了你的爷爷奶奶。"

"I won't, papa," she said, a memory surfacing as she looked back. She sat at the water's edge along the beach, the wind playing with her matted, frizzled hair. Her grandpa squatted in front of her, shielding her from the blinding light of the sun with his cool shadow. Sea salt stung her nose. Behind him, grandma reached over his shoulder and held out her open hand, offering a ruddy red shell to place atop Asuka's castle. Her papa sat beside her and mama kneeled, the four of them watching as she placed it atop the highest tower.  
"我不会的，爸爸," 她说，记忆浮现眼前。她坐在海滩的水边，风儿轻抚着她纠结蓬松的头发。爷爷蹲在她面前，用他凉爽的影子为她遮挡刺眼的阳光。海盐的味道刺激着她的鼻子。在他身后，奶奶越过他的肩膀，伸出手，递给她一个红润的贝壳，让她放在明日香城堡的顶端。爸爸坐在她旁边，妈妈则跪着，四人一起看着她将贝壳放在最高的塔顶上。

"I won't forget." "我不会忘记。"
