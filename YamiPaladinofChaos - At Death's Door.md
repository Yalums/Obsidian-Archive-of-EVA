He was dying. 他正在死去。

This, the old man knew quite well. It was a feeling he had known before, once, in a moment of pure desperation and panic and terror...  
这一点，老人非常清楚。这种感觉他曾经体验过，那是在一次纯粹的绝望、恐慌和恐惧中...

And yet it was followed by a moment of bliss, of a love that only a mother and son could share...  
然而随之而来的是一个幸福的瞬间，一种只有母子之间才能分享的爱...

"Was it the Thirteenth... no, that was Touji..." he mumbled, his memories muddled and darkened from years of wallowing in misery and alcohol. That single year, 2015, was one giant nightmare that at long last, had faded from memory.  
"是第十三号机...不，那是东治..." 他喃喃自语，多年的痛苦与酒精浸泡使他的记忆混乱而模糊。那一年，2015 年，是一个巨大的噩梦，最终从记忆中淡去。

He lay in his apartment, in his bed, awaiting his end. There was no Eva, no Mother to save him... this was the fate of all humans.  
他躺在自己的公寓里，躺在床上，等待着生命的终结。没有 Eva，没有母亲来拯救他...这是所有人类的命运。

Alone, he waited. 孤独地，他等待着。

_Death was coming. 死亡正在逼近。_

He remembered words... why were they important? They were connected with that time of dying...  
他记得那些话语……为何它们如此重要？它们与那濒死的时刻紧密相连……

"I just wanted to see them all... one more time."  
“我只是想再见他们一面……哪怕一次。”

_Tick tock, the Reaper's knocking.  
滴答滴答，死神在敲门。_

Briefly, he struggled to remember the faces he had forgotten. He remembered Touji... strong and yet then crippled... Kensuke, a boy with glasses, always asking questions... a woman named Misato... but there were others, faces he knew and had forgotten.  
他短暂地挣扎着，试图回忆那些被遗忘的面孔。他想起了冬二...坚强却又残疾...眼镜男孩真嗣，总是问个不停...一个叫美里女士...但还有其他人，那些他认识却已遗忘的面孔。

People who had passed from his life, or perhaps never existed at all.  
那些从他生活中消失的人，或者也许从未存在过的人。

A blue haired girl, delicate and frail, impassive, and yet with some hidden pain lurking in her crimson eyes. Old nightmares, of a score of the faces of that girl, naked and smiling eerily. He felt something for her... but now, she was just a faded shadow.  
一个蓝发女孩，纤弱而冷漠，眼中却潜藏着隐痛。旧日的梦魇，浮现出那女孩的数十张面孔，赤裸且诡异地微笑着。他对她有所感触……但如今，她仅是一抹淡去的影子。

Misato, he could recall, if faint, like a childhood memory, only half real, and half fantasy. Her face, smiling and happy, often guzzling down beer... but it was feelings that he remembered. Warmth and affection, as if she had been an older sister or even a mother figure...  
美里，他依稀记得，如同童年的记忆，半真半幻。她的笑脸，常带着欢乐，大口畅饮啤酒……但他铭记的是那份情感。温暖与关爱，仿佛她曾是姐姐甚至母亲般的存在……

_Closer, ever closer to the final oblivion...  
愈发接近，终末的虚无……_

Another woman, blonde with emerald eyes, often a cold, almost cruel look on her striking face...  
另一位女子，金发碧眼，常在她那引人注目的面庞上带着一种近乎冷酷的神情……

An unshaven man with joking eyes and a carefree, challenging grin...  
一个胡子拉碴的男人，眼中带着戏谑，嘴角挂着不羁而挑衅的笑容……

A boy, not much older than himself, with matted gray hair and crimson eyes, so warm and friendly, and yet unearthly and an Enemy...  
一个男孩，年纪与他相仿，灰发赤眸，如此温暖友好，却又超凡脱俗，是个敌人……

_Cold... a cold, stalking feeling of nothingness creeping into his soul...  
冰冷...一种冰冷、潜伏的无形感觉悄然侵入他的灵魂..._

And there was the Girl.  
然后，那个女孩出现了。

He didn't remember her name anymore... and barely recalled her features.  
他已记不清她的名字...甚至连她的容貌也模糊不清。

When he thought of the Girl, there was a flash of crimson and sapphire, and a mixture of apprehension and admiration in his gut.  
每当他想起那个女孩，脑海中便闪过一抹绯红与宝石蓝，心中混杂着一丝忧虑与钦佩。

_Tick tock, dying just a little more...  
滴答滴答，一点点走向消亡……_

Her face was at the corner of his eyes, her name dancing at the back of his mind, and her voice a faint cry, like a soft summer wind, just barely tangible, barely there. He remembered that the Girl had strength, had vitality... but couldn't remember who she was.  
她的面容在他眼角余光中若隐若现，她的名字在他脑海深处跳跃，她的声音如夏日微风般轻柔，几乎触手可及，却又难以捉摸。他记得那个女孩有着力量，有着活力……却记不起她是谁。

Was he in love with her, in that fantasy/memory? He didn't know, didn't remember... didn't even know if the Girl was real, or something he concocted, yet another lie fabricated to create a life.  
他是否爱上了她，在那幻想/记忆中？他不知道，不记得...甚至不确定那个女孩是否真实存在，或是他编造的又一个谎言，用来构建一种生活。

Just like all the other memories.  
就像所有其他的记忆一样。

All these faces, all these names, all these feelings... they seemed someone else's life, a movie he had seen and loved in his childhood.  
所有这些面孔，所有这些名字，所有这些情感...它们似乎属于别人的生活，一部他在童年时看过并喜爱的电影。

It was all too fantastic to be real... giant robots, monsters from the unknown, defending humanity from annihilation...  
这一切太过奇幻，难以置信...巨型机器人，来自未知领域的怪兽，守护人类免于灭绝...

A different life, a different world, a different person...  
不同的生活，不同的世界，不同的人...

_The clock chimes, the Reaper's coming.  
时钟敲响，死神降临。_

Were they even his memories? Or memories crafted out of fantasy, a life he constructed for himself, to prove his own existence?  
这些记忆真的是他的吗？还是说，它们只是幻想的产物，一个他为自己构建的生活，以此证明自己的存在？

Was any of it even real?  
这一切真的存在过吗？

Who was the Girl... why couldn't he remember her, if he had once cared for her so deeply?  
那个女孩是谁...如果他曾经如此深爱过她，为何现在却记不起她的模样？

What was her name, for God's sake!  
她到底叫什么名字，看在上帝的份上！

_The Reaper towered over him, beckoning.  
死神矗立在他面前，召唤着他。_

Struggling, the old man fought against the sweet siren of Death once more.  
老人挣扎着，再次与死亡的甜美诱惑抗争。

He couldn't go... not until he remembered the Girl. He had gone his life without purpose, without direction... but here, now, he would try to claim a forgotten memory.  
他不能走……直到他记起那个女孩。他一生漫无目的，毫无方向……但此刻，他决心追寻一段遗忘的记忆。

It shouldn't have been important, a person who was decades gone from his life...  
这本不该重要，一个早已从他生活中消失几十年的人……

But it was. 但事实就是如此。

_Time, time is no more, Death is forever.  
时间，时间已不复存在，死亡才是永恒。_

It would be the final, clinching proof that he had done something, had actually lived that life of a Child... or would be the terminal evidence that he was insane, and creating fiction in place of memory.  
这将是对他做过某事、真正活过那段孩童时光的最终、决定性证明...或者将成为他疯了、用虚构代替记忆的最终证据。

Who was she... 她是谁...

_Creeping ever closer to the endless dream of Death...  
一步步逼近那无尽的死亡梦境……_

A flash. 一道闪光。

Heat... a raw, screaming agony that sears into his flesh-  
热浪……一种原始的、撕心裂肺的剧痛灼入他的肌肤——

And yet he is happy- no, overjoyed... he has saved the life of the Girl.  
然而他是快乐的——不，是欣喜若狂的……他救了那个女孩的命。

That was real. 那是真实的。

That happened. 那确实发生了。

That was not an illusion, not a specter.  
那并非幻觉，亦非幽灵。

A few words are said quietly, affectionately.  
几句低语，满含柔情。

"Idiot... you showoff." “傻瓜……你这爱显摆的。”

They should be insulting, but they are soft, like the gentle caress of a summer's breeze.  
它们本应是侮辱性的，却温柔如夏日微风的轻抚。

And he finally remembered her name.  
他终于记起了她的名字。

_Death smiled down at Shinji Ikari... and he smiled back.  
死亡对碇真嗣微笑着...而他回以微笑。_

The old man opened his mouth, and breathed his last word.  
老人张开嘴，吐出了他最后的话语。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Author's Remarks 作者的话

The Reaper's knockin, but Shinji's forgotten.  
死神在敲门，但真嗣已忘却。

Sort of an odd little short I came up with on the fly. As for why I used that Magma Diver scene instead of the kiss scene, that was really the most tender moment between the two, and probably the only time that Asuka spoke in a more... gentle manner to Shinji.  
这是一篇我即兴创作的小短文。至于为什么选择使用岩浆潜水场景而不是接吻场景，那是因为这是两人之间最温柔的时刻，也可能是明日香以一种更……温柔的方式对真嗣说话的唯一时刻。

### Comment
[TonyStarkakaIronMan](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/842302/TonyStarkakaIronMan): Interesting take on his last moments. I, for one, was never satisfied with how the Eva saga ended. The movie was a step up from the TV show's ending, but still somewhat unsatisfying. Not bad for something you came up with "on the fly."
对他最后时刻的看法很有意思。我对伊娃传奇的结局一直不满意。电影比电视剧的结局好一些，但还是有些不尽人意。你临时想出来的东西还不错嘛

[Linkin-Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578289/Linkin-Phoenix): Well it is probably a good idea to use that scene than the kiss scene, considering in the kiss scene the next thing Asuka does is run to the bathroom screaming and berating herself and Shinji. That was good, you are one of the best writers I've ever found on without question, your Evangelion stories are first rate and you really know how to get inside Shinji's head. So once again an absolute brilliant story, I congratulate you.
考虑到在吻戏中明日香做的下一件事就是跑到浴室尖叫，并责备自己和真嗣，所以用这个场景可能比用吻戏更好。写得很好，毫无疑问，你是我见过的最好的作家之一，你的福音战士故事是一流的，你真的知道如何进入真嗣的内心世界。我再次祝贺你，这是一个绝对精彩的故事。

[FinalMax](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/387576/FinalMax): This was solid work. Introspective, well written, and your logic was spot on. You also chose a setting that makes the reader ask a lot of questions, which really grabs the attention.Keep it up, and good luck on your other projects.
你的工作很出色。思想深刻，文笔优美，逻辑严密。你还选择了一个能让读者提出很多问题的背景，这确实吸引了读者的注意力。继续努力，祝你在其他项目中取得好成绩。
