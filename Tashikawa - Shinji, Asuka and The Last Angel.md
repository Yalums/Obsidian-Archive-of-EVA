## Suicide  
Okay, well, this story came kinda randomly, seeing as I haven't finished writing any other fanfics that I have published…Hopefully this one may be the lucky one. I got a bit inspired by Evangelion and even more by the few stories I read about Evangelion over the internet. For no reason I guess, I wanted to write a story about Shinji's and Asuka's relationship.

This is version 1.4 if you want to be technical. I'm trying to fix as many mistakes in the original as possible okay? Please cut me some slack here.

**-Asuka, Shinji and the Last Angel-**

Shinji ate dinner alone for the fourth night in a row. He had been cooking each meal for the past week expecting Misato or at least Asuka to join in, but Asuka had not left her room since she got out of the hospital and Misato was absent for the time being. Misato had left some sort of note saying she was going to go looking for someone and Shinji could guess who she was referring to, he wouldn't stop her.

It had been three weeks since Asuka had been mentally violated by the 15th angel. It was only seven days ago though, when she was thought to be in a stable enough state to leave the hospital. Shinji couldn't help but be worried though, seeing as he had to leave her food by her door every day. Misato told Shinji that he shouldn't try to interfere with Asuka while she was in this state, but Shinji was worried all the same.

"It just doesn't seem right to see Asuka in this kind of state", thought Shinji. "To be honest, I would even prefer her in her obnoxious moods than in a state of such depression." Pen-pen crossed the room, took a beer and without looking at Shinji once, went back to his fridge. If only life was as simple as it was to a pinguin, Shinji thought to himself.

Finally, Shinji got up and put away his dishes. As usual, he saved some food in the fridge in case Misato would return home and want something to eat, but the chances of that were so slim that he was only doing it for ruitine's sake.

He stalled for a minute though, while he held Asuka's food in his hands. "How long is she going to be like this?" He continued to hold her plate in his hands as if it was the only connection with her he had for the moment, savoring it. As he walked to her closed door though, he stalled once again.

He didn't want to keep running away. Even though Misato didn't want him interfering with her, he didn't want to sit around and do nothing. "I promised I wouldn't run away," he thought to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Shinji knocked on Asuka's door as loud as he dared and cleared his throat. "Um, a-Asuka? C-can I c-come in? It's me, um, Shinji…you in there Asuka?" He waited patiently for some sort of answer or some sort of sign that the person inside the room could hear him. Though when there was no answer, he hesitated. Finally, he called in a bit louder: "Asuka, can you hear me? I, I'm coming in, o-okay?" Shinji started opening the door, though there was no light emanating from within.

As soon as he had opened the door all the way, time seemed to pause. Asuka's room was very clean, as if nothing had been touched at all. There were only some scrap pieces of food at the side of her bed. That was when Shinji noticed that there was no one in the room other than him!

"Asuka?" Shinji called a bit louder. He carefully stepped into the room, holding her plate out in front of him. "A-Asuka, I brought your dinner, is it okay if I-…"

Shinji stopped in mid-phrase, nobody was in this room, it was empty. Shinji furiously looked around, forgetting the food in his hands. He dropped the plate as he looked through her closet and under her bed, but Asuka was nowhere to be seen.

Shinji raced back into the hallway, trying to think of a place she might go. Finally settling, he ran through the kitchen, bathroom, and his own bedroom before he found himself staring out the living room window. Out on the Balcony beyond the window was a red haried girl sitting precariously off the edge of the railing over the street below.

"ASUKA! NO!" Shinji dropped and ran towards double doors. He used all his strength to try and pull them open before seeing they were locked. Cursing under his breath, Shinji unhooked both catches on the sliding doors and pulled them open. "Wh-what are you doing Asuka?!"

Asuka turned her head towards him for a moment and Shinji could see that her face had become much more gaunt than he was used to seeing. Then, without saying a word she slipped on the rail and began to fall towards the streets below.

"STOP ASUKA!" Shouted Shinji. He ran as fast as he could and practically jumped towards the ledge. Her fingers were just disappearing from view and Shinji once again felt as helpless to save her as he did during the 15th angel attack.

"No…" Shinji thought. "I couldn't do anything that time, I don't want a repeat. I WON'T RUN AWAY!" Shinji gathered all his strength and landed on his waist over the rail. He plummeted his right hand downwards and barely caught hers while the other reached towards the railing for support.

The rail creaked under the strain of two bodies, but nevertheless held strong. Shinji was surprised at the same time as he held on to Asuka. She was as limp as a doll as he held onto her life by his hand. She didn't look upwards at him right away. Shinji noted that he was definitely capable of pulling her upwards now. She had lost so much weight that it was no problem for Shinji to hoist her up.

It was only as Asuka felt the hand pulling her upwards did she muster the energy to look upwards. Asuka didn't know what to think when she saw Shinji straining to pull her limp body upwards. Though at that moment, even though she didn't do anything, she felt a warmth towards him inside of her. She didn't get a surge of hope right then, but she felt a bit more inclined to live for some reason.

Asuka worked and grabbed onto shinji's wrist with both of her hands as he brought her upwards.

It seemed like forever, but finally Shinji was able to pull Asuka's body all the way into the protective barrier of the balcony. Though Shinji didn't stop there. He took Asuka by the shoulder and only let go one they were both safely inside the apartment. Shinji then locked the door from the inside again and turned towards her. He then grabbed her around the shoulders and even against her will brought her back into her own room while carefully stepping over the spilled dinner.

Asuka looked away as Shinji stared at her, she didn't want to have to look at him now. He was probably the person she would have least liked in the world to have helped her. INstead she focused her gaze on the floor.

"A-Asuka," Shinji finally broke the silence, "…w-why?"

"…"

"Why Asuka? Wh-what happened? Wh-what's wrong with you?" Shinji's voice started to crack.

"…"

"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ASUKA?!" Shinji finally yelled. Asuka didn't flinch but hardened her gaze on the floor.

"Please, Asuka. Please can you tell me what's wrong. Please?" Shinji felt ashamed at having to yell at her. He felt so sorry for her.

"I don't want your sympathy." Asuka finally retorted. "I didn't need you and I don't need you now either."

"Asuka what do you mean by that? What were you doing on the balcony just now then?

"Simple," said Asuka, "I accidentally locked myself outside. So I couldn't do anything."

"Then what were you doing on the railing Asuka?"

Asuka continued looking at the floor, but there was no mistake that tears were starting to develop in her eyes.

"C-can you just talk to me Asuka?..."

"SHUT UP!" Asuka finally yelled. "I DON"T NEED YOU. I HATE YOU. I HATE ALL OF YOU. I JUST WISH YOU WOULD ALL JUST DIE! I HATE YOU!"

Shinji was taken aback by this. Asuka was standing up now glaring at him. She was made all the more terrifying because of her now gaunt figure. She was breathing heavily and had curled her fists into balls. Shinji was able to restrain his emotions though, he remembered Kaji was good at controlling his anger, so he would try as well.

"Asuka," said Shinji, backing away until he leant on the sliding doors. "…I d-don't understand anything here. My life I mean. I know that yours must be pretty messed up, but there are many others who have gone through worse…HEY! I didn't mean it that way, I'm sorry!" Shinji quickly added seeing the anger on Asuka's face.

"I DON"T…want your sympathy…" Asuka was still standing but she was shivering at the same time. Shinji wasn't sure if she was shaking from sadness or anger.

"Asuka, Please, if it helps, I'm the one to blame."

Asuka suddenly looked up from her tears at him.

"If it will make you feel better, it was my fault you had to go through all this. I couldn't help when the 15th angel attacked. Plus I had humiliated you both when I beat your synchronization ratios and the other angel in front of you."

She just stood in front of Shinji now, Asuka had stopped crying and shaking while listening to Shinji.

"To be honest Asuka, I don't want to see you like this. I would prefer to see you when you're all self confident and annoying rather than see you like this, it's just too scary. You were strong enough to hold your painful memories inside of you and continually strive to be the best, but wouldn't that also qualify as running from those memories as well? I looked up to you if you can believe that, heh heh…"

Shinji looked straight into Asuka's eyes when he said his next words, "Are you running from the painful memories that you too hold within you?"

There was a moment of silence. Asuka seemed to be in quiet shock while Shinji stood against the door. He somewhat regretted his words because it would force her to relive those memories as well. He didn't want to cause any more pain. He wanted to stop her from suffering like this, but he had no idea how. He definitely knew that he cared for her, but to what extent?

Suddenly Asuka started crying again. She was standing with her head down sniffing. "How dare you…" Shinji looked up as Asuka started to speak again.

"How what?"

"How…HOW DARE YOU!" Asuka took a step towards him shouting dangerously. "HOW DARE YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE, TRYING TO LECTURE ME! ME: ASUKA LANGLEY SOHRYU!" Shinji couldn't back away from her, he was pressed as far back from Asuka as he could. But she took another step towards him anyways. "I HATE YOU. IHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOU! I HATE EVERYONE!"

Shinji was actually afraid now, she was definitely beyond reason. He didn't know what to do so he just tried to say the most reassuring things that came to his mind. "A-Asuka, p-please stop. I-I-I don't know what you're going through…

"DAMN RIGHT YOU DON"T, YOU STUPID PIECE OF…"

"…But, p-please Asuka, what's making you hate everybody?"

Asuka stopped in mid sentence. She couldn't answer that question herself. She had just felt all the built in hatred and she wanted to release it all on the only person in front of her right now. Shinji.

But she couldn't, she didn't know what feeling this was. This whole time it was Shinji who was trying to help her, she knew that. But she couldn't accept it. He was the one she hated. He was the one she wanted most dead. So why was he the person she had to respect most? Suddenly she felt weary, her anger was dissolving into sadness and she still didn't know why.

"Asuka…"

Asuka looked up into Shinji, for the first time she was actually aware that he was being as compassionate as he ever was towards her.

"I-is, was it so bad, that you really wanted to end it all?"

"Sniff I have, nothing else. I can't pilot an Eva anymore. Why can't you just respect me and let me END THIS SUFFERING!"

"Asuka," Shinji finally thought he understood why he cared for Asuka so much. "You really want to end it like this? I've told myself and others the same thing, Asuka, don't you ever say you don't have anything else. There is always something else. I promise Asuka, please, will you at least let me try to stop your suffering without having to resort to death? I'm respecting you by telling you not to throw your life away."

"Shinji…" Asuka felt as if she couldn't breathe. She hated him the most, she loved him more than anyone. Why? Why did she keep running away? She never wanted anyone to comfort her, but that's exactly what she wanted now. She promised she would never cry, but she was doing so now, in front of Shinji. It made her so mad and at the same time, it made her feel cared for.

"Erm, Asuka?" Shinji asked quietly. "W-what…what i-is it?" Shinji thought he may have gone too far, just when he was debating whether he should actually leave Asuka to herself she looked up at him for the first time without a face contorted with rage.

"Y-you…idiot." Her face was twisted up in a half frown, half smirk.

"Um…what?!"

Asuka couldn't help herself, she didn't want to keep suffering on her own anymore. She started to slump towards the ground for a second, then regained herself as she looked up towards Shinji's weary face. She felt sick that she actually put him through all this. She knew he had never asked for any sympathy even though he had gone through just as much as well. "Why do I have to be so stubborn," she thought?

Just then, Asuka launched herself at Shinji. He wasn't expecting this and he didn't have any time to react. She fell into his chest knocking the air out of him. He knew that he wouldn't be able to fight back while winded like this. Shinji tried to grab for something, anything, arms flailing around. Finally, he lost his balance and slumped sideways onto the floor. Asuka though, followed as well, still holding him around his chest.

Shinji came to rest in a sitting position between Asuka's door and beaurau. He was sprawled with his legs open half sitting, while Asuka was almost lying on top of him now. He had expected Asuka to get up after that and try and make for the balcony again but to his surprise she was still holding him. Both of them were sprawled on the floor a bit awkwardly but she wasn't fighting anymore.

Shinji looked down to see Asuka shaking. She was crying on him, not the way he would have ever expected to see someone her age. She was crying and moaning as if she was in pain. Shinji looked down at her and felt miserable. It made him feel sad as well seeing her cry into his shoulder.

Not knowing what to do and definitely not knowing anything to say to Asuka, Shinji took both his arms and wrapped them around Asuka and leant his head on hers for comfort. It felt really weird for him to be comforting Asuka in his arms, it was even a bit embarrassing as he turned a bit red. Though this was the best thing he could think of doing for her at the moment.

Asuka felt his arms around her and she felt like punching him, but it was she that was now asking Shinji for support. She relaxed and let Shinji hold her as she slowly let out all the pain of recent events on him.

As Asuka cried in Shinji's arms, the sky became darker as the sun set. He could see her meal that he dropped earlier on the floor a little ways away from them. Shinji finally felt though, that he may have done something worthy. He felt more worthwhile at the thought of being able to comfort Asuka.

Asuka's moans slowly became sniffles as the night wore on, until she was finally fast asleep in Shinji's arms. Shinji was awake the whole time, rubbing her back every so often to remind her he was there. Seeing as she was finally asleep, he sighed and leant his head back. He felt relief and pleasure at the same time. Relief that she had finally gone to sleep and pleasure that he had finally had a chance to help Asuka face to face with her emotions. He was happy as well because at any other time she would have snarled at just the idea of touching or being touched by him.

Looking over the bedside table, Shinji got startled seeing that it was one thirty in the morning. He didn't even feel the time going by. He guessed that it must have been because he was with Asuka. Even though he wanted to deny it, after watching the other nature to Asuka, he felt more attached towards her to anybody in his life. He picked her up and was once again painfully reminded of how much weight she had lost.

"God Asuka," Shinji muttered to himself as he laid her on her bed. "I could lift you with one hand if I wanted to. Why do you do this…?" Shinji stepped back to see her lying peacefully in her bed at last. Looking down at the mess on the floor he groaned.

"Well, hopefully she will overlook this…," thought Shinji to himself. "…Of course, Asuka will never be as forgiving as that," he thought afterwards.

Well, I don't exactly know what to say. None of my stories get many reviews, so to be honest, if I get even ONE STINKING REVIEW! …then I will gladly write another chapter. Up until now, let me count me reviews…one…two…crap, is that all?!

You get the point. I WANT REVIEWS DAMMIT…(starts crying…)

Ps…You wondering about why I chose that title?...well, don't worry, I didn't forget or add the "angel" part for no reason, keep reading and you'll find out lol.

好吧，这个故事来得有点随意，毕竟我还没完成任何已发布的同⼈作品……希望这⼀篇能成为幸运⼉。我受到了《新世纪福⾳战⼠》的启发，而互联⽹上关于它的几篇故事更是让我灵感迸发。不知为何，我想要写⼀个关于真嗣和明⽇香关系的故事。
如果要讲究精确，这是 1.4 版。我正尽⼒修正原作中的诸多错误，可以吗？请在这⾥给我⼀些宽容。
-明⽇香、真嗣与最后的使徒-

真嗣已经连续第四个晚上独⾃吃晚餐了。过去⼀周，他每顿饭都亲⾃下厨，期待着美⾥或⾄少明⽇香能加⼊，但明⽇香⾃从出院后就没离开过房间，而美⾥⽬前也不在家。美⾥留下了⼀张字条，说她要去找某个⼈，真嗣能猜到她指的是谁，他不会阻⽌她。
⾃从第⼗五个使徒对明⽇香进⾏了精神侵犯以来，已经过去了三周。然而，直到七天前，她才被认为状态稳定，可以出院。尽管如此，真嗣还是忍不住担⼼，因为他每天都得把⻝物放在她的门口。美⾥告诉真嗣，在明⽇香这种状态下，他不应该试图⼲涉她，但真嗣依然忧⼼忡忡。
􀀁看到明⽇香这副模样，总觉得不对劲。􀀁 真嗣⼼想，􀀁说实话，我宁愿她还是那副讨⼈厌的样⼦，也不愿见她如此消沉。􀀁 企鹅 Pen-pen 穿过房间，拿了⼀罐啤酒，⼀眼也没看真嗣，就回到了⾃⼰的冰箱。真嗣暗⾃思忖，要是⽣活能像企鹅那样简单就好了。
最终，真嗣起⾝收拾了碗筷。和往常⼀样，他留了些⻝物在冰箱⾥，以防美⾥回家时想吃点什么，但这种可能性微乎其微，他这么做不过是出于习惯。
他⼿中捧着明⽇香的餐盘，犹豫了⼀分钟。􀀁她还要这样多久呢？􀀁 他继续捧着她的盘⼦，仿佛这是此刻与她唯⼀的联系，细细品味着这份牵绊。然而，当他走向她紧闭的房门时，⼜⼀次停下了脚步。
他不想再逃避了。尽管美⾥不希望他插⼿，他也不愿只是袖⼿旁观。􀀁我承诺过不会逃跑，􀀁 他暗⾃思忖。
深吸⼀口⽓后，真嗣尽可能⼤声地敲了敲明⽇香的房门，并清了清嗓⼦。“呃，明、明⽇香？我、我能进来吗？是我，呃，真嗣……你在⾥⾯吗，明⽇香？”他耐⼼等待着某种回应或迹象，表明屋内的⼈能听见他。然而，当没有任何回应时，他犹豫了。最终，他稍微提⾼了声⾳：“明⽇香，你能听见我吗？我，我要进来了，可、可以吗？”真嗣开始推开门，但⾥⾯并没有光线透出。
当他完全推开门的那⼀刻，时间仿佛凝固了。明⽇香的房间异常整洁，仿佛未曾有⼈触碰过。床边只有⼀些零星的⻝物碎屑。这时，真嗣才注意到，房间⾥除了他，空⽆⼀⼈！
明⽇香？􀀁 真嗣提⾼了些声⾳喊道。他小⼼翼翼地走进房间，⼿⾥端着她的餐盘。􀀁明⽇香，我给你带晚饭来了，我可以...进来吗？
真嗣话说到⼀半突然停住，房间⾥空⽆⼀⼈。他焦急地四处张望，⼿中的⻝物也顾不上了。随着他翻看她的⾐橱和床底，餐盘应声落地，但明⽇香却踪影全⽆。
真嗣急忙跑回走廊，试图想出⼀个她可能去的地⽅。最终决定后，他穿过厨房、浴室和⾃⼰的卧室，最后发现⾃⼰站在客厅的窗前。在窗外阳台上，⼀个红发⼥孩正危险地坐在栏杆边缘，下⾯是街道。
明⽇香！不要！􀀁 真嗣⼤喊⼀声，冲向双开门。他⽤尽全⼒试图拉开它们，却发现门被锁上了。他低声咒骂着，解开滑动门上的两个扣⼦，⽤⼒拉开。􀀁你...你在做什么，明⽇香？！
明⽇香转头朝向他，那⼀刻，真嗣看到她的脸庞⽐往常更加憔悴。随后，她⼀⾔不发，脚下⼀滑，便开始向街道下⽅坠落。
􀀁明⽇香，停下！􀀁 真嗣⼤声呼喊。他拼尽全⼒奔跑，几乎是⼀跃而起冲向边缘。她的⼿指正从视线中消失，真嗣再次感受到在第 15 使徒攻击时那种⽆⼒拯救她的绝望。
􀀁不…􀀁 真嗣⼼想。􀀁那次我什么都没做到，我不想重蹈覆辙。我绝不会再逃避！􀀁 真嗣汇聚全⾝⼒量，腰部跨过栏杆，猛地伸出右⼿向下抓去，勉强握住了她的⼿，另⼀只⼿则伸向栏杆寻求⽀撑。
栏杆在两个⼈的重量下吱嘎作响，但依旧坚固。真嗣⼀边紧握着明⽇香，⼀边感到惊讶。她软绵绵的，像个⼈偶，真嗣仅凭⼀只⼿维系着她的⽣命。她并没有⽴刻抬头看他。真嗣意识到，现在他完全有能⼒把她拉上来。她已经瘦弱到真嗣毫不费⼒就能将她提起的程度。
直到感觉到那只⼿正将她向上拉，明⽇香才攒⾜⼒⽓抬头望去。当她看到真嗣正竭⼒将她瘫软的⾝体拉上去时，明⽇香不知该如何是好。尽管那⼀刻她什么也没做，但内⼼却对他涌起了⼀股暖意。她并未⽴即感到希望的涌动，却莫名地更想活下去。
明⽇香努⼒伸⼿，⽤双⼿紧紧抓住真嗣的⼿腕，随着他将⾃⼰向上拉。
仿佛过了许久，最终真嗣总算将明⽇香的⾝躯完全拖⼊了阳台的保护屏障内。然而，真嗣并未就此停步。他扶住明⽇香的肩膀，直到两⼈都安全进⼊公寓内部才松⼿。随后，真嗣再次从⾥⾯锁上门，转⾝⾯向她。他紧握她的肩膀，不顾她的抗拒，将她带回⾃⼰的房间，小⼼翼翼地跨过洒落⼀地的晚餐。
⾯对真嗣的凝视，明⽇香转过头去，此刻她不愿直视他。他可能是她在这个世界上最不想得到帮助的⼈。于是，她将⽬光聚焦在地板上。
􀀁飞鸟，􀀁 真嗣终于打破了沉默，􀀁……为……为什么？􀀁
"…"
􀀁为什么是明⽇香？到-到底发⽣了什么？你-你怎么了？􀀁 真嗣的声⾳开始颤抖。 "…"
􀀁这到底是什么⻤，明⽇香?!􀀁 真嗣终于吼了出来。明⽇香没有退缩，只是⽬光更加坚定地盯着地板。
􀀁求你了，明⽇香。告诉我到底怎么了。求你了？􀀁 真嗣为⾃⼰不得不对她吼叫而感到羞愧。他为她感到⾮常难过。
我不需要你的同情。􀀁明⽇香终于反驳道，􀀁我以前不需要你，现在也不需要。
明⽇香，你这话什么意思？那你刚才在阳台上做什么？
很简单，􀀁 明⽇香说，􀀁我不小⼼把⾃⼰锁在外⾯了。所以什么也做不了。
那你在栏杆上做什么呢，明⽇香？
明⽇香依旧盯着地板，但毫⽆疑问，她的眼眶开始泛起泪光。
你能不能和我说话，明⽇香？...
闭嘴！􀀁 明⽇香终于爆发了。􀀁我不需要你。我恨你。我恨你们所有⼈。我只希望你们都去死！我恨你！！！
这番话让真嗣愣住了。明⽇香此刻站起⾝来，怒视着他。她那因消瘦而更显可怕的⾝影，呼吸急促，紧握双拳。尽管如此，真嗣还是控制住了⾃⼰的情绪，他记得加持先⽣很擅⻓控制愤怒，于是他也试图这样做。
􀀁明⽇香，􀀁 真嗣说着，后退到靠在推拉门上。􀀁…我…我什么都不明⽩。我是说我的⽣活。我知道你的⽣活肯定也很混乱，但还有很多⼈经历过更糟的…嘿！我不是那个意思，对不起！􀀁 看到明⽇香脸上的怒⽓，真嗣急忙补充道。
􀀁我…我不需要你的同情…􀀁 明⽇香虽然还站着，但同时也在颤抖。真嗣不确定她是因为悲伤还是愤怒而颤抖。
明⽇香，如果这样有帮助的话，都是我的错。
明⽇香突然从泪⽔中抬头望向他。
如果这能让你好受些，你经历这⼀切都是我的错。当第⼗五使徒来袭时，我⽆能为⼒。此外，我在你⾯前击败了你的同步率和其他使徒，让你俩都蒙羞了。
她就那样站在真嗣⾯前，听着真嗣的话，明⽇香已经停⽌了哭泣和颤抖。
⽼实说，明⽇香，我不想看到你这样。我宁愿看到你⾃信满满、让⼈讨厌的样⼦，也不愿看到你现在这样，实在太可怕了。你曾坚强到能将痛苦的记忆深藏⼼底，不断努⼒成为最好的⾃⼰，但那不也是⼀种逃避这些记忆的⽅式吗？如果你相信的话，我曾仰慕过你，呵呵……
当真嗣说出下⼀句话时，他直视着明⽇香的眼睛：“你是不是也在逃避那些同样藏在你⼼中的痛苦记忆？”
有那么⼀刻，沉默笼罩了四周。明⽇香似乎陷⼊了⽆声的震惊，而真嗣则背靠着门站⽴。他对⾃⼰的话感到有些后悔，因为这将迫使她也重新经历那些记忆。他不想再给她带来任何痛苦。他想要阻⽌她这样受苦，但他不知道该如何是好。他确信⾃⼰关⼼她，但这份关⼼究竟有多深？
突然间，明⽇香⼜开始哭泣。她低着头，抽泣着。“你怎么敢……”真嗣抬起头，因为明⽇香⼜开始说话了。
什么怎么了？
你怎么敢？！􀀁 明⽇香怒⽓冲冲地向他迈进⼀步，⼤声吼道。􀀁你怎么敢，偏偏是你，来教训我？！我，明⽇香·兰格雷·索拉尔！􀀁 真嗣⽆法再后退，他已经被逼到了离明⽇香尽可能远的地⽅。但她还是⼜向他迈了⼀步。􀀁我恨你。我恨你我恨你我恨你我恨你！！！我恨所有⼈！！！
真嗣现在真的害怕了，她显然已经失去理智。他不知道该怎么办，只能尽⼒说出脑海中浮现的最能安慰⼈的话。“A-Asuka，请停下。我-我-我不知道你正在经历什么……”
“你当然不知道，你这个愚蠢的……”
…但是，请，请告诉我，飞鸟，是什么让你如此憎恨所有⼈？
飞鸟的话语戛然而⽌。她⾃⼰也⽆法回答这个问题。她只是感觉到内⼼积压的恨意，想要将这⼀切发泄在眼前唯⼀的⼈􀀂真嗣⾝上。
但她做不到，她不明⽩这是什么感觉。⼀直以来都是真嗣在试图帮助她，她⼼⾥清楚。但她⽆法接受。他就是她憎恨的⼈。她最希望他死去。那么，为什么他偏偏是她最需要尊重的⼈呢？突然间，她感到疲惫，愤怒正在消融成悲伤，而她依旧不明所以。
明⽇香……
明⽇香抬头望向真嗣，这是她第⼀次真正意识到，他对她⼀如既往地充满同情。
我...我，真的有那么糟糕，以⾄于你真的想要结束⼀切吗？
我只剩下嗅觉了，别的什么都没了。我再也不能驾驶 Eva 了。为什么你就不能尊重我，让我结束这痛苦呢！！！
明⽇香，􀀁 真嗣终于觉得⾃⼰明⽩了为什么他如此在乎明⽇香。􀀁你真的想就这样结束吗？我曾对⾃⼰和别⼈说过同样的话，明⽇香，你永远不要说⾃⼰⼀⽆所有。总会有别的什么。我向你保证，明⽇香，请你⾄少让我尝试阻⽌你的痛苦，而不必求死。我告诉你不要放弃⽣命，这正是我对你的尊重。
􀀁真嗣…􀀁明⽇香感到⾃⼰仿佛⽆法呼吸。她最讨厌他，她⽐任何⼈都爱他。为什么？为什么她⼀直在逃避？她从未想要任何⼈安慰，但此刻她正渴望着。她发誓永不哭泣，现在却在真嗣⾯前落泪。这让她既愤怒⼜感到被关怀。
􀀁呃，明⽇香？􀀁真嗣轻声问道。􀀁什…什么…什么事？􀀁真嗣觉得⾃⼰可能做得太过分了，正当他犹豫是否应该让明⽇香独⾃⼀⼈时，她第⼀次抬头看向他，脸上没有了愤怒的扭曲。
􀀁你…这个傻⽠。􀀁 她的脸上⼀半是皱眉，⼀半是苦笑。
呃…什么?!
明⽇香再也控制不住⾃⼰，她不想再独⾃承受痛苦。她⼀度瘫软向地⾯，随即⼜振作起来，抬头望向真嗣疲惫的⾯庞。她感到恶⼼，⾃⼰竟让他经历了这⼀切。她知道，尽管他也经历了同样多，却从未要求过同情。“我为什么⾮要这么固执呢？”她⼼想。
就在那时，明⽇香突然扑向真嗣。他毫⽆防备，来不及做出任何反应。她撞进他的怀⾥，让他喘不过⽓来。他知道，在这种窒息状态下，他⽆法反抗。真嗣试图抓住什么，任何东西，⼿臂在空中乱挥。最终，他失去平衡，侧⾝倒在地上。而明⽇香，也随之倒下，依然紧紧抱住他的胸膛。
真嗣最终坐在了明⽇香房门与办公桌之间。他半坐着，双腿张开，而明⽇香几乎躺在了他⾝上。他本以为明⽇香会起⾝再次试图冲向阳台，但出乎意料的是，她依然紧紧抱着他。两⼈就这样略显尴尬地躺在地板上，而她已不再挣扎。
真嗣低头⼀看，发现明⽇香在颤抖。她在他⾝上哭泣，那种哭泣⽅式是他从未想过会在她这个年纪的⼈⾝上看到的。她哭泣着，呻吟着，仿佛正承受着痛苦。真嗣低头看着她，感到⽆⽐难过。看到她伏在⾃⼰肩头哭泣，他的⼼也跟着沉重起来。
不知道该做什么，更不知道该对明⽇香说什么，真嗣伸出双臂，将她拥⼊怀中，并将头靠在她的头上以⽰安慰。对他来说，在怀⾥安慰明⽇香感觉真的很奇怪，甚⾄有点尴尬，他的脸颊微微泛红。尽管如此，这是他此刻能为她想到的最好的事情。
明⽇香感觉到他的⼿臂环绕着⾃⼰，她本想给他⼀拳，但现在却是她在向真嗣寻求⽀持。她放松下来，任由真嗣抱着她，慢慢地将最近所有痛苦都倾诉给他。
当明⽇香在真嗣怀⾥哭泣时，天空随着夕阳西下而变得更加昏暗。他能看到⾃⼰之前掉在地上的那盒便当，离他们不远。真嗣终于感觉到，⾃⼰或许做了件有价值的事。想到能安慰明⽇香，他觉得⾃⼰更有意义了。
随着夜⾊渐深，明⽇香的呻吟声逐渐变成了抽泣，直到最后在真嗣怀⾥沉沉睡去。真嗣整夜未眠，不时轻抚她的背，提醒她⾃⼰就在⾝边。见她终于⼊睡，他叹了口⽓，仰头靠后。他同时感到宽慰和愉悦。宽慰的是她终于睡着了，愉悦的是他终于有机会⾯对⾯帮助明⽇香⾯对她的情感。他也很⾼兴，因为在其他任何时候，她都会对触碰或被他触碰的想法嗤之以⿐。
瞥了⼀眼床头柜，真嗣惊讶地发现已是凌晨⼀点半。他竟未察觉时间流逝。他猜想，这定是因为与明⽇香相伴。尽管他试图否认，但⽬睹了明⽇香另⼀⾯的他，感到与她之间的羁绊超越了⽣命中的任何⼈。他抱起她，再次痛⼼地意识到她消瘦了多少。
“天哪，明⽇香，”真嗣低声⾃语，将她安置在床上。“若我愿意，单⼿便能将你举起。你为何要这样……？”真嗣后退⼀步，望着她终于安详地躺在床上。低头看着地板上的凌乱，他不禁叹息。
􀀁唉，希望她能忽略这⼀点……􀀁 真嗣暗⾃思忖。􀀁……当然，明⽇香绝不会那么宽容，􀀁 他随即⼜想。
