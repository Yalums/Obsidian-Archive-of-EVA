### Chapter 1

Ok... well, as usual, when I started writing, this exploded.  
好吧...嗯，像往常一样，当我开始写作时，这东西就爆炸了。  
Discord chat, largely with Alex , gave me the idea to do a crack-mashup of Evangelion and The Hangover. Predictably, the results are also shot through with WAFF, because well... Me.  
与 Alex 在 Discord 上的聊天启发了我，让我想做一个《新世纪福音战士》和《宿醉》的疯狂混搭。不出所料，结果中也充满了温馨感人的片段，毕竟...是我嘛。

It's also hit 5k before I've gotten them out of the hotel room.  
而且，在我让他们离开酒店房间之前，字数就已经突破了 5 千。  
So, here's Part 1 of ? of Evangelion: The Hangover. This may or may not be mixed with A&T writing as I go forward.  
那么，这是《新世纪福音战士：宿醉》的第 1 部分，共？部分。随着故事的推进，可能会融入 A&T 的写作风格。  
To be clear, this is _not_ A&T's universe. This is early 2021, 3rd Impact never came, and SEELE and Gendo are no longer worries. Exactly how that happened may or may not come up in the story, but for now, just count them as dead or gone.  
明确一下，这里并非 A&T 的世界。这是 2021 年初，第三次冲击从未发生，SEELE 和碇源堂也不再是问题。具体他们是如何消失的，故事中可能会提及也可能不会，但目前只需将他们视为已死或已离去。  
And yes, that means everyone is old enough for what happens here.  
没错，这意味着所有人在这里都已足够成熟，能够应对发生的事情。

.

What happens in Vegas... 在拉斯维加斯发生的事...

Shinji Ikari woke up, and immediately regretted it. His head hurt. A lot. His stomach hurt. A lot. His arms and legs felt too heavy to move. And hurt. A lot. He didn't feel like a 20 year old man who'd just woken up from a deep sleep. He felt like a 200 year old man whose body was in revolt. He was tired and worn out, like he'd been running or exercising all night, and some strategic bits of him felt kind of sore like he'd been mas-...um… 'being introspective' all night.  
碇真嗣醒来，立刻就后悔了。他的头很痛。非常痛。他的胃也很痛。非常痛。他的四肢沉重得无法动弹。而且也很痛。非常痛。他感觉自己不像是一个刚从深度睡眠中醒来的 20 岁青年。他感觉自己像是一个身体正在反抗的 200 岁老人。他疲惫不堪，仿佛整夜都在奔跑或锻炼，某些关键部位还有些酸痛，好像他整夜都在自省……嗯……'进行内省'。

He almost hurt too much to move. His limbs felt so heavy... and kind of lumpy? Wait…  
他几乎痛得动弹不得。他的四肢感觉如此沉重……而且有点肿胀？等等……

With great effort, he pried his gluey eyes open, just a slit. The weak sunlight dribbling in between the curtains on the hotel suite's windows _still_ hurt his eyes. But not nearly as much as how much the sight that greeted them made his brain hurt and his heart clench.  
他费了很大劲才勉强将黏糊糊的眼皮撑开一条缝。透过酒店套房窗帘缝隙洒进来的微弱阳光依旧刺痛了他的眼睛。但远不及眼前所见之景给他带来的心痛和脑部冲击来得强烈。

Asuka Langley Soryu was right in his face.  
明日香·兰格雷就紧贴在他面前。

To be fair, she was achingly beautiful, as always. She'd been beautiful at 14, and now at 20 she was a true heartbreaker. What made his heart clench right now was how cute she was in her sleep… ten centimeters from his face. And how she was wrapped around him like he was her body pillow at home, the one she pretended was just for her comfort, not because she nuzzled it in her sleep and sometimes mumbled sweetly to it…. Not that he'd ever peeked into her room while he tried to work up the nerve to go in and talk to her!  
平心而论，她一如既往地令人心碎地美丽。十四岁时她就很美，如今二十岁的她更是名副其实的倾城佳人。此刻令他心痛的是她熟睡中的可爱模样……离他的脸只有十厘米。而且她像抱着家里的抱枕一样紧紧缠绕着他，那个她假装只是为了舒适而非因为她在睡梦中会依偎并偶尔对它甜蜜低语的抱枕……并非他曾鼓起勇气试图进入她的房间时偷看过！

Where was he? Oh, right, waking up in bed in a hotel with Asuka wrapped around him, no memory of how they'd ended up there, and, key point here, not a stitch of clothing on either of them. The killer hangover at least accounted for why he couldn't remember anything, though the circumstances of waking up with one of the people he was involved in a serious, long-term, maximum-awkward mutual crush-occasional-friendship-with-benefits-something made getting some answers on that front _kind of a priority._  
他在哪儿？哦，对了，在酒店的床上醒来，被明日香紧紧抱着，完全不记得他们是怎么到那儿的，而且，关键在于，两人身上一丝不挂。宿醉至少解释了为什么他什么都不记得，但醒来时身边是那个与他有着严肃、长期、极度尴尬的相互暗恋-偶尔友谊-带点好处的关系的人，这让弄清楚这一点变得相当紧迫。

On the other hand, waking up naked in bed with a girl you've literally dreamed about doing something like that with for years did lend itself to another obvious possible answer.  
另一方面，醒来时和一个你多年来实际上梦寐以求能和她发生这种事的女孩赤裸裸地躺在床上，确实提供了另一种显而易见的答案。

"Ah," Shinji muttered. "I'm having _that_ dream again."  
“啊，”真嗣喃喃自语，“我又在做那个梦了。”

His tiny utterance received a "Murrghph," of acknowledgement from his other side.  
他微弱的嘟囔换来了身旁一声含糊的“嗯”作为回应。

He blinked, and rolled his head to the right. A very familiar mop of blue hair greeted him.  
他眨了眨眼，将头转向右侧。一簇熟悉的蓝色发丝映入眼帘。

Rei Ayanami was glomped to his right arm just as firmly as Asuka was on his left. No wonder he couldn't move his limbs.  
在他的右臂上，绫波零同样紧紧地依偎着，就像左臂上的明日香一样。难怪他动弹不得。

"Oh, it's one of _those dreams," Shinji amended, still at whisper-levels of volume. Even in a nice dream, it was only considerate to not wake people, especially when they were as cute as Rei and Asuka._  
“哦，这是那种梦啊。”真嗣轻声修正道，音量依旧保持在耳语级别。即便是在美好的梦境中，不打扰他人也是基本的礼貌，尤其是当她们像绫波和明日香那样可爱时。

"Grumphlble," agreed another dreamer from across Shinji's legs.  
“咕噜姆布尔，”另一个梦者从真嗣腿的另一边附和道。

Shinji very carefully and slowly raised his head to look down his body. A sleepy and contented-looking Kaworu Nagisa was somehow peacefully sleeping laid across his and Rei's legs, his head in Rei's lap. He too somehow contrived to look really cute. Seriously, Kaworu's hair was just so silky and fluffy, it was a joy to run his fingers through and where the Hell had that come from, Shinji?  
真嗣小心翼翼地缓缓抬起头，目光顺着身体向下看去。睡眼惺忪、一脸满足的渚薰不知怎地安详地躺在他和绫波的腿上，头枕在绫波的膝间。他那副模样也莫名显得十分可爱。说真的，渚薰的头发真是丝滑又蓬松，让人忍不住想用手指去抚摸，这念头究竟是从哪儿冒出来的，真嗣？

Oh, right, that party six months ago.  
哦，对了，那场六个月前的派对。

_"Do it! Do it! Hahahah, bet you'll chicken out!" Asuka drunkenly cheered.  
"快做！快做！哈哈哈，我打赌你不敢！" 明日香醉醺醺地起哄道。_

_"It's ok if you don't want to, Shinji-kun," Kaworu said, blushing almost as hard as Shinji.  
"如果你不想做也没关系，真嗣君，" 渚薰说道，脸红得几乎和真嗣一样厉害。_

_"Nuh-uh!" Shinji slurred. "Asuka thinks I won't, and you're cute and nice and I've kind of been thinking about it for a while and Asuka once dared me to kiss her and I did and we both liked it so she can't say anything and fuck I talk too much. Come 'ere." Shinji grabbed Kaworu, pulled him into a hug, and planted a nice, solid kiss right on the Nephilim's soft lips.  
"不不！" 真嗣含糊地说道，"明日香觉得我不敢，但你又可爱又善良，我其实已经想了很久，而且明日香有一次激我吻她，我照做了，我们俩都很喜欢，所以她没资格说什么，操，我说得太多了。过来。" 真嗣抓住渚薰，把他拉进怀里，结结实实地在天使柔软的唇上吻了一下。_

_Asuka's drunken cheer of approval was barely heard. Shinji couldn't stop himself from running his hands through Kaworu's delightfully silky hair, pressing him close. He only felt even more excited when Kaworu responded to Shinji's other hand sliding south to get a nice firm grip on Kaworu's perfect backside by matching Shinji's move with his own.  
明日香醉醺醺的欢呼声几乎听不见。真嗣情不自禁地用手抚摸着渚薰那令人愉悦的丝滑头发，将他紧紧抱住。当渚薰回应真嗣另一只手向下滑去，紧紧抓住他完美的臀部时，真嗣感到更加兴奋，渚薰也以同样的动作回应。_

_Things escalated slightly. Then some more. When they finally broke apart, both of them had their shirts half-off, their pants unbuttoned, and a slightly wild look in their eyes. Shinji reluctantly pulled his hand out of Kaworu's boxers.  
事情逐渐升级，再升级。当他们最终分开时，两人的衬衫都半敞着，裤子扣子解开，眼中闪烁着些许狂野的光芒。真嗣恋恋不舍地从薰的内裤里抽出手来。_

_"Oh my fucking Gott, that was so hot," Asuka cheered. "I have never been so happy to be wrong! This is the best 20th birthday ever!"  
"哦我的天哪，真是太刺激了，"明日香欢呼道，"我从没这么高兴自己错了！这真是我有史以来最棒的 20 岁生日！"_

_"Do it again," Rei commented, quietly but with a hungry, focused look in her eyes. Rei always got strangely intense when drunk. Her verbal filters tended to evaporate, too. "I wish to see more of that."  
"再来一次，"丽评论道，声音虽轻，眼中却闪烁着饥渴而专注的光芒。丽一喝酒就会变得异常专注。她的言辞过滤器也往往随之消失。"我想多看看那个。"_

_Kaworu wobbled a bit on his feet. Drink always hit him pretty hard, though he never was anything less than cheerful. He just got… cuddly. "Not...not that I… dun wanna, but… I thought…" He hiccuped. "I thought you and Shhhhhinji were kind of a thing again. Or waszh that last month?"  
渚薰脚步有些踉跄。酒精总是让他反应强烈，尽管他从未失去过那份欢快。只是变得...格外亲昵。“不是...不是说我...不想，但是...我以为...”他打了个嗝。“我以为你和真嗣又有点什么了。还是说那是上个月的事？”_

_"Because guy-on-guy is HOT!" Asuka and Rei said in stereo. "Just like guys like watching girls make out, right?" Asuka continued. "Like this!" She grabbed an entirely unresisting Rei and gave her a kiss. Technically just one, but it went on for a while. Eventually, she had to somewhat pry Rei off her. "Sheee? And I'm mad at Shinji again thiz week, but this is a great way for making me happy with him again. So make with the yaoi action again!"  
“因为男男互动超火辣的！”明日香和丽齐声说道。“就像男生喜欢看女生亲热一样，对吧？”明日香接着说。“就像这样！”她抓住毫无反抗的丽，给了她一个吻。严格来说只是一次，但持续了相当久。最终，她不得不稍微把丽从自己身上拉开。“这样啊？我这周又对真嗣生气了，但这种方式能让我再次对他感到开心。所以再来点耽美动作吧！”_

_Shinji found he had no real objection to kissing Kaworu some more. His on-again-off-again semi-girlfriend said it was ok, and Kaworu_ _**was**_ _really cute and a good friend._ _And_ _**fuck**__, was he a good kisser!_  
碇真嗣发现自己并不真正反对与渚薰多亲吻几次。他那时而亲近时而疏远的半女友说这没问题，而且渚薰真的很可爱，是个好朋友。而且，该死，他吻技真棒！

Still, them all ending up in bed _at once_ was more likely a dream than anything. Seriously, the only time Shinji was _that_ ambitious was in his dreams. And hadn't he had the foursome one the night before they left on...that… trip? "Where are… oh, right. Misato's conference thing. Vegas," Shinji finally remembered.  
尽管如此，他们同时躺在一张床上更像是梦境而非现实。说真的，真嗣只有在梦里才会如此雄心勃勃。而且，在他们出发去...那次...旅行前一晚，他不就梦到了四人同床的情景吗？“他们在哪儿...哦，对了。美里参加的那个会议。在拉斯维加斯。”真嗣终于想起来了。

They were in Vegas. This was Caesar's Palace. He remembered checking in… yesterday? Misato had dragged them all to some 'Retrospectives on the Angel War' conference, declaring she wasn't going to let the five of them dodge it anymore, now that they were all legally of age. Asuka had used that excuse to get them out of a lot of Angel War stuff, once she'd gotten tired of the initial year of publicity.  
他们在拉斯维加斯。这里是凯撒宫。他记得昨天办理了入住……？美里硬拉着他们参加了某个“天使战争回顾”会议，宣称再也不会让他们五个逃避了，毕竟现在他们都已成年。明日香曾用这个借口逃避了许多与天使战争相关的事务，自从她厌倦了最初一年的宣传活动后。

Wait.

Vegas. All in bed together. Not wearing anything. Couldn't remember last night. The only thing that was needed to complete the bad joke was…  
拉斯维加斯。全都躺在一张床上。一丝不挂。记不清昨晚发生了什么。唯一缺的就是……

Shinji looked down at his left hand, just barely visible between him and Asuka.  
碇真嗣低头看向自己的左手，它在他和明日香之间若隐若现。

There was a nice, fairly fancy band of gold and diamond on it.  
上面有一枚漂亮且颇为精致的黄金钻石戒指。

And on Asuka's. 还有明日香的那枚。

And on Rei's. 还有丽的那份。

….and on Kaworu's. ……还有渚薰的。

"...oh. Shit," Shinji said.  
"“……哦。该死，”真嗣说道。”

Ok. Ok. Don't panic, Shinji. There had to be a logical explanation for this. The pounding headache and full bladder suggested maybe this wasn't a dream. The rings they were all wearing did too, since not even his wildest dreams included marrying all of them. So… ok, try to wake them up one at a time, to avoid mass panic.  
好了，好了，别慌，真嗣。这肯定有个合乎逻辑的解释。剧烈的头痛和胀满的膀胱暗示这可能不是梦。他们手上戴的戒指也是，因为即便在他最疯狂的梦里，也不曾想过要娶她们所有人。所以……好吧，试着一个一个叫醒她们，以免引起集体恐慌。

"Kaworu!" he hissed. Kaworu was usually cheerful and sensible, right? He was a good one to wake first.  
"卡沃鲁！" 他低声唤道。卡沃鲁通常既开朗又理智，对吧？他是最适合第一个叫醒的人。

"Mmmurble," Kaworu replied, nuzzling his face deeper into Rei's lap. Rei did not seem to mind.  
“嗯嗯呜噜，”渚薰回答道，将脸更深地埋进绫波的膝间。绫波似乎并不介意。

"Kaworu! Wake _up_!" Shinji said a little louder.  
"薰！醒醒！" 真嗣稍微提高了声音说道。

Kaworu's eyes snapped open. He vaguely focused in on Shinji, and started to smile.  
渚薰的双眼猛地睁开。他朦胧地聚焦在真嗣身上，随即露出了微笑。

Then his face turned green, and he murmured, "Oh Gott…" before leaping out of the bed and streaking for the bathroom. Sounds of extensive, deep vomiting began.  
随后他的脸色变得苍白，喃喃自语道：“哦，天哪……”紧接着从床上跳起，直奔浴室。随即传来一阵剧烈而深沉的呕吐声。

Shinji sighed. Ok, so much for plan A. Plan B.  
真嗣叹了口气。好吧，A 计划算是泡汤了。启动 B 计划。

"Rei!" Shinji tried wiggling his right arm. "Rei, wake up! We've got a situation!"  
"绫波！" 真嗣试图扭动他的右臂。"绫波，醒醒！我们有麻烦了！"

"Whuh?" Rei mumbled, cracking one crimson eye open. She smiled sleepily. "Oh, hi Shinji." She ducked her head forward to kiss him.  
"嗯？" 丽咕哝着，睁开一只深红色的眼睛。她困倦地笑了笑，"哦，嗨，真嗣。" 她向前低头，轻轻吻了他。

Shinji found himself helplessly returning the kiss. Rei was always sweet and fun to kiss. They'd intermittently dated for a few months during one of his and Asuka's 'off' times. It had more or less ended when at yet another liquor-fueled party Rei had literally pushed him into Asuka's arms, saying 'She looks sad. You make her smile.' Rei had then sat back and beamed at them while he and Asuka sucked face for the rest of the night.  
真嗣发现自己不由自主地回应了那个吻。丽总是那么甜美，吻她总是乐趣无穷。在他们和明日香某段“分手”期间，他和丽断断续续地约会了几个月。这段关系差不多在又一次酒精助兴的派对上结束了，当时丽直接把他推到了明日香怀里，说：“她看起来很难过。你去让她笑吧。”然后丽就坐在一旁，微笑着看他和明日香整晚亲热。

"Rei-mmmwha. I mean, Rei, stop! We… I think we…" he swallowed. "Umm… do you remember anything about last night?"  
"丽-嗯唔。我是说，丽，停下！我们…我觉得我们…" 他咽了咽口水。"呃…你还记得昨晚的事吗？"

Rei closed her eyes and snuggled back down, smiling contentedly. "Not really."  
丽闭上眼睛，满足地微笑着，又蜷缩回去。“并没有。”

"I...I think we got married."  
"我...我想我们结婚了。"

Rei opened one eye again. "Which? Us? You and Asuka? About time..." she said sleepily.  
丽再次睁开一只眼睛。“哪个？我们？你和明日香？终于..."她睡意朦胧地说。

"All of us." “我们所有人。”

"Oh." Rei closed her eye again. "That's nice." She yawned, and started to snore softly.  
“哦。”丽再次闭上了眼睛。“那挺好的。”她打了个哈欠，开始轻轻地打起鼾来。

Shinji wished his hand was free so he could facepalm. "Big help you are, Rei…"  
真嗣真希望自己空出一只手来捂脸。“你可真帮了大忙啊，绫波……”

Ok, plan B no good either. Plan C was to chew his arm off so he could make his escape, since plan D, 'wake up Asuka and explain this' was much scarier.  
好吧，计划 B 也不行。计划 C 是咬断自己的手臂以便逃脱，因为计划 D，“叫醒明日香并解释这一切”，要可怕得多。

...He couldn't reach his arm with his teeth without waking her. Crap. Plan C was out.  
...他无法在不吵醒她的情况下用牙齿够到自己的手臂。该死。C 计划泡汤了。

_'Oh come on, Shinji. Is it_ _**really** so scary to wake up the woman you've kind of been in love with for five years and tell her you all are now married somehow? You've had this dream too!'_  
“哎呀，真嗣，不就是叫醒你暗恋了五年的女人，告诉她你们现在莫名其妙结婚了嘛，有那么可怕吗？你也做过这个梦的！”

_'Not when I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED! Also, I doubt she'll be too ecstatic when I mention 'Rei and Kaworu too', will she?!''  
'在我连发生了什么都记不起来的时候，怎么可能冷静！而且，我要是提到“丽和薰也”，她大概也不会太高兴吧，不是吗？！'_

_'Ok, fair point. Counter-point: She_ _looks_ _**really**_ _cute and happy right now.'_  
好吧，说得有理。反驳一下：她现在看起来真的很可爱又开心。

Shinji gave up arguing with his brain. It never worked anyway. He looked down at Asuka. Alright, yeah, she _did_ look amazingly cute and happy. She always did when they woke up together, something that to be fair happened moderately often over the last few years. But no matter how often, one of them would say or do something stupid, or one of their insecurities would rear its head, and they'd break up again.  
碇真嗣放弃了与自己的大脑争论，反正这从来都没用。他低头看着明日香，好吧，没错，她的确看起来异常可爱和开心。每当他们一起醒来时，她总是这样，公平地说，这种情况在过去几年里相当频繁地发生。但无论多么频繁，总会有一个人说出或做出愚蠢的事情，或者他们中的某个人内心的不安会再次浮现，然后他们又会分手。

Then again, since they'd been living together for five years, and got back together as often as they broke up, it was more like they'd been dating for five years, with occasional 'I'm not talking to you because I'm angry' periods.  
不过话说回来，既然他们已经同居了五年，且复合的次数和分手一样频繁，这更像是一场持续了五年的恋爱，期间偶尔穿插着“我生气了，不想和你说话”的阶段。

He still loved her. That was the annoying part. No matter what they did or said to each other, he couldn't stop loving her. For all the arguments, when she was sweet, it was… like nothing else in the world. At such times, he could _almost_ understand his father's willingness to break the world to get his own love back.  
他依然爱着她。这才是最恼人的部分。无论他们彼此间做了什么或说了什么，他都无法停止对她的爱。尽管争吵不断，但当她温柔时，那种感觉……仿佛世间万物都黯然失色。在那些时刻，他几乎能理解父亲为了找回自己的爱愿意打破整个世界的决心。

Of course, then he'd remember his father was a giant asshole who'd been party to a conspiracy to kill three billion people, and out _that_ moment of sympathy went.  
当然，紧接着他就会想起他父亲是个大混蛋，参与了一场谋杀三十亿人的阴谋，那一刻的同情心也就烟消云散了。

Anyhow, Asuka. Smiling, sleeping in his arms. A really nice wakeup, except for the part where he had to explain the rings they were all wearing.  
无论如何，明日香。微笑着，在他怀里安睡。真是个美好的清晨，除了他不得不解释他们所有人手上戴的戒指那部分。

He took a deep breath. "Asuka?"  
他深吸了一口气。“明日香？”

"Mmmm?" “嗯？”

"I need you to wake up."  
"我需要你醒来。"

"Dun wanna. Headache. Hangover. Fuck. Why did we drink so much?"  
不想动。头疼。宿醉。该死。我们干嘛喝这么多？

"Do you remember last night?"  
“你还记得昨晚的事吗？”

"No."

Shinji bit his lip. 真嗣咬了咬嘴唇。

As the pause lengthened, Asuka stirred a bit. Finally, she opened one eye a slit. "Why?" she growled suspiciously.  
随着停顿的延长，明日香微微动了动。最终，她眯起一只眼，狐疑地低吼道：“为什么？”

"You have to promise not to get mad."  
“你得答应不生气。”

"Shinji, we've known each other for five years and change by now. Woken up this exact way more than once. Since when has that _ever_ worked?"  
“真嗣，我们相识已有五年多，这样的早晨也不是第一次了。什么时候这招管用过？”

"Thought it was worth a shot."  
“想着值得一试。”

She sighed. "Can I have a few more minutes to enjoy waking up in your arms before we get to the inevitable disaster that makes us mad at each other again?"  
她叹了口气。“在我们再次因为那不可避免的灾难而互相生气之前，我能再享受几分钟在你怀里醒来的时光吗？”

"Um…. yeah, I think we're ok on that one."  
“嗯……是的，我想这方面我们没问题。”

"Good. I like this part. Stupid sexy Shinji," she muttered. "...did we have sex last night? Bits of me are sore."  
“好。我喜欢这部分。愚蠢又性感的真嗣。”她喃喃自语。“……我们昨晚做爱了吗？我有些地方酸痛。”

"I honestly can't remember. I _think_ so? We had a bit to drink."  
我真的记不清了。应该是吧？我们喝了不少。

"Scheiße… I hate it when that happens. Sex with you is _good_," Asuka complained. She sighed again. "Alright, hit me. What did we do this time?"  
“该死……我讨厌这种事发生。和你做爱感觉不错，”明日香抱怨道。她又叹了口气。“好吧，说吧。这次我们又做了什么？”

"I think we got married."  
“我想我们结婚了。”

Shinji's heart did a little leap when, out of the rapid kaleidoscope of emotions that flashed across Asuka's face, the preeminent one was joy. But wariness soon came to the forefront. "Ok… so you wanted me to promise not to get mad because… wait, we're both still in bed, I don't remember anything, and you don't either, so... what makes you think we got married?"  
当看到在明日香脸上闪过的纷繁情绪中，最突出的是喜悦时，真嗣的心不由得小小地跳动了一下。但很快，警觉便占据了上风。“好吧……所以你让我承诺不生气是因为……等等，我们俩都还在床上，我什么都不记得，你也是，那么……你凭什么认为我们结婚了？”

Shinji wiggled his left hand free and took hers, raising them in front of Asuka's face.  
真嗣挣脱了左手，握住她的手，将它们举到明日香面前。

Her eyes nearly crossed. "Oh… wow… um,... That's a nice ring….rings." She swallowed. "Ok...so…. We're married?"  
她的眼睛几乎要瞪出来了。“哦……哇……呃，……这戒指真漂亮……戒指。”她咽了咽口水。“好吧……所以……我们结婚了？”

Shinji winced. She sounded… happy. Hopeful. Eager, even. "Yyyyeah, that's… where it gets complicated."  
真嗣皱了皱眉。她听起来……很高兴。充满希望。甚至有些急切。“呃呃，是的，那……这就变得复杂了。”

"Because we just had one of the most important moments in our lives, and we can't remember Scheiße?"  
“因为我们刚刚经历了生命中最重要的时刻之一，而我们却什么也记不起来？”

Shinji rolled onto his back to reveal Rei still snuggled up on his far side. "Rei's wearing a ring too. Exactly like ours."  
真嗣翻身仰躺，露出丽依然蜷缩在他远侧的身影。“丽也戴着戒指。和我们的一模一样。”

"...we married Wondergirl _too_?!"  
“……我们也娶了明日香？！”

"And," Shinji waved at the bathroom door. Another angonized "HUUUUGGGRRRRRRHHGNLBBBBLE!" came from within.  
“而且，”真嗣朝浴室门挥了挥手。里面又传来一声痛苦的“呼——呃——呃——咕噜噜！”

Asuka blinked at him for a moment. "What."  
明日香对他眨了眨眼，片刻后说道：“什么。”

"I _said_ it got complicated."  
“我说了，情况变得复杂了。”

"How is the _four_ of us being married even possible?"  
"我们四个怎么可能结婚呢？"

"This is Vegas, and all the weird polygamy and stranger stuff the US authorized after Second Impact in the name of boosting birthrates?"  
"这里是拉斯维加斯，美国在第二次冲击后为了提高生育率，批准了各种奇怪的一夫多妻制和其他更离谱的东西。"

"And I'm still a US Citizen, so this is all probably legal." Asuka rubbed her face. "Where is Misato? This is all her fault, I'm sure of it. I'm going to kill her."  
"我还是个美国公民，所以这些大概都是合法的。" 明日香揉了揉脸。"美里在哪儿？这全是她的错，我敢肯定。我要杀了她。"

"I don't know. I just woke up. I tried waking the others without disturbing you, but Kaworu is… well, you can hear him. Rei just said 'that's nice', and went back to sleep."  
“我不知道。我刚醒来。我试着在不吵醒你的情况下叫醒其他人，但渚是……嗯，你可以听到他。绫波只是说了句‘那挺好’，就又睡回去了。”

Asuka sat up far enough to mildly glare at the bluenette. "She's lucky she's so cute, or I'd be more upset with her." Asuka's eyes narrowed. "What's that on her face?"  
明日香坐起身来，足够远地瞪着那位蓝发女孩。“她真幸运，这么可爱，不然我会更生气的。”明日香的眼睛眯了起来。“她脸上那是什么？”

Shinji looked closer. Rei shift had revealed what looked like a bandage on her face. "A… some gauze? Did she hurt herself last night?"  
真嗣凑近了些。丽换班时露出了她脸上看似绷带的东西。“是……某种纱布吗？她昨晚受伤了吗？”

Asuka reached over Shinji and gently tugged at the bandage, already coming up a bit from where Rei's face had rubbed on the pillow. It came away easily, revealing a small, fresh tattoo under the corner of Rei's left eye. "Is that… kanji?"  
明日香越过真嗣，轻轻地拉扯着绷带，那部分已经因为绫波的脸颊摩擦枕头而有些松动。绷带轻易地脱落，露出了绫波左眼下角一个新鲜的小纹身。“那是……汉字吗？”

Shinji examined it. He had to cover his mouth to avoid laughing out loud. "Snrk. Y-Yeah, it is."  
真嗣仔细端详着它，不得不捂住嘴以免笑出声来。“噗。嗯，确实是。”

Asuka shifted her glare to him. "Why are you laughing? What does it say?"  
明日香将目光转向他，厉声问道：“你笑什么？上面写了什么？”

"...Soryu." "...索琉。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Rei has your last name tattooed on her face. Right in the 'path of her tears', no less."  
"丽在你的脸上纹了你的姓氏。就在她的‘泪痕’上，毫不含糊。"

Asuka reached over to shake Rei awake. "Rei! Rei! Wake up!"  
明日香伸手去摇醒丽。"丽！丽！快醒醒！"

"Mmmuh?" “嗯？”

"...do you know you've got a tattoo on your face?"  
"...你知道你脸上有个纹身吗？"

"...what?" "...什么？"

"Why do you have _my name_ on your face, Wondergirl?" Asuka demanded.  
"你为什么把我的名字纹在脸上，奇迹少女？" 明日香质问道。

"I… do not remember getting a tattoo?"  
"我…不记得有纹身啊？"

Asuka reached up to gently draw a circle around the mark, carefully not touching it. "Not kidding, First. You've got my name's kanji right here."  
明日香伸出手，轻轻地在标记周围画了一个圈，小心翼翼地没有触碰到它。“不是开玩笑，队长。你这里纹着我的名字的汉字。”

"You... marked me?" Rei said hesitantly.  
“你……标记了我？” 丽犹豫地说。

"How should I know?!" Asuka threw her hands up. "I can't remember anything about last night after… like, mid-afternoon!" Asuka pulled Rei's left hand up. "And… are we fucking married now?! Do you remember anything?"  
“我怎么知道？！”明日香双手一挥。“昨晚从下午中段开始的事我一点印象都没有！”明日香拉起绫波的左手。“而且……我们现在是结婚了？！你记得什么吗？”

"Married? To...you? I thought…" Rei looked at her ring, then the matching ones on Asuka and Shinji. "Oh. And… Kaworu too?"  
"结婚？和你...你？我以为…" 丽看着她的戒指，然后是明日香和真嗣手上相配的戒指。"哦。还有… 渚薰也是？"

"HUUURRGGHGBBLBBLBBLLL!" “呼噜噜噜咕噜咕噜噜！”

"Apparently." 显然。

"Oh...I'm ok with this." “哦……我对此没意见。”

Asuka and Shinji stared at her like she'd grown a new head.  
明日香和真嗣盯着她，仿佛她头上长出了新脑袋。

"What?" Rei said. "You're all hot and I love all of you? I've slept with all three of you at least once in the last 4 years?"  
“什么？”绫波说，“你们都热得不行而我爱你们所有人？过去四年里我和你们三个至少都睡过一次？”

Shinji's eyes got wide and he looked at Asuka, a grin starting to form on his lips.  
真嗣的眼睛睁得大大的，他看着明日香，嘴角开始浮现出一丝笑意。

Asuka blushed and looked away. "Look, we were all drunk and you and I were fighting again. Rei was… comforting."  
明日香脸红了，转过头去。“听着，我们当时都喝醉了，你和我又吵了起来。丽她……在安慰我。”

"Then we did it again the next we-" Asuka reached over to grab Rei by the back of the head and seal her lips with a kiss.  
“然后我们第二天又——” 明日香伸手过去抓住绫波的后脑勺，用一个吻封住了她的唇。

Rei's smile when Asuka pulled back was beatific. "And that would be one of many reasons I do not mind the idea of being her wife," she said quietly.  
明日香退开后，绫波的微笑显得无比神圣。“而这只是我愿意成为她妻子的众多原因之一，”她轻声说道。

Asuka covered her face with her hands. "I'm too hungover for this. I'm going to make some hangover cure. Shinji, you see if Kaworu needs any help in there before he vomits up the rest of his internal organs. Rei, see if you can look around and find any traces of Misato, Hikari, their boytoys, or anything that looks like marriage certificates, whatever. If we really got married, there's got to at least be a receipt or _something_.  
明日香双手捂脸，"我宿醉得厉害，得去弄点解酒的东西。真嗣，你去看看卡罗有没有需要帮忙的，别让他把剩下的内脏都吐出来。丽，你四处找找，看有没有美里、光、他们的男友，或者任何像结婚证的东西。如果我们真的结婚了，总该有张收据什么的吧。"

"These are very nice rings," Rei said, looking at hers again. She raised her head, looking into space. "Also, I think I have been… 'ridden hard and put away wet'."  
“这些戒指非常漂亮。”丽看着自己的戒指再次说道。她抬起头，目光投向远方。“而且，我觉得自己好像……‘被使劲骑过，然后湿漉漉地收起来了’。”

Shinji nearly fell over on his way to the bathroom. Asuka walked right into one of the barstools around the counter of the kitchenette. "W-What?" she sputtered.  
真嗣在去洗手间的路上差点摔倒。明日香则径直撞上了厨房吧台旁的一个凳子。“什、什么？”她结巴道。

"My nether bits feel well and extensively used. Whatever happened last night, I believe a substantial part of it must have been extended sexual intercourse, most likely in consummation of our marriage." Rei looked vaguely annoyed. "I wish I could remember that."  
“我的下体感觉被充分且广泛地使用了。无论昨晚发生了什么，我相信其中很大一部分必定是长时间的性行为，很可能是我们婚姻的圆满完成。”丽看起来有些模糊的烦恼。“我希望我能记得那件事。”

Asuka turned back to look at Rei again. "Wondergirl, are you still drunk? You're sounding like you do when hammered."  
明日香转回来看着丽。“三无少女，你还在醉吗？你听起来就像喝醉时那样。”

"No, but I might be somewhat giddy from the prospect of you all being my spouses. I find the concept... most agreeable." There was no change in Rei's usual deadpan cool.  
"不，但我可能有点儿因为你们都将成为我的配偶而感到兴奋。我觉得这个概念……非常合我意。" 丽平常的冷淡表情没有丝毫变化。

Asuka muttered something in German and began pulling bottles of orange juice and Gatorade out of the kitchenette's fridge. "Hurensöhne! There's Tylenol in the minibar… but it's twelve dollars for a bottle! What a ripoff!"  
明日香用德语咕哝了一句，开始从厨房的小冰箱里拿出橙汁和佳得乐瓶子。"混蛋！迷你吧里有泰诺……但一瓶要十二美元！真是坑人！"

"We're probably not the first hangover sufferers in Vegas," Shinji said, entering the bathroom. "Hey, Kaworu are you-" He froze and backed out of the bathroom slowly. "Uhhhh… Rei, Asuka? There's a creature in the bathtub."  
"我们大概不是拉斯维加斯第一批宿醉的人，"真嗣说着走进浴室。"嘿，渚薰，你——"他突然僵住，缓缓退出了浴室。"呃……绫波，明日香？浴缸里有只生物。"

"You found Pen Pen?" “你找到 Pen Pen 了？”

Shinji shook his head and cracked the door open to reveal a polar bear in the tub. "Wrong Arctic."  
真嗣摇了摇头，推开门，只见一只北极熊泡在浴缸里。“找错北极了。”

Kaworu slowly raised his head from the toilet bowl, feebly wiping at his chin. "...Oh Gott. Wait… maybe he will eat me, and end my suffering," he said weakly.  
渚薰缓缓从马桶边抬起头，无力地擦拭着下巴。“……哦，天哪。等等……也许他会吃了我，结束我的痛苦。”他虚弱地说道。

"Kaworu are you-" Shinji whispered. He tiptoed his way back into the bathroom. His eyes sought Kaworu's hand. Yup, matching ring. "Tell me you remember last night?"  
"渚薰，你——" 真嗣低声问道。他踮着脚尖悄悄回到浴室。目光寻找着渚薰的手。没错，是同款的戒指。"告诉我，你还记得昨晚的事吗？"

"Huh? Uh… no...not a thing past…" Kaworu knitted his brow. "Um,... about the point where Misato said we...wait… weren't we going to celebrate Touji and Hikari's engagement?"  
“嗯？呃…不…没有什么事过去…”渚薰皱起眉头。“嗯…在美里说我们…等等…我们不是要去庆祝真治和光子的订婚吗？”

"Well… um… how about you slowly, carefully follow me out of the bathroom, and away from the giant carnivore…" Shinji took another look at the still sleeping polar bear. "...That is wearing a fez and cuddling a bottle of Stolichnaya?"  
“呃…嗯…要不你慢慢来，小心地跟着我离开浴室，远离那只巨大的食肉动物…” 真嗣又看了一眼仍在熟睡的北极熊。“…它还戴着一顶费兹帽，抱着一瓶斯托利查那伏特加？”

"Definitely Misato's fault," Asuka said.  
“绝对是美里小姐的错，”明日香说。

"But if I stay in here, maybe I'll get lucky and he'll kill me," Kaworu complained. "Oh Gott, my head…"  
"但如果我留在这里，或许我会走运，他可能会杀了我。" 渚薰抱怨道，"哦，天哪，我的头……"

"Kaworu, I _really_ want you to not get eaten by a possibly hungover bear," Shinji said. "Especially when we… er… might be married now."  
"渚薰，我真的希望你不要被一只可能宿醉的熊吃掉，" 真嗣说道。"尤其是在我们……呃……可能现在已经结婚了的情况下。"

Kaworu lolled his head around to blink blearily at Shinji. "...what?"  
渚薰懒洋洋地转过头，睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着真嗣。“……什么？”

Shinji helped his...husband? To stand up, and supported him as they withdrew cautiously from the bathroom. Shinji closed the door, wincing at even the tiny click the latch made when he did.  
真嗣扶着他的...丈夫？站起身来，小心翼翼地扶着他从浴室撤出。真嗣关上门，听到门锁那微小的咔嗒声时还皱了皱眉。

"Oh, don't worry, Shinji. Lieutenant Growlski won't hurt you unless you try to take away his vodka," Rei said cheerily. Well, cheerily for Rei.  
“哦，别担心，真嗣。格罗尔斯基中尉不会伤害你的，除非你试图抢走他的伏特加，”丽欢快地说道。好吧，对丽来说算是欢快了。

"Lieutenant… Growlski? Rei, how do you know its name?"  
"中尉……格罗尔斯基？丽，你怎么知道它的名字？"

"I have no idea." Rei rustled some papers. "I think I may have found our wedding papers. And a...note from Misato?"  
"我完全不知道。" 丽翻动了几页文件。"我觉得我可能找到了我们的结婚证书。还有一封……美里小姐的便条？"

"What does it say?" Asuka said, pouring out four glasses of juice and Gatorade and placing painkillers beside each glass. Kaworu allowed Shinji to guide him to a stool at the counter, where he slumped forward and put his head down.  
"上面写了什么？" 明日香说着，倒出四杯果汁和佳得乐，并在每杯旁边放上止痛药。渚薰任由真嗣引导他到吧台的凳子上，他向前一倾，把头埋在双臂之间。

"I do not know. It is written entirely in Drunk Misato." She walked over to Asuka and handed her the note.  
"我不知道。这完全是用醉醺醺的律子写的。" 她走到明日香身边，把纸条递给她。

Asuka looked at the paper, shook her head, and calmly handed the note over to Shinji. "You're the most Japanese of us. I already can't read normal kanji, nevermind... _that_."  
明日香看了看纸条，摇了摇头，平静地把它递给了真嗣。"你是最日本人的。我连正常的汉字都看不懂，更别提...这个了。"

Shinji squinted at the paper, but shook his head as well. "This isn't Kanji. This is... Drunk Misato. There's not even one actual character on here. There's a sketch of a bottle and… I think that's a dickbutt." He looked at Rei. "No other sign of her?"  
真嗣眯着眼睛看纸条，但也摇了摇头。"这不是汉字。这是...醉醺醺的律子。这里甚至没有一个真正的字符。有一个瓶子的草图和…我想那是个屁股。"他看着绫波。"没有她的其他迹象吗？"

"Her bed is not slept in, and all that's here is her underwear."  
"她的床没有睡过的痕迹，这里只有她的内衣。"

Shinji sighed, and took a deep, forced swallow from his glass before starting to sort through the papers.  
真嗣叹了口气，强迫自己从杯中深深地喝了一口，然后开始整理文件。

"What's the verdict?" Asuka asked after a few minutes of paper shuffling.  
"结论是什么？" 几分钟后，明日香在纸张翻动的声音中问道。

"According to all this, yes, we're all married, as a quartet, no, I don't know how that all works, yes, I'm serious, and no, we're not getting out of this." He sighed. "Those same post-Second Impact laws that allow all this also say we can't get any kind of annulment or divorce for at least 96 hours."  
"根据这一切，是的，我们四个人结婚了，不，我不知道这是怎么运作的，是的，我是认真的，而且不，我们摆脱不了这个局面。" 他叹了口气。"那些在第二次冲击后制定的法律，允许这一切的同时也规定了至少 96 小时内我们无法获得任何形式的无效宣告或离婚。"

"And we fly back to Japan in 48," Asuka pointed out.  
"而我们 48 小时后就要飞回日本，" 明日香指出。"

"I… do not wish to get a divorce," Rei said softly. "And it would be difficult to get all the tattoos removed."  
“我……不想离婚，”丽平静地说道，“而且要去除所有纹身也挺难的。”

"You don't want to… wait, what tattoos?" Asuka said.  
“你不想……等等，什么纹身？”明日香说。

Rei pointed at Shinji's chest. "You have Asuka, my, and Kaworu's names over your heart. He has a matching set of yours, mine, and Asuka's. I have Asuka's last name on my face, and I suspect from the soreness, yours and Kaworu's on my back. Asuka, could you turn around and move your hair off your back?"  
丽指着真嗣的胸口说：“你的心口有我和明日香、渚的名字。他有一套和你、我和明日香的对应纹身。我脸上是明日香的姓氏，而且从酸痛感来看，背上还有你和渚的。明日香，你能转过身来把头发撩开吗？”

Shinji jerked his head down to stare at his chest. Yup, there were fresh, sharp katakana spelling out the three names, right over his heart, with Asuka's in the middle, a bit larger. It had probably gone first.  
碇真嗣猛地低下头，凝视着自己的胸膛。没错，那里清晰地刻着三个用锐利片假名拼写的名字，正位于心脏上方，其中明日香的名字居中，稍大一些。它可能是最先刻上的。

"Well, do I?" Asuka demanded.  
“那么，我有吗？”明日香质问道。

Shinji jerked his head back up. ...partway up. He got stuck for a second staring at Asuka's admittedly perfect backside. He never got tired of staring at…. Oh, right, he was supposed to be looking for tattoos!  
真嗣猛地抬起头，...只抬到一半。他愣了一会儿，盯着明日香那无可挑剔的背影。他怎么也看不够……哦，对了，他应该是在找纹身！

When his eyes got a little higher, there they were. His name in fancy Western script, right on the small of her back, with Kaworu and Rei's names forming part of a filigreed circle around it. It was… distractingly pretty… The swirling, elaborate lettering made him want to trace his fingers over it, following the letters.  
当他的视线稍稍上移，那行字便映入眼帘。他的名字以华丽的西文书写，正位于她腰背的凹陷处，而渚薰与绫波的名字则环绕其周，构成了一圈精巧的花纹。这图案……美得令人分心……那蜿蜒繁复的字体，让他忍不住想要用手指去描摹，顺着字母的轨迹。

"Uh… yeah… right on your back, here," he told Asuka, delicately circling his fingertip around it.  
“呃……对……就在你背上，这里，”他告诉明日香，小心翼翼地用指尖在上面画圈。

"EEEEEYYYAAAIIII!" Asuka shrieked in surprise, leaping into the air. "Stop that! It tickles!"  
“哎呀呀呀呀呀！”明日香惊叫着跳了起来，“别这样！痒死了！”

"Sorry!" “对不起！”

Asuka tried peering over her own shoulder. "I… I have your names as a _tramp stamp_?!"  
明日香试图从自己的肩膀上看过去。“我……我把你们的名字纹成腰间纹身了？！”

"It's very artistic," Kaworu said weakly, just raising his head. "Did… I sketch the tracework? It kind of looks like my hand."  
"非常艺术性，" 渚薰虚弱地说道，只是抬起了头。"我……我画了这些线条吗？看起来有点像我的手笔。"

"What about me?" Rei interrupted. "I feel it on my shoulder blades, but what does it look like?"  
"那我呢？" 绫波零打断道。"我感觉在后肩胛骨上，但它看起来是什么样的？"

The bluenette had turned around, and was looking over her shoulder for their reactions. And she got them.  
蓝发少女转过身来，透过肩膀观察他们的反应。而她确实得到了他们的反应。

"Oh, wow, Rei… You've got _wings_," Asuka said.  
“哦，哇，丽…你有翅膀了。”明日香说道。

"I… I don't know what to say, Rei. You… I don't deserve to… to be…" Shinji couldn't finish.  
"我…我不知道该说什么，丽。你…我不配…去…" 真嗣说不下去了。

So Kaworu did. "...We're your wings?" He wobbled upright from his stool and stepped close enough to Rei to gently trace his fingers along the delicate, feathered angel wings that lead down from near the top of Rei's back, with 'Shinji' and 'Kaworu' written on them. They looked almost lifelike.  
于是薰接过了话。"...我们是你的翅膀？" 他从凳子上摇摇晃晃地站起身，走近丽，用手指轻轻沿着那对精致的、羽毛丰满的天使翅膀描摹，这对翅膀从丽背部的上方延伸下来，上面写着'真嗣'和'薰'。它们看起来栩栩如生。

"And my name in the 'path of your tears'," Asuka said, shaking her head. "I never knew you cared that much, Rei."  
"而我的名字在你'泪痕之路'上，" 明日香说，摇了摇头。"我从不知道你这么在乎，绫波。"

"I do. I am sorry I remain…" Rei fidgeted with her hands. "Bad at expressing deep emotion. But I do love you all. The idea of your names being permanently on my skin is… I feel simultaneously loved and aroused."  
"我是的。我很抱歉我依然……" 绫波摆弄着双手。"不擅长表达深切情感。但我确实爱你们所有人。你们的名字永久刻在我的皮肤上……这让我既感到被爱又感到兴奋。"

Kaworu and Shinji shared a look. "Uhh…" they said together.  
渚薰和真嗣交换了一个眼神。“呃……”他们异口同声地说。

Asuka snorted. "Damn, Rei, I knew you were kind of kinky. Ok, whatever the Hell we did last night, we must have had some good shit to drink to spark it. I blame Misato. So we need to find her, and see if _she_ can explain any of this. If she's not in evidence, we need to start following the trail. The address for the chapel's on those papers, right?"  
明日香哼了一声。“该死，绫波，我知道你有点变态。好吧，不管昨晚我们干了什么，我们一定是喝了些好东西才这么兴奋。我怪美里。所以我们需要找到她，看看她能不能解释这一切。如果她不在场，我们需要开始追踪线索。教堂的地址就在那些文件上，对吧？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Good. We'll start there. There's probably a receipt or charge record on our cards for these tattoos, too. So we can try that too." Asuka thought for a moment. "We haven't tried calling Misato, Hikari, or anyone, right?"  
好，我们就从这里开始。我们的卡上可能也有这些纹身的收据或消费记录。所以我们可以试试那个。”明日香想了一会儿。“我们还没试着联系美里、光村或其他人，对吧？”

"Not unless someone did it while I was regurgitating everything I've eaten in the last month," Kaworu said, blearily. He nearly choked trying to force down the rest of the glass of Gatorade Asuka had put in front of him, then stood up to try digging ice out of the freezer.  
"除非有人趁我吐光过去一个月吃的东西时动手脚，"渚薰含糊地说道。他差点呛到，努力咽下明日香递来的佳得乐饮料，然后起身去冰箱里找冰块。

"I'll find our phones. ...And our pants. I have no idea where our clothes are," Shinji said.  
我会找到我们的手机。...还有我们的裤子。我不知道我们的衣服在哪里。” 真嗣说。

"Oh...we'll have to put on clothes, won't we?" Rei said. She sounded disappointed.  
“哦……我们得穿上衣服，不是吗？”丽说。她的声音听起来有些失望。

"If I promise the rest of us will help you out of them later, will that make you feel better?" Asuka said sarcastically.  
“如果我保证我们其他人稍后会帮你摆脱这些麻烦，你会感觉好些吗？”明日香讽刺地说道。

Rei gave her one of her tiny smiles. "Promise?"  
丽给了她一个微小的微笑。“答应了？”

"What are we going to do about the polar bear in the bathroom?" Kaworu asked, gingerly putting a ziploc bag of ice against his head. "Besides feed me to it so I stop wishing for the sweet embrace of death?"  
"我们该怎么处理浴室里的北极熊？" 渚薰小心翼翼地将一袋冰块贴在头上问道，"除了把我喂给它，好让我不再渴望那甜蜜的死亡怀抱之外？"

"We'll let the hotel staff figure that one out. We've got a mystery to solve," Asuka replied.  
"我们会让酒店员工来解决这个问题。我们还有个谜团要解开，"明日香回答道。

"We better leave the maid one hell of a tip," Shinji muttered. "Ah… you're taking this really well, Asuka. I kind of expected you to explode or try to strangle me."  
"我们最好给女佣留一大笔小费，" 真嗣嘀咕道。"啊…你接受得真好，明日香。我以为你会爆发或者试图掐死我。"

Asuka left the kitchen and walked over to where he was searching through the scattered sheets and pillows around the bed for their clothes and grabbed him in a surprisingly tight hug. "Shinji, I am currently half-freaking out because we can't remember anything about how or why we did this, half-giddy that we finally _did_ do this, and half-confused as all fuck as to why we included Wondergirl and the Angel of Prettyboys in the mix. I'm also still not completely convinced this isn't a really weird dream from eating too much buffet last night. So on balance, I've decided to just roll with it for now, and… maybe it's not so bad? I… you and I have been dancing around each other for years, never able to just… stop dancing and make it real. Maybe I kind of needed to be just… given a push like this."  
明日香离开厨房，走到他在床上四处寻找散落的床单和枕头下的衣服的地方，给了他一个出乎意料的紧紧拥抱。"真嗣，我现在一半在抓狂因为我们不记得是怎么或为什么做了这件事，一半在兴奋因为我们终于做了这件事，还有一半完全搞不懂为什么我们会把绫波和美少年天使也牵扯进来。我也仍然不完全相信这不是因为昨晚吃太多自助餐而做的奇怪梦。所以总的来说，我决定暂时就这样顺其自然，而且…也许没那么糟糕？我…你和我已经绕着彼此转了这么多年，从未能真正…停下来，让这一切变得真实。也许我需要这样…被推一把。"

Shinji's breath caught in his throat. "Asuka, I… You know I've loved you for years… I'd just… never thought we'd…"  
碇真嗣的呼吸一窒。“明日香，我……你知道我多年来一直爱着你……我只是……从未想过我们会有……”

"Maybe you needed the push too, huh?" she said softly.  
"也许你也需要那个推动力，是吧？" 她轻声说道。

"Is… I mean…. Rei and Kaworu too?" he asked hesitantly.  
"是…我是说…丽和渚薰也是吗？" 他犹豫地问道。

She tilted her head up for a kiss. "Eh, you and I both kind of love Rei already, and I've seen you and Kaworu together looking such a cute couple I have to admit I got jealous sometimes. And after the four of us living together for so long, life would feel… half-empty without them. So… yeah, maybe I don't really mind… having a wife and two husbands?" She blushed quite a bit by the end of that admission. She still managed to meet his eyes… after a moment. "You think you can handle two half-Angels who I know you love already, plus me, the love of your life? Because if we do this… I'm going all-in, baka-Shinji. No holding back anymore."  
她抬起头索吻。“呃，你和我都已经有点爱上丽了，而且我看到你和渚薰在一起时那么可爱的一对，有时候我不得不承认我会嫉妒。再加上我们四个人一起生活了这么久，没有他们，生活会感觉……空了一半。所以……是的，也许我真的不介意……有一个妻子和两个丈夫？”说到最后，她的脸颊泛起了红晕。她还是设法在片刻后与他对视。“你觉得你能应付两个你已经爱上的半天使，还有我，你生命中的挚爱吗？因为如果我们这么做……我会全力以赴，笨蛋真嗣。不再有任何保留。”

He swallowed hard. _This_ would be one of the reasons he loved Asuka. The way she could just… cut through everything, and make him feel like he was the world to her. It made him want to do the same for her. "I… I kind of want this too. For… pretty much the same reasons. I can't imagine living without them and you."  
他艰难地咽了咽口水。这就是他爱明日香的原因之一。她总能……直击要害，让他感觉自己是她的全世界。这让他也想为她做同样的事。“我……我也想要这样。因为……几乎同样的原因。我无法想象没有他们和你一起生活。”

"Now I'm going to make a joke about watching you and Kaworu go at it, because #1, that's hot, and #2, its easier than facing the oh-holy-shit levels of emotional scariness that goes with seriously thinking about ohfuckohfuckouhfuckI'mmarriedI'mmarriedI'mmarriedtothreepeopleandIthinkIlovethemand-" Asuka let go of him and clamped her hands over her mouth.  
“现在我要开个玩笑，说看你和渚薰那啥，因为第一，那很火辣，第二，总比面对那些该死的情感恐怖级别要好，比如认真思考‘卧槽卧槽卧槽我结婚了我是三个人的妻子我还觉得我爱他们’之类的——” 明日香松开手，猛地捂住自己的嘴。

Shinji smiled weakly. "Y-Yeah… same reasons." He kissed her on the forehead and gave her one last squeeze. "Let's… find out what happened."  
真嗣虚弱地笑了笑。“嗯……同样的原因。”他在她的额头上轻轻一吻，最后一次紧紧拥抱了她。“我们……去弄清楚发生了什么。”

"Everyone?" Rei spoke up from the now open door to the bathroom. "Lieutenant Growlski says he wants breakfast. Do we have any more vodka?"  
“所有人？”绫波从现在敞开的浴室门里说道，“格罗尔斯基中尉说他想要吃早餐。我们还有伏特加吗？”

Shinji paled a bit. "Um… Rei? Aren't you nervous about ah… 'Lieutenant Growlski' trying to… eat you?"  
真嗣的脸色有点苍白。“呃… 绫波？你不担心…‘格罗尔斯基中尉’试图…吃掉你吗？”

"He's fine as long as he gets his vodka," Rei said serenely.  
"只要他能喝到伏特加，他就没事。" 丽平静地说道。

Shinji eyed the bathroom door nervously. "What happens if he doesn't get his vodka?"  
真嗣紧张地盯着浴室门。"如果他喝不到伏特加会怎么样？"

"Then he's not fine." Rei headed into the kitchen area and began to rummage through the cabinets. "Help me find some, Shinji?"  
"那他就不好了。" 丽走进厨房区域，开始翻找橱柜。"帮我找找，真嗣？"

Shinji squeezed Asuka's hand one last time and went to help Rei.  
真嗣最后一次紧握了明日香的手，然后去帮助丽。

"Do _not_ get eaten by the bear!" Asuka called after him. She resumed searching for their keys or phones in the cushions of the suite's couch. She found her shirt from last night under the cocktail table. She picked it up, but wrinkled her nose at the strong scent of alcohol pouring off it. As if they'd needed any more confirmation that they'd done a truly epic amount of drinking yesterday. "Enough to get married to three people, but forget about it and the whole rest of the evening," she muttered.  
“别被熊吃掉了！”明日香在他身后喊道。她继续在套房沙发的垫子里寻找他们的钥匙或手机。她在鸡尾酒桌下找到了昨晚的衬衫。她捡起来，却因上面浓烈的酒精气味而皱起了鼻子。仿佛他们还需要更多证据来证明昨天确实喝得天昏地暗。“足够跟三个人结婚，然后忘得一干二净，连带着整个晚上，”她喃喃自语。

Kaworu tapped her on the shoulder, presenting her with a set of fresh clothes. "I found your suitcase under some flung sheets. Still no sign of our phones."  
薰轻轻拍了拍她的肩膀，递给她一套干净的衣服。“我在一些散落的床单下找到了你的行李箱。手机还是没找到。”

She took the blouse, underwear, and pants with a nod of thanks. She had to pull her eyes away from the ring on his hand as she took them.  
她接过衬衫、内衣和裤子，点头致谢。接过衣物时，她不得不移开视线，不去看他手上的戒指。

Kaworu's own gaze was stuck just as much on hers. She tried to ignore it as she started getting dressed right there.  
渚薰的目光也同样停留在她的身上。她试图忽视这一点，就在那里开始穿衣服。

"Asuka? "“明日香？”

"Yeah?" She stepped into her semi-lacy panties and pulled them up. She was vaguely bemused to note they were the same blue as Rei's hair.  
"嗯？" 她踏进那半透明的蕾丝内裤，拉了上去。她有些好笑地注意到，这内裤的颜色和她头发是同一种蓝色。

"Why me?" "为什么是我？"

She fastened her bra behind her and adjusted the straps. "What do you… oh, why are you wearing a ring too?"  
她在背后扣上胸罩，调整了肩带。"怎么了……哦，你为什么也戴了个戒指？"

He nodded. "You and Shinji, everyone's been expecting that for years, despite how often you two broke up and reconciled. And I can even see how much you and Rei really care for each other, even without my Sight. Rei and Shinji likewise. But… I'm the weird new one, the outsider in your little trio, the _Angel_… I mean, I know you're all my friends, and even sometimes a lover, but… do I really… am I worthy of this?"  
他点点头。“你和真嗣，大家多年来一直期待着你们复合，尽管你们分分合合无数次。我甚至能看出你和绫波之间真挚的情感，即使不借助我的‘视线’。绫波和真嗣亦然。但……我是那个新来的怪人，你们这个小三人组的局外人，那个天使……我是说，我知道你们都是我的朋友，甚至有时是恋人，但……我真的……我有这个资格吗？”

Asuka frowned. "Ok, number one, none of us even remember how we went from 'celebratory drinking about Hikari and her gorilla' to 'let's all get tattooed and married', so I don't know what to say in the more immediate sense. Number two… you're not 'just a friend', Kaworu. Angel? You've been closer than anyone else to all three of us for years at this point. Number three…" Asuka tried to sort through her wildly confused feelings. Failing to come up with a coherent, articulable line of explanation, she fell back on a more base one, that had the virtue of being at least _part_ of the truth. "You're good."  
明日香皱眉道：“好吧，首先，我们都不记得是怎么从‘庆祝光和她的猩猩’变成‘一起去纹身结婚’的，所以我不太知道怎么在更直接的层面上回答你。其次……你不仅仅是‘朋友’，渚薰。天使？你多年来比任何人都更亲近我们三个。第三……”明日香试图整理她混乱的情绪。未能找到连贯可表达的解释，她退而求其次，选择了一个至少部分真实的说法。“你很好。”

"Good?" “很好？”

Asuka looked down briefly, then away from the still distractingly nude and very gorgeous Nephilim. "...in bed."  
明日香短暂地低头看了一眼，随即移开了视线，不再注视那位依然赤裸且极其迷人的拿非利人。“……在床上。”

"_Bullshit! I've got_ _**years**_ _of practice on him, and I_ _**know**_ _he likes it," Asuka smirked. "There's no way you can even match me, let alone beat me."_  
“胡说！我比他多练了几年，而且我知道他喜欢，”明日香得意地笑了。“你连跟我比都做不到，更别说赢我了。”"

_"Hey, my first couple of boyfriends may have been more interested in notching 'I banged an Angel' on their bedpost and damn blogs than in really seeing me for me, but that is one thing I got out of all of them: I am the **king**_ _of blowjobs," Kaworu countered. "And Shinji damn near ripped my ears off the last time you dared us to do it while you and Rei watched and cheered."_  
“嘿，我的前几任男友可能更热衷于在床头板上刻下‘我睡了一个天使’并在他们的博客上炫耀，而不是真正地了解我，但这是我从他们那里得到的一件事：我是口交之王，”渚薰反驳道。“上次你敢让我们在你和绫波观看并欢呼时做，真嗣差点把我的耳朵都扯掉了。”"

_"Oh yeah?!" "哦，是吗？！"_

_"Yeah!" "是的！"_

_The argument had escalated to dueling practical demonstrations. Kaworu had needed a full minute just to uncross his eyes after Asuka finished him off. Asuka had yelled loud enough at her moment of climax Shinji had needed to cover his ears. Rei had merely smiled that wickedly content way she did when drunk and horny, and declared that the only means of truly settling the argument was for them both to do Shinji at once. Shinji's surprised 'guh-WHA?' had been stilled by Rei giving him her best coquettish look, with one finger on her lower lip.  
争论已经升级到了实战演示的对决。卡罗尔在明日香结束战斗后花了整整一分钟才让眼睛不再交叉。明日香在高潮时刻的喊声大到真嗣不得不捂住耳朵。丽只是带着那种醉酒且饥渴时邪恶满足的微笑，宣布解决争论的唯一方法就是让他们俩同时对真嗣下手。真嗣惊讶的'呃-什么？'被丽用她最迷人的眼神和下唇上的手指制止了。_

_Shinji had no complaints after that, only the repeated and mountingly fervent gasping of both their names. However, their heads close together had begun distracting them both into increasingly heated kissing between bobs. That had ended when Asuka had grabbed Kaworu by the back of the neck, pulled him on top of her, and demanded more... direct satisfaction, immediately.  
自那以后，真嗣没有任何怨言，只有他们名字不断重复且愈发热烈的喘息声。然而，他们紧靠在一起的头开始让他们分心，转向越来越激烈的亲吻。直到明日香抓住薰的后颈，将他拉到自己身上，并要求立即得到更直接的满足，这一幕才结束。_

_That Shinji and Rei had promptly attached themselves to her left and right sides only made it better. Asuka very quickly discovered a few things: Kaworu was a tender, skilled, and gentle lover, he never stopped looking into her eyes, and she really, really liked being under him with Rei and Shinji pressed against her sides, taking turns kissing her and teasing her breasts. She felt surrounded, the center of attention… and loved. Intensely, deeply, completely. Her three favorite people, with her, holding her, loving her…  
真嗣和丽立即贴在她左右两侧，这让一切变得更加美好。明日香很快发现了几件事：薰是一个温柔、熟练且体贴的情人，他从未停止注视她的眼睛，而她真的很喜欢在他身下，丽和真嗣紧贴在她两侧，轮流亲吻她并逗弄她的胸部。她感到被包围，成为焦点……并被深深爱着。强烈、深沉、完全。她最爱的三个人，与她在一起，拥抱着她，爱着她……_

_She didn't want it to end.  
她不希望这一切结束。_

_But eventually she screamed her release into Shinji's mouth, and the morning came. She and Shinji were together again, and they didn't discuss the night before. Not in that level of detail.  
但最终，她在真嗣的唇间尖叫着释放了自己，晨光也随之降临。她和真嗣再次在一起，他们没有详细讨论前一晚的事。没有达到那个深度。_

_But it still happened again a couple more times.  
但这种情况还是又发生了几次。_

_Per month. 每个月。_

_She wanted more. But how do you say something like that?  
她渴望更多。但这种话该如何启齿呢？_

"You're... good. A good lover. And I like sex. How many… look, Kaworu, there's you, and there's Shinji. And that's it. That's all the men I've let touch me in the last… three years?"  
“你……很好。一个好情人。而且我喜欢性爱。有多少……听着，渚薰，有你，还有真嗣。这就是全部了。这是我过去……三年里允许触碰我的所有男人。”

Kaworu blinked at her. "What, really? Half the time you and Shinji break up, you're dating some new hot guy within a day or two. You… never?"  
渚薰对她眨了眨眼。“什么，真的吗？每次你和真嗣分手，不出一两天你就会和某个新帅哥约会。你……从来没有？”

"Nope. Hell, more than half of them are just me trying to make Shinji jealous," Asuka admitted.  
"不，见鬼，超过一半只是为了激起真嗣的嫉妒，"明日香承认道。

Kaworu started to smile. "That does kind of undercut the 'I like sex' justification. If that was all there was to it, you'd be all over them too. If it's just Shinji and I, that suggests…"  
渚薰开始微笑。"那确实削弱了'我喜欢性'的辩解。如果只是那样，你也会对他们感兴趣。如果只是我和真嗣，那就意味着……"

Asuka turned away, hiding her face. "Halt's Maul."  
明日香转过身去，遮住自己的脸。"哈尔的巨锤。"

Kaworu's smile deepened. "You don't just sleep around, Asuka. You demand more than that. You only sleep with people you-"  
渚薰的微笑加深了。“你不是随便和人上床的那种人，明日香。你要求的不仅仅是那样。你只会和你——”

Asuka spun back around. "I said shut it, idiot!"  
明日香猛地转过身来。“我说了闭嘴，白痴！”

"This isn't just about sex, is it?"  
“这不仅仅是关于性，对吧？”

She punched him in the chest, lightly. "Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!" She punched him again. "You've been living with us since the end of the War, you're closer to us than anyone, even Misato and Kaji, and I know how you feel about Shinji and Rei. You make them happy, they like you too, and I'm not going to just… cut you out and leave you alone. So whatever crazy logic persuaded us that suddenly getting _group-married_ last night was a good idea, for my part there's no way I'd… leave you out, alright? That's it." Asuka crossed her arms and looked away again. "Idiot."  
她轻轻地捶打他的胸口。“笨蛋！笨蛋！笨蛋！”她又捶了一下。“战争结束后你就一直和我们住在一起，你比任何人都亲近我们，甚至比美里和加持还要亲近，我也知道你对真嗣和绫波的感情。你让他们快乐，他们也喜欢你，我不会就这样……把你排除在外，让你孤单一人。所以无论是什么疯狂的逻辑说服我们昨晚突然集体结婚是个好主意，就我而言，我绝不会……把你排除在外，好吗？就这样。”明日香交叉双臂，再次别过头去。“笨蛋。”

She squeaked in alarm when Kaworu suddenly picked her up by the waist and spun her around in the air, grinning. "Aaack! Put me down, you lunatic!" Her head spun.  
当渚薰突然搂住她的腰将她举起在空中旋转时，她惊慌地尖叫起来，渚薰咧嘴笑着。“啊啊！放我下来，你这个疯子！”她的头都晕了。

"I know this song!" he said. "I've seen it before!"  
“我知道这首歌！”他说。“我以前见过！”

"What the Hell are you _talking_ about, du Dummkopf?!"  
“你到底在说什么鬼话，笨蛋？”

He lowered her down and crushed her to him, kissing the side of her neck. "You used to sound like this about him. And I know where that went. So if… Asuka, you know what I am, what I nearly did before Rei and I found a way to mute the Call, and you _still_ accept me. You may not be able to say it, but this," he pulled back and held up his left hand, "this says more than words ever could. This is the ultimate expression of acceptance and…" He closed his eyes, still smiling. "You said you 'wouldn't leave me alone'. I know how difficult emotional intimacy is for you. That you'd include me in… Asuka, this is the second most wonderful thing anyone's ever done for me."  
他将她放下并紧紧拥入怀中，亲吻她的脖颈一侧。“你以前对他也是这样说的。我知道那结果如何。所以如果……明日香，你知道我是什么，知道我在遇见丽并找到抑制召唤的方法之前差点做了什么，而你依然接受我。你或许说不出口，但这个，”他后退一步，举起左手，“这个胜过千言万语。这是最极致的接纳和……”他闭上眼睛，依旧微笑着。“你说你‘不会让我孤单’。我知道情感上的亲密对你有多难。你愿意把我包括在内……明日香，这是别人为我做的第二美好的事。”

Asuka felt her pride prickle a bit. "Second?" she pouted.  
明日香感到一丝骄傲的刺痛。“第二？”她噘嘴道。

"Rei saving me from the Call narrowly wins."  
「零拼尽全力从召唤中救了我。」

.

_The alarms and sirens far above were inaudible at this depth, but Kaworu knew they were going off. Two Nephilim forcing open Heaven's Gate and entering the very heart of Terminal Dogma must have set off every alarm in NERV, even without the immense Pattern Blue signal their AT-Fields must have sent off.  
在这个深度，上方的警报和警笛声已无法听见，但渚薰知道它们正在响起。两个天使强行打开天堂之门，进入终端教条的核心，必定触发了 NERV 内所有的警报，更不用说他们巨大的蓝色信号 AT 力场所引发的反应了。_

_Kaworu looked up at the titanic form hanging from the gigantic red cross before them. Even hanging mid-air on the wings of their AT-Fields, Lilith's true body still towered over them. The constant siren song of the Call was a hurricane-loud scream this close. Only the knowledge that this was truly Lilith, not Adam, allowed Kaworu to keep his will in control over his instincts. That, and his trust in his companion.  
渚薰抬头望向悬挂在他们面前巨大红色十字架上的巨型身影。即便依靠 AT 力场的翅膀悬浮在半空中，莉莉丝的真身依然高耸在他们之上。在这般近距离下，召唤的持续歌声如同飓风般震耳欲聋。唯有确信这是真正的莉莉丝而非亚当，以及对同伴的信任，才让渚薰能够控制住自己的本能。_

_"Are you sure this will work?" he asked her.  
“你确定这会有效吗？”他问她。_

_Rei turned, giving him a perfectly blank look. Only the faint hint of steel in her eye told him she was just as intent on her goal as ever. "No. This will either work, cause you to explode, or trigger you into an irreversible overload state that will require me to kill you to stop. But I am confident the first is the most likely. You trust me, and are maintaining conscious control of your barriers. You retain the ability to willingly lower them. That and your half-Lilim body will allow me to manipulate and integrate sufficient Progenitor-material into your Core that the Call will be satisfied and silenced forever." She paused. "If you are still willing."  
丽转身，给了他一个完全空白的表情。只有她眼中微弱的坚定之光告诉他，她对目标的执着一如既往。“不。这要么会成功，要么会让你爆炸，或者触发你进入不可逆转的超载状态，我必须杀了你才能阻止。但我相信第一种可能性最大。你信任我，并且保持着对屏障的意识控制。你保留了自愿降低它们的能力。再加上你那半莉莉丝的身体，将使我能够操纵并整合足够的始祖物质进入你的核心，从而满足并永远平息呼唤。”她顿了顿。“如果你还愿意的话。”_

_He looked back at the far-off entrance to Lilith's chamber. Unit-01 and Unit-02 stood guard, their backs to the two hovering Nephilim, keeping SEELE's Evas at bay. The sounds of battle were growing stronger, the thunderous clangs and crashes of Evas in close combat eerily mixed with the unnatural roars and shrieks of the Mass Production Series.  
他回头望向远处莉莉丝房间的入口。零一号机和零二号机守卫着，背对着悬浮的两名奈菲利姆，将 SEELE 的 EVA 挡在远处。战斗的声音越来越强，EVA 近身搏斗的雷鸣般撞击声与量产机型非自然的咆哮和尖叫诡异地混合在一起。_

_He turned back to Rei. "In the face of such trust, how can I do any less? Proceed, Rei. We will win, or I will die. Either way, you will all live, and I will no longer endanger those I have come to care for." He opened his white shirt, revealing his bare chest.  
他转回身面对丽。“面对如此信任，我怎能不尽全力？继续吧，丽。我们必将胜利，否则我便战死。无论如何，你们都将存活，我也不会再危及那些我已深切关怀的人。”他解开白色衬衫，露出赤裸的胸膛。_

_Rei just nodded, and floated closer to Lilith's form. As she drew near, a bulge in Lilith's stomach formed, reaching out for Rei. But the First Child halted it with a raised hand. "No," she told it, "not now, perhaps not ever. This world is alive. Give me what I require to ensure it remains so."  
丽只是点点头，飘近莉莉丝的形态。当她靠近时，莉莉丝腹部鼓起，伸向丽。但第一适格者举手制止了它。“不，”她对它说，“现在不行，也许永远都不行。这个世界充满生机。给我所需之物，确保它继续存在。”_

_The pseudopod of white flesh inched closer, narrowing. A sphere no larger than a plum formed at the tip and dropped into Rei's outstretched hand. The bulge then retreated, and Lilith's body was still once more.  
那白色的肉状触手缓缓靠近，逐渐变细。顶端形成一个李子大小的球体，落入丽伸出的手中。随后鼓起消退，莉莉丝的身体再次静止。_

_Rei flew back to Kaworu, holding her hand out in front of her. "Open wide, Kaworu. It is time for Tabris to go to sleep."  
丽飞回到薰身边，伸手向前。“张大嘴，薰。是时候让塔布里斯入睡了。”_

_The fragment of raw Progenitor screamed at him, the Call roaring in his ears, but it was wrong, wrong, not Adam, not-  
原始始祖的碎片在他耳边尖叫，呼唤声震耳欲聋，但不对，不对，不是亚当，不是——_

_Rei pressed it into his mouth, gently but unrelentingly. "If this causes you to explode, I apologize."  
丽轻轻但坚定地将它按进他的嘴里。“如果这让你爆炸了，我道歉。”_

_He swallowed it. 他咽了下去。_

_Rei's eyes flared like red stars, matching his own. She plunged her hand into his chest.  
丽的双眼如红星般闪耀，与他的目光相映成辉。她将手猛地插入他的胸膛。_

_He felt his AT-Field scream, twist, distort… and She was inside him. Filling him. Changing him. He felt his Lilithian and Adamite sides clash, mix… and meld, bridged by the pure piece of Progenitor she'd fed him, then guided into his Core with her own AT-Field.  
他感到自己的 AT 力场尖叫、扭曲、变形……而她已在他体内。充盈着他。改变着他。他感受到自己的莉莉丝与亚当之力相互冲突、交融……最终融合，由她喂给他的纯净始祖碎片所连接，再由她自身的 AT 力场引导进入他的核心。_

_For the first time in his existence, the Call faded, faded… and stopped.  
在他存在的第一次，那呼唤渐渐消退，消退……然后停止了。_

_Rei pulled her hand out of his chest, and laid it gently on his skin. Her touch still made his skin tingle, but not like before. "You have not exploded. Good. The Forbidden Union has been achieved. You are now safe from the Call."  
丽从他的胸膛中抽出手，轻轻地放在他的皮肤上。她的触摸仍让他感到皮肤发麻，但已不如从前。“你没有爆炸。很好。禁忌的结合已经达成。你现在已经不再受那呼唤的困扰。”_

_Kaworu smiled. The silence in his head was the sweetest music he'd ever heard. "Yes, I am. Now-"  
薰微笑了。他脑海中的寂静是他听过的最美妙的音乐。“是的，我自由了。现在——”_

_Rei grabbed his shoulders and slammed her lips against his.  
丽抓住他的肩膀，猛地将嘴唇贴了上去。_

_Eventually, she pulled back. "I have wanted to do that for weeks. That was even more pleasant than I expected. Now, let us go save our friends. We will discuss that more later."  
最终，她退开一步。“我已经想这么做好几个星期了。这比我想象的还要愉快。现在，让我们去救我们的朋友。这事我们稍后再详谈。”_

_"Guh." “呃。”_

_She honked his nose. "Focus, Fifth Child. We have a battle to win, and SEELE to crush. You and I have risked much to reach this point. The others have risked even more to let us have this chance. Let us go redeem their trust in us. And then enjoy the fruits of victory."  
她轻捏了一下他的鼻子。“集中精神，第五适格者。我们有一场战斗要赢，还有 SEELE 要摧毁。你我为了走到这一步冒了很大的风险。其他人为了给我们这个机会冒了更大的风险。让我们去回报他们对我们的信任。然后享受胜利的果实。”_

_He shook his head. "R-Right… trust. Thank you, Rei. For all of this."  
他摇了摇头。“好……信任。谢谢你，丽。为了这一切。”_

_"You may repay me later," Rei said, still as deadpan and cool as ever. "For now…" A pair of glowing octagons appeared at her hands, humming. "Let us go tear SEELE's Evas a structurally superfluous new behind."  
“你以后可以报答我，”丽说道，依旧面无表情，冷静如常。“现在……”她双手上浮现出两对发光的八角形，嗡嗡作响。“让我们去给 SEELE 的 EVA 们撕出一个结构上多余的新屁股。”_

_Two more AT-Fields appeared near Kaworu's hands. "Ladies first."  
又有两个 AT 力场在渚薰的手边出现。“女士优先。”_

_The two Nephilim rocketed towards Heaven's Gate, outbound and down.  
两位拿非利人疾速冲向天堂之门，向外飞驰而下。_

"I mean, she did kind of save my life and the world with that trick…" Kaworu rubbed his head. "So… I'm equally glad to be her husband too."  
"我的意思是，她用那个把戏救了我的命和整个世界……" 渚薰揉了揉头。"所以……我也同样高兴能成为她的丈夫。"

"Thank Shinji for the idea," Asuka muttered. That had been a… difficult day. But watching her two friends come flying out of Terminal Dogma to help them fight off SEELE's last five Mass Production Evas remained one of her favorite memories. "He is the one that thought it up. My baka can be a genius sometimes."  
"感谢真嗣的主意，" 明日香低声说道。那是个……艰难的日子。但看着她的两位朋友从终端教条飞奔而出，帮助他们击退 SEELE 最后五台量产 EVA，依然是她最喜欢的记忆之一。"是他想出来的。我的笨蛋有时候也能是个天才。"

"Now I'm your baka too," Kaworu grinned again. "And I can wait for you to say the words. I love you too, Asuka."  
"现在我也是你的笨蛋了，" 渚薰再次咧嘴笑道。"我会等你亲口说出那句话。我也爱你，明日香。"

She turned red, then purple. "Stop-... I… you… GAAAH! Stupid Fish!" Asuka pulled out of his grip. "Go get dressed, you distractingly naked man! Shinji! Rei! Where are you?" Asuka pushed open the door to the bathroom. "Have you found-"  
她的脸先是变红，接着变紫。"别-...我…你…啊啊啊！笨蛋鱼！" 明日香挣脱了他的手。"去穿衣服，你这个让人分心的裸男！真嗣！丽！你们在哪儿？" 明日香推开浴室的门。"你们找到了-"

The bear in the bathtub waved a quieting paw at her, warning her not to disturb the deeply embracing couple near the sinks. He raised his new bottle of vodka and took a long drink.  
浴缸里的熊轻轻挥动着安抚的爪子，警告她不要打扰在水池旁深情拥抱的情侣。他举起新开的伏特加酒瓶，喝了一大口。

Shinji couldn't answer Asuka's question. Rei had his tongue.  
真嗣无法回答明日香的问题。丽把他的舌头缠住了。

Asuka cleared her throat, subtly. Then not so subtly. "A_hem_. Rei, what are you doing? I thought you were just giving ah… Lieutenant Growlski some more vodka to keep him pacified, then coming back to help us search?"  
明日香轻咳了一声，先是微妙地，然后不那么微妙。“咳咳。丽，你在干什么？我以为你只是给……格罗尔斯基中尉再多倒些伏特加让他安静下来，然后回来帮我们搜索？”

Rei slowly broke the kiss, a very pleased smile on her face. She finally looked at Asuka. "I am doing science."  
丽缓缓结束了亲吻，脸上带着非常满意的微笑。她终于看向了明日香。“我在做科学研究。”

Asuka gave her a flat look. "Science."  
明日香给了她一个平淡的眼神。“科学。”

"I am experimentally verifying the question 'Is kissing your husband different from kissing your lover?' I am happy to report the answer is 'Yes, it is substantially better.'" Rei's eyes twinkled with anticipation. "I would now like to proceed with the next subject of investigation on the list, 'Is kissing your _wife_ different from kissing your lover?' Based on my experiments so far, I have high hopes for further positive results."  
“我正在实验验证一个问题：‘亲吻你的丈夫与亲吻你的情人有何不同？’我很高兴地报告，答案是‘是的，明显更好’。”绫波的眼中闪烁着期待的光芒。“现在，我想继续进行列表上的下一个研究课题：‘亲吻你的妻子与亲吻你的情人有何不同？’根据我迄今为止的实验，我对进一步的积极结果抱有很高的期望。”

Asuka bit her lip. Damn it. Rei's kisses were literally and figuratively divine, but is she let Rei get her hands on her, it would take them even longer to get out of the suite and start finding out some answers. "Um, Rei, I really do hate to say this, but we have to, uh… postpone that experimental series until _after_ we figure out exactly how we, ah… reached that status."  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。该死。绫波的吻无论在字面上还是比喻上都是神圣的，但如果让她继续下去，他们离开套房并开始寻找答案的时间将会更长。“呃，绫波，我真的不想这么说，但我们必须……推迟那个实验系列，直到我们弄清楚我们究竟是如何……达到那个状态的。”

Rei's expression dimmed for a moment, but her lips curled back up into a small smile just as quickly. "Ah, I see. Yes. Well, as a good and obedient wife, I will of course obey my beloved's wishes."  
丽的眼神暗淡了一瞬，但她的嘴角很快又弯起了一个小小的微笑。“啊，我明白了。是的。好吧，作为一位贤惠顺从的妻子，我当然会遵从我亲爱的丈夫的意愿。”

"Glurk," Asuka replied. "I… damn it, you little minx…"  
“咕噜，”明日香回答道。“我……该死，你这个小妖精……”

Rei patted her on the cheek as she squeezed past Asuka. "Yes, dear. I will still hold you to your promise to help me into my clothes."  
丽轻轻拍了拍她的脸颊，从明日香身边挤过去。“是的，亲爱的。我仍然会要求你兑现帮我穿衣服的承诺。”

Some more cleaning and hotel suite archaeology unearthed their luggage and got the others dressed. Their cell phones turned up wrapped in aluminum foil in the freezer, for some reason. Misato and Kaji didn't answer theirs when called. There were several waiting text messages from her, all incoherent babble or random mashes of characters. The couple of voicemails were much the same. The last message was hours old, too. Giving up on that for a moment, Asuka shepherded her gaggle of hungover spouses out the suite door and down to the hotel lobby in search of possibly a taxi.  
再打扫一番，加上对酒店套房的“考古”，他们终于找到了行李，并帮其他人穿好了衣服。他们的手机不知为何用铝箔纸包着，放在冰箱里。Misato 和 Kaji 打电话时没有接听。她的几条未读短信全是语无伦次的胡言乱语或随机的字符组合。语音留言也差不多。最后一条信息也是几个小时前的了。暂时放弃联系他们，Asuka 带着一群宿醉的“配偶”走出了套房，下到酒店大堂，寻找可能的出租车。

Well, not so much shepherded as led from in front. Asuka did find some moderate amusement in realizing that all three of the hungover people behind her were probably staring at her arse. Or possibly her new tattoo. Either end pleased her ego in nice ways.. and a deeper part she was still hesitant to examine too closely just yet. It was too near the part that wanted to wildly freak out over waking up married to not just her intermittent boyfriend, but two additional friends as well.  
其实，与其说是带领，不如说是走在前面。Asuka 发现身后那三个宿醉的人可能都在盯着她的屁股，或者她新纹的纹身。无论是哪一头，都让她自我感觉良好，还有更深层次的感受，她暂时还不太敢细想。这离她醒来发现自己不仅和时好时坏的男友结了婚，还多了两个朋友作为伴侣的疯狂事实太近了。

Fortunately, she found a ready-made distraction waiting for them all once they cleared the elevators and reached the first floor, the bings and hubub of the casino floor filling the otherwise quiet lobby. Sitting at one of the tables spilling out of the restaurant just off the lobby's front hall was Hikari Horaki, looking very smug, and Touji Suzuhara, looking like he didn't know if he wanted to scream or start giggling madly.  
幸运的是，当他们穿过电梯到达一楼时，她发现了一个现成的干扰在等着他们所有人，赌场地板的叮当声和喧闹声填满了原本安静的大堂。坐在餐厅延伸至大堂前厅的一张桌子旁的是 Hikari Horaki，看起来非常得意，而 Touji Suzuhara 则一脸茫然，不知道自己是该尖叫还是开始疯狂地傻笑。

Asuka blinked in surprise as Hikari spotted them and waved them over. Her friend looked... different. Very different. Besides the cat-who-ate-100-canaries smile and the way she was radiating ALL THE SMUG. Hikari had maintained her girlish pigtails for a long time, even most of the way through high school. Even after they'd finally faded away, Hikari had always kept her hair tightly restrained in a severe ponytail. But now, for the first time any of them could recall, Hikari's brunette locks were unconfined, a glossy waterfall of rich chestnut hair spilling down all over her shoulders.  
当 Hikari 发现他们并挥手示意他们过去时，Asuka 惊讶地眨了眨眼。她的朋友看起来……不一样。非常不一样。除了那副吃了 100 只猫的得意笑容和她散发出的所有得意气息。Hikari 保持她少女般的双马尾很长时间，甚至大部分高中时期都是如此。即使它们最终消失了，Hikari 也总是把头发紧紧地束成一个严肃的马尾。但现在，他们中任何人能回忆起的第一次，Hikari 的棕色长发没有束缚，一头光泽的栗色头发如瀑布般倾泻在她的肩上。

"Hikari, good morning. You look, um... nice?" Shinji said, confused.  
“Hikari，早上好。你看起来，呃……不错？”Shinji 困惑地说。

"Ohhh, and I _feel_ even better, Shinji, thank you," Hikari said warmly. She took a slow, contented sip from her cup of coffee. "I feel great. I feel _unleashed_."  
"哦，我感觉更好了，真嗣，谢谢你，" 洞木光温暖地说道。她慢慢地、满足地啜了一口咖啡。"我感觉棒极了。我感觉自己被释放了。"

"Ah...why is that, Horaki-san?" Kaworu inquired.  
"啊...为什么会这样呢，洞木同学？" 渚薰询问道。

"Because my darling Touji and I are not stuck on third base anymore," she said smugly. "And it was _fantastic_!" She hummed a happy little tune to herself as she took another sip of her steaming coffee.  
"因为我亲爱的东治和我终于不再停留在三垒了，" 她得意地说。"而且那真是太棒了！" 她哼着一首愉快的小曲，又喝了一口热腾腾的咖啡。

"You did? Wait, what happened to 'no sex before marriage'?" Asuka said.  
"你真的做了？等等，那‘婚前不发生性行为’的原则呢？" 明日香说道。

Hikari did giggle this time. "Oh, don't you remember?" she said, shaking her head. "We did it! It's not Horaki anymore, that's why! It's _Suzuhara_, finally!"  
光这次真的笑了。"哦，你不记得了吗？" 她摇着头说，"我们结婚了！她不再是洞木了，所以才改姓铃原，终于！

"You got married last night?" Shinji asked.  
"你们昨晚结婚了？" 真嗣问道。

"Yup! You were all there! You don't remember either? You were my _husband's,_" Hikari trilled the word, "Best Man, Shinji! You were my Maid of Honor, Asuka!" Hikari seemed about to burst into laughter. "Well, I suppose we all _had_ been drinking a bit. That's how we went from a 'celebrate our engagement' party to 'hey, it's Vegas, let's get married right now!'" She laughed. "I am soooo happy Misato made that suggestion! Five years of waiting! I don't think Touji and I stopped until dawn!"  
"没错！你们都在场！你们也不记得了吗？你是我的丈夫的，"光用轻快的语调说出了这个词，"伴郎，真嗣！你是我的伴娘，明日香！"光似乎快要笑出声来。"嗯，我想我们都喝了不少。就这样从'庆祝我们的订婚'派对变成了'嘿，这里是拉斯维加斯，我们现在就结婚吧！'"她大笑着说。"我真是太高兴美里提出了那个建议！五年的等待！我想我和冬二一直闹到天亮！"

"Seems to have been a trend," Kaworu muttered quietly. Rei poked him in the side, smiling faintly.  
"似乎成了一种趋势，"渚低声嘀咕道。绫波轻轻戳了戳他的侧腰，微微一笑。

Asuka and Shinji shared a glance. _Yup, this was all Misato's fault_. "You look, ah... very happy, yes," Shinji said. He looked at his friend. "Uh... Touji looks... a bit more in shock."  
明日香和真嗣交换了一个眼神。没错，这都是美里的错。"你看起来，呃……非常开心，是的，"真嗣说。他看着他的朋友。"呃……冬二看起来……有点震惊。

Touji finally blinked. He'd been rather still, though the remaining crumbs of breakfast in front of him showed he'd definitely eaten quite an array of food from the buffet. His gaze slowly drifted to Shinji. "I... I'm definitely married... and I think I'm pregnant."  
真嗣终于眨了眨眼。他一直相当静止不动，尽管面前早餐剩下的碎屑表明他确实从自助餐中吃了不少食物。他的目光缓缓转向真嗣。“我……我肯定是结婚了……而且我觉得我怀孕了。”

Shinji stared back in confusion. "Ah... what?"  
真嗣困惑地回望着他。“啊……什么？”

"I am so pregnant..." Touji said vaguely. "I'm probably going to have triplets. Three little girls..."  
“我真的很怀孕了……”真嗣含糊地说。“我可能会生三胞胎。三个小女孩……”

"Touji, you're the _guy,"_ Shinji pointed out.  
"真嗣，你这家伙，" 真嗣指出来。

Touji shook his head. "Doesn't matter. Hikari screwed me into submission. I never had a chance. She wins, forever. I get to have the babies." He blinked again, a little more focus returning to his eyes. "Holy shit, I am so _married_." He smiled up at them.  
托基摇了摇头。"没关系。光把我吃得死死的。我从来没机会。她永远赢了。我得负责生孩子。" 他再次眨眼，眼神稍微恢复了些焦点。"我靠，我真是结婚了。" 他笑着抬头看他们。

"I _really_ wish we could remember last night," Asuka grumbled. "I knew this was Misato's fault."  
"我真的希望我们能记得昨晚的事，" 明日香抱怨道。"我就知道这是美里搞的鬼。"

Hikari looked at all of them. "None of you remember? Wow."  
光看着他们所有人。“你们都不记得了？哇。”

"We do not, Hikari, no," Rei said quietly. "You do? Can you tell us more? There have been... developments that we urgently desire more information about."  
“我们不记得，光，不记得，”丽轻声说。“你记得？能告诉我们更多吗？有些……发展，我们迫切需要更多信息。”

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"Er," Shinji said. He took Asuka's hand and raised it. "I think your impulse put an idea in our heads. We seem to have gotten married too."  
“呃，”真嗣说。他握住明日香的手并举起来。“我觉得你的冲动在我们脑海中种下了想法。我们似乎也结婚了。”

Hikari's eyes widened. "What, you got married _too_? Without me there?! Asuka, I've been waiting for you two to stop playing games and get together for good for five years, and you're telling me I _missed_ it?" She hesitated, lips pursing in thought. "Ok, I guess some of that is my fault. Touji and I _did_ leave the instant we could, and we left you all there. I _know_ the idea was in the air, since Misato wouldn't stop making jokes. And we were just a _little_ tipsy..."  
光的眼中闪过一丝惊讶。“什么，你也结婚了？没等我到场？！明日香，我等你们俩不再玩游戏，真正走到一起已经等了五年，你现在告诉我我错过了？”她犹豫了一下，嘴唇紧抿，陷入沉思。“好吧，我想这多少是我的错。我和冬二一有机会就离开了，把你们留在那里。我知道这想法一直萦绕在大家心头，毕竟美里一直不停地开这种玩笑。而且我们当时只是有点微醺……”

"Hikari, we were all so blind drunk none of us can remember anything. I think that's a bit more than 'tipsy'," Asuka said dryly.  
“光，我们当时都醉得不省人事，谁也记不清发生了什么。我觉得这可不仅仅是‘微醺’。”明日香干巴巴地说道。

"Good thing the staff there didn't notice or say anything!" Hikari giggled. "Once Misato pointed out we could be married before midnight, it sounded so wonderful neither of us could stand waiting any longer." She sighed happily. "And it is. I'm so sad I missed you two getting married, though! I've been waiting for that to happen since we were fifteen! Everyone could see it! I'm so happy for you two!"  
“好在那里的工作人员没注意到也没说什么！”光咯咯笑道，“一旦美里指出我们可以在午夜前结婚，这主意听起来太美妙了，我们俩都等不及了。”她幸福地叹了口气，“而且确实很美好。不过我真遗憾错过了你们俩的婚礼！我从十五岁起就在等这一天了！大家都看得出来！我真为你们俩高兴！”

"Four," Rei said. “四。”丽说。

Rei's soft statement was lost in Hikari's tsunami of romantic cheer. Hikari put a thoughtful hand on her chin. "Well," she began, "Since I wasn't there, I'm guessing Rei was your Maid of Honor, Kaworu was Shinji's Best Man, and Kaji gave away the bride?"  
丽轻柔的话语淹没在光子的浪漫欢呼浪潮中。光子若有所思地托着下巴。“嗯，”她开口道，“既然我当时不在场，我猜丽是你的伴娘，薰是真嗣的伴郎，而加持把新娘交给了新郎？”

Kaworu snorted. "No, I was not the Best Man."  
薰嗤笑一声。“不，我不是伴郎。”

Hikari looked confused. "You weren't?"  
光看起来很困惑。“你不是吗？”

"No. I was the groom," he said, smiling despite still looking rather green around the gills.  
“不，我是新郎，”他笑着说，尽管脸色依旧有些苍白。

Hikari's confusion deepened. She looked at Touji.  
光的困惑加深了。她看向了斗司。

He shook his head. "Don't look at me, hon. You know exactly where I was. I'dda been proud to be Shin-man's Best Man, but..." Touji's brain finally caught up. He slowly wobbled his stare around to Kaworu. "Wait, you were the _groom_? I thought it was Shinji and Asuka that got married?"  
他摇了摇头。“别看着我，亲爱的。你明明知道我在哪儿。我本该自豪地成为真嗣的伴郎，但是……” 冬二的大脑终于跟上了节奏。他缓缓地将目光转向了渚薰。“等等，你是新郎？我以为结婚的是真嗣和明日香？”

"They did," Rei said, a little louder than before.  
“他们确实结婚了，” 绫波说，声音比之前稍微大了一些。

Kaworu raised his left hand. Beside him, Rei did too. Their matching rings sparkled.  
渚薰举起了他的左手。在他身旁，绫波也举起了手。他们手上的婚戒闪闪发光。

Hikari covered her mouth with both her hands, but still squeed loud enough to be heard anyway. "Ohmigod ohmigod ohmigod you had a _double wedding?!_ That's even _better_! You two are so cute together! I can't believe we missed all this! Did you get a video? Tell me there's a video!"  
光用双手捂住嘴，但仍然兴奋得大声尖叫，足以让人听见。“我的天啊，我的天啊，我的天啊，你们居然办了双重婚礼？！那更棒了！你们俩在一起太可爱了！真不敢相信我们错过了这一切！你们有录像吗？告诉我有录像！”

Asuka rubbed her face with her hands. Her head throbbed, and not just from the hangover. Explaining this to her best friend was hard enough. She couldn't _wait_ for all the fun it would likely entail to explain it to everyone else she knew. On the other hand, she was actually looking forward to explaining it to her faithless father and that slut he'd picked up before her mother was even in the ground. Scandalizing him with her own happy and lusty marriage sounded wickedly entertaining. She wasn't a filthy _cheater_. She was honest and sincere and needed them and was never going to lie to _any_ of them...  
明日香用手揉了揉脸。她的头在痛，不仅仅是因为宿醉。向她最好的朋友解释这一切已经够难了。她简直无法想象，向其他认识的人解释会带来多少乐趣。另一方面，她其实很期待向她那不忠的父亲和那个在他母亲还没下葬前就勾搭上的婊子解释。用自己幸福而充满激情的婚姻来震惊他，听起来真是邪恶的乐趣。她不是肮脏的骗子。她是诚实和真挚的，需要他们，永远不会对他们中的任何一个撒谎……

Wait, what was that? She shook her head. _Focus, Soryu._ "I... I hope there's a video, too. Some explanation for this would be nice. Since it's even more complicated than you think, Hikari."  
等等，那是什么？她摇了摇头。集中注意力，Soryu。“我……我也希望有录像。对此有个解释会很好。因为这比你想象的还要复杂，光。”

"Hmmm? How? I mean, I'm happy for all four of you."  
"嗯？怎么回事？我是说，我为你们四个都感到高兴。"

"We didn't have a double wedding. We had _one_."  
"我们没有举行双人婚礼。我们只办了一场。"

Hikari blinked at her. "I don't-"  
光眨了眨眼看着她。 "我不明白-"

Rei stepped up between Asuka and Shinji, pulling Kaworu along with her. Making sure he was tucked in right behind her, she let go of Kaworu long enough to snake one arm around Shinji's waist and lay her head on Asuka's shoulder. "_We_ got married," she declared softly but firmly, a tiny smile on her lips.  
丽走到明日香和真嗣之间，顺手拉着薰一起。确保薰紧贴在她身后，她松开薰的手，用一只胳膊环住真嗣的腰，头靠在明日香的肩上。“我们结婚了，”她轻声但坚定地宣布，嘴角挂着一丝微笑。

All four of them held up their left hands.  
他们四人都举起了左手。

Hikari's eyes bugged out. "You got... wait, _all four of you_? Together?! How the Hell did that happen?"  
光的眼珠子都快瞪出来了。“你们……等等，你们四个？一起？！这到底是怎么发生的？”

"We were hoping you could tell us," Kaworu said. "None of us remember even leaving this hotel. The working theory is that this is all Misato's fault somehow. What you've told us seems to bear that out."  
"我们希望你能告诉我们，" 渚说。"我们谁也不记得离开过这家酒店。目前的推测是，这一切都是美里造成的。你告诉我们的情况似乎证实了这一点。"

"It, ah... I guess it is?" Hikari visibly struggled to collect her wits. "I can't believe all _four_ of... um, alright. Well, we were all here, drinking, having a wonderful time, when um... Touji and I got a little excited. I mean, yes, we'd been planning this official engagement for almost two years, but really having it _happen_ was... we couldn't help it. I told Touji I hated the wait. Misato said I 'needed to get fucked, in the worst way', and when I told her that nothing was going to make me break my promise to my mother to wait until I was married, she pointed out this was a city famous for 24-hour no-waiting wedding chapels. It... sounded like the greatest idea ever, at that point."  
"嗯，啊... 我想是的？" 光子明显在努力集中思绪。"我简直不敢相信我们四个... 呃，好吧。我们当时都在这里，喝酒，玩得很开心，然后... 我和冬二有点兴奋。我是说，虽然我们计划这场正式订婚已经快两年了，但真正发生时... 我们控制不住。我告诉冬二我讨厌等待。美里说我'急需被狠狠地干一回'，当我告诉她我不会违背对母亲的承诺，婚前不会发生关系时，她指出这是一座以 24 小时无需等待的婚礼教堂闻名的城市。那时... 听起来简直是绝妙的主意。"

"I think it was the 'Romulan Ale' Misato had us all drinking," Touji mumbled. "I think that stuff was _powerful_. I think I would have agreed to just about anything at that point, as long as Hikari kept kissing me. I dunno what was in that stuff, but once we started drinking that, everything got reeeeeally fuzzy."  
"我觉得是美里让我们喝的那种‘罗慕兰酒’，" 托基含糊地说。"我觉得那玩意儿劲儿很大。我想我当时什么都愿意答应，只要光继续吻我。我不知道那里面有什么，但一旦我们开始喝那个，一切都变得非常模糊。"

"So I said 'let's go!' And we all went! We found a jewelry store a few kilometers away, hit the downtown county office for the license, found the chapel a few kilometers on, and Misato organized us into a wedding party!" Hikari giggle again. "And ta-daaaa, one hour later I was _Mrs. Hikari Suzuhara_!"  
"所以我喊了声‘走吧！’然后我们就都去了！我们找到了几公里外的一家珠宝店，冲到市中心的县政府办公室领了证，又往前几公里找到了教堂，美里帮我们组织了一场婚礼！" 光再次咯咯笑道。"然后，哒哒哒，一小时后我就成了铃原光！"

"So how does that explain us?" Shinji asked.  
"那我们俩呢？" 真嗣问道。"

Hikari shook her head. "I have no idea. You were all still single when I left! Touji and I departed right after the official said 'man and wife', because I have been waiting _five damn years_ to be properly married so I can finally fuck my husband, and I was not waiting one second more than I had to." Her eyes went misty. "_So_ worth it."  
光摇了摇头。“我完全不知道。我离开时你们都还是单身！我和阿斗在牧师说完‘夫妻对拜’后立刻就离开了，因为我已经等了整整五年才正式结婚，终于可以和我的丈夫好好亲热了，我一分钟也不想多等。”她的眼眶湿润了。“这一切都太值得了。”

"Was Misato-san still there with us too, when you left us?" Shinji asked.  
“美里小姐当时也和我们在一起吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes, she and Kaji were there, laughing and cheering the whole time."  
“是的，她和加持也在那里，全程都在笑闹和欢呼。”

"Was this the establishment, Hikari?" Rei said, producing their sheaf of marriage certificates and receipts from her handbag.  
“这里是登记处吗，光？”丽从手提包里拿出他们的结婚证书和收据问道。

Hikari took them and shook her head in amazement. "Yes, this is it. The Chapel of the Flowers. We used the Crystal Gardens chapel." She handed Rei back the papers. "I take it you're heading there now to... find out what happened?"  
光接过证书，惊叹地摇了摇头。“是的，就是这里。花之礼拜堂。我们用的是水晶花园礼拜堂。”她把文件还给丽。“我想你现在是要去那里……弄清楚发生了什么吧？”

Rei nodded. "Yes. We will have to be circumspect, however. If the Chapel staff become convinced we were intoxicated beyond ability to remember at the time they performed the ceremony, they may be forced to determine it was invalid," she said calmly. Her voice hardened. "I do not wish this to happen."  
丽点点头。“是的。但我们必须谨慎行事。如果礼拜堂的工作人员认为我们当时醉得无法记事，他们可能会被迫判定仪式无效，”她平静地说道。她的语气变得坚定。“我不希望这种情况发生。”

Touji rubbed his eyes. "You... want to have this be a thing? I mean, you're not going to, uh... fix it?"  
冬二揉了揉眼睛。“你……想让这成为一件事情吗？我是说，你不会去，呃……修复它吗？”

Rei tapped one slender finger on the tattoo under her eye. "No. I have been marked and claimed and held, as have they. We are bound, hearts and souls, by love and by will until the end of us all." She looked contemplative for a moment. "Also, I do not wish to give up the pleasure of Shinji's _enormous_ co-"  
丽用她纤细的手指轻敲着眼下的纹身。“不。我已被标记、被宣称、被拥有，他们也是如此。我们因爱与意志，心与灵魂，被紧紧束缚，直到我们所有人的尽头。”她沉思了一会儿。“而且，我不想放弃享受真嗣巨大同情心的乐趣——”

Kaworu clamped a hand over Rei's mouth. "Compassion. She was going to say compassion," he improvised.  
薰迅速用手捂住了丽的嘴。“她想说同情心，”他即兴补充道。

Rei pried his hand away. "Kaworu's too." She too looked smug.  
丽将他的手推开。“卡罗也太。”她看起来也很得意。

"We're not 'fixing' anything for at least 96 hours after the fact," Asuka pointed out. "No divorces or annulments allowed in that time frame, according to the same current law that even allows for the four of us to be married in the first place."  
“我们至少在事情发生后 96 小时内不会‘修复’任何事情，”明日香指出。“根据现行法律，不允许在这段时间内离婚或取消婚姻，该法律甚至允许我们四个人首先结婚。”

"But we fly back to Japan in-" Hikari started to say.  
“但我们飞回日本——”光希开始说道。

"We _know_," Asuka cut her off. "And that's without touching on the fact we still don't know what the Hell we were thinking, or how," she looked at Rei, who was now snuggling up against Kaworu's chest, still smiling smugly, "opinions are divided on if we even _want_ to... 'fix this'. And as Rei pointed out, we've all got each others' names tattooed all over us."  
"我们知道，" 明日香打断了她。"而且这还没提到我们仍然不知道当时我们到底在想什么，或者怎么想的，" 她看向绫波，后者正依偎在渚薰的胸前，依旧得意地笑着，"至于我们是否还想'修复这一切'，意见也分歧。正如绫波所说，我们每个人身上都纹着彼此的名字。"

"What, really? All of you?"  
"什么，真的吗？你们所有人？"

Asuka felt dainty, familiar hands take her by the shoulders and turn her around, putting her back to Hikari. Rei's hand then grabbed Asuka's shirt at her beltline and pulled it up. "Yes," Rei said, "Observe. Is it not beautiful? Shinji and Kaworu's are over their hearts."  
明日香感觉到熟悉而娇小的手抓住她的肩膀，将她转过身来，背对着光。绫波的手随后抓住明日香腰带处的衬衫，向上拉起。"是的，" 绫波说，"看吧。不是很美吗？真嗣和渚薰的名字在他们的心口上。"

"Rei!" Asuka tugged her shirt back down and spun back around to hide her back. "Don't just go flashing me at Hikari, her gorilla, and everyone else in the lobby!"  
"丽！" 明日香拉下她的衬衫，迅速转过身去隐藏自己的背部。"别就这样在光、她的猩猩，还有大厅里的所有人面前炫耀给我看！"

Rei did manage to look contrite. "I am sorry, Asuka," she said apologetically. I am just giddy at the prospect of showing off our marks to everyone. You are all mine." She turned Asuka's head enough to kiss her softly. "As I am yours."  
丽确实露出了悔意。"我很抱歉，明日香，"她歉意地说道。"我只是对向大家展示我们的痕迹感到兴奋。你们都是我的。"她轻轻地转过明日香的头，温柔地吻了她一下。"正如我是你的。"

"Gleeble!" Asuka protested.  
"格利布尔！" 明日香抗议道。

"Wow... I... I didn't know you were _that_ close, Asuka," Hikari said, flushing red.  
“哇...我...我不知道你们这么亲密，明日香。” 美里说，脸颊泛红。

"The Red Demon and Rei Ayanami are kissing. I think being married has affected my brain," Touji said vaguely. His eyes glazed over again. "Hikari, can we go back upstairs and be married again some more?"  
“红魔和绫波丽在接吻。我觉得结婚已经影响我的大脑了，” 冬二含糊地说道。他的眼神再次变得呆滞。“美里，我们能回楼上再结一次婚吗？”

"I... maybe we should go with them? I mean, we didn't get our video either," Hikari said. "Either way, I'm going to have to lean on you. After last night, my legs are more wobbly than flan in an earthquake."  
“我...也许我们应该跟他们一起去？我是说，我们也没拿到录像，” 美里说。“不管怎样，我得靠着你了。经过昨晚，我的腿比地震中的布丁还软。”

"How did you get down here, if so?" Kaworu inquired.  
"你是怎么下来的呢？" 渚薰询问道。

Hikari smugged again. "My strong and virile husband carried me down from our room for breakfast. _Bridal carry_, in fact."  
光再次得意地笑了。"我那强壮有力的丈夫从我们的房间把我抱下来吃早餐。实际上是公主抱。"

"Hikari is cuddly," Touji nodded. He smiled agreeably at everyone.  
"光很可爱，" 冬二点头道。他愉快地向大家微笑。

"I think you literally fucked his brains out, Hikari," Asuka smirked.  
"我觉得你简直是把他脑子都搞飞了，光莉，" 明日香带着一丝嘲讽地笑道。

"Don't need brains. Being married is awesome. I am so pregnant," Touji... argued?  
"不需要脑子。结婚真是太棒了。我怀孕了，" 冬二...争辩道？

"Touji, buddy, I assure you, you're not pregnant," Shinji tried. "You are anatomically ill-equipped."  
"冬二，兄弟，我向你保证，你没有怀孕，" 真嗣尝试解释。"你的生理结构不允许。"

"Then we'll have to try harder. I want Hikari's babies."  
"那我们就得更努力了。我想要光的孩子。"

Kaworu patted Shinji on the shoulder. "I think he's still in shock, Shinji. Just let him be happy. It's not as if we all don't feel nearly as, ah... unmoored from our normal states of mind this morning, no?"  
渚薰拍了拍真嗣的肩膀。“我想他还处于震惊中，真嗣。就让他快乐吧。我们今天早上不也都几乎感到，呃……与平常心境脱节了吗，不是吗？”

"I... guess? I don't know. I feel weirdly... at ease," Shinji said, covering Kaworu's hand with his own. "Because I've got you, Rei, and Asuka, I think. I'd be flailing all over if I didn't."  
“我……大概吧？我不知道。我感到奇怪地……平静，”真嗣说，用自己的手覆盖住渚薰的手。“因为有了你、绫波和明日香，我想。如果没有你们，我早就手足无措了。”

Kaworu smiled back and started to lean in for a kiss. He hesitated at the last moment, looking the question at Shinji if it was ok to do this in public.  
渚薰回以微笑，开始倾身向前准备接吻。但在最后一刻他犹豫了，用眼神询问真嗣是否在公共场合这样做合适。

"_Gott_, you two are so cute..." Asuka murmured. "I mean, ahem! Let's get a taxi and go find out what happened! We've got a mystery to solve, Misato to track down, and then we blame her for all of this mess." She paused. "Finish that kiss first, though." She coughed into her hand. "Please."  
“天哪，你们俩真是太可爱了……”明日香喃喃道。“我是说，咳咳！我们赶紧打个出租车去找出发生了什么吧！我们有谜团要解，美里要追踪，然后我们把这一切混乱都归咎于她。”她顿了顿。“不过，先完成那个吻。”她用手掩嘴轻咳一声。“请吧。”

As Shinji and Kaworu happily obliged her, Rei turned to Hikari. "You are taking our situation far more calmly than I feared you might, Hikari. I was concerned you would find our unorthodox status... objectionable. You do have a bit of a reputation about strictness over 'traditional values'."  
当真嗣和渚薰欣然应允时，绫波转向光。“你对我们这种情况的接受程度远比我预想的要平静，光。我曾担心你会觉得我们这种非正统的状态……难以接受。你在‘传统价值观’方面的严格可是有些名声的。”

"You mean I was a raging prude who once blew up at the impropriety of Shinji and Asuka merely living together?" Hikari smiled. "Well, two things, Rei. First, however weird it might be, you're all as married at Touji and I, and that covers a lot of 'sin'. Second, I am so mellow right now I'm nearly Zen. I might get more uptight about it later when I come down, but I promise I'll try not to. But right now, I am _fine_."  
"你是说我曾经是个暴怒的保守派，仅仅因为真嗣和明日香同居就大发雷霆？" 光微笑着说，"好吧，有两件事，丽。首先，不管多奇怪，你们都像我和斗志一样结婚了，这掩盖了很多'罪'。其次，我现在非常放松，几乎达到了禅的境界。以后我可能会对此更加紧张，但我会尽量不这样。但现在，我很好。"

She finished the last of her coffee and patted Touji on the hand. "I think you'll have to carry me to the taxi stand, dear. Let's go help them find out what happened to them last night after we left."  
她喝完了最后一口咖啡，轻轻拍了拍斗志的手。"亲爱的，我想你得把我抱到出租车站了。我们走吧，去帮他们弄清楚昨晚我们离开后发生了什么。"

"I'm glad you talked me into that minivan for our rental, Kaworu."  
“我很高兴你劝我租了那辆小型货车，薰。”

"I knew we'd need the space, Shinji," Kaworu smiled. He bit his lip for a moment, then sidled a little closer to Shinji and took his hand as they walked.  
“我就知道我们需要这个空间，真嗣，”薰微笑着说。他咬了咬嘴唇，然后稍微靠近真嗣，牵起了他的手一起走。

Shinji jumped slightly, but quickly relaxed. No one was really staring at the two young men walking hand-in-hand through the nicely air-conditioned lobby of the hotel-casino as they headed for the parking garage. Shinji started to sweat anyhow. "Kaworu?"  
真嗣微微一跳，但很快放松下来。没有人真正盯着这两个年轻人手牵手穿过酒店赌场那空气清新的前厅，朝停车场走去。真嗣还是开始冒汗了。“薰？”

"I... want to... show off," Kaworu replied haltingly. "I am still confused as to how this came about, but I am... happy? I... Shinji, you know I have... loved you since I arrived, yes? But... anyone could see you and Asuka were something only a fool would interrupt. So I didn't. But... the idea that I could be _added_ to your pairing was... I wish I'd thought of it before. Beyond wild dreams, I mean."  
“我……想炫耀一下，”薰断断续续地回答。“我仍然困惑这是怎么发生的，但我……很高兴？我……真嗣，你知道我从来到这里就……爱着你，对吧？但是……任何人都能看出你和明日香是那种只有傻瓜才会打扰的关系。所以我没这么做。但是……想到我可能会加入你们的组合……我真希望我早点想到。我是说，这超出了我狂野的梦想。”

Shinji tried not to blush too much. Kaworu's hand in his was warm and strong, the surprising strength of another musician's fingers easy to feel. "I... um... I kind of noticed, yeah. How you... liked me. You know how I'm... bad at... _believing_ that, though. Asuka had to practically tackle me to the floor the first time we... er... got serious. And I wasn't much better with Rei. You... come on, a third person who liked me? And... it took nearly a straight liter of sake before I could admit I wanted to kiss you, remember? If Asuka hadn't dared me to, I probably would still have chickened out."  
真嗣尽量不让自己脸红得太厉害。渚薰握着他的手温暖而有力，另一位音乐家手指间出乎意料的力量轻易就能感受到。“我……嗯……我有点注意到，是的。你……喜欢我。你知道我……不擅长……相信这一点。第一次我们……呃……认真起来时，明日香几乎要把我扑倒在地。和绫波在一起时我也没好到哪儿去。你……来吧，第三个喜欢我的人？而且……我喝了将近一升清酒才敢承认我想吻你，记得吗？如果不是明日香激我，我可能到现在还不敢呢。”

"I'm glad you did not..." Kaworu's smile was _almost_ perfectly innocent. Only someone who'd known him for years could spot the wicked edge to it. "I found Rei was right. Kissing someone you love is... different. And sex even more so."  
“我很高兴你没有……”渚薰的微笑几乎完美无瑕。只有认识他多年的人才能察觉到其中一丝邪恶的边缘。“我发现绫波是对的。亲吻你所爱的人是……不同的。而性爱更是如此。”

Shinji did blush this time. It had taken a couple of years of intermittent intimacy before he'd even admitted to Asuka alone that he found men attractive too. Or at least Kaworu. He'd never felt too much pull towards other men. Not like the one he'd felt for his gray-haired friend, anyway. Asuka, happily, had found the news more arousing than shameful, the latter being something he'd feared. She'd happily bragged about Europe's 'more enlightened' attitude about it. Shinji had rebutted with a simple look in the direction of Asuka's surprisingly extensive collection of _Japanese_ yaoi manga. She'd retaliated by grabbing a hold of his groin and starting to whisper how she'd like to see him and Kaworu together, and the discussion had wandered from there. Still, actually acting on the attraction, or admitting it to anyone else had waited until that very drunken birthday party last year. He'd never minded that Asuka and Rei had always been there when they did, eagerly watching and cheering.  
这次，真嗣确实脸红了。他花了好几年断断续续的亲密时光，才向明日香一个人承认，他也觉得男人有吸引力。或者说，至少是觉得薰有吸引力。他对其他男人从未有过如此强烈的感受，至少不像他对那位灰发朋友那样。幸运的是，明日香听到这个消息后，更多的是感到兴奋而非羞耻，后者是他曾担心的情况。她兴高采烈地吹嘘欧洲对此的“更为开明”态度。真嗣则用一个简单的眼神指向明日香那令人惊讶的日本耽美漫画收藏，作为反驳。她随即反击，抓住他的下体，开始低声细语她想看他和薰在一起的情景，话题便由此展开。尽管如此，真正付诸行动或向他人承认这份吸引力，一直等到去年那场酩酊大醉的生日派对。他从不介意明日香和丽在他们身边，热切地观看和欢呼。

Hell, both girls had been firmly encouraging. Everyone knew Rei was a considerable voyeur, but Asuka... she'd been whispering in his ear the entire time he and Kaworu had first... gone further. Whispering how hot she found it... but also whispering encouragement. _Emotional_ encouragement. Telling him not to be afraid of admitting you liked someone, not to fear showing it, that she and Rei would never mock him for it.  
见鬼，两个女孩都坚定地鼓励着他。大家都知道丽是个相当爱偷窥的人，但明日香... 在他和渚薰第一次... 更进一步的时候，她一直在他耳边低语。低语说她觉得这有多么火热... 但也低语着鼓励。情感上的鼓励。告诉他不要害怕承认自己喜欢某人，不要害怕表现出来，她和丽永远不会因此嘲笑他。

And yes, sex with Kaworu had been... as intense and exciting as he'd imagined. Asuka being there, whispering in his ear, had quieted his fears even more than the alcohol had numbed them. The morning after, waking up next to the man who'd done his best to be Shinji's friend from the day they met, despite the darker whispers of the Call, Shinji hadn't felt any of the shame or regret he'd feared. Only warmth that both Kaworu and Asuka had been as happy with the night as he was.  
没错，和渚薰的性爱... 正如他所想象的那样激烈和令人兴奋。明日香在那里，在他耳边低语，比酒精更能平息他的恐惧。第二天早上，醒来时身边是那个从见面第一天起就尽力成为真嗣朋友的人，尽管有更黑暗的召唤低语，真嗣没有感到任何他担心的羞耻或后悔。只有温暖，渚薰和明日香都像他一样享受那个夜晚。

Right up until Kaworu's weakness to hangovers had reared it's head, and he'd fled the room in haste for the bathroom. Kind of like this morning, really. ...Except for the part where Kaworu was now apparently his husband. That did start his legs trembling, and more sweat rolling down his temples than the mere heat of the Las Vegas sun on the parking garage could account for. Husband. And his _two_ wives were right behind them. He... was he _allowed_ to be this happy?  
直到卡罗尔对宿醉的弱点显现出来，他急忙冲向洗手间。就像今天早上一样。...除了卡罗尔现在显然成了他的丈夫这一部分。这确实让他的双腿颤抖，额头上流下的汗水比拉斯维加斯阳光照射在停车场上的热度还要多。丈夫。而他的两位妻子就在他们身后。他...他可以这么幸福吗？

That exact insecurity had cause more than one breakup between him and Asuka. Sometimes, the better things were going, the less Shinji felt like he was worth it, like Asuka could do better than him, and that always led to him withdrawing from her right when they were getting closer than ever, and ta-da, breakup again. Made worse each time by the way it was triggered by Asuka lowering her walls a bit more. She hated the way him doing that hurt her, he hated _himself_ for hurting her... There were reasons that they'd taken five years to reach this point, despite how much they loved each other.  
正是这种不安全感导致了他和明日香之间不止一次的分手。有时候，事情进展得越好，真嗣就越觉得自己不配，好像明日香可以找到比他更好的人，这总是让他在她离他越来越近的时候退缩，然后，分手再次发生。每次都因为明日香稍微放下一些防备而变得更糟。她讨厌他那样做伤害了她，他讨厌自己伤害了她...尽管他们彼此深爱，但正是这些原因让他们花了五年时间才走到这一步。

And now here he was, walking along holding his _husband's_ hand while his wives, plural, watched the two of them with smiles. He wondered if this was some attempt by his subconscious to 'go berserk' on its own and try to overload his insecurity until it surrendered. He wasn't sure if he deserved this, but it looked like Rei wanted it, Kaworu was content with it, and Asuka... She'd been overjoyed when he'd said 'I think we got married.' And he wanted her to be happy more than anything. Was their happiness with this enough to override his fears of reaching for it? They'd all four of them been the closest of friends and lovers for years. Could he... could he do this? For them?  
而现在，他正牵着丈夫的手漫步，他的妻子们，是的，不止一个，正微笑着注视着他们。他不禁怀疑这是否是他的潜意识在自行‘发狂’，试图通过加剧他的不安全感直到它屈服。他不确信自己是否配得上这一切，但似乎丽希望如此，薰对此感到满足，而明日香...当他说出‘我想我们结婚了’时，她欣喜若狂。他最希望的就是她能快乐。他们的幸福是否足以压倒他对追求这一切的恐惧？他们四人多年来一直是亲密无间的朋友和爱人。他...他能做到吗？为了他们？

He shook his head. Maybe the... gulp... wedding video would reveal some answers. The address wasn't far away. Even in Las Vegas Traffic, they'd be there quickly once they got in the...  
他摇了摇头。或许...咕噜...婚礼视频会揭示一些答案。地址并不远。即便在拉斯维加斯的交通中，一旦他们上了...

"Dude, where's my car?" “哥们，我的车呢？”

Kaworu looked at the empty parking spot in the vast garage. "Where's your car, dude?"  
渚薰望着空荡荡的车位，在宽敞的车库里问道：“你的车呢，伙计？”

"Dude, _where's my car?_" Shinji repeated.  
“伙计，我的车呢？”真嗣重复道。

"Shin-dude, the car is missing!" Touji belatedly observed. In his arms, Hikari looked around in confusion.  
“真-伙计，车不见了！”东治后知后觉地发现。在他怀里的光则困惑地环顾四周。

Their suite, for a small additional fee of course, came with a reserved parking spot in the attached parking structure, right near the elevators. The last Shinji could _remember_, they'd parked the nice, new-model Honda minivan right there the day before. Right now, however, the spot was entirely devoid of cars, trucks, minivans, limousines, or even scooters.  
他们的套房，当然要额外支付一小笔费用，附带一个预留的停车位，就在相连的停车楼里，紧挨着电梯。据真嗣最后记得的，他们昨天就把那辆崭新的本田新款小型货车停在了那里。然而现在，这个车位却空空如也，没有汽车，没有卡车，没有小型货车，没有豪华轿车，甚至连摩托车都没有。

"Shinji, where's the car?" Asuka joined in.  
“真嗣，车呢？”明日香也加入了询问。

"I... I have no idea. We left it here... last I can remember." Shinji dug the keys out of his pants pocket and tried clicking the fob. No locating beep returned.  
“我……我不知道。我们明明把它停在这里……我最后记得的是这样。”真嗣从裤袋里掏出钥匙，试着按下遥控器。没有传来定位的哔哔声。

Rei walked past them and examined the spot from close up. "Dude, there is no car."  
丽从他们身边走过，近距离检查了那个地方。“伙计，这里没有车。”

"Rei, since when do you use 'dude'? I expect that from the boys, not you," Asuka said wryly.  
“丽，你什么时候开始用‘伙计’这个词了？我以为这是男孩子们的专利，而不是你。”明日香带着一丝讽刺说道。

"I wanted to participate." She knelt down. "I believe I have data."  
“我想参与进来。”她跪了下来。“我相信我有数据。”

"Eh? What have you got, Rei?" Asuka walked over to see what Rei had picked up.  
“嗯？丽，你找到了什么？”明日香走过去看看丽捡起了什么。

"It appears we left ourselves a message as to the disposition of our vehicle, and left it pinned here under a small rock," Rei said calmly. She examined the small scrap of paper.  
“看来我们给自己留下了一条关于车辆去向的信息，并把它压在了一块小石头下，”丽平静地说。她仔细检查着那张小纸片。

Asukan looked over at Rei's shoulder at it. "It's... a drunken doodle of a car on top of a... house?" She looked at Kaworu and Shinji. "Ok, which one of you two drunken ninnies did this? I call 'not it'. And what the _flurgen_ is this supposed to tell us?"  
明日香从丽的肩膀上看过去。“这是一张……醉酒时画的汽车在……房子上？”她看向渚薰和真嗣。“好吧，你们两个醉鬼谁干的？我声明不是我。这到底想告诉我们什么？”

"We... parked the car on the roof?" Kaworu guessed.  
"我们...把车停在了屋顶上？" 渚薰猜测道。

"Why wouldn't we park it here?" Shinji asked.  
"为什么不能停在这里？" 真嗣反问。

Asuka held up the paper. There was indeed a sloppy, ball-point pen drawing of something that vaguely resembled a car sitting on the roof of a cartoonish rendering of a house, right down to a chimney with a little curlicue of smoke coming out of it. "This is all I'm working with, baka. You tell me. You've still got the keys. You were therefore probably the driver."  
明日香举起那张纸。确实有一幅潦草的圆珠笔画，画着一辆模糊类似汽车的物体停在卡通风格的房子屋顶上，甚至连烟囱里冒出的一小缕烟都画得惟妙惟肖。"这就是我所有的线索，笨蛋。你来解释。你还有车钥匙。所以你很可能就是司机。"

"Er... Shall we go to the roof deck and see if it's there?" Kaworu suggested.  
“呃……我们去顶楼看看它是否在那儿？”渚薰提议道。

For lack of a better idea, the group headed up the stairs to the top floor of the parking garage. There were few cars on the top deck while there were still spaces open lower down and in the shaded floors, but none of them proved to be the missing rented minivan.  
由于没有更好的主意，一行人爬上楼梯到达停车场的顶层。顶层的车很少，而下面几层和阴凉处还有空位，但这些都不是他们丢失的租来的小型货车。

Asuka surveyed the handful of non-minivans in sight with a frown. She spun around to glare lightly at Shinji. "No car. Next bright idea?"  
明日香皱着眉头打量着眼前为数不多的非小型货车。她转过身，轻轻瞪了真嗣一眼。“没车。下一个好主意呢？”

Shinji frowned back. "How should I know?" he grumbled. The hangover and the blazing sun overhead were making him irritable. "I may have the keys, but we can't remember getting _married_, which is just a little more significant than 'where did we park?', so I think not knowing how to interpret a drunken doodle is forgivable!" He held up the keys and clicked the fob again.  
真嗣皱着眉头回道：“我怎么知道？”他咕哝着，宿醉和头顶炽热的阳光让他烦躁不安。“我可能有钥匙，但我们连怎么结的婚都不记得了，这可比‘我们车停哪儿了？’重要多了，所以我觉得不知道怎么解读一个醉酒涂鸦是可以原谅的！”他举起钥匙，再次按下遥控器。

There was a very faint 'beep-beep' from far overhead.  
从高空远远传来一阵微弱的‘哔哔’声。

The quartet and the couple blinked at each other before slowly looking up in unison.  
四人组和那对情侣面面相觑，然后缓缓地齐齐抬头望去。

Far, far above them, the main tower of Caesar's Palace loomed over the parking garage. Shinji clicked the key fob once more, and was rewarded by another faint 'beep-beep' coming from the top.  
在他们上方极远之处，凯撒宫的主塔俯视着停车场。真嗣再次按下钥匙扣，随即从顶层传来了又一次微弱的‘哔哔’声。

"The car..." he said slowly.  
“那辆车……”他缓缓说道。

"...is on the roof," Asuka finished, equal disbelief in her voice.  
“……在屋顶上，”明日香接话道，语气中同样充满了难以置信。

"This was an excellent note," Rei observed. "Concise and accurate."  
“这是一张极好的纸条，”丽观察道，“简洁而准确。”

Kaworu rubbed his face with his hands. "Why did we... nevermind. I'll go take a look." There was a faint frisson of energy as he lightly flared his AT-Field, and he floated swiftly up into the air.  
渚薰用手揉了揉脸。“为什么我们……算了。我去看看。”他轻轻地展开 AT 力场，一股微弱的能量波动随之产生，他迅速飘向空中。

Once he was level with the roof of the casino, he took a look and shouted back down to them. "I found it. It's on the roof, alright. Hang on, I'll bring it down."  
当他与赌场的屋顶齐平时，他环顾四周并向下方喊道：“找到了。确实在屋顶上。稍等，我这就把它带下来。”

The Nephilim raised his hand towards the roof of the casino. A moment later their missing minivan appeared, floating gently through the air on another AT-Field. Kaworu drifted downward alongside it, letting it settle to the concrete of the parking garage with hardly a bounce.  
那名拿非利人将手伸向赌场的屋顶。片刻后，他们失踪的面包车便出现了，在另一个 AT 力场的支撑下，轻轻地飘浮在空中。渚薰伴随着它缓缓下降，让它几乎毫无颠簸地落在了停车场的混凝土地面上。

The other three stared at it. "Um..." Shinji said slowly. "Why..."  
其他三人盯着这一幕。"呃..." 真嗣缓缓开口，"为什么..."

"...is there a bear in the driver's seat?" Asuka finished again.  
"...驾驶座上会有一只熊？" 明日香再次接话道。

"Ah, good morning, Mrs. Growlski!" Rei said, in what passed for brightly from her.  
"啊，早上好，格罗尔斯基夫人！" 丽用她特有的方式欢快地说道。

The other three slowly shifted their stares to Rei. "Rei... how did you... 'Mrs. Growlski'?" Shinji asked.  
其他三人缓缓将目光转向丽。"丽...你怎么会...‘格罗尔斯基夫人’？" 真嗣问道。

"She's wearing the pink fez. That's how you tell them apart."  
"她戴着那顶粉红色的菲斯帽。这就是区分她们的方法。"

"Rei, how do you _know_ that?"  
"丽，你怎么知道的？"

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"That just raises _further_ questions!" Kaworu protested.  
"那只会引发更多问题！" 渚抗议道。

The polar bear blinked awake and gave them all a suspicious squint. She rolled the window down and growled and harrumphed at them for a moment.  
北极熊眨了眨眼醒来，对他们投以怀疑的斜视。她摇下车窗，对他们咆哮和哼哼了一会儿。

"Yes, that's probably a good idea," Rei said. She turned to her spouses. "She's offering to do the driving if we're going somewhere, since she's betting we're all either still drunk or really hungover."  
"是的，这主意可能不错，"丽说。她转向她的配偶们。"她提出要开车，如果我们去什么地方的话，因为她赌我们全都还醉着或者宿醉严重。"

The wind blew a small tumbleweed across the garage's sunlit roof.  
风卷起一个小风滚草，吹过车库阳光照射的屋顶。

"Rei," Asuka said carefully, "Since when do you speak 'bear'?"  
"丽，"明日香小心翼翼地说，"你什么时候会说'熊语'了？"

Rei gave a tiny smile and shook her head. "I don't speak 'bear', Asuka. That would be silly. I speak decent Russian, though. And Lieutenant and Mrs. Growlski are from Siberia, of course." Rei walked over to the minivan, opened the passenger door, and got in. "I will sit up front and help navigate."  
丽微微一笑，摇了摇头。“我不会说‘熊语’，明日香。那太傻了。不过我的俄语说得还不错。格罗尔斯基中尉和夫人当然是来自西伯利亚。”丽走向小型货车，打开副驾驶门，坐了进去。“我坐前面帮忙导航。”

Shinji and Kaworu shared a glance. "When did you learn Russian?" Shinji asked.  
真嗣和薰交换了一个眼神。“你什么时候学的俄语？”真嗣问道。

"Last year. I developed a taste for numerous Russian porn sites, and available translations were poor or nonexistent." She pulled a pair of sunglasses out of the sun visor and put them on. She looked out at the rest. "I believe the appropriate quote here is 'get in, losers, we're going cruising.'" She waved at the back of the van.  
“去年。我迷上了好几个俄语色情网站，但可用的翻译要么质量差，要么根本不存在。”她从遮阳板里抽出一副太阳镜戴上。她向外看着其他人。“这里应该引用一句‘上车吧，失败者们，我们要去兜风了’。”她向货车后部挥了挥手。

"I guess that explains why Rei got really into vodka that year. This day just keeps getting stranger," Kaworu said, shaking his head. He opened the side door and got in the back row.  
“我想这解释了那年丽为什么对伏特加那么着迷。今天真是越来越奇怪了。” 渚摇着头说。他打开侧门，坐到了后排。

Asuka gave her friend an apologetic look. "I'm really sorry we can't remember your wedding, Hikari."  
明日香向她的朋友投去歉意的目光。“真的很抱歉我们不记得你的婚礼了，光。”

The brunette shrugged. "That's what the video is for, I suppose. And I'm pretty sure we're still going to do a traditional Japanese one once we're home, so our families can come. _I_ am sorry I missed yours entirely! I was expecting to be your maid of honor since about 2016! Well, me or Rei."  
棕发女孩耸了耸肩。“我想这就是录像的意义所在吧。而且我确信我们回家后还会再办一场传统的日本婚礼，这样我们的家人也能参加。很抱歉我完全错过了你的婚礼！我本以为从 2016 年起就会成为你的伴娘呢！嗯，要么是我，要么是丽。”

"Does it bother anyone else that the _polar bear_ is driving?" Shinji said worriedly.  
"北极熊在开车，这事儿有人觉得不对劲吗？" 真嗣担忧地说道。

"And where did she get the spare keys?" Touji added.  
"她是从哪儿弄来的备用钥匙？" 冬二补充道。

"Take the next left," Rei told the driver. She turned back to look at Shinji. "Better her than us, I think. You are all quite hungover, and I might still be slightly intoxicated."  
"下一个路口左转，" 丽对司机说。她转过头来看着真嗣。"我觉得她开车总比我们强。你们都宿醉未醒，而我可能还有点儿醉意。"

"This remains extremely unfair," Kaworu muttered. Even the mild motion of the car through traffic was making him look green and nauseous. "I always have the worst hangovers."  
"这仍然极其不公平，" 渚薰喃喃道。即便是车辆在交通中轻微的移动也让他看起来脸色发青，感到恶心。"我总是有最糟糕的宿醉。"

"Yes, but you are a very happy and snuggly drunk, and utterly amazing in bed when you're well lit," Rei replied without missing a beat, still totally deadpan. "Flexible, too."  
"是的，但你喝醉时非常快乐和黏人，而且当你状态好时在床上简直令人惊叹，" 绫波零毫不犹豫地回答，依旧面无表情。"还很灵活。"

Hikari covered her mouth, partly smothering a laugh. "Rei, I think you are still a little drunk. Your verbal filters go right out the window when you are, and you're sounding like that now."  
光捂住嘴，部分地压抑着笑声。"绫波，我觉得你还是有点醉。你喝醉时语言过滤器就完全失效了，现在听起来就是这样。"

"I'm also affected by the sheer emotional overload of the morning. I am quite giddy at the prospect of being married to the three people I love the most in the world, and have extensive, regular, and extremely fulfilling sexual encounters with in addition to less directly active periods of pure emotional intimacy. I am currently experiencing the most fascinating combination of arousal and romantic joy. I would prefer that this state last as long as possible."  
"我也被早晨的强烈情感冲击所影响。想到能与世界上我最爱的三个人结婚，并且除了纯粹情感亲密的非直接活跃期外，还能有广泛、规律且极其满足的性接触，我感到非常兴奋。我现在正经历着一种既兴奋又浪漫的奇妙结合。我希望能尽可能长久地保持这种状态。"

Hikari blinked. Rei had said all that with no change of tone or expression. "Um... good to hear, then? I take it you are, ah... one vote for staying married, and not trying to undo this?"  
光眨了眨眼。丽用同样的语气和表情说了这一切。“嗯...那很好，对吧？我猜你是...支持维持婚姻，而不是试图解除它？”

"Quite. I postulate that the tattoos may have been my idea, since they help underline the permanence."  
"确实如此。我推测纹身可能是我的主意，因为它们有助于强调永久性。"

"You sure? I mean..." Hikari looked at the others. "A.. four-way marriage? That... well, it might be legal here, but back home it's going to get a lot of funny looks."  
"你确定吗？我是说..." 光看着其他人。"四人婚姻？那...在这里可能是合法的，但在家乡会引来很多奇怪的目光。"

"I have blue hair, red eyes, am part space alien, and am already globally famous for my part in the Angel War and the defeat of SEELE. I submit to you that state of affairs makes any additional worries about being stared at moot."  
"我有蓝头发，红眼睛，部分是外星人，而且已经在全球因参与天使战争和击败 SEELE 而闻名。我认为这种情况使得任何关于被盯着看的担忧都变得无关紧要了。"

"...point," Hikari conceded. "I just... mostly figured it was going to be you and Kaworu one day, right along with Shinji and Asuka. Not... this."  
"...有道理，" 光承认道。"我只是...大多时候以为有一天会是你们和渚在一起，就像真嗣和明日香那样。而不是...这样。"

"I am happy. Among other things it means I do not have to cease sexual relations with any of them, or combinations thereof. I can continue this, and deepen the far more fulfilling emotional intimacy as well. I with to do this extensively with all of them."  
"我很高兴。这意味着我不必与他们中的任何一个或组合停止性关系。我可以继续这样做，并加深更为充实的情感亲密。我希望与他们所有人广泛地这样做。"

Shinji blushed. "Rei, filters..."  
真嗣脸红了。 "绫波，过滤器……"

"This marriage may be a surprise, but I am content. I do not wish to undo this. I love them all beyond my ability to verbally express, and have for some time, Hikari. While I may not be able to express it to my satisfaction, I wish to spend the rest of my life trying," Rei stated firmly.  
"这场婚姻虽然出乎意料，但我很满足。我不希望解除它。我对他们的爱超越了我用言语表达的能力，而且已经有一段时间了，光。虽然我可能无法充分表达，但我希望用余生去尝试，"绫波坚定地说道。"

Hikari opened and closed her mouth a few times. "Well," she said eventually. "I can kind of understand that feeling, I suppose." She looked at Touji and gave him a kiss.  
光打开又闭上了几次嘴巴。“嗯，”她最终说道，“我想我能稍微理解那种感觉。”她看着真嗣，给了他一个吻。

"Hee hee, babies," Touji mumbled happily, a goofy grin on his face. "What she said, too. Same for me."  
“嘻嘻，宝贝们，”真嗣开心地咕哝着，脸上挂着傻笑。“她说的也是。我也是这么想的。”

"I'm pretty sure you're not interested in sex with Kaworu, Touji," Asuka snarked. "Or even cuddling."  
“我很确定你对渚薰没性趣，真嗣，”明日香嘲讽道，“甚至连抱抱都不感兴趣。”

"Nope. Just Hikari. Lots and lots. So married. Mweee..."  
"不是的。只有光。很多很多。已经结婚了。喵呜..."

Mrs. Growlski harrumphed something more, pointing with one paw.  
葛罗尔斯基夫人哼了一声，用一只爪子指着。

"We are here," Rei interpreted.  
"我们到了，" 丽解释道。

Shinji was very grateful for the dark sunglasses he'd found in one of the minivan's pockets. Even with them, the ohgodsobrightithurrrrrrts sun made him wince badly as they all piled out on the parking lot in front of the Chapel of the Flowers. It did look vaguely familiar to Shinji's eyes. Obviously, if they'd been there last night and gotten married, according to the paperwork Asuka had in her hand, but it still felt weird to him that he could only get a hazy deja-vu feeling of having been there before when it was theoretically the site of the most important moment in his life since the day they'd averted Third Impact.  
真嗣非常感激他在面包车口袋里找到的那副深色太阳镜。即便戴着它们，那刺眼得要命的阳光还是让他痛苦地皱起了眉头，当他们一起走出停车场，来到花之教堂前时。那地方在真嗣眼里看起来有些模糊的熟悉感。显然，如果他们昨晚真的在那里结了婚，正如明日香手中的文件所证明的那样，但对他来说，这仍然感觉很奇怪，因为他只能隐约感觉到曾经来过这里的既视感，尽管从理论上讲，这是自他们阻止第三次冲击以来他生命中最重要的时刻。

Mrs. Growlski harrumphed and growled at Rei for a moment as she got out. Rei nodded and closed the passenger door. "Mrs. Growlski will stay here and keep the air conditioning going so the car is cool. She doesn't like Vegas' heat," she reported as they started to walk to the chapel's front entrance.  
格罗尔斯基夫人哼了一声，对绫波咆哮了一会儿，然后下了车。绫波点点头，关上了副驾驶的门。“格罗尔斯基夫人会留在这里，让空调继续运转，这样车子就能保持凉爽。她不喜欢拉斯维加斯的热浪。”她报告道，他们开始向教堂的前门走去。

Shinji and Kaworu shared a confused look before a simultaneous shrug as they fell in behind Rei and Asuka. Shinji put his arm around Kaworu as they went. His husband (!) still looked pretty green, and the sunlight and heat was hitting him even harder than it was Shinji. Kaworu gave him a grateful nod and a weak smile.  
真嗣和薰困惑地对视了一眼，随即同时耸了耸肩，跟在绫波和明日香身后。真嗣伸手揽住薰，他们一起走着。他的丈夫（！）脸色依旧苍白，阳光和热浪对他来说比对真嗣影响更大。薰感激地点头，露出一个虚弱的微笑。

Gods, that smile always made Shinji's stomach flutter. And the feeling of being able to put his arms around Kaworu _in public_... Shinji gulped as they went inside and the blissful cool of high-powered a/c washed over them.  
天啊，那个微笑总是让真嗣的心跳加速。能够在公共场合拥抱薰的感觉……真嗣咽了口唾沫，他们走进室内，强劲的空调带来的凉爽让他们感到无比幸福。

The woman at the counter looked up from her smartphone as the band of newlyweds approached. "Ah, hello, Mrs. Soryu-Ayanami! Great to have you and your spouses back so soon! You too, Mister and Misses Suzuhara. I'm betting you're here to pick up your videos? You all left in such a hurry last night, but I can understand why."  
柜台后的女士从智能手机上抬起头，看着这群新婚夫妇走近。“啊，你好，绫波-明日香太太！很高兴你们这么快就回来了！还有，铃原先生和太太。我猜你们是来取录像带的吧？昨晚你们走得那么匆忙，但我能理解为什么。”

Asuka blinked. She looked again at the papers in her hand. She'd glanced at them before they'd left, but mostly just to verify they were indeed their marital paperwork and to get the address of the chapel. She hadn't looked at the details. But yes, right there in black and white, was her new, legal name and those of her spouses: _Asuka Langley Soryu-Ayanami, wife: Rei Soryu-Ayanami, husband #1: Shinji Soryu-Ayanami, husband #2: Kaworu Soryu-Ayanami._  
明日香眨了眨眼。她再次看向手中的文件。出发前她只是匆匆扫了一眼，主要是确认这些确实是他们的婚姻文件，并获取了教堂的地址。她没有细看细节。但没错，白纸黑字上写着她新的法定名字以及配偶们的名字：惣流·明日香·兰格雷-绫波，妻子：绫波·惣流·绫波，丈夫#1：碇·惣流·绫波，丈夫#2：渚·惣流·绫波。

'They took my name? All of them? I...'  
'他们用了我的姓？全都用了？我...'

Asuka bit her lip and suppressed the urge to grab one or all of them and kiss their brains out. Or cry. But neither of those were something she could let herself do right now. They were in public. And... reasons. Yeah. She shook herself. _'Focus, Asuka.'_  
明日香咬了咬唇，强压下抓住他们中的一个或全部狂吻一番的冲动。或者哭泣。但这两种情绪她现在都不能表露出来。他们在公共场合。而且...有原因的。没错。她摇了摇头。'专注，明日香。'

"Ah... you can understand?" Asuka began. "You'll have to refresh us. I'm afraid there was just a _bit_ of celebratory drinking afterwards, so we're all kind of hung over and blurry on something we all really wish we we're crystal clear on."  
“啊……你能理解吗？”明日香开始说道，“你得帮我们回忆一下。恐怕是因为事后庆祝喝多了，我们现在都有点宿醉，对一些我们本该记得清清楚楚的事情感到模糊。”

The young blonde woman smiled and nodded. "Ma'am, I've worked here for five years, seen hundreds of weddings, but I don't think I've ever seen any couple or more come through here that was as... as _joyful_ as you and yours were, or more in love. That speech you gave to propose to them all was... I swear, we had at least three couples and one trio sign up to get married today because of your speech. It was the most moving and romantic thing any of us had ever heard. I kissed my husband so hard that night when I got home..."  
那位年轻的金发女子微笑着点点头。“女士，我在这里工作五年了，见过数百场婚礼，但我想我从没见过哪对情侣或更多人像你们这样……如此快乐，如此相爱。你那番求婚的演讲……我发誓，至少有三对情侣和一组三人因为你的演讲决定今天结婚。那是我们听过的最感人、最浪漫的事情。我那天晚上回家后，狠狠地亲了我的丈夫……”

Asuka stared at her. "What."  
明日香盯着她。“什么。”

The countergirl nodded, smiling broadly. "Actually, my manager said he wanted to talk to you when you came in to pick up the disc. He wanted to talk to you about seeing if we could use some of it in our marketing and advertising materials. We would compensate you and credit you, of course, but only if you wanted us to. We could anonymize it as well. We can understand if you want to avoid anyone making a fuss about your... unusual arrangement. Though you did um... shout to the entire parking lot 'HOLY SHIT, I'M MARRIED!' as you all left last night. Mrs. Suzuhara did too, come to think of it."  
柜台女孩点头微笑。“实际上，我的经理说当你来取光盘时他想和你谈谈。他想和你讨论是否可以将其中一些内容用于我们的营销和广告材料。当然，我们会补偿你并给你署名，但前提是你愿意。我们也可以匿名处理。如果你不想引起别人对你...特殊安排的注意，我们能理解。不过，你们昨晚离开时...对着整个停车场大喊‘天哪，我结婚了！’。铃原太太也是，想想看。”

"What." Asuka was still frozen.  
“什么。”明日香仍然僵在原地。

Shinji slid up next to Asuka and took her hand, massaging the back of it with his thumb. "Er... that's um... very kind of you, but could we see the video first? We're not really in shape for ah... detailed negotiations right now," he said to the woman.  
真嗣滑到明日香身边，握住她的手，用拇指按摩她的手背。“呃...你们真是太好了，但我们能先看看视频吗？我们现在不太适合...进行详细的谈判，”他对那位女士说。

"Oh! I'm sorry Mister Soryu-Ayanami! Yes, of course. I'm terribly sorry. We're all just... very excited by it. To tell the truth, the staff have been watching it over and over again this morning, showing it the morning staff who weren't here last night to see it. Please, follow me. I'll take you right to the video department."  
"哦！对不起，索吕-绫波先生！当然，非常抱歉。我们只是……对此非常兴奋。说实话，今天早上工作人员一直在反复观看，给那些昨晚不在的早班员工展示。请跟我来，我会直接带您去视频部门。"

She walked out from behind the counter and gestured for them all to follow her down the hall to the right.  
她从柜台后走出来，示意他们所有人都跟着她沿着走廊向右走。

"Asuka, what did you _say_?" Hikari hissed in her ear as they followed.  
"明日香，你说了什么？" 他们跟着走时，光在她的耳边低声问道。"

"I... I don't _know_!" Asuka finally managed, snapping out of her shock. "You don't remember?"  
"我...我不知道！" 明日香终于回过神来，脱口而出。"你不记得了吗？"

Hikari shook her head. "We were pretty drunk too, but I don't remember you making any speeches before Touji and I left, so it must have been after that."  
光摇了摇头。"我们当时也喝得挺醉的，但我记得你没在我们离开前发表什么演讲，所以应该是那之后的事。"

"Were Commander Katsuragi and Inspector Kaji still here? Would they know?" Kaworu asked.  
"葛城司令和加持 Inspector 还在吗？他们会知道吗？" 渚薰问道。"

"It was probably her _fault_," Asuka muttered. "And it doesn't matter if they know or not. We're about to see it for ourselves anyway."  
"这大概得怪她，" 明日香嘀咕道。"不管他们知不知道，反正我们马上就要亲眼看到了。"

"I just want to know how much to thank them or blame them," Kaworu replied.  
"我只是想知道该感谢他们多少，还是该责怪他们多少，" 渚薰回答道。"

"Thank. Definitely thank," Rei said softly, smiling faintly.  
"感谢。绝对是感谢，" 绫波丽轻声说道，微微一笑。"

Shinji let go of Asuka's hand and pondered the idea himself as they walked. How did he feel about all this, really? Misato _had_ been encouraging of him and Asuka as a pair, and more than once been Shinji's shoulder to cry on when he'd fucked things up and caused another temporary break-up with her. Especially the first bad one, where Shinji had been afraid that was it forever. Misato had been the one to reassure him Asuka loved him back just as much as he loved her, just that they were both bad at communicating it. She'd been the one to give him the courage to try again.  
真嗣松开了明日香的手，边走边自己思考这个问题。他到底是怎么看待这一切的呢？美里一直鼓励他和明日香在一起，而且在他搞砸事情导致和明日香短暂分手时，多次成为他的倾诉对象。特别是第一次严重的分手，当时真嗣害怕那会是永远的结束。美里是那个安慰他明日香同样深爱着他的人，只是他们都不擅长表达。她给了他再次尝试的勇气。

And now here he was. _Married_. To not just Asuka, but Rei and Kaworu as well. The three people in the world who had _said_ they loved him. That Asuka had been half-drunk, fully nude, lying on top of him, and blushing as red as her hair when she mumbled, then shouted it at him had only made him even more sure she was telling the truth. That Rei and Kaworu had said it more softly and sweetly as they held him on their own occasions had been very... them.  
而现在，他就在这里。结婚了。不仅是和明日香，还有丽和薰。世界上那三个说爱他的人。明日香当时半醉半醒，全身赤裸地躺在他身上，脸红得像她的头发一样，先是喃喃自语，然后大声对他喊出那句话，这让他更加确信她说的是真话。而丽和薰在各自的时刻温柔甜蜜地对他说出那句话，非常符合他们的风格。

_'Huh. In fact, all three of them said that to me while we were all naked, buzzed, and post-coital. And we got married nearly the same way. My love life is as deep and wild as it is partly thanks to alcohol. I think I can blame-slash-thank Misato for that one too,'_ he mused. His eyes were almost automatically drawn to the three backsides walking in front of him. They were all gorgeous, from Asuka's stunning, toned one to Rei's smooth, sweetly curved one to Kaworu's firm, mathematically perfect one. They all loved him and would happily spend all day in bed with him, and had more than once. And he now had official permission to do this for the rest of their lives, every night. All three of them...  
"“哈，实际上，他们三个都曾在赤身裸体、微醺且事后的时候对我说过同样的话。我们的婚礼也几乎是以同样的方式举行的。我的爱情生活既深沉又狂野，部分得归功于酒精。我想我也可以把这归咎于——或者说感谢——美里，”他沉思道。他的目光几乎不由自主地被走在前面的三个背影吸引。她们每一个都美得惊人，从明日香那令人惊艳、线条分明的背，到绫波那光滑、曲线优美的背，再到渚薰那坚实、数学般完美的背。她们都深爱着他，愿意整天和他躺在床上，而且不止一次。现在，他得到了正式的许可，可以每晚都这样做，直到永远。她们三个……”

Shinji Soryu-Ayanami became uncomfortably aware he was suddenly feeling very... compassionate. Oops.  
碇苍龙-绫波突然意识到自己感到非常……同情。哎呀。

He dropped his hands to attempt to cover the abrupt appearance of a tent pole in his trousers. The effort was doomed to failure. He could feel his cheeks heating.  
他放下手试图遮住裤子里突然出现的帐篷。这种努力注定要失败。他感觉到自己的脸颊在发热。

Rei sensed his agitation, and turned to examine his face. She opened her mouth to speak, but stopped before she uttered a single word, seeing his face. He could see her eyes widen, then flicker downward for a moment. A small but definite _smirk_ appeared on her lips. Lips she made sure to slowly lick after she made sure she had eye contact with him. Shinji swallowed, his blush and... compassion getting worse.  
丽感受到了他的焦虑，转过身来审视他的脸。她张开嘴想要说话，却在发出声音前停住了，因为她看到了他的表情。他能看到她的眼睛睁大，然后短暂地向下闪烁。她的唇边浮现出一抹微小却明确的笑意。在确保与他目光接触后，她故意慢慢地舔了舔嘴唇。真嗣咽了咽口水，他的脸红和...同情心愈发严重了。

"You are... tense, my husband. This may be embarrassing," Rei whispered. "I have an idea."  
“你...很紧张，我的丈夫。这可能会让你感到尴尬，”丽低声说，“我有个主意。”

A couple of minutes of walking took the group to the back of the chapel's office side. Rachel, the countergirl, smiled at them as she rapped on the door marked 'Video Department'. A moment later it opened, and she waved them inside.  
几分钟后，一行人走到了教堂办公室的后面。柜台女孩瑞秋朝他们微笑，敲了敲标有‘视频部门’的门。片刻后门开了，她挥手示意他们进去。

Asuka blinked in surprise again. On the large screen over the broad video editing console and monitors, her own face was frozen on a paused video.  
明日香再次惊讶地眨了眨眼。在宽大的视频编辑控制台和监视器上方的大屏幕上，她自己的脸定格在一段暂停的视频中。

"Oh... oh my. Asuka, you look..." Kaworu tried to find words for it. "Asuka, you're _beautiful_."  
“哦……我的天。明日香，你看起来……” 渚薰试图找到合适的词来形容。“明日香，你真美。”

The Asuka on the screen was frozen mid-radiant smile, a look of unfettered joy lighting up her face. She looked impossibly happy, her brilliant blue eyes sparkling at the camera over Shinji's shoulder. The Third Child's back was to the camera, so she was apparently speaking to him at the time the video was paused. Or possibly Rei or Kaworu, who were standing close to Shinji, all three of them facing Asuka.  
屏幕上的明日香定格在灿烂的笑容中，脸上洋溢着无拘无束的喜悦。她看起来无比幸福，她那明亮的蓝眼睛透过真嗣的肩膀闪烁着对着镜头。第三适格者的背影对着镜头，所以她显然是在视频暂停时对他说话。也可能是对绫波或渚薰，他们三人站得离真嗣很近，都面向明日香。

It took Asuka a moment to tear her gaze away, her cheeks slightly pink. "I..." She coughed, her throat suddenly tight. "I take it that's my... ah, speech?"  
过了一会儿，明日香才移开视线，双颊微微泛红。“我……”她清了清突然发紧的喉咙，“我猜那是我……呃，演讲？”

The video tech, a Hispanic man who's nametag said 'Roberto', nodded. He looked shocked himself, suddenly face to face with the woman on his screens. "Uh... y-yes, ma'am. Actually, that's right after it. We were trying to capture the look on your face at that particular moment."  
视频技术人员，一位姓氏牌上写着‘罗伯托’的拉丁裔男子点了点头。他自己也显得很震惊，突然间与屏幕上的女子面对面。“呃……是、是的，女士。实际上，就在那之后。我们试图捕捉您在那个特定时刻的表情。”

"That particular moment?" Hikari asked. "Because she looks so happy?"  
“那个特定时刻？”光问，“因为她看起来很开心吗？”

"That's the moment all three of them said 'Yes', ma'am," he explained. "You... lit up when they did. Even more than during your proposal speech."  
"就在那一刻，他们三人都说了‘是的，女士’，"他解释道。"你……在他们答应时，你的光芒更加耀眼了。甚至比你在求婚演讲时还要明亮。"

Asuka colored further. "A_hem_!" she cleared her throat again. "S-so I see. I... wait, _I_ asked _them?_All three of them? And I made a _speech_?"  
绫波的脸更红了。"咳咳！"她再次清了清嗓子。"那……我明白了。我……等等，是我向他们求婚的？三个人都？我还发表了演讲？"

"Yes, ma'am." The tech hesitated. "You... don't remember? Uh... from the video, the entire thing was your idea."  
"是的，女士。"技术员犹豫了一下。"您……不记得了吗？呃……从视频来看，整个事情都是您的想法。"

"We got a bit drunk afterwards," Asuka mumbled. "And I bet some of the blame goes to Misato on both parts of that. I-...wait, where are Shinji and Rei?"  
"后来我们有点喝多了，" 明日香含糊地说。"我敢打赌，这责任有一部分得归咎于美里。我...等等，真嗣和绫波去哪儿了？"

Kaworu, Hikari, and Touji blinked and looked behind them. There was a distinct lack of Children, First or Third.  
渚薰、光和剑介眨了眨眼，回头看去。那里明显少了第一和第三适格者。

"I... they were right behind us when we left the front, I thought?" Touji said.  
"我...我们离开前门的时候，他们明明就跟在我们后面，我以为？" 剑介说道。

Asuka massaged her forehead. "How do _both_ of them get lost in... agh. Kaworu, where are they?"  
明日香揉着额头。“他们俩怎么会在……啊。渚薰，他们在哪儿？”

Kaworu smiled a bit and swept his eyes across the wall and door. He always did seem to enjoy using his powers at the command of his friends-turned-spouses. "I... there they are. I See them coming down the hall. They'll be here in a moment."  
渚薰微微一笑，目光扫过墙壁和门。他似乎总是乐于在朋友兼配偶的命令下使用自己的能力。“我……他们就在那儿。我看到他们正沿着走廊过来。马上就到了。”

A patter of rapidly approaching feet sounded in the hall, resolving to a missing pair of ex-Pilots slowing down to a walk, their faces red and slightly sweaty. "H-Hi, everyone!" Shinji stammered. "We just got a l-little... sidetracked. Rei and I, um..." He looked at Rei, who was smiling enigmatically.  
走廊里传来一阵急促的脚步声，随后消失不见，取而代之的是一对前驾驶员放慢脚步，面颊微红，略显汗湿。“大、大家好！”真嗣结巴道，“我们只是稍微……走神了。绫波和我，呃……”他看向绫波，她正神秘地微笑着。

The bluenette sauntered over to Kaworu, put her hands on his cheeks, and pulled him into a deep kiss. She broke it off after just a few seconds, however, and turned to do the same thing to Asuka.  
蓝发女孩悠闲地走向渚薰，双手捧住他的脸颊，深深地吻了上去。然而，仅仅几秒钟后，她就结束了这个吻，转身同样对待明日香。

Asuka's eyes went wide as Rei thoroughly kissed her wife. Rei ducked her head to the side to whisper something in Asuka's ear when she ended the kiss, and tucked something into Asuka's right pocket as she did. Asuka's face was beet red when Rei pulled back, and she was biting her lip hard and panting.  
明日香的眼睛因绫波深情地亲吻她的妻子而瞪大。绫波在结束吻后，侧头在她耳边低语了几句，并顺势将某物塞进了明日香的右口袋。当绫波退开时，明日香的脸红得像甜菜根，紧咬着嘴唇，急促地喘息着。

"You can check if you want to," Rei purred quietly. She licked her lips.  
“你可以检查一下，如果你想的话。”绫波轻声细语地低吟，舔了舔嘴唇。

Asuka emitted a high-pitched keening noise, closed her eyes, and vibrated in place for a moment. She gasped and sagged when it ended. She fixed Rei with a glare that managed to mix vengeful admiration and no small amount of frustrated lust. "I... am... _so_ going... to get you... for that... later," Asuka panted.  
明日香发出了一声尖锐的哀鸣，闭上眼睛，原地颤抖了一会儿。当这一切结束时，她喘着气瘫软下来。她用一种混合着报复性的钦佩和不少挫败欲望的眼神瞪着绫波。“我……迟早……会……让你……为此……付出代价……”明日香喘息着说。

"Tonight, I am all yours," Rei said with a tiny smirk.  
“今晚，我完全属于你，”绫波带着一丝微妙的笑意说道。

Asuka bit down on a groan and pinched her eyes shut. "_Stop_ that, you little minx!"  
明日香咬紧牙关，抑制住呻吟，并紧闭双眼。“别这样，你这个小妖精！”

"Not for the rest of our lives," Rei replied. She looked at Kaworu. "Did I put a thought in your head, my other husband?"  
"不是一辈子的事，" 丽回答道。她看向渚。"我是不是在你的脑海里种下了什么念头，我的另一位丈夫？"

The gray-haired Nephilim tore his eyes from where he'd been staring at Shinji. He swallowed. "Nnnng. Nope. I'm good," Kaworu said in a strangled voice. "I'm just going to... stand behind this chair for a bit."  
灰发的拿非利人从盯着真嗣的地方移开了视线。他咽了咽口水。"嗯，没有。我很好，" 渚用一种窒息的声音说道。"我只是要...站在这把椅子后面一会儿。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji's hand and hauled him closer. "Shinji, my dear, could you help hold me up for a bit? My knees are feeling a bit wobbly." She threw another glare at Rei, who continued to look like a cat that had definitely gotten a canary or two.  
明日香抓住真嗣的手，把他拉近了些。"真嗣，亲爱的，你能帮我撑一会儿吗？我的膝盖有点发软。"她又瞪了丽一眼，而丽依旧像是一只绝对已经吃到了一两只金丝雀的猫。

Shinji obligingly put his arms around her, and muttered something into her ear. Asuka's face softened a little. "Dork." She shook herself. "Alright, ah... Roberto? Could you start it... no, wait, back up a bit. Show us the Suzuhara's first, since we came for them first."  
真嗣顺从地抱住她，对着她的耳朵低语了几句。明日香的脸色稍稍缓和了一些。“呆子。”她摇了摇头。“好吧，呃……罗伯特？你能开始了吗……不，等等，先倒回去一点。先给我们看看铃原家的，毕竟我们是为他们来的。”

"Of course, ma'am." The tech sat back down and began pulling up the appropriate video. Rachel closed the door to give them a modicum of privacy to watch, but stayed around herself, apparently wanting to see the whole thing again.  
“当然，女士。”技术人员重新坐下，开始调出相应的视频。瑞秋关上门，给他们留出一点私人空间观看，但她自己却留在一旁，显然是想再看一遍整个过程。

_14 hours before 14 小时前  
_  
"I can't believe we're really doing this!" Hikari almost squealed. "Oh god oh god oh god I've wanted this for _so long!_"  
"真不敢相信我们真的要这么做了！" 光几乎尖叫起来。"哦天啊，哦天啊，哦天啊，我盼这一刻盼了好久！"

"Stay cool, Hikari," Asuka calmed her. "I... _wow_, that stuff Misato gave us is some crazy shit. I feel super-drunk _and_ totally focused and spober. I mean sober." She giggled.  
"冷静点，光，" 明日香安抚她。"我...哇，美里给我们的那玩意儿真是疯狂。我感觉超级醉但又异常清醒和...呃，清醒。" 她咯咯笑了起来。"

"I _know_, right?" Hikari breathed, her shimmery blue satin gown shaking as she tried to suppress her own giggles. "I can't stop thinking about how much I love Touji and want to be his wife _and_ just how hard I'm going to fuck his brains out once we get back to the hotel as a _married couple_!" She waved her tightly clutched bouquet like a wand and did a fairly good impression of Sailor Moon's transformation twirl. "Ta-DAAAA! Magical Fiancée Pretty Hikari is now Super Wifey Suzuhara! In the name of the moon, I will tie you to the bed and ride you all night!"  
"就是啊，对吧？" 光喘着气说，她那闪亮的蓝色缎面礼服随着她试图压抑自己的笑声而颤抖。"我满脑子都是我有多爱阿薰，多想成为他的妻子，还有我们回到酒店后，作为新婚夫妇我要把他折腾得魂飞魄散！" 她挥舞着紧握的花束，像挥动魔杖一样，还模仿了美少女战士变身时的旋转动作。"哒哒！魔法未婚妻美光现在变成了超级妻子铃原！以月亮的名义，我要把你绑在床上，整夜驾驭你！"

"Man, that blue stuff is _gold_ if it can make you talk like this 5 minutes before your _wedding_," Asuka snorted. She paused. "I want some more."  
“天哪，那蓝色玩意儿要是能在你婚礼前五分钟让你这么说话，简直就是金子啊，”明日香嗤笑道。她顿了顿。“我还想要点。”

"I'm just glad it _worked_," Hikari said. "We were already drunk as lords... drunk as ladies? Eh, whatever. Point is, we were already shitfaced when Misato had that great idea. If we showed up here staggering drunk, they'd have turned us away! And I don't want that! I want my _husband_ right now, and I want to get _fucked_!"  
“我只是很高兴它奏效了，”光说。“我们当时已经醉得像老爷们……醉得像女士们？哎，管他呢。重点是，我们当时已经烂醉如泥，是美里想出了那个绝妙的主意。如果我们醉醺醺地踉跄着来这里，他们肯定会把我们赶走！我可不想那样！我现在就要我的丈夫，我要被狠狠地干！”

Asuka covered her mouth with both hands and tried to muffle the sound. Misato had the _BEST_ ideas...  
明日香双手捂住嘴，试图压住声音。美里的主意真是太棒了……

.

.

_Two hours earlier than before...  
比之前早了两个小时...  
_  
"Jesus, Hikari, I know this is your engagement party, but leave _some_ of your fiancé for the wedding?" Misato snarked. The casino bar was scarcely quieter than the gaming floor, but it had fairly good, cheap drinks that went on their rooms' tab, and nice close conversation pits.  
“天哪，光，我知道这是你的订婚派对，但给婚礼留点你未婚夫的时间好吗？”美里嘲讽道。赌场酒吧的喧闹程度几乎不亚于赌场大厅，但这里有相当不错且便宜的饮品，记在房间账上，还有舒适的私密谈话角落。

Hikari slowly and reluctantly pulled her lips away from Touji's, where they'd been welded for a good 10 minutes straight this time. She stayed put right in his lap, though. "I dun ~hic~ wanna, Mishato. I wanna suck face with him and shee if I can get him ta put his hand up my skirt agin."  
光慢慢地、不情愿地从总司的唇上移开，这次他们已经连续吻了整整十分钟。但她仍然坐在他的腿上，没有离开。“我~嗝~不想，美里。我想和他亲热，看看能不能让他再把手伸进我的裙子里。”

"Uh... right here in _public_, Hikari?" Shinji said. He didn't seem to notice he was still sitting so tightly between Asuka and Rei all three of them could check each others' pockets without moving.  
"呃...就在这里，光？" 真嗣说道。他似乎没有注意到自己仍然紧紧地坐在明日香和丽之间，三个人甚至可以不用移动就能互相检查口袋。

"Oh, like _you've_ never done that before," Asuka and Rei said in stereo. They looked at each other in surprise before breaking into laughs and tapping their drinks together.  
"哦，好像你以前没做过似的，" 明日香和丽齐声说道。她们惊讶地对视了一眼，然后爆发出笑声，互相碰杯。

Misato just shook her head. "Man, you need to get fucked in the worst way, Hikari."  
美里只是摇了摇头。"伙计，你真是需要被狠狠地教训一顿，光。"

"Noooo, in the _best_ way, Misato!" Hikari giggled. "By this massive meaty hunk of my man right here! But we _can't_!" she moaned in sadness. Then she moaned in a... less sad manner as she wiggled on Touji's lap.  
"“不，是以最好的方式，美里！”光 giggled。“通过我这位肌肉发达的猛男！但我们不能！”她悲伤地呻吟。随后，她以一种不那么悲伤的方式呻吟着，在真嗣的腿上扭动。”

"Why not?" Misato probed. "You're both old enough, you're _living together_ back home in Japan, and this is your own official _engagement_ party. What's the trouble? You've got your own room, and no one here is going to do anything but cheer you on if you throw Touji over your shoulder, haul him upstairs, and make a man out of him."  
“为什么不呢？”美里追问。“你们都成年了，一起住在日本的家里，这还是你们自己的订婚派对。有什么问题？你们有自己的房间，这里没人会反对，只会为你们加油，如果你把真嗣扛在肩上，带他上楼，让他成为一个真正的男人。”

Touji nuzzled Hikari's neck and gave Misato a sad smile. "She made a promise. And I ain't going to even go near asking her to break it. I love her more than anything, so I'm backing her up one hunnert perschent." He hiccuped.  
真嗣轻吻光的后颈，向美里露出一个悲伤的微笑。“她许下了一个承诺。我不会要求她违背它。我爱她胜过一切，所以我会百分百支持她。”他打了个嗝。

"Promise?" Kaworu asked, idly running his hand through Rei's hair and tracing his fingers down her shoulder. He always was touchy and cuddly when the booze kicked in. Rei shivered in delight and tugged him closer to her other side.  
"承诺？" 渚薰随意地用手梳理着绫波的头发，手指顺着她的肩膀滑下。每当酒精上头，他总是变得爱抚又黏人。绫波高兴得微微颤抖，将他拉近自己的另一侧。

"I promised my mother when she died... I mean, when she waz dying... I mean, when we _thought_ she waz dying, stupid SEELE bullshit..." Hikari said slowly. "Tha I wuddn't have shex with nobody until I was married. So we _wait_. Eben though I've wanted Touji for _years_. 'Cause Imma good girl."  
"我妈妈去世时...我是说，在她临终时...不，是我们以为她要去世时，该死的 SEELE 那套鬼话..." 美里缓缓说道。"她让我发誓，结婚前不会和任何人发生关系。所以我们得等。尽管我多年来一直想要和冬二在一起。因为我是个好女孩。"

"Yeah, but... you love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already..."  
"是啊，但是...你们彼此相爱，你们需要这个，所以也许你们应该停止拖延，直接结婚吧..."

"Mmm, that soundz sho gud, Mishato, but... the wedding hall we wanted izn't 'vailable until _December_ and we hav' ta _plan_ errything," Hikari moaned again. "I hate waiting... We've waited for _years_ already..."  
"嗯，那听起来真不错，美里，但是...我们想要的婚礼大厅要到十二月才有空档，我们得安排一切，" 光再次抱怨道。"我讨厌等待...我们已经等了好几年了..."

"Wait!" Misato slammed her fist into her palm, jostling Ryouji as he tried to take a sip of his own Black Russian. "Waitaminute! We're in _Las Vegas_! The one city in the world where 'Hey, I need to get married in a big damn hurry' is _no problem!_"  
"等等！" 美里一拳砸在手掌上，惊得正在尝试喝一口自己的黑俄罗斯的亮司差点洒出来。"等一下！我们在拉斯维加斯！这个世界上唯一一个'嘿，我急需马上结婚'不成问题的地方！"

Asuka barked a laugh. "Ok, hold up there, miss Wedding Planner. Two things I need to mention first. Number one: Shinji is great in bed and he's sleeping with me tonight."  
明日香嗤笑一声。"好吧，先别急，婚礼策划小姐。我得先提两点。第一：真嗣在床上很棒，他今晚要和我一起睡。"

"Asuka, what does that have to do wi-"  
"明日香，这和那有什么关系-"

"Nothing, I just like bragging. Number two: The least drunk one here is Kaworu, and I have watched him down at least six cocktails. And I mean drinks this time."  
"没什么，我就是喜欢吹嘘。第二条：这里最清醒的是渚薰，我亲眼见他至少喝了六杯鸡尾酒。这次我指的是真正的饮料。"

Rei and Shinji started giggling. Kaworu just stuck his tongue out at her and finished off his tumbler. "Seven," he shot back at her. "And you had no complaints when it was your turn last time."  
绫波和真嗣开始咯咯笑起来。渚薰只是对她吐了吐舌头，喝完了他的酒杯。“七杯，”他回敬道，“上次轮到你的时候，你可没抱怨过。”

"Shaddap. Anyhows, Misato, _none_ of ush are anywhere close to sober, or even good enough to fake it. We go near a chapel right now, and they'll tell us to go sleep it off first. This may be Vegas, but Hikari and Jock Stooge are high and dry until we all dry out tomorrow. _Then_ maybe we can talk about moving the wedding from 'this winter' to 'tomorrow night'."  
"闭嘴。总之，美里，我们谁都没清醒到哪儿去，甚至连装都装不好。我们现在靠近教堂，他们肯定会让我们先去醒醒酒。这里是拉斯维加斯，但光和那个傻大个得等到我们明天都清醒了再说。到时候我们再考虑把婚礼从‘今年冬天’提前到‘明晚’吧。"

Misato pouted at her for a moment, then brightened. "HA! Wait! Shows what you know! I've got _this_!" She dug energetically in her large Coach purse for a second before triumphantly pulling out a large screw-topped thermos with a NERV logo on the side. "Ta-Daaaa!"  
美里对她撅了撅嘴，随即眼睛一亮。“哈！等着瞧！让你看看我的本事！”她用力在她的 Coach 大手袋里翻找了一会儿，然后得意地拿出一个带有 NERV 标志的大号螺旋盖保温瓶。“当当当当！”

"What the Hell is that?"  
“那是什么鬼东西？”

"Something Ritz gave me before we left. She just finished it. LCL-derived party fuel!"  
“临走前丽兹给我的。她刚做完。LCL 提取的派对燃料！”

"Uh... explain, Misato?" Shinji asked, taking a sip of his own drink.  
“呃……解释一下，美里？”真嗣喝了一口自己的饮料问道。

"LCL-based, but mixed with some specialized additives and alcohol, it doesn't _exactly_ sober you up, but it makes everything _clear_ if you're sloshed, so you can think and do stuff if you need to _without_ losing your buzz! We can fool them all with this stuff, get Hikari and Touji hitched, and be back here to keep the party going all night! This _is_ our 'Vegas Cut-Loose Week', right?"  
“基于 LCL，但混合了一些特殊添加剂和酒精，虽然不会让你清醒，但如果你喝醉了，它能让你思路清晰，这样你就能在保持醉意的同时思考和做事！我们可以用这个骗过所有人，让光和冬二结婚，然后回到这里继续派对一整晚！这是我们的‘拉斯维加斯放纵周’，对吧？”

"I'm hammered, horny, and hugging more than one person I've slept with, so this all sounds like a _great_ idea!" Asuka shouted. "Hikari, sound good to you?"  
"我喝得烂醉，欲火中烧，还抱着不止一个跟我上过床的人，所以这听起来真是个绝妙的主意！" 明日香大喊道。"光，你觉得怎么样？"

Hikari slammed her own empty cup on the table between her and Misato. "Bartender, fill me the fuck _up_!"  
光将自己空空如也的杯子猛地砸在和美里之间的桌上。"酒保，给我满上！"

_Two hours later... 两小时后...  
_  
"I now pronounce you... man and wife," the minster finished. "You may kiss the bride."  
“我现在宣布你们成为……丈夫和妻子，”牧师说完，“你可以亲吻新娘了。”

Hikari threw her arms around Touji and kissed him harder than ever before. She tossed the bouquet blindly at Asuka, who caught it automatically before her yes-occifer-I-am-sotally-tober brain caught up to what her hands were doing.  
光子紧紧抱住冬二，吻得比以往任何时候都热烈。她盲目地将花束抛向明日香，明日香下意识地接住了，直到她的“警官，我绝对没醉”的大脑才反应过来自己的手在做什么。

Misato giggled and pointed at her from next to Asuka, where she'd been standing in as 'Mother of the Bride' to Asuka's 'Maid of Honor'. Across from them, behind Touji, Ryouji (Father of the Groom) laughed and Shinji (Best Man) looked like he couldn't decide if he wanted to blush or go pale. He settled for staring at Asuka in shock and standing very still.  
美里在一旁咯咯笑着，指着明日香，她作为“新娘的母亲”站在明日香旁边，明日香则是“伴娘”。在他们对面，冬二身后，良治（新郎的父亲）大笑着，而真嗣（伴郎）看起来不知道是该脸红还是变白。他最终选择了震惊地盯着明日香，一动不动地站着。

Asuka couldn't look away. "'You love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already...'" she whispered to herself. "'We've waited for years already'..." Shinji wouldn't break the stare either... like he could hear what she was thinking... like always.  
明日香无法移开视线。"'你们相爱并且需要这个，所以也许你们应该停止胡闹，直接结婚算了...'"她自言自语道。"'我们已经等了好几年了'..." 真嗣也没有打破对视...仿佛他能听到她的想法...一如既往。

Hikari was still kissing Touji. With a visible effort of will, she pulled away from Touji just long enough to look at Asuka and Misato. "I... feel _amazing_. Did that just happen? Am I really married?"  
光还在亲吻着斗。她费了很大的劲，才从斗的吻中抽身，足够长的时间去看向明日香和美里。"我...感觉棒极了。刚才真的发生了吗？我真的结婚了吗？"

"Yes, you are, _Mrs. Suzuhara_," Touji said softly in her ear. "'Til death do us part, for better and worse. We're together. I love yoUUU!" He looked quite surprised as his petite little bride hoisted him up over her shoulder and started moving surprisingly quickly towards the doors at the back of the chapel.  
"是的，你是的，铃原太太，"斗在她耳边温柔地说。"'直到死亡将我们分开，无论是好是坏。我们在一起了。我爱你！"他看起来相当惊讶，因为他的娇小新娘将他扛在肩上，开始以惊人的速度向教堂后门移动。

"Asuka we're leaving we'll get a taxi see you tomorrow don't wait up for us don't call we're going to be BUSY!" Hikari said in one rush as she dashed for the exit. "Touji, I love you~~! Mine mine mine! Heeheeheeheeheehee! We're going to get LUCKY!"  
“明日香，我们要走了，会打车回去，明天见，别等我们，别打电话，我们要忙了！” 光子一口气说完，冲向出口。“阿薰，我爱你~~！我的我的我的！嘻嘻嘻嘻嘻嘻！我们要走运了！”

Rei and Kaworu just watched them leave with matching warm smiles. Kaworu sighed after a moment, took out his wallet, and handed Rei 1000 yen. The First Child took it with a small smirk.  
丽和薰只是带着相似的温暖微笑目送他们离开。片刻后，薰叹了口气，拿出钱包，递给丽 1000 日元。第一适格者带着一丝微笑接过。

"Lucky, huh? Hah! I can't believe we pulled this off! In less than 90 minutes, too!" She shook her head. "Ok, well, speaking of feeling lucky, you and I are buzzed, amped on Ritz's Romulan Ale stuff, and full of cash in Sin City. Got any ideas on what we should do next, Mister Inspector?" She elbowed Ryouji.  
“走运了，是吧？哈！真不敢相信我们做到了！还不到 90 分钟！”她摇摇头。“好吧，说到走运，你我都有点醉了，被丽兹的罗慕兰麦芽酒搞得兴奋不已，又在罪恶之城腰缠万贯。有什么好主意接下来该做什么，侦探先生？”她用胳膊肘碰了碰良治。

He laughed. "What, you don't think I can hear what you're thinking, Katsuragi? I'm feeling lucky too."  
他笑道：“怎么，你不觉得我能听到你在想什么吗，葛城？我也感觉自己今天运气不错。”

Misato snorted. "You already got me to marry you, _Mister Katsuragi_. So that's out, lovely as the thought is. Yes, I can hear _you_ thinking too. And I think that's a _great_ idea!"  
美里哼了一声。“你已经让我嫁给你了，葛城先生。所以这个念头就别想了，虽然很诱人。没错，我也能听到你在想什么。我觉得这是个好主意！”

"You, me, high-stakes poker, and our usual bets?" he smiled at her, a sharp edge to it.  
“你我二人，高赌注的扑克，还有我们常下的赌注？”他向她微笑，带着一丝锐利。

"Damn right. First one to lose a pot loses their underwear. Feelin' lucky, mister?" Misato pulled him close and smirked at him.  
"当然没错。第一个输掉一局的就得脱掉内裤。感觉幸运吗，先生？" 美里把他拉近，对他挑衅地笑了笑。

"Never better, Misato. Let's do it. All night."  
"从未如此好过，美里。来吧，整晚都玩。"

Misato mock-swooned. "Oh my, so lusty!" She straightened back up. "Let's hit the high-end tables at the Luxor. I'm feeling Egyptian right now." She looked over at the remaining ex-Pilots. "You all feel like coming to watch my husband fleece some suckers with his incredible poker face?"  
美里装作晕倒的样子。"哦天哪，真是个色鬼！"她又挺直了身子。"我们去卢克索的高档赌桌吧。我现在感觉自己像个埃及人。"她看向剩下的前驾驶员们。"你们都想来围观我丈夫用他那无与伦比的扑克脸宰割一些倒霉蛋吗？"

"I think we'll wait here for a few minutes, Misato," Kaworu said equably. "I think Asuka needs to recover from catching that... tradition."  
"我想我们在这里等几分钟吧，美里，" 渚薰平静地说道，"我觉得明日香需要从抓住那个...传统中恢复过来。"

Misato smirked one more time and nodded. "Yeah, we all know what that means, and probably who. Maybe we'll have another round tomorrow night, ne? Hahaha! Keep ahold of that, Asuka. It's still got my cross!" Misato pointed at the familiar pendant she'd let Hikari borrow on short notice for the traditional 'something borrowed' part of the poem. She linked her arm with Ryouji's and they headed to the parking lot themselves.  
美里再次微微一笑，点了点头。"是啊，我们都知道那意味着什么，可能还知道是谁。也许明晚我们还能再来一轮，对吧？哈哈哈！好好保管那个，明日香。它还挂着我的十字架呢！" 美里指着那个她临时借给光用来完成传统诗句中'借来的东西'部分的熟悉吊坠。她挽着良治的胳膊，两人一起向停车场走去。

Asuka didn't notice. She was still engaged in a stare with Shinji. No... they were drifting closer. Was he moving? Her? She finally broke the look, her eyes dropping to the bouquet still in her hands.  
明日香没有注意到。她仍然在与真嗣对视。不...他们越来越近了。是他动了？还是她？她终于打破了凝视，目光落在了手中仍握着的花束上。

"You're thinking about it, aren't you?" Rei said quietly, putting her hand on Asuka's shoulder.  
"你正在想这件事，对吧？" 丽轻声说道，将手放在明日香的肩上。

Asuka snapped her head up to meet Rei's gaze, her face less than a foot to Asuka's right. How had she gotten so close? When? Wait, she'd asked a question...  
明日香猛地抬起头，与丽的目光相遇，她的脸距离明日香的右侧不到一英尺。她是怎么靠得这么近的？什么时候？等等，她问了一个问题...

"Uh... I... no?" "呃... 我... 没有？"

Rei smiled sadly. "Asuka... everyone knows. It's alright. We all love you. You can do this."  
丽悲伤地笑了。“明日香……大家都知道。没关系的。我们都爱你。你能做到的。”

Asuka looked carefully at Rei, then across at Shinji and Kaworu. "No... no I can't. You're right."  
明日香仔细地看着丽，然后又看了看真嗣和薰。“不……不，我做不到。你说得对。”

Rei looked confused. "I... but I said you _can_. Kaworu and I... we can See it. We know it."  
丽看起来很困惑。“我……但我刚才说你能做到。薰和我……我们能看见。我们知道这一点。”

Asuka shook her head. "No... weren't you listening? To what Misato said earlier? 'You love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already...'"  
明日香摇了摇头。“不...你没在听吗？之前美里说的什么来着？‘你们相爱并且需要彼此，所以或许你们应该停止胡闹，干脆结婚算了...’”

"Asuka, that's what I'm suggesting you and Shinji d-"  
“明日香，我就是在建议你和真嗣——”

"No. I've got a _better_ idea. Listen to what Misato said!"  
“不。我有个更好的主意。听听美里的话吧！”

"You and Shinji need each other, and-"  
"你和真嗣需要彼此，而且-"

"No... _we_ need each other."  
"不... 我们需要彼此。"

Rei's eyes widened. "Wha-"  
绫波的眼眸微微睁大。 "什-"

Asuka whirled, a ear-to-ear smile exploding onto her face. "Yes! YES! That's IT! AHAHAHAAH! We can _do that_! It's in the rules!" Asuka waved the glossy pamphlet of _'So You Want To Get Married'_ they'd picked up at the front desk. "Look! Here!" She flipped it open and pointed to something on the second page. "Quartets!" she shouted. "It's legal here! 100% _legal!_"  
明日香猛地转身，满脸绽放出灿烂的笑容。“是的！没错！就是这样！啊哈哈哈哈！我们可以这么做！这在规则里是允许的！”明日香挥舞着他们在前台拿到的光鲜亮丽的‘你想结婚吗’小册子。“看！这里！”她翻开册子，指向第二页的某处。“四重奏！”她喊道。“在这里是合法的！百分之百合法！”

The other three Children exchanged a look. "Asuka, what-" Shinji began.  
其他三位适格者交换了一个眼神。“明日香，什么——”真嗣开口道。

"_I love you all!_" Asuka shouted again, joyously. "All of you! Shinji! _Everyone_ we know knows how much we love each other! We always have! We may be stupid and afraid and constantly hurting each other by accident but we _always_ come back to each other because we know beyond words that we hold each others' heart. I say your name at night when you're not there! I miss you even when I'm mad at you! I can't imagine life without you near me! You were the first, the one who taught me I _am_ worthy of love. And I will never let that feeling go. So... stand there!" She pointed at a spot near the camera, still filming.  
“我爱你们所有人！”明日香再次欢呼，充满喜悦。“你们所有人！真嗣！所有人都知道我们彼此相爱有多深！我们一直都知道！我们可能愚蠢、害怕，还总是无意中伤害对方，但我们总是回到彼此身边，因为我们知道，言语无法表达我们对彼此的心意。你不在的时候，我会在夜里呼唤你的名字！即使我生你的气，我也会想念你！我无法想象没有你在身边的生活！你是第一个，教会我值得被爱的人。我永远不会放弃这种感觉。所以……站在那里！”她指向摄像机仍在拍摄的位置。

Asuka threw her bouquet at Rei. "Rei! We may have started off at each others' throats, but it's amazing what saving each others lives a few times and saving the world can do to change that! And you've always been there for me when I thought Shinji broke my heart, or I did something stupid and thought I made him hate me... You've let me cry on your shoulder a dozen times, a hundred times, kissed away my tears when I thought there was nothing left, pushed me and Shinji back together when even I thought he would be better off with you... You believed in us and loved us when no one else would. I love you, Blue, and I'm not letting you go ever. So you stand... there!" She pushed Rei to stand next to Shinji.  
明日香将她的花束扔向丽。“丽！我们可能一开始互相看不顺眼，但拯救彼此生命几次和拯救世界能改变很多事情，这真是太神奇了！每当我以为真嗣伤了我的心，或者我做了什么蠢事以为他恨我时，你总是在那里支持我...你让我在你的肩膀上哭泣了十几次，上百次，当我以为一切都完了时，你吻干了我的泪水，当我甚至认为他和你在一起会更好时，你推动我和真嗣重新在一起...当没有人相信我们时，你相信我们并爱着我们。我爱你，蓝，我永远不会让你离开。所以你站在...那里！”她推着丽站在真嗣旁边。

Kaworu looked at her sadly, shaking his head. "Asuka, you shouldn't include me. I think this is just that 'Romulan Ale' stuff talking-"  
薰悲伤地看着她，摇了摇头。“明日香，你不应该把我包括在内。我想这只是‘罗慕兰酒’在作祟——”

"You SHUT THE HELL UP, Sparkles!" Asuka pointed her finger firmly at him. "This is _NOT_ 'the Romulan Ale stuff' talking! This is my heart _freed_ from all the fear and bullshit and lies and masks and _AAAARRRGGG_ I always hide it behind! So what if it took that to get here? This is truth and love and years of me being an idiot when everything I have ever wanted or needed right in front of me!"  
"你给我闭嘴，闪闪发光的家伙！" 明日香坚定地用手指着他。"这可不是什么'罗慕兰酒'在作祟！这是我内心摆脱了所有恐惧、胡扯、谎言、面具和那些我总是隐藏在背后的东西后的真实！就算需要这些才能走到这一步又怎样？这是真相、是爱、是我多年来一直是个傻瓜，而所有我想要和需要的就在我面前的事实！"

She pointed at Shinji. "The perfect man, the love of my life, my partner in battle and in life! The one who loved me first, deepest, and makes me cry in the night because I can't believe he really means it when he says those three little words!"  
她指向真嗣。"完美的男人，我生命中的爱人，战斗和生活中的伙伴！第一个爱我、爱得最深的人，让我在夜晚哭泣，因为我无法相信他真的在说那三个小字时是真心的！"

She pointed at Rei. "The perfect _woman_, the one who always believes in me and holds me when I'm weak! Who saved my life over and over when we fought to save the world! Yes, I admit it! I _proclaim_ it! I, Asuka Langley Soryu, love a woman! One, perfect, amazing woman! One goddess, who loves me back..."  
她指向绫波。"完美的女人，总是在我脆弱时支持我、拥抱我的人！在我们为拯救世界而战斗时，一次次救了我的命！是的，我承认！我宣布！我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，爱一个女人！一个完美、令人惊叹的女人！一个爱我回头的女神……"

She pointed at Kaworu. "And you... I've already got the perfect man, the perfect woman... so what else could a worthless ex-Pilot possibly deserve? You. You, Kaworu fucking Nagisa, the gift of Heaven. The Angel who fell to Earth and gave us hope when there was no light. You're my light-bringer, my fallen Angel, my heavenly messenger who holds the world in his hands and gives it all to us because he thinks he's nothing."  
她指向渚薰。“而你……我已经有完美的男人，完美的女人了……一个无用的前驾驶员还能配得上什么？你。你，渚薰，该死的渚薰，天赐的礼物。那个从天而降的天使，在我们无光之时给予我们希望。你是我的光明使者，我的堕天使，我的天国使者，他手握世界，将一切给予我们，只因他认为自己一文不值。”

Tears started to trickle down Kaworu's face. "Asuka, don't. I... I don't... you don't lov-"  
泪水开始从渚薰的脸颊滑落。“明日香，别这样。我……我不……你不爱——”

"Bull_shit,_ 'I don't love you'! Fuck yes, I do! Kaworu, I can see how you and Shinji are. I _revel_ in it. And I know you love Rei not one iota less. You think I will take them for myself and leave you out in the cold for our whole lives? Idiot. You're all idiots. _I_ decide who I love, and I have let no other man but you and Shinji ever touch my heart, you stupid, beautiful, impossible man. I will have no others but you. You love the ones I love, and they love you. I will neither forsake you or them. We are _all_ for each other. So you... stand... _there_!" Asuka shouted happily, pointing him to a spot on the other side of Shinji from Rei.  
“放屁，‘我不爱你’！当然爱，我当然爱你！渚薰，我看得出你和真嗣的关系。我乐在其中。我也知道你对绫波的爱丝毫不减。你以为我会把他们据为己有，让你一辈子孤零零的？傻瓜。你们都是傻瓜。决定我爱谁的人是我，除了你和真嗣，没有其他男人能触动我的心，你这个愚蠢、美丽、难以捉摸的男人。我只要你。你爱我所爱，他们也爱你。我不会抛弃你或他们。我们都是为了彼此。所以你……站在那里！”明日香开心地喊着，指着真嗣另一边绫波旁边的位置。

Asuka stood facing all three of them. "You can say what you like. 'This is just the night talking, you'll regret this in the morning.' Wrong. This is me speaking freely for the first time. Yes, the night has helped, the feeling of watching Hikari achieve her heart's dream... but all that has done is give me clarity and courage. I've felt like this for a long time. But you know me. Always afraid, always insecure, hiding my heart and soul behind a tsundere mask because I'm too cowardly to admit I need you all and can no longer imagine living without all of you holding me, loving me, being _with_ me..." She wiped at her own tears. "So put all that aside and do what I'm doing: listening to my heart for once in my stupid life. So I'm going to, I'm going to say this all and ask a question before the spell wears off and I retreat from it _again_, running away from seizing the most perfect joy in my universe... No, not this time. This time I listen to what I've wanted for years."  
明日香站在他们三人面前。“你们爱怎么说就怎么说。‘这只是夜晚的情绪作祟，你明早会后悔的。’错了。这是我第一次自由地表达自己。是的，夜晚确实帮了忙，看着光实现她心中的梦想的感觉...但这一切只是让我更加清晰和勇敢。我很久以来就有这种感觉了。但你们了解我。总是害怕，总是不安，把我的心和灵魂藏在傲娇的面具后，因为我太懦弱，不敢承认我需要你们所有人，无法再想象没有你们所有人支撑我、爱我、陪伴我的生活...”她擦去自己的泪水。“所以把那些都抛开，做我现在做的事：在我愚蠢的生命中第一次倾听我的心声。所以我要，我要说出这一切，并在魔法消失、我再次退缩之前问一个问题，不再逃避抓住我宇宙中最完美的喜悦...不，这次不会了。这次我要倾听我多年来的渴望。”

She took a deep breath. "Shinji, Rei, Kaworu... I don't deserve you. I'm arrogant, harsh, selfish, stupid, and cowardly. I've been a fool for years, pretending I didn't want this. But I love you more than I will ever be able to say, even if I started now and did it for the rest of my life. And I plan to. I need you more than I'll ever be able to admit ever again, though I will try. I need you to stay with me, to make me strong and powerful and whole. I need you because I'm nothing without you. And I want you all, the three most beautiful, sexy, loving people I've ever known or ever will. You are my heart, my soul, and my world. I don't care if tomorrow we all wake up and this vanishes like some dream of mist and fog. I want this moment, now and forever. So I ask you, all of you, I beg you... will you all marry me, love me, stay with me, and be my husband, husband, and wife for the rest of our lives?"  
她深吸了一口气。“真嗣，丽，薰...我不配拥有你们。我傲慢、苛刻、自私、愚蠢又懦弱。多年来我一直是个傻瓜，假装我不想要这一切。但我对你们的爱超越了我所能表达的极限，即便我从现在开始，用尽余生去诉说。我打算这么做。我对你们的需要超越了我能再次承认的极限，尽管我会努力。我需要你们留在我身边，让我变得坚强、有力、完整。我需要你们，因为没有你们我什么都不是。我想要你们三个，我所认识或将会认识的最美丽、性感、充满爱的人。你们是我的心脏，我的灵魂，我的世界。我不在乎明天我们醒来时这一切是否像雾和梦一样消散。我想要这一刻，现在直到永远。所以我问你们，你们所有人，我恳求你们...你们愿意嫁给我，爱我，留在我身边，成为我的丈夫、丈夫和妻子，共度余生吗？”

There was five heartbeats of the loudest silence that chapel had ever seen.  
教堂里出现了五次心跳般的最响亮的沉默。

Three voices spoke in harmony.  
三个声音和谐地响起。

"Yes." "是的。"

And all was right with the world.  
而世界一切安好。

_The Present 此刻_

Asuka stared at the screen. "... what... the... fuck?"  
明日香盯着屏幕。"...什么...鬼...东西？"

She stood frozen in Shinji's arms, vaguely glad he was helping hold her up. Because her knees and legs had just turned to water, and without his support she'd have fallen on her ass already in pure shock.  
她僵硬地站在真嗣的怀抱中，隐约庆幸他在帮忙支撑着她。因为她的膝盖和双腿已经软得像水一样，没有他的支持，她早就因为纯粹的震惊而摔了个屁股蹲。

_'It... it was_ _**my**_ _idea? The whole thing was_ _**my**_ _idea? And they all said 'Yes'?!'_ her mind babbled. _'I asked them all to marry me and they said_ _**YES**__?!'_  
'这...这都是我的主意？整个事情都是我的主意？他们全都说了‘好’？！'她的脑海中一片混乱。'我向他们所有人求婚，他们居然都说了‘好’？！'

'...they love me.' '...他们爱我。'

The sudden wave of emotion snapped her out of her shock. She was _not_ going to cry in public, damn it! Not even tears of joy, while she... she... she watched herself on video forming a square with the others, each with one hand around the person on their left, and one hand in the middle, together, while the minister asked them to recite their vows. While she watched herself give slow, heartfelt kisses to Kaworu, Rei, and Shinji that left them all breathless. While she threw her bouquet into the air with a scream of joy that sparked a matching smile on her living face.  
突如其来的情感浪潮将她从震惊中唤醒。她绝不会在公共场合哭泣，该死！即使是喜悦的泪水也不行，当她...她...她看着自己在视频中与其他人围成一个方形，每个人一只手搭在左边人的肩上，另一只手放在中间，一起，而部长要求他们背诵誓词。当她看着自己缓缓地、深情地亲吻着渚薰、绫波丽和真嗣，让他们都喘不过气来。当她欢呼着将花束抛向空中，脸上绽放出与视频中自己一样的笑容。

"HOLY SHIT, I'M MARRIED!" her recorded self shouted to the world, linking arms with Shinji and Rei and letting Kaworu walk backwards in front of her, pulling her by their joined hands as they walked across the parking lot.  
“天哪，我结婚了！”视频中的她向世界大喊，与真嗣和绫波丽挽着手臂，让渚薰倒退着走在她前面，拉着他们相连的手穿过停车场。

The video followed them as far as them piling into the minivan to leave before ending. Asuka had to blink rapidly when it stopped, and wipe futilely at her cheeks. Damn it. She looked around.  
视频一直跟拍到他们挤进小型货车准备离开时才结束。视频停止时，明日香不得不快速眨眼，徒劳地擦拭着脸颊。该死。她环顾四周。

No one else had noticed most of them were in a similar state. Kaworu emerged from behind the chair he'd hurriedly adopted as concealment for his excitement and walked over to enfold Asuka and Shinji in an embrace. Rei was barely a second behind. Shinji's arms tightened around her as well.  
其他人大多没有注意到，大家的状态都差不多。渚薰从他匆忙选作藏身之处的椅子后面走出来，走到明日香和真嗣身边，将他们拥入怀中。绫波零紧随其后。真嗣的手臂也紧紧抱住了她。

"Asuka... I... I promise I will earn that. What you said," Kaworu mumbled into her hair. "I... thank you. I mean... I love you."  
“明日香……我……我保证我会赢得那个。你说的那些话，”渚薰在她头发中喃喃道，“我……谢谢你。我是说……我爱你。”

"A goddess, hm?" Rei purred in her right ear. "The perfect woman? That's impossible. I'm holding her."  
"女神，嗯？" 丽在她右耳边低声说道，"完美的女人？那是不可能的。我正抱着她呢。"

She felt Shinji's arms squeeze her again. "Asuka, I can tell you're about to... do something you hate, and you've always known how I feel about you, so instead I'm going to distract you to help." She felt him burrow his nose and face into her hair to clear a path to the back of her neck.  
她感觉到真嗣的胳膊再次搂紧了她。"明日香，我能感觉到你即将……做一些你讨厌的事情，而且你一直知道我对你的感觉，所以这次我要用分散你注意力的方式来帮你。" 她感觉到他用鼻子和脸在她头发中蹭出一条通向她后颈的路。

Then he bit her. 然后他咬了她。

"Rei, make a note. Experiment #4, wives are delicious," he said in his best dry voice.  
"丽，记一下。实验#4，妻子们很美味。" 他用最干巴巴的语气说道。

"Duly noted," Rei echoed, matchingly deadpan. "However, I refuse to enter this data officially until I am included in the sample set and the sampler."  
"已记录，" 丽同样面无表情地回应。"不过，在我被纳入样本集和采样者之前，我拒绝正式录入这些数据。"

"Noted." "知道了。"

"Should I bite someone?" Kaworu asked, slightly confused.  
"我应该咬谁吗？" 渚薰有些困惑地问。

Asuka snorted. "Gott damn it, Sparkles..." She started laughing, the tears retreating. "You are all idiots."  
明日香哼了一声。"该死的，闪亮亮..." 她开始笑起来，泪水渐渐退去。"你们都是白痴。"

"Your idiots, Asuka," Shinji said happily.  
"是你的白痴们，明日香，" 真嗣开心地说。

A discreet cough from Rachel broke their momentary isolation. "Ah... so, Mrs. Soryu-Ayanami, you can see why we want to ask about using your ceremony's footage in our advertising materials? It's... powerful stuff. Can we discuss it while Roberto makes you some copies? Here or in my office?"  
一声谨慎的咳嗽声从瑞秋那里传来，打破了他们短暂的孤立。“啊……所以，碇-绫波女士，您能理解我们为何想询问是否可以使用您仪式的影像资料用于我们的广告宣传吗？那真是……震撼人心的内容。我们可以在罗伯特为您复印文件时讨论这件事吗？在这里还是去我办公室？”

Asuka took a deep breath and got a grip on herself. _'It was_ _**my**_ _idea. And they all love me back. Holy shit. Ok, brain, back in gear.'_  
明日香深吸一口气，稳住了自己的情绪。‘这是我自己的主意。而且他们都爱我。天哪。好了，大脑，回到状态。’

"Certainly. Let's go talk," she said confidently.  
“当然。我们去谈谈吧，”她自信地说道。

"I dunno what makes me feel kinkier, the video camera watching our every move, or this stuff," Maya said meditatively, staring at her glass of Blue Fuel.  
"我不知道是什么让我感觉更刺激，是摄像机记录我们的每一个动作，还是这玩意儿，" 玛雅若有所思地说着，盯着她的蓝燃料饮料。

"It is a necessity," Ritsuko said carefully, every word precisely enunciated with great care. This was due to her being 4 cocktails and two tall glasses of Blue Fuel in herself. "The first time we drank this stuff, we didn't remember a thing in the morning. This was kind of embarrassing, since you and I were naked, covered in glitter and bodypaint, and lying on the Commander's old desk in his office."  
"这是必须的，" 律子小心翼翼地说，每个字都发音清晰，非常谨慎。这是因为她自己已经喝了四杯鸡尾酒和两杯高脚蓝燃料。"第一次喝这东西的时候，我们早上什么都不记得了。这有点尴尬，因为你和我都赤裸着，浑身闪粉和身体彩绘，躺在指挥官办公室的老桌子上。"

"Yyyeah, I _wish_ we could have gotten video of that," Maya giggled, a salacious grin on her lips. "It took _days_ to remember that all! Hee hee!"  
"是啊，真希望当时能录下来，" 玛雅咯咯笑着，嘴角带着狡黠的笑容。"花了好几天才想起来这一切！嘻嘻！"

She took a swig of her glass. "This is the _bests_ stuff. Energy drink, intoxicant, mental concentrator, aphrodisiac, and fertility enhancer, WOOO! I'm drunk, sober, awake, horny as fuck, and bursting with energy." She took another drink, emptying the glass, and put it aside so she could ineffectually swipe her hands at Ritsuko, who was still out of reach. "Sooooo stop playing with the camera, come over here, and make love to your wife, damn it. I want me some Sempai!"  
她猛灌了一口杯中的液体。“这玩意儿太棒了。能量饮料，迷幻剂，精神集中剂，春药，还有助孕的，哇哦！我现在既醉又醒，精神抖擞，欲火中烧，还精力充沛。”她又喝了一口，将杯子一饮而尽，然后放在一边，伸手试图去抓仍遥不可及的律子。“所以，别玩相机了，快过来，和你老婆亲热亲热，该死的。我要我的前辈！”

"I'm just setting up the 3D mode," Ritsuko said. "I'm just about... done!" She threw off her robe, crawled onto the bed like an oversized cat, and laid herself down on top of Maya, eagerly fitting herself between the younger woman's legs. "And can I say it is _never_ getting to get old hearing you say that, m'dear?"  
“我只是在设置 3D 模式，”律子说，“马上就好……好了！”她甩掉浴袍，像只大猫一样爬上床，躺在真嗣身上，急切地将自己置于年轻女子的双腿之间。“我能说，听你这么说永远不会腻吗，亲爱的？”

"Which? 'Make love to your wife', or 'I want me some Sempai'?" Maya teased. "'Cause I've got a schoolgirl outfit in my closet somewhere if your wanna do that one again..."  
“哪句？‘和你老婆亲热’，还是‘我要我的前辈’？”真嗣逗弄道，“因为我衣柜里某个地方还有一套学生装，如果你想再来一次的话……”

"Yes." Ritsuko dipped her head down to kiss her. "All of the above. And you better watch out on that 'fertility enhancer' part, love. The last batch of tests on _that_ procedure were all positive."  
“是的。” 律子低下头去吻她。“以上皆是。而且你最好小心那个‘生育增强剂’部分，亲爱的。上一次关于那个程序的测试结果全都是正面的。”

Maya's eyes widened. "I... HIC! I... the... the er..." She blushed. "The... chromosomal ones? Those procedures?"  
玛雅的眼睛睁大了。“我……呃！我……那个……染色体的……那些程序？”她脸红了。“那些……染色体的程序？”

Ritsuko nodded, kissing her wife and grinding against her. "Yesss it is. I can successfully combine your and my eggs with a little LCL magic and some cloning tricks, and get them to combine and quicken. We're only working with X chromosomes since they're derived from us, but..." She stopped, and looked right into Maya's eyes. "We can have daughters. And I very much want yours."  
律子点头，亲吻着她的妻子并紧贴着她。“没错，就是那个。我可以利用一点 LCL 魔法和一些克隆技巧，成功地将你我的卵子结合，并使它们迅速发育。因为我们只使用来自我们的 X 染色体，但是……”她停了下来，直视着玛雅的眼睛。“我们可以拥有女儿。而我非常想要你的。”

Maya closed her eyes and shivered. "Oh my god..." Her legs wrapped around Ritsuko's waist. "Now. Gimme NOW!"  
玛雅闭上眼睛，颤抖着。“哦，天哪...”她的双腿缠绕在律子的腰间。“现在。给我，现在！”

"Yup, this stuff does _wonders_ for your libido and fertility," Ritsuko said with a grin, and ground harder.  
“没错，这东西确实能提升你的性欲和生育能力，”律子笑着说，更加用力地摩擦。

Maya blinked. "Wait... didn't you say you put a few liters of this stuff in Commander Katsuragi's luggage as a present? Won't she and her husband..."  
玛雅眨了眨眼。“等等...你不是说你放了几升这东西在葛城司令的行李里作为礼物吗？她和她的丈夫不会...”

Ritsuko grinned wider. "She _did_ say she wanted to start on kids of her own, and that will help! She and Inspector Sexy are probably coming home preggers. So if we don't want to fall behind... tomorrow you and I are going down to the lab and starting a family of our own."  
律子笑得更开了。“她确实说过她想要有自己的孩子，这会有帮助的！她和性感警探回家时可能已经怀孕了。所以如果我们不想落后……明天你和我一起去实验室，我们也开始组建自己的家庭。”

"That is the best thing I have ever heard. I love you, Ritsuko," Maya sighed. "Now... If I'm going to be a momma, I wanna get there the old fashioned way." She thrust up at her wife. "So, fuck my brains out. Now."  
“这是我听过的最棒的事情。我爱你，律子。”玛雅叹息道。“现在……如果我要当妈妈，我想用传统的方式来实现。”她向妻子挺身而出。“所以，把我的脑子都干飞吧。现在。”

An hour later, it was a stunned but still smiling group that made it's way back out to the parking lot, several HD copies of their ceremonies in hand on both disc and digital formats in hand. Asuka had recovered enough of her brains to drive a hard and detailed bargain, ensuring their wedding would be prominently but tastefully featured in the chapel's advertisements for a long while. It wasn't as if they'd needed the money, so Asuka hadn't pressed on that front. The leavings of NERV and SEELE's accounts and technologies kept them in more than comfortable style. The addition of the chapel's payments was mostly a token, if one that made Asuka feel smug.  
一个小时后，一群人虽然震惊但依然面带微笑地回到了停车场，手里拿着几份高清的仪式副本，既有光盘格式也有数字格式。明日香已经恢复了足够的理智，与教堂进行了一番强硬而详细的谈判，确保他们的婚礼将在教堂的广告中长期而恰当地展示。他们并不需要这笔钱，所以明日香在这方面没有过多坚持。NERV 和 SEELE 的账户与技术的剩余资产让他们过上了非常舒适的生活。教堂的支付主要是象征性的，尽管这让明日香感到得意。

"Where next?" Kaworu asked, sliding the door to the minivan open, but turning to face them.  
“接下来去哪儿？” 渚薰问道，滑动打开了小型货车的门，但转身面向他们。

Shinji looked at the scrap of paper in his hand. "Well, the timestamps on the receipt say we went to the tattoo parlor after here, but... I think we know what happened there. So... lunch?"  
真嗣看着手中的纸片。“嗯，收据上的时间戳显示我们离开这里后去了纹身店，但是……我想我们清楚那里发生了什么。所以……吃午饭？”

Kaworu looked green. "Urp. No, please?"  
渚薰看起来脸色发青。“呃。不了，拜托？”

"Oh, right, sorry," Shinji apologized. "Um... how about-"  
“哦，对了，抱歉，”真嗣道歉道，“呃……那我们……”

He was interrupted by the roar of a powerful engine and the screech of tires as a silver Lotus Evora GT430 powerslid off the street and across the lot to stop right next to them.  
一阵强劲引擎的轰鸣声和轮胎摩擦地面的尖锐声打断了他，一辆银色的莲花 Evora GT430 在街道上猛地一转，穿过停车场，稳稳地停在他们旁边。

A familiar figure threw the passenger door open. "Found you! Hurry, one of you jump in! They're right behind me!" Misato Katsuragi shouted at them.  
一个熟悉的身影猛地推开副驾驶车门，“找到你们了！快，你们中一个赶紧上车！他们就在我后面！”葛城美沙绪对他们喊道。

"Who is?" Asuka blinked. "谁啊？" 明日香眨了眨眼。

"The Russian mob! Apparently Kaji rolled the Hell out of one of them at poker last night, and now they're pissed about... Asuka, is that a _polar bear_ in the driver's seat of that van?"  
"俄罗斯黑手党！显然昨晚加持在扑克桌上把其中一个家伙打得落花流水，现在他们对此很生气……明日香，那辆货车驾驶座上的是只北极熊吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"I... I... buh?" "我……我……啊？"

"What do you mean 'apparently'?" Asuka said sharply. "You're being chased by mobsters and you're _not sure_ why?"  
"你说的'显然'是什么意思？" 明日香尖锐地问道。"你被黑帮追杀，却不确定为什么？"

"I don't remember most of last night. That blue shit Ritsuko gave me was apparently hard stuff!"  
"我记不清昨晚的大部分事情了。那个蓝色玩意儿，律子给我的，显然是烈性药物！"

"How did you know we were here, Misato-san?" Shinji asked.  
"美里小姐，你是怎么知道我们在这里的？" 真嗣问道。"

"Tracers in your phones! I couldn't find you until just now since I've been dodging these guys!"  
"你们手机里有追踪器！我一直躲着这些人，直到刚才才找到你们！"

"Explains why they were in our freezer in foil, I guess," Kaworu put in.  
"这么说来，他们用锡纸包着待在我们的冰箱里也不奇怪了，" 渚薰插话道。"

"In our own hotel room," Rei pointed out. "Not precisely the most unlikely spot to find us anyhow."  
"就在我们自己的酒店房间里，" 绫波指出。"不管怎么说，也不是最不可能找到我们的地方。"

The growl of several cars approaching at speed began to grow louder. Misato looked down the street. "I see at least three cars. Come on, one of you jump in and we'll get moving. The rest of you can... um... have the bear drive you along?"  
几辆汽车高速驶来的轰鸣声逐渐变大。美里沿着街道望去。“我至少看到了三辆车。快点，你们中跳进来一个，我们赶紧出发。剩下的人可以……呃……让熊开车带你们走？”

Rei sighed. "Why?" 绫波叹了口气。“为什么？”

"Rei, did you miss the part about the 'three cars full of pissed off Russian mobsters'?"  
“绫波，你没听到关于‘三车愤怒的俄罗斯黑帮’那部分吗？”

Rei looked down the street herself. The three black Mercedes-Benzes were slowing just enough to pull into the chapel lot, but were still coming on fast. Rei raised her hand to point at them, and a glowing orange hexagon briefly flashed to life...  
丽看着街道的尽头。三辆黑色的梅赛德斯-奔驰车正减速准备驶入教堂停车场，但速度依旧很快。丽举起手来指向它们，一个发光的橙色六边形瞬间闪现...

...one meter in front of the lead car.  
...在领头车前一米处。

The ensuing crash and pileup was rather spectacular.  
随之而来的撞击和连环相撞场面相当壮观。

Rei turned back to Misato. "Now... where is your husband?"  
丽转回身面对美里。“现在……你的丈夫在哪里？”

Misato tore her eyes away from the pile of wrecked Mercedes and bloodied men that had been her pursuers a moment ago. "I… ah, that's why I was looking for you all. I don't know. I can't remember anything past mid-afternoon yesterday, and I'm trying to track him down. I was hoping you and Kaworu-kun could do some magic and find him for me."  
美里将目光从那堆被毁的奔驰车和血迹斑斑的男子身上移开，那些人片刻前还是她的追捕者。“我……啊，这就是我找你们的原因。我不知道。我记不起昨天下午之后的事了，我正在设法找到他。我本希望你和薰君能施展些魔法帮我找到他。”

Rei looked around the city, her eyes becoming more red and shiny than usual. She pivoted in place, turning in a three-quarters circle before halting and pointing. "That way."  
丽环视城市，她的眼睛比平时更加红润闪亮。她原地旋转了四分之三圈，然后停下并指向一个方向。“那边。”

Misato waved Rei towards her car. "Get in, you can guide me while the others follow." She looked back again at the smashed pile of mobsters. "Guess we don't need to worry about a dramatic chase through the streets right now."  
美里向丽挥手示意她上车。“上车吧，你可以给我指路，其他人会跟着我们。”她再次回头看了一眼那堆被击溃的暴徒。“看来我们现在不用担心会在街上上演一场戏剧性的追逐了。”

Rei opened the far door to the Lotus and got in. She stuck her head back out the door long enough to shout 'Следуйте за нами!' at Mrs. Growlski.  
丽打开莲花车的远门坐了进去。她把头伸出车门，大声向格罗尔斯基夫人喊道：“跟着我们！”

The husky engine of the Lotus growled loudly as Misato put it back in gear and headed off in the general northwesterly direction Rei had pointed. The older woman glanced at Rei out of the corner of her eye as they drove, in between looking in the rear-view mirror at the no longer pursuing mobsters. "So… why were you all at the chapel, Rei? Someone else planning to get married?"  
莲花车的强劲引擎轰鸣着，美里重新挂挡，朝着丽所指的西北方向驶去。年长的女人一边开车，一边不时从后视镜中瞥一眼那些不再追赶的暴徒，同时用眼角余光打量着丽。“那么……你们为什么都在教堂里，丽？还有其他人打算结婚吗？”

"No, Commander. I think we have completed all necessary marriages yesterday."  
"不，指挥官。我想我们昨天已经完成了所有必要的婚礼。"

"So what were you doing there, then, if seeing Shinji and Asuka finally tie the knot wasn't it?"  
"那么，你们当时在那里做什么呢？如果观看真嗣和明日香终于结为连理不是目的的话？"

"We were acquiring video footage of the ceremony. We left last night without it, apparently."  
"我们在获取婚礼的视频资料。显然，我们昨晚离开时没有拿到它。"

Rei considered for a moment the happy circumstance that had placed her seated to Misato's left, and her facial tattoo on the far side from her Commander. The small smile on her face serenely hid her amusement.  
丽思索了一会儿，庆幸自己坐在美里左边，脸上的纹身远离指挥官。她脸上那抹淡淡的微笑，平静地掩盖了她的笑意。

"No sudden marriage impulses this morning?" Misato said teasingly.  
“今天早上没有突然的结婚冲动吗？”美里打趣道。

"That is a correct statement."  
“这话没错。”

"So what did you guys do after we split up last night?" Misato asked. She grimaced a moment later. "Or… right, you probably don't remember either, do you?"  
"昨晚我们分开后，你们做了什么？" 美里问道。片刻后，她皱了皱眉。"或者……对了，你们大概也不记得了吧，是吗？"

"Our memories of last night are mostly blurs, yes. According to our credit card receipts, and the marks on our skin, after we left the chapel we went to a tattoo parlor."  
"我们对昨晚的记忆大多模糊不清。根据信用卡收据和我们身上的痕迹来看，离开教堂后，我们去了纹身店。"

Misato blinked and looked at her more directly for a moment. "Wait, tattoos?"  
美里眨了眨眼，更直接地看了她一会儿。"等等，纹身？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Ah….where? And what?" "啊…哪里？什么？"

"Several. Shinji now has Asuka's name over his heart. She has his on her back," Rei said calmly.  
"有几个。真嗣现在把明日香的名字刻在心口上。她则把他的名字刻在背上，" 绫波平静地说道。"

"Aww… that's sweet of them," Misato said with a smile. "What about you? You get anything?"  
"哇…他们真贴心，" 美里微笑着说。"你呢？你有什么吗？"

"Yes. Among them, I have tattoos on my back I think it best to show you rather than tell you. Turn left here. Kaji's Light is approximately one kilometer east of us and..." Rei squinted, "some distance above us. Evidently in a tall building."  
"是的。其中，我背上的纹身我认为最好给你看看，而不是告诉你。在这里左转。Kaji 的 Light 大约在我们东边一公里处，并且……" 绫波皱了皱眉，"离我们有一定高度。显然是在一座高楼里。"

"Oooh, mysterious…" Misato turned at the corner. Ahead of them loomed Caesar's Palace. "Wait… Kaji's in our own hotel? Why isn't he answering his phone?"  
"哦，真神秘……" 美里在拐角处转弯。前方矗立着凯撒宫。"等等……Kaji 在我们自己的酒店里？他为什么不接电话？"

"Perhaps he is still asleep?" Rei suggested.  
"也许他还在睡觉？" 绫波提议道。"

"I woke up in our room with a splitting headache. He wasn't there," Misato said, confused.  
“我醒来时，头痛欲裂，他不在房间里。”美里困惑地说道。

Deciding speed was worth the money this time, they left both the Lotus and the minivan in the hands of the valet parking crew, and headed inside. Mrs. Growlski got a lot of stares and more than a few gasps and screams of fear. The security guards that tried to tell them they couldn't bring a polar bear in a pink fez into the casino were sent stumbling back away when Mrs. Growlski growled at them and flipped them off. She waddled along in tow of the Pilots instead.  
这次他们决定花钱买速度，将莲花跑车和面包车都交给代客泊车服务，径直走进了赌场。格罗尔斯基夫人引来了众多目光，以及不少惊呼和尖叫。那些试图告诉他们不能带一顶粉色费兹帽的北极熊进入赌场的保安，被格罗尔斯基夫人一声低吼和竖起的中指吓得连连后退。她摇摇摆摆地跟在驾驶员们后面。

Rei pointed upward, and they took the elevators to the upper levels of the tower.  
绫波指了指上方，他们便乘坐电梯前往塔楼的上层。

The ride was at least faster than the old ones in the Geofront, if a lot stranger with a polar bear squeezed in with them.  
这趟旅程至少比地底都市的老式交通工具快，尽管与一只北极熊挤在一起显得格外奇怪。

It did provide a short period where Shinji and Asuka were relatively alone in one corner, isolated from the others by a wall of white fur and muscle.  
这确实提供了一个短暂的时段，让真嗣和明日香相对独处于一角，被一堵白毛和肌肉构成的墙与其他人隔开。

Shinji fought down an old reflex to avert his gaze anywhere but at Asuka, and took her hand instead. He was comforted a bit by the way she was blushing as much as he was. They hadn't been like this in years. The old early days of their courtship, sure, they'd been like two tomatoes they blushed around each other so much at the merest sign they liked one another, it sometimes felt like Misato would never stop teasing them.  
真嗣努力克制住旧有的习惯，不再回避目光，而是握住了明日香的手。看到她和他一样脸红，他感到些许安慰。他们已经多年没有这样了。早期的恋爱时光，确实，他们那时就像两个番茄，只要稍微表现出对彼此的好感，就会脸红得不得了，有时感觉美里永远不会停止取笑他们。

But now… this was different, unexplored territory. "I… I have literally _dreamed_ about this for a long time, Asuka…" he said hesitantly.  
但如今……这是不同的，未曾涉足的领域。“我……我确实长久以来一直梦想着这一刻，明日香……”他犹豫地说道。

"You're hardly the only one, you know," she admitted just as quietly. "If _you'd_ asked _me_ at any point in the last couple years, I probably would have said yes. Half the time I pushed at you, I think I was… trying to get you to. It was always… you know how I'm scared of… being abandoned. It was always that hidden, niggling fear that you'd one day… wise up and leave that made me keep…trying to see if you really would stay with me no matter what. But… I've imagined a day like this too. Maybe not with Rei and Kaworu _quite_ so intimately tied to us too, but…" She paused. "Ok, well, the _bear_ is a surprise. As is… Mein Gott, Shinji, you all said _yes_. To _me_! I… this was my idea?!"  
“你知道的，你并非唯一一个，”她同样轻声地承认。“如果过去几年中的任何时候你问我，我大概都会说愿意。很多时候我对你施压，我想我是在……试图让你这么做。总是……你知道我害怕……被抛弃。总是那个隐秘的、挥之不去的恐惧，担心你有一天……会醒悟并离开，这让我一直……试图看看你是否真的会无论发生什么都在我身边。但……我也曾想象过这样的一天。也许没有丽和薰与我们如此亲密地联系在一起，但……”她停顿了一下。“好吧，好吧，那只熊是个惊喜。还有……我的天，真嗣，你们都答应了。对我！我……这是我的主意？！”

Shinji smiled a little less hesitantly. "Because we all love you, Asuka."  
真嗣略显不那么犹豫地笑了笑。“因为我们所有人都爱你，明日香。”

Asuka sighed out her nose and poked him in the forehead. "Yeah, well… maybe. But you still don't get it, do you, my baka _husband_? Why we're all here in the first place?"  
明日香从鼻子里叹了口气，用手指戳了戳他的额头。“是啊，好吧……也许吧。但你还是不明白，对吧，我的笨蛋丈夫？我们为什么会在这里，一开始？”

He blinked, confused. "Er… because Misato said we had to-"  
他眨了眨眼，一脸困惑。“呃……因为美里说我们必须……”

"No, you dummy! Us! All four of us! As a… foursome!" Asuka blushed harder.  
“不，你这个傻瓜！我们！我们四个！作为一个……四人组！”明日香的脸更红了。

"I… I don't…?" "我…我不…？"

Asuka hung her head for a second. "All these years, still a baka." She raised her head and stared at him. "Shinji, the reason Rei, Kaworu, and I are all here is _you_. We all love _you_, you idiot. All of us may love each other too now, but what brought us all together in the first place is we all fell in love with you. Rei may have gotten him first because I had you at that point, but you can't tell me even _you_ missed that Kaworu has loved you since the day he showed up here?"  
明日香低下头，片刻后又抬起，"这么多年了，还是个笨蛋。"她直视着他，"真嗣，丽、薰还有我都在这里，都是因为你。我们都爱你，你这个傻瓜。我们可能现在也彼此相爱，但最初把我们聚在一起的原因是我们都爱上了你。丽可能先得到了他，因为那时我已经有了你，但你不能告诉我，你连薰从第一天来到这里就爱着你的事都没注意到吧？"

Shinji did look away this time, flushing. "Um… yeah, I… kind of noticed."  
这次，真嗣确实移开了视线，脸颊泛红。"嗯…是的，我…有点察觉到了。"

"And our favorite bluenette? The one you impressed the moment you met by volunteering to take her place against the Third Angel? The one who… Gott damn her sexy ass, the one who loves you _and_ me so much she made sure she never let us permanently give up on each other? The one who apparently is already 100% on-board with… with us staying married? You think she doesn't love your oblivious ass too?"  
"还有我们最喜欢的蓝发女孩呢？那个你第一次见面就通过主动代替她对抗第三使徒而给她留下深刻印象的人？那个……该死的性感屁股，那个深爱着你和我，确保我们永远不会永久放弃彼此的人？那个显然已经完全同意……我们保持婚姻关系的人？你觉得她不也爱着你那迟钝的屁股吗？"

"Um… well… yes…" Shinji mumbled. He automatically put his arms around Asuka as she pulled him into a hug. "I… I can't deny any of this, Asuka. But why are you-"  
"嗯……好吧……是的……" 真嗣含糊地回答。他本能地张开双臂抱住明日香，她将他拉进一个拥抱。"我……我无法否认这些，明日香。但你为什么——"

Asuka rolled right on like he hadn't spoken. "And me. Me, me, me. The one who fell hardest and fastest and deepest, but can't fucking spit it out unless we're about to die or I'm drunk off my ass because I'm still a stupid scared little girl inside afraid to admit I cry most nights we're not together because the idea of a future without my Shinji scares the Hell out of me…"  
明日香继续说着，仿佛他没插话。"还有我。我，我，我。那个陷得最深、最快、最彻底的人，但就是他妈的说不出口，除非我们快要死了或者我醉得不省人事，因为我内心仍然是个害怕承认自己大多数夜晚哭泣的愚蠢胆小的小女孩，因为想到没有真嗣的未来让我害怕得要命……"

She took a shuddering deep breath and buried her face in his shoulder. "I… I've been worried over the last year, Shinji, trying to figure out me, my feelings, and how this… how long the four of us could go on before something happened that broke this fragile equilibrium we'd all found… I… I wanted you forever, but couldn't imagine telling Rei or Kaworu they… they'd have to just watch you and I go off alone together. I never imagined we could do _this_… and I… I… I think I'm with Rei. I think we should… I meant every word I said in that video. I can't _remember_ it right now, but I know it. I... want to keep this."  
她颤抖着深吸一口气，将脸埋在他的肩头。“我……过去这一年我一直很担心，真嗣，试图弄清楚自己，我的感情，以及我们四个这种……这种脆弱的平衡能维持多久，直到发生什么事情打破它……我……我想要你永远在我身边，但无法想象告诉丽或薰他们……他们只能看着你和我独自离开。我从没想过我们可以这样做……而我……我……我想我是和丽在一起的。我想我们应该……我视频里说的每一句话都是真心的。我现在记不清了，但我知道。我……想保持这样。”

Shinji's arms tightened around her. "…you… you mean… stay like this. All four of us, together?"  
真嗣的手臂紧紧环绕着她。“……你……你是说……就这样保持下去。我们四个，在一起？”

She nodded. "I… Rei's there too. And… I'm pretty sure Sparkles is too. I… I know I am. Are you? Do… do you want to...?"  
她点点头。“我……丽也在。而且……我很确定薰也是。我……我知道我是。你呢？你……你愿意吗……？”

She could feel him shaking. "A-asuka... I'd marry _PenPen_ if that was a requirement to be able to stay with you. You're asking me if... if I also want to stay... stay with the two other people I love and love me? I..."  
她能感觉到他在颤抖。“明日香...如果这是能和你在一起的要求，我会和 PenPen 结婚。你是在问我...是否也想和另外两个爱我、我也爱的人在一起吗？我...”

He started laughing. "Asuka, I may be the most blind, oblivious baka in the world, but I'm not fool enough to ever let you go, o-or Rei, or Kaworu... I... are, are _you_ sure? I... yes, I've... Kaworu and I have been... looking at each other since we met, but... you come first. Him and me, me and Rei, him and Rei, you and me... that's all something anyone can see. But... I don't want to make you have to... take him as part of a package just because-"  
他开始笑了起来。“明日香，我可能是世界上最盲目、最迟钝的笨蛋，但我绝不会愚蠢到让你离开，也不会让丽或薰离开...我...你确定吗？我...是的，我和薰自从相遇以来就一直在...互相注视，但是...你永远是第一位的。他和我的关系，我和丽的关系，他和丽的关系，你和我的关系...这些都是任何人都能看出来的。但是...我不想让你被迫...接受他作为捆绑的一部分，只是因为-”

Asuka stopped him with a kiss. "Shush, you. Sparkles... He and I may not _yet_ be as gaga as the rest of us are for each other, but he's also the only other man besides you I have never minded waking up next to, and... I'd be lying if I said I didn't like the feeling of being between you two. Not just the sex, I mean. The... just being held by you both when I know how you two feel about each other. So... no, it's not 'imposing' him at all, okay? He's... He's part of us now. I can't picture him not being there. So that's that."  
明日香用一个吻打断了他。“嘘，你这个傻瓜...薰和我可能还没有像我们其他人那样疯狂地相爱，但他也是除了你之外，我从未介意醒来时躺在他身边的人，而且...如果我说我不喜欢夹在你们两个之间的感觉，那我就是在撒谎。不仅仅是性，我的意思是...只是被你们两个抱着，当我明白你们两个对彼此的感情时。所以...不，这根本不是在强加给他，好吗？他...他现在是我们的一部分了。我无法想象没有他的日子。就这样定了。”

She looked him in the eyes again. "So... if you're ok with being at the middle of a pile of wives and a husband at night from now on..."  
她再次直视他的眼睛。“那么……如果你不介意从今往后每晚都处在妻子堆和丈夫之间……”

He laughed again, a faintly crazed edge to it. "Asuka... you always ask me the questions that make me wonder if I'm losing my mind... I've never wanted to let you go, ever. I was always just afraid to ask you to stay, because I didn't deserve it. If you're okay with this... then I am too."  
他又笑了，笑声中带着一丝近乎疯狂的边缘。“明日香……你总是问我那些让我怀疑自己是否要疯了的问题……我从未想过要放开你，从来没有。我只是害怕开口让你留下，因为我觉得自己不配。如果你觉得这样没问题……那我也一样。”

"Also, I promised Rei I was going to screw her brains out tonight for that little stunt she pulled at the chapel with her panties in my pocket..." Asuka said with a growing smile. "And we can't let her get away with that, can we?" She squeezed him tight. "Our Rei needs a firm hand with this kind of thing."  
“还有，我答应过丽今晚要让她彻底疯狂，因为她那次在教堂里把内裤塞进我口袋的小把戏……”明日香带着越来越大的笑容说道，“我们不能让她就这么逃掉，对吧？”她紧紧抱住他，“我们的丽在这种事上需要一个坚定的手。”

"Our Rei, huh?" Shinji replied. "Kaworu and I to hold her down and you to have your way with her?"  
“我们的丽，嗯？” 真嗣回应道。“我和薰按住她，然后你就可以为所欲为了？”

Asuka smiled beatifically. "I love you."  
明日香幸福地微笑着。“我爱你。”

The elevator binged. "Penthouse level. We're here," Misato said from the far side of Mrs. Growlski. "Let's find my husband."  
电梯发出“叮”的一声。“顶层到了。我们到了，”美里从格罗斯基夫人那边说道。“我们去找我丈夫吧。”

### Chapter 6

Arg. This should have gone faster. But here we are! Finally! The last chapter of Hangover!  
哎呀，这本该更快完成的。但不管怎样！终于！《宿醉》的最后一章！  
(Though we may see more 'later days' bits)  
（尽管我们可能会看到更多‘后来的日子’片段）

**Evangelion: The Hangover pt 6  
新世纪福音战士：《宿醉》第六部分**

**.**

---

Rei and Kaworu, similarly isolated in another corner of the elevator by Mrs. Growlski's bulk, had their own conversation on the ride up. Similar, if a bit shorter. And for given values of the word 'conversation'.  
丽和渚薰同样被格罗尔斯基太太庞大的身躯隔在了电梯的另一个角落，在上升的过程中，他们有自己的对话。相似，如果稍微短一些的话。而且对于‘对话’这个词，有特定的理解。

Rei rose from where she'd been kneeling, delicately licking her lips with a small, catlike smile. "Mmm... the best part of having two husbands is I will get to do this twice as often. As well as various other things that require two men."  
丽从跪着的姿势站起身，优雅地舔了舔嘴唇，露出一丝小猫般的微笑。“嗯……有两个丈夫最好的部分就是我可以更频繁地这样做。还有其他需要两个男人的各种事情。”

Kaworu released his white-knuckled grip on the elevator's handrail and tried to uncross his eyes. "R-Rei... if you are trying to convince me to support maintaining this group marriage by pure sex, I have to admit, _it's working_." He hastily zipped his pants up. His arms automatically closed around Rei as she buried herself into his chest with a purr.  
渚薰松开了紧握电梯扶手、指节发白的手，试图让眼睛不再交叉。“丽……如果你试图通过纯粹的性来说服我支持维持这种集体婚姻，我不得不承认，这很有效。”他匆忙拉上裤子拉链。他的手臂自然而然地环抱住丽，她埋进他的胸膛，发出一声低沉的呜咽。

"Not intentionally, but I do find it is a persuasive additional argument," Rei said with only the faintest hint of smug. "My main case remains that we both love Shinji intensely, desire he be happy more than anything, and know that Asuka is the person who makes him happiest. He loves all three of us, but has not wanted to tell either of us that they are not 'the one', and so has held back from committing to Asuka. Ergo, the path of maximum joy for all four of us is this arrangement."  
"并非有意，但我确实认为这是一个有说服力的附加论点，" 丽说道，语气中仅带着一丝微不可察的自得。"我的主要论点依然是，我们都深爱着真嗣，渴望他比任何事都幸福，并且知道明日香是让他最快乐的人。他爱我们三个，但不愿告诉任何一方他们不是'那个人'，因此一直犹豫不决，没有向明日香承诺。因此，对我们四个人来说，最快乐的道路就是这种安排。"

"I... don't disagree with any of that," Kaworu admitted, wiping sweat off his forehead. It had been difficult not to _scream_ under Rei's 'attention' there. She was very, very good. "But... I... Asuka and I..."  
"我...并不反对这些，" 渚薰承认道，擦去额头上的汗水。在丽的'关注'下保持冷静并不容易。她非常非常出色。"但是...我...明日香和我..."

Rei patted his cheek reassuringly. "It is true, she does not love you with the same intensity she has for me, let alone Shinji. But recall she is just like him: she likewise has been afraid of ending things with me _and_ you if she and Shinji were to become a monogamous married pair. Or even just legally and symbolically excluding us by doing so. She is also aware of how we both love Shinji, and will not spurn you for that. And there is her speech in that video. She was sincere. I am fully confident she will be happy you are part of this, and come to love you as much as Shinji and I. We have... so much time ahead together."  
丽轻轻拍了拍他的脸颊以示安慰。“确实，她对你的爱没有像对我那样强烈，更不用说对真嗣了。但别忘了，她和真嗣一样：她也害怕如果她和真嗣成为一夫一妻制的夫妻，会结束与我和你的关系。甚至仅仅是通过这样做来合法地和象征性地排除我们。她也知道我们俩都爱真嗣，不会因此而拒绝你。还有她在视频中的那番话。她是真心的。我完全相信她会因为你成为我们的一部分而感到高兴，并像爱我和真嗣一样爱你。我们还有……很多时间在一起。”

Kaworu's face flashed to joy, but then clouded. "They're... still mortal, Rei. Are we?"  
渚薰的脸上闪过喜悦，但随即又蒙上了阴霾。“他们……还是凡人，丽。我们是吗？”

Rei gave a small shrug. "I am unsure. We age. I believe we _can_ die, if we wish to. And... we have decades, Kaworu. We have us, living examples of biological integration of the Fruit of Life. We have our loves. I think ensuring we do not have only a single century with them is sufficient motivation to dedicate ourselves to _carefully_ developing the Fruit for humanity at large. That will be a good life, yes?"  
丽微微耸肩。“我不确定。我们会衰老。我相信如果我们愿意，我们可以死去。而且……我们有几十年，渚薰。我们有我们，生命的果实生物融合的活生生的例子。我们有我们的爱。我认为确保我们不仅仅与他们共度一个世纪，足以成为我们致力于为全人类谨慎开发生命果实的充分动力。那将是一种美好的生活，不是吗？”

Kaworu snorted, and started laughing. Rei raised a trim eyebrow at him. He forced himself to calm down enough to answer her. "Rei... you just blew me so incredibly well I'm surprised I can still talk straight, explained why we should stay jointly married to our two best friends, and then topped it off with a statement you intend to defeat physics and entropy to create immortality for our loves and all mankind. All in the space of five minutes. Have I told you lately you are awesome and I love you?"  
渚薰嗤笑一声，随即大笑起来。绫波丽对他挑起修剪整齐的眉毛。他强迫自己平静下来，以便回答她。“绫波……你刚刚让我爽到难以置信，我居然还能说话这么利索，解释了我们为什么要继续与我们的两位好友共同维持婚姻关系，然后还以一句你打算战胜物理和熵，为我们的爱人和全人类创造永生的话作为结尾。这一切只用了五分钟。我最近有没有告诉过你，你真是太棒了，我爱你？”

"Not in the last two hours, but I will happily accept the compliments from my husband," Rei said with a faintly arrogant, royal air that she'd definitely learned from Asuka. She also managed to put a lilt into 'husband' that shot right down Kaworu's spine and woke his recently sated libido again. Rei smirked wider as she felt him stir against her. "Ahh...the best part of two husbands, indeed."  
“最近两小时没有，但我很乐意从我丈夫那里接受这些赞美，”绫波丽带着一丝从明日香那里学来的傲慢皇室气质说道。她还在‘丈夫’这个词上加了点儿抑扬顿挫，直击渚薰的脊椎，唤醒了他刚刚满足的欲望。绫波丽得意地笑了笑，感觉到他身体的变化。“啊……有两个丈夫的好处，确实不少。”

The elevator binged. "Penthouse level. We're here," Misato said from the far side of Mrs. Growlski. "Let's find my husband."  
电梯发出“叮”的一声。“顶层到了。我们到了，”美里从格罗斯基夫人那边说道。“我们去找我丈夫吧。”

The former Pilots fell into step behind their old Operations Director. Surprisingly, Misato somehow lacked the slight wobble to their gait the others still had from their hangovers. After a short walk down the hallway, Misato looked back over her shoulder. "Rei?"  
前驾驶员们跟在他们昔日的作战指挥官身后。令人惊讶的是，美里似乎并没有因为宿醉而步履蹒跚，而其他人却依然如此。走过一段走廊后，美里回头看了一眼。“绫波？”

Rei looked around, her eyes faintly glowing just a bit redder than usual if you were watching close. She pointed towards the elaborate double doors at the end of the hall with 'Presidential Suite' on the gilded doorplate. "There."  
丽环顾四周，如果你仔细观察，会发现她的眼睛微微泛着比平时更红的微光。她指向大厅尽头那扇装饰华丽的双开门，门牌上镀金写着'总统套房'。“那里。”

"Either my husband's been moving up in the world while I've been out, or someone's made him a guest," Misato commented. She rapped firmly on the door.  
“要么是我丈夫在我不在的时候地位上升了，要么是有人让他成了客人，”美里评论道。她用力敲了敲门。

Nothing. 没有回应。

Misato frowned, and shot a look at Rei, who just nodded again. Misato knocked again, harder. "Kaji? You in there?"  
美里皱了皱眉，瞥了一眼绫波，后者只是再次点了点头。美里再次敲门，这次更用力。“加持？你在里面吗？”

There was the faint sound of movement on the other side of the door. "No one that name here. Go," said a thick Russian accent.  
门后隐约传来一阵动静。“这里没有叫这个名字的人。走吧，”一个浓重的俄罗斯口音说道。

Misato's frown deepened, and her eyes narrowed. "We have reason to believe he's in this room, sir. Please open up."  
美里的眉头皱得更深了，眼睛也眯了起来。“我们有理由相信他在这个房间里，先生。请开门。”

"Go away or we call hotel make you leave." More indistinct sounds and footsteps moving away.  
“走开，不然我们就叫酒店的人让你离开。”更多的模糊声音和脚步声逐渐远去。

"Commander, if I might help?" Kaworu said, leaning past Misato's side. He tapped the electronic door lock with one precisely manicured finger. A faint zzzt of electricity and a miniscule flare of an AT-Field, and the door clicked open.  
“指挥官，需要我帮忙吗？”渚薰说着，侧身越过美里。他用一只精心修剪过的手指轻敲电子门锁。一丝微弱的电流声和微小的 AT 力场闪光后，门锁咔嗒一声打开了。

Misato threw him a grateful smile and pushed at the now unlatched door. It swung open on perfectly silent hinges to reveal a marble-tiled hallway and small foyer decorated in 'How Much Do You _Think_ This Cost?', but no doorman or anyone else in sight.  
美里投给他一个感激的微笑，推开已解锁的门。门在完全无声的铰链上转动，露出一条铺着大理石的走廊和小门厅，装饰风格仿佛在问‘你猜这花了多少钱？’，但门童或其他任何人都不见踪影。

Misato reached under her battered but still screaming-red old NERV jacket and loosened her pistol in it's holster. "I'm not even going to try asking you to stay here, kids, but at least stay behind me?" She didn't wait for their nods before heading down the hallway.  
美里伸手到她那破旧却依旧鲜红的 NERV 夹克下，松了松枪套里的手枪。“我甚至不会尝试让你们留在这里，孩子们，但至少要跟在我后面？”她没等他们点头就朝走廊走去。

Someone was ranting angrily in Russian in the room ahead. Misato beckoned Rei forward. "Rei, since you apparently learned Russian when I wasn't looking, what's this guy yelling about?"  
前方房间里有人正用俄语愤怒地咆哮。美里示意丽上前。“丽，既然你在我没注意的时候学会了俄语，这家伙在嚷嚷什么？”

Rei cocked her head. "He is demanding the return of his investments. And... threatening to have whoever he is speaking to 'talk to my friend Valera'."  
丽歪了歪头。“他在要求归还他的投资。而且……威胁说要让与他交谈的人‘和我朋友瓦列拉谈谈’。”

Misato's lips pressed into a flat line. "And my husband is in there, isn't he?"  
美里双唇紧抿成一条直线。“我丈夫也在里面，对吧？”

Rei nodded. 绫波点了点头。

Misato drew her pistol and worked the slide. "Alright, stay right behind me."  
美里拔出手枪，推上膛。“好，紧跟在我后面。”

She pushed the door open slightly...  
她轻轻推开门...

...only to bump right into the back of the heavyset man standing right in front of it. "Ooops."  
...却正好撞上了站在门前的魁梧男子的后背。“哎呀。”

"Чё за?.." “这是怎么回事？..”

Misato gave the door a huge shove and knocked the man over, stepping into the room with her pistol up. "Hi everyone! I'm looking for my... oh shit."  
美里用力推开门，将那人撞倒，举着手枪踏进房间。“大家好！我在找我的……哦，该死。”

Half a dozen pistols pointed right back at her. "Да кто ты ваще такая, ёпт?" demanded the thin young man standing in the middle of the room. Right in front of him, handcuffed to a chair, sat the object of their search.  
半打手枪立刻指向她。“你他妈到底是谁？”站在房间中央的瘦削年轻人厉声质问。就在他面前，被铐在椅子上的，正是他们搜寻的目标。

"Hi honey!" Inspector Katsuragi said cheerily in English. "I got a little held up. This gentleman here is Pavel Radontsev, and he seems to be the guy I beat at poker last night."  
“嗨，亲爱的！”葛城 inspector 愉快地用英语说道，“我有点耽搁了。这位先生是帕维尔·拉东采夫，看来他就是我昨晚在扑克桌上赢的那个人。”

Radontsev swung a hilariously oversized .44 revolver to point at the group of NERV members coming in through the door. "Fine! Fine! Great! Have some more assholes come in!" he shouted in accented English. "Maybe _they_ will tell me where my property went!"  
拉东采夫挥舞着一把滑稽的超大号.44 左轮手枪，指向从门口进来的 NERV 成员们。“好极了！好极了！太棒了！又来了一群混蛋！”他用带有口音的英语喊道，“也许他们会告诉我我的东西去哪儿了！”

"You should all put your guns down," Kaworu said cheerfully. "I don't think Rei will appreciate it if you keep pointing them at us."  
“你们都应该放下枪，”渚薰愉快地说，“我想零不会喜欢你们一直用枪指着我们的。”

"Oh? Sure, why don't I just give you the fucking gold fillings out of my teeth, too? You want anything else, сука?" Radontsev snarled. "I did not drag my ass all the way to Verkhoyansk in the middle of _fucking winter_ to find them just to have some _stupid Chinaman_ steal them from me at poker before my buyer can collect them!"  
“哦？当然，我为什么不干脆把我的金牙也给你呢？你还想要什么，婊子？”拉东采夫咆哮道，“我可不是在那个该死的冬天一路拖着屁股到维尔霍扬斯克，就为了在买家来取货之前被某个愚蠢的中国人在扑克桌上从我这里偷走！”

"I'm not Chinese," Kaji noted.  
"我不是中国人，" 加持指出。

"I don't give a fuck!"  
"我他妈才不在乎！"

Misato worked her jaw. "Ok... leaving aside that you appear to have my husband kidnapped and cuffed to a chair, _and_ that you're pointing a gun at me and my friends, exactly what are we supposed to have 'stolen' from you?" she said tightly, her own pistol not wavering a bit.  
美里咬了咬牙。"好吧...撇开你似乎绑架了我的丈夫并把他铐在椅子上，还有你正用枪指着我和我的朋友们这些事不谈，我们到底从你那里偷了什么东西？" 她紧绷地说道，手中的枪丝毫未动。

"My fucking _bears_, you stupid woman! This little dick says he beat me at poker for them last night, which is _impossible_! Nobody beats me at poker! No matter how drunk I am! So until this мудак coughs up my bears, he's going to stay right here!"  
"我他妈的熊，你这个蠢女人！这个小混蛋说他昨晚用扑克赢了我的熊，这不可能！没人能在扑克上赢我！不管我有多醉！所以直到这个混蛋交出我的熊，他得一直待在这儿！"

"You _really_ should put the guns down," Kaworu suggested again. "Rei doesn't like people pointing weapons at us."  
"你真的应该放下枪，"渚再次建议道。"丽不喜欢有人用武器指着我们。"

"Unless you're going to give me my bears, you can shut the fuck up too, сукабля!" Radontsev told him.  
"除非你打算还我熊，否则你也可以闭上你的臭嘴，婊子养的！"拉东采夫告诉他。"

"Which bears?" Shinji said quietly from the back of the group. "Is this one of them?"  
"哪种熊？" 真嗣从人群后方轻声问道，"这是其中之一吗？"

Mrs. Growlski shouldered her way through the too-small doorway and stood up to her full height. She growled something unhappy and surly sounding at the assembled crowd, several of whom snapped their guns to her.  
格罗尔斯基夫人挤过过于狭窄的门框，挺直了身子站在众人面前。她发出一声不悦且粗鲁的低吼，引得几名聚集的人群立刻将枪口对准了她。

"Господи Иисусе!" one of the goons said.  
"我的天哪！" 其中一个打手惊呼道。

Mrs. Growlski rumbled again, louder.  
格罗尔斯基夫人再次低沉地咕哝，声音更大了。

"Mrs. Growlski would like to know where her husband is," Rei translated helpfully.  
“格罗尔斯基夫人想知道她丈夫在哪里，”丽帮忙翻译道。

Asuka raised a finger. "Didn't we leave him in our bathtub?"  
明日香竖起一根手指。“我们不是把他留在浴缸里了吗？”

Mrs. Growlski looked around, glaring at them all. Rei said something to her in Russian. Apparently satisfied, the polar bear rumbled back at her.  
格罗尔斯基夫人环顾四周，狠狠地瞪了他们一眼。丽对她说了一句俄语。显然是满意了，那只北极熊对她咕哝了一声。

Radontsev said something to Rei, looking confused.  
拉东采夫对丽说了些什么，看起来很困惑。

Rei shrugged. "It's not my fault you sound like a drunken pig farmer from Bobruisk. _She_ speaks perfectly good Russian. Now, in English, please? My friends do not speak Russian."  
丽耸了耸肩。“你听起来像个来自鲍布鲁伊斯克的醉醺醺的养猪农，这可不是我的错。她俄语说得很好。现在，请用英语好吗？我的朋友们不会说俄语。”

"It's true, I really don't," Kaworu said, smiling. "And if you lost them at poker, doesn't that mean the really belong to Inspector Katsuragi?"  
"确实如此，我真的没有，" 渚薰微笑着说，"如果你是在扑克游戏中输掉的，那不就意味着它们真正属于葛城侦探了吗？"

Radontsev purpled. His pistol snapped to point right at Kaworu. "Would you care to repeat that to my friend Valera? Valera! Your time has come!"  
拉东采夫脸色发紫。他的手枪迅速指向渚薰，"你想把那话再说一遍给瓦列拉听吗？瓦列拉！你的末日到了！"

"I wouldn't dooooo that if I were you~" Kaworu sang, still smiling.  
"如果我是你，我可不会那么做~" 渚薰唱道，依旧面带微笑。"

The pistol's bark was thunderously loud in the hotel suite.  
手枪的轰鸣在酒店套房中震耳欲聋。

In contrast, the hum of the orange hexagon in front of him was barely audible. The bullet hovering in midair still commanded everyone's attention.  
相比之下，他面前橙色六边形的嗡嗡声几乎听不见。悬停在空中的子弹依然吸引着所有人的目光。

"Тычёбля?!" “Тычёбля?!”

For the first time since coming into the room, Rei's face had a clear expression on it. Anger.  
这是自进入房间以来，丽脸上首次露出清晰的表情。愤怒。

She raised her hand and pointed at the goon to her left. "Stop."  
她举起手，指向左边的小喽啰。“住手。”

He collapsed in a splash of LCL and suddenly emptied clothes.  
他像 LCL 一样溅落，衣物突然空荡荡地塌陷。

Her arm swung to the next one. "Shooting."  
她的手臂挥向了下一个。“射击。”

Splash. 溅落。

"At."

Splash. 溅落。

"My."

Splash. 扑通。

Her finger now pointed at Radontsev. "Husband!"  
她的手指现在指向拉东采夫。“丈夫！”

Splash. 扑通。

After two seconds as LCL, he was suddenly back, if naked. Then a puddle of LCL again. Then back. Then liquid. Then back. Then liquid-  
在经历了两秒钟的 LCL 状态后，他突然回到了现实，尽管是赤裸的。接着又变成了一滩 LCL。然后再次回归。然后是液体。然后又回归。然后是液体——

"Rei, stop playing with your food," Asuka said dryly.  
“丽，别玩你的食物了，”明日香干巴巴地说道。

"Were you not even slightly worried?"  
“你难道一点都不担心吗？”

Asuka smiled at her. "With you _and_ Sparkles here? Not a bit. I know you'd never let anyone hurt us."  
明日香对她微笑道：“有你和闪亮在这里？一点儿也不怕。我知道你绝不会让任何人伤害我们。”

"Do I still get credit for dramatically saving my loves from danger?"  
“我还能因为戏剧性地从危险中救出我的爱人而得到表扬吗？”

"Yes, you get kisses." “当然，你可以得到亲吻。”

"Good." "很好。"

Misato sighed. "Rei, put them back, please. I don't want to have to explain any _more_ insanity to the hotel or the cops as it is," she said, even as she stepped forward to fish the handcuff keys out of the soggy pile that had been Pavel Radontsev's clothes.  
美里叹了口气。“丽，请把它们放回去。我可不想再向酒店或警察解释更多疯狂的事情了，”她说着，同时上前从帕维尔·拉东采夫那堆湿漉漉的衣服中找出钥匙。

"I was going to, Commander. This was just a rapid way of neutralizing their guns and disarming them, since they will be naked, gun-less, and confused in a moment." She daintily stepped to each pile of clothes, removed the pistols, and placed the collection in a plastic bag she picked up off the table. "Like so." Rei waved her hand at the multiple piles of LCL-soaked clothes.  
“我正打算这么做，指挥官。这只是快速解除他们武装的方法，因为他们很快就会赤身裸体、手无寸铁且困惑不已。”她优雅地走到每堆衣服前，取出里面的手枪，并将收集到的枪支放入从桌上捡起的塑料袋中。“就像这样。”丽挥手示意那些浸满 LCL 的衣服堆。

Suddenly a bunch of very confused and very naked men stood over them. "...это пиздец ваще..." Radontsev said softly, eyes wide.  
突然间，一群非常困惑且一丝不挂的男人站在他们面前。“...这他妈的真是见鬼了...”拉东采夫轻声说道，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"He told you not to point guns at us, didn't he?" Misato smirked at him as Kaji stood up behind her, rubbing his wrists. "Now, why don't you nice young men all sit right over here on the couch and _politely_ tell us why we shouldn't just hand you all to the Las Vegas Police Department?"  
"他不是告诉过你不要用枪指着我们吗？" 美里对他微微一笑，而加持站在她身后，揉着手腕。"现在，你们这些好小伙子们为什么不都坐在这边的沙发上，礼貌地告诉我们为什么我们不应该把你们都交给拉斯维加斯警察局呢？"

"Чооо?"

Misato rolled her eyes. "Orrrrr, while you sit down and recover from the sudden feeling of having your AT-Field popped like a soap bubble by an angry demigoddess, I'll talk to my friends for a few minutes." She shepherded them to collapse on and around the couch. As an afterthought, she threw the wet piles of clothes at them.  
美里翻了个白眼。"或者，当你们坐下来从被愤怒的半神像戳破肥皂泡一样突然破掉的 AT 力场的感觉中恢复过来时，我去和我的朋友们聊几分钟。"她引导他们倒在沙发上和周围。作为事后考虑，她把湿漉漉的衣服堆扔给他们。

"Now... Rei... _'husband'_?" Misato asked with a smirk.  
"现在... 丽... '丈夫'？" 美里带着一丝戏谑问道。

"That is what I said, yes."  
"没错，我是这么说的。"

"So you and Kaworu _did_ tie the knot after I left?"  
"所以在我离开后，你和渚薰确实结婚了？"

"That is technically a correct statement."  
"从技术上讲，那句话是正确的。"

"Ohohohoh! But you couldn't call me back to see this? I'm so sad!"  
"哦呵呵呵！但你不能叫我来见证这一刻吗？我好伤心！"

"It happened rather quickly. And it was not precisely my idea."  
"事情发生得相当快。而且这并非完全是我的主意。"

"Eh? So Kaworu asked you?" She looked at the gray-haired Nephilim. "Awww, that's sweet of him."  
“诶？所以是渚邀请你的？”她看向灰发的天使。“哇，他真贴心。”

"No."

Misato blinked. "Eh? But... if he didn't, and it wasn't your idea, how did it go?"  
美里眨了眨眼。“诶？但如果不是他，也不是你的主意，那怎么会成行呢？”

Asuka covered her face with her palm. "Rei~"  
明日香用手掌遮住脸。“丽~”

Rei looked back at her. "But I'm having fun..."  
丽回头看着她。“但我玩得很开心……”

"You could keep this up all afternoon, couldn't you?" Asuka tried to glare at her, but couldn't.  
“你可以整个下午都这样继续下去，不是吗？”明日香试图瞪她，但没能成功。

"Probably." “大概吧。”

Misato raised an eyebrow at Rei, catching on. "You think you're being silly with me, eh?" She looked to Shinji. "Shin-chan, I know you're the worst liar in this entire group, so how about _you_ tell me what happened?"  
美里对绫波挑了挑眉，心领神会。“你以为你在跟我开玩笑，是吧？”她转向真嗣。“真嗣君，我知道你是我们这群人里最不会撒谎的，不如你告诉我发生了什么？”

"Er..." Shinji looked at his spouses. "Er... we got married."  
“呃……”真嗣看向他的伴侣们。“呃……我们结婚了。”

"Wait, you and Asuka too?!"  
“等等，你和明日香也是？！”

"That is also a correct statement," Rei said, perfectly blank.  
"那也是一个正确的说法，" 丽说道，面无表情。

"I swear, Blue, I am going to spank you _so much_..." Asuka warned.  
"我发誓，蓝，我要狠狠揍你一顿..." 明日香警告道。

"This is not reducing my motivation to continue," Rei said impishly.  
"这并没有减少我继续的动力，" 丽调皮地说。

Misato's eyes widened. "Wait, you and Asuka got married? _And_ Rei and Kaworu?"  
美里瞪大了眼睛。“等等，你和明日香结婚了？还有丽和薰？”

"Yes," Rei confirmed. She then jumped as Asuka pinched her bottom, but started to grin.  
“是的，”丽确认道。随即她跳了起来，因为明日香捏了她的屁股，但她开始咧嘴笑。

"This woman is impossible," Asuka grumbled.  
“这个女人真是无可救药，”明日香咕哝着。

"This would be among the reasons you love me," Rei said smugly, but subsided at Asuka's almost pleading look.  
"这正是你会爱上我的原因之一，" 丽得意地说道，但在明日香近乎恳求的眼神下收敛了。

Asuka sighed, but turned to her old boss. "What she's oh so cutely avoiding saying, Misato, is... is... ah..."  
明日香叹了口气，转向她的老上司。"她那么可爱地避而不谈的，美里，是...是...啊..."

"We got married," Shinji assisted. "All four of us. Together. And we aim to stay that way, Misato."  
"我们结婚了，" 真嗣帮忙补充道。"我们四个，一起。而且我们打算一直这样下去，美里。"

Misato blinked. "Wait, what?"  
"美里眨了眨眼。“等等，什么？””

"Asuka and I had a talk on the way up here. We love each other, we love Rei, Rei and I love Kaworu, and-"  
“明日香和我来这里的路上谈过了。我们彼此相爱，我们爱丽，丽和我爱薰，而且——”

Misato shook her head. "No, no, I mean… back the Hell up to the part where all four of you are married? Did… Only Touji and Hikari were married when Kaji and I left last night! What the Hell happened?"  
"美里摇了摇头。“不，不，我是说……回到你们四个都结婚的那部分？昨晚我和加持离开时，只有真治和光结婚了！到底发生了什么？””

Asuka wrapped Rei in an embrace and buried her face in the bluenette's shoulder. "Sparkles, show her the video."  
明日香紧紧拥抱着丽，将脸埋在蓝发少女的肩头。“斯帕克尔斯，给她看看那段视频。”

.

_._

_Twelve hours ago 十二小时前  
_  
Rei answered the insistent if erratic knocking at their suite's door but only because she was already up and getting a scoop of ice cream in the kitchen. She would not have bothered at all, otherwise. The other three occupants of the suite didn't even seem to notice the sound. To be fair, they were _deeply_ engaged.  
丽回应了套房门口那虽急促却杂乱无章的敲门声，但这仅仅是因为她已经起床并正在厨房里挖一勺冰淇淋。否则，她根本不会理会。套房里的另外三位住客似乎完全没有注意到这声音。说来也公平，他们正全神贯注于各自的事情。

Rei's sole concession to her state of dress was to wrap a kitchen towel around her waist before opening the door a crack. "Yes?"  
丽唯一的让步是在打开门缝前用一条厨房毛巾围住腰部。“什么事？”

Misato's face was right there pressed up against the crack. "Hiiiii~~~~ Rei! Quick, oppen zee door. I nid to stasch Kajiiiii~'s winnins wit youse faw. Faux. Four." Hic.  
美里脸贴在门缝上。“嗨~~~~丽！快，打开门。我需要把加持的赢钱藏在你这里。假的。四。”打嗝。

If Rei hadn't already been 200% intoxicated, Misato's breath alone would have done the trick. At the moment, all it did was remind Rei that she _was_ drunk, what that had led to, and what she was currently missing by being at the door right now instead of back in bed bouncing vigorously astride one of her spouses. "We are busy, Commander."  
如果丽还没有完全醉倒，美里的呼吸就足以让她醉倒了。此刻，这仅仅提醒了丽她已经醉了，那导致了什么，以及她现在因为站在门口而不是回到床上在她的配偶身上剧烈跳动而错过了什么。“我们正忙着，指挥官。”

"It'll onlee taik a minnit! Iz scheecret! Nid ta hide it place they woan look. I'mma put one in yur room, and one... uh... need a place..."  
"就一会儿！这是秘密！得藏在他们不会找的地方。我给你房间放一个，还有一个...呃...得找个地方..."

"What winnings?" "什么赢钱？"

"Kajeee's playin' poaker agin some Russki kid whu things he can out-poker Kajee, and out-drink _me_!" Misato said with a laugh. She pulled a flask out of her pocket and had another slug of the Blue Stuff. "Kajee's rollin' him gud! Took him for at leese $200,000 already, and made him lose his bearz!"  
"Kajeee 又在和那个俄罗斯小子玩扑克了，那小子以为自己能赢过 Kajee，还能喝赢我！" Misato 笑着说。她从口袋里掏出一个酒壶，又喝了一口蓝色液体。"Kajee 手气不错！已经从他那儿赢了至少 20 万美元，还让他输掉了他的熊！"

Rei stared at her. "Bears."  
丽盯着她。“熊。”

Misato appeared to think hard for a second. "AhHAH!" She smacked her hand with her fist. "We can putter inda car! Wait... no... they might schee her. We'll put de car on the roov! There, I ficshed it."  
美里似乎认真思考了一会儿。“啊哈！”她用拳头拍了拍手掌。“我们可以开车去！等等...不行...他们可能会看到她。我们把车放在屋顶上！好了，我解决了。”

"The car," Rei said blankly.  
“车，”丽面无表情地说。

Misato pushed the door open. "Here. You go get the keez and... Rei, why don't you have annee pantsh on?"  
美里推开门。“这里。你去拿钥匙和... 丽，你怎么没穿内裤？”

"I was in the middle of exceptionally emotionally and physically satisfying coitus, Commander. Can you come back later? You are interrupting-"  
“我正处在情感和身体上都极为满足的性爱中，指挥官。你能待会儿再来吗？你打扰到——”

"This'll onlee bee a jif, Rei! I just nid youse to grab zhee car keez and... uh, some pantz, and follow me! I'll leave a note while youse getz 'em!" Misato grabbed a piece of paper and a pen off the table and began scribbling a note. "Dis'll tell erryone what's the planz."  
“这只需要一会儿，丽！我只需要你拿上车钥匙和... 呃，一些内裤，然后跟我走！你拿东西的时候我会留张条！”美里从桌上抓起一张纸和一支笔，开始潦草地写便条。“这会告诉大家计划是什么。”

Reluctantly, Rei acquired some pants and grabbed the key fob. "Why do we need to do this right now, Commander?"  
不情愿地，丽穿上裤子，抓起钥匙扣。“为什么我们现在就得做这个，指挥官？”

Rei stepped back and blinked as the polar bear shouldered his way through the door and into the room. Misato directed him into the bathroom and handed him a bottle of vodka off the bar. "'Cauz bears hate waitin'. Now come on, we gotta put de odder one in teh car."  
丽后退一步，眨了眨眼，看着那只北极熊挤过门进入房间。美里指挥它进了浴室，并从吧台上递给它一瓶伏特加。“因为熊讨厌等待。现在快点，我们得把另一只放进车里。”

"This is interrupting my consummation, Commander," Rei complained as the door closed.  
“这打断了我的结合，指挥官，”门关上时，丽抱怨道。

_Thirty Minutes Later... 三十分钟后……_

Rei re-entered the suite, threw her pants off as fast as she could, and rapidly collected their phones before placing them all in the freezer wrapped in foil. She also made sure to carefully lock, bolt, and chain the door. Commander Katsuragi would _not_ be allowed to interrupt a second time.  
丽重新进入套房，迅速脱掉裤子，迅速收集了他们的手机，然后用锡纸包好放进冰箱。她还仔细地锁好、闩上并拴上了门。葛城司令不会再有机会打断他们了。

She made her way back to the bedroom. Happily, things had not ceased in her brief absence. In fact, she seemed to have arrived at an opportune moment, as she got there just in time to watch Kaworu stiffen and shout in climax atop Shinji, then slowly topple off to flop at Shinji's side across from Asuka.  
她回到卧室。幸运的是，在她短暂的离开期间，事情并没有停止。事实上，她似乎到达了一个恰到好处的时刻，正好赶上看到渚薰在真嗣上方僵硬并高潮地大喊，然后慢慢倒下，倒在明日香对面的真嗣身边。

Rei smiled. "Is that for me?" she asked coquettishly, nodding at the still prominent display of Shinji's compassion.  
丽微笑着。“这是给我的吗？”她娇媚地问道，目光投向了真嗣那依然显而易见的关怀之举。

Shinji blinked his own rapturously closed eyes open and smiled lazily, lovingly at her. "Yes it is, Rei, if you want it. I have to warn you, I'm... pretty close."  
真嗣缓缓睁开自己陶醉闭合的双眼，慵懒而深情地对她微笑。“是的，丽，如果你愿意的话。我得提醒你，我……相当接近了。”

"That is perfectly acceptable, my husband," Rei purred as she crawled onto the bed and settled astride his hips. "Pretty close is where I want you to be from this point on."  
“那再好不过了，我的丈夫，”丽低声呢喃，爬上床，跨坐在他的腰间。“从现在开始，我希望你一直保持这样的接近。”

She lowered herself with a warm smile, feeling completely fulfilled. "I'm home..." she said happily.  
她带着温暖的微笑缓缓坐下，感到无比满足。“我回来了……”她开心地说道。

Asuka and Kaworu smiled at her. "Welcome home, _wife_," they said together. This made them grin at each other.  
明日香和薰向她微笑。“欢迎回家，妻子。”他们异口同声地说，这让两人相视而笑。

Rei began to move. "Home..." she murmured to herself, staring right into Shinji's eyes.  
绫波开始移动。“家……”她喃喃自语，直视着真嗣的眼睛。

.

_._

"I do," said four voices in perfect synch.  
"我愿意，"四个声音完美同步地说道。

"Then by the power vested in me by the State of Nevada, I now pronounce you husbands and wives. You may kiss your loves."  
"那么，根据内华达州赋予我的权力，我现在宣布你们成为丈夫和妻子。你们可以亲吻你们的挚爱了。"

A confused, joyful collision of lips and faces ensued, capped by Rei and Asuka squealing in excitement as Shinji dipped Kaworu for a very thorough kiss.  
随之而来的是一片混乱而欢乐的唇与脸的碰撞，雷和明日香兴奋地尖叫着，而真嗣则将薰深深地拥入怀中，给了他一个极其深情的吻。

Misato stared slack-jawed at the 200cm flatscreen on the wall of the Presidential Suite. Without taking her eyes of the still fiercely embracing quartet on screen, she reached her free hand out to her left towards Shinji. "Beer me. Now."  
"美里目瞪口呆地盯着总统套房墙上的 200 厘米平板电视。她的目光始终没有离开屏幕上依然热烈拥抱的四人组，伸出空着的那只手向左边的真嗣示意。“给我啤酒。现在。””

"Ah, Misato… Are you sure-"  
“啊，美里……你确定——”

"Beer. I cannot brain this. Gimme beer."  
“啤酒。我无法思考了。给我啤酒。”

Shinji sighed and opened the suite's minibar, extracting a chilled bottle of Asahi Super Dry.  
真嗣叹了口气，打开套房的迷你吧，取出一瓶冰镇的朝日超爽啤酒。

Misato took it without looking, popped the cap off with her gun, and drained it in one pull. She sat staring at the screen until the video ended. "….Ok. So… you're all married."  
美里看都没看就接了过来，用枪弹开瓶盖，一口气喝干。她坐在那里盯着屏幕，直到视频结束。“……好吧。那么……你们都结婚了。”

"Yes." "是的。"

"To each other." “彼此之间。”

"Yes." "是的。"

"And… you're all… fine with that? I… How… what?"  
"而且…你们都…同意这个？我…怎么…什么？"

"And it's your fault too," Asuka smirked. "You and your little line about 'You love each other and you need this, so maybe y'all should just quit messing around and get married already...' is what gave me the idea, apparently."  
"这也是你的错，"明日香得意地笑了。"你和你那句关于'你们相爱并且需要这个，所以也许你们应该停止胡闹，直接结婚算了...'的话，显然给了我这个主意。"

"Hey!" Misato pouted. "嘿！"美里撅嘴道。

"I love Asuka, Misato. And Rei. And Kaworu. Half the reason Asuka and I weren't married before you and Kaji was Asuka and I were afraid committing to each other meant locking Rei and Kaworu out. So we just… hovered," Shinji said quietly, still attracting everyone's attention. "This… this is a solution I would never had dreamed of, or dared even whisper if I had. It took Asuka's courage and intelligence to see it and seize it. I will never be this lucky or this blessed again. Yes, we're keeping this."  
"我爱明日香，美里。还有丽。还有薰。我和明日香之前没有结婚的原因之一，就是我们担心彼此承诺会意味着把丽和薰排除在外。所以我们只是……徘徊不定，" 真嗣轻声说道，依然吸引着所有人的注意。"这个……这是我从未梦想过，甚至不敢低声提及的解决方案。是明日香的勇气和智慧让她看到了并抓住了这个机会。我再也不会有如此幸运或如此受祝福的时刻了。是的，我们要保留这个。"

Misato waved her hand confusedly at Rei and Asuka. "The… Rei… Rei and Asuka? I mean, I knew they were a lot closer since the end of the war than they started off but…"  
美里困惑地向丽和明日香挥了挥手。"那个……丽……丽和明日香？我是说，我知道她们在战争结束后比刚开始时亲近了许多，但是……"

"Asuka and I have been sleeping together off and on for over eighteen months, Commander," Rei said calmly. "And I love her as much as I love Shinji or Kaworu. She is my wife and I will not give her up."  
"我和明日香已经断断续续地在一起睡了超过十八个月，指挥官，" 丽平静地说道。"我爱她就像爱真嗣或薰一样。她是我的妻子，我不会放弃她。"

Asuka blushed. "Rei! I… just… don't just _say_ it like that! Telling her we've been… um…"  
明日香脸红了。“丽！我……只是……别那样说！告诉她我们已经……呃……”

"My wife is amazing in bed, Commander," Rei said with a tiny smirk. "And tastes good, too."  
“我的妻子在床上非常出色，司令，”丽微微一笑说，“而且味道也不错。”

"Stop that!" “别那样！”

Misato tried once more. "Asuka and Kaworu?"  
美里再次尝试。“明日香和薰？”

"I-" Kaworu began. “我——”薰开口道。

"No! You damn well stop right there, Misato. Yes, Kaworu! He makes my Rei happy. He makes my Shinji happy! And that right there _alone_ is enough for me to want him in this too! But you saw that video! And what he said before! I _know_ that beautiful, stupid Angel of mine would quietly back out without a whisper of protest if he thought it would make the rest of us happy to just be us three. And I will not have that happen. I will not let him trying to be a stupid, self-effacing dummy just like the others, putting everyone else's love and happiness ahead of his own! No way! How can I not want him too, the perfect, pretty, sweet doofus that makes Rei smile, that makes Shinji glow, that makes me love _him_ for being that way?" Asuka swatted at her now wet cheeks. "Gott damn you, Misato! You made me fucking cry and say it out loud! Yes, he belongs with us, _to us!_ He is a part of… whatever they Hell we four are, and I will not let anyone take him away from us!"  
“不！你给我停在那儿，美里。是的，薰！他让我的丽开心。他让我的真嗣开心！光是这一点就足以让我希望他也加入我们！但你看过那段视频了！还有他之前说的话！我知道我那美丽又愚蠢的天使，如果他认为这样会让其他人都开心，他会默默退出，连一声抗议都不会有。我绝不允许这种事发生。我绝不会让他像其他人一样，愚蠢地自我牺牲，把别人的爱和幸福放在自己之前！绝不！我怎么能不想要他呢，那个完美、漂亮、甜蜜的傻瓜，让丽微笑，让真嗣发光，让我因为他那样而爱上他？”明日香拍打着自己湿润的脸颊。“该死的美里！你让我哭了，还让我大声说出来！是的，他属于我们，和我们在一起！他是我们四个……不管我们是什么关系的一部分，我不会让任何人把他从我们身边夺走！”

She grabbed the stunned Nephilim and pulled him into a fierce, almost desperate kiss. "You hear me, baka number two? You're mine and Shinji and Rei's, and you're staying married to us! Got it?!"  
她抓住了震惊的混血种，将他拉入一个激烈而近乎绝望的吻中。“你听到了吗，二号笨蛋？你是我的，也是真嗣和丽的，你得和我们保持婚姻关系！明白了吗？！”

Kaworu just gaped at her, his face flashing through a combination of shock, joy, and incipient tears himself. "…..ok," he finally managed in a tiny voice.  
渚薰只是目瞪口呆地看着她，脸上闪过震惊、喜悦和即将落泪的复杂表情。“……好，”他终于用微弱的声音回答道。

"Good! Now go kiss your husband before I start bawling or something!" She shoved him at Shinji.  
“好！现在去亲你的丈夫，不然我就要开始嚎啕大哭了！”她把他推向真嗣。

He stumbled towards Shinji, then shyly smiled at him, blushing. "Um… Y-you know how this goes, Shinji."  
他踉跄地走向真嗣，然后羞涩地对他微笑，脸颊泛红。“嗯……你、你知道这怎么回事，真嗣。”

Shinji just nodded. "The Asuka has spoken. We must obey." He gently pulled Kaworu close enough to kiss.  
真嗣只是点点头。“明日香已经发话了。我们必须服从。”他温柔地将薰拉近，足以亲吻。

"Er… I am very confused," Radontsev said from behind Misato. "But… can I put pants on now?"  
“呃……我非常困惑，”拉东采夫在美里身后说，“但是……我现在可以穿上裤子了吗？”

Misato shook her head and looked at Kaji, who shrugged. "I don't think he's going to be any more trouble, love. Rei's kind of impressed on him the dangers of that."  
美里摇了摇头，看向加持，后者耸了耸肩。“我觉得他不会再惹麻烦了，亲爱的。丽已经让他深刻认识到那件事的危险性了。”

Misato looked at Rei, who nodded. "If he becomes irritating again, I will put him in a bucket for a few hours."  
美里看向丽，丽点了点头。“如果他再变得烦人，我会让他泡在水桶里几个小时。”

"Nyet! Please! I be good!"  
“不！请！我会乖乖的！”

Misato shook her head again. "I need more beer. And more Blue Stuff." She took a flask out of her jacket pocket, and shook it. Her expression fell when it proved empty. "Damn it. I wish I'd saved some."  
美里再次摇了摇头。“我需要更多啤酒。还有蓝色饮料。”她从夹克口袋里掏出一个扁酒壶，摇了摇。发现里面空空如也时，她的表情黯淡下来。“该死。真希望我留了一些。”

Hikari and Touji re-entered the room with Lieutenant Growlski following them. "We er... brought him, Asuka."  
光和真嗣带着格罗尔斯基中尉重新进入房间。“我们……把他带来了，明日香。”

The two bears let out loud and happy growls on sighting each other, and smashed together in a huge, fur-and-claws hug.  
两只熊一见到对方就发出了响亮而欢快的咆哮，随即紧紧相拥，展开了一场毛茸茸的巨爪拥抱。

"I thought this would be sadder, after that terrible performance with the dog at Medieval Times the night before," Rei said, watching them. "But this is nice. Lieutenant Growlski hit it out of the park."  
"我以为昨晚在 Medieval Times 和那只狗的糟糕表演之后，这会显得更悲伤，"丽说，看着他们。"但这挺好的。格罗夫斯基中尉真是大放异彩。"

Asuka stared at her, very confused. "Rei, what the Hell are you talking about?"  
明日香盯着她，非常困惑。"丽，你到底在说什么鬼话？"

"For the mourning after a terrible knight, there's nothing like the dog of the bear that hit you," Rei said sagely, nodding.  
"对于一个糟糕骑士的哀悼，没有什么比击倒你的熊的那只狗更合适了，"丽睿智地点头说道。"

Everyone in the room stared at her in silence.  
房间里的每个人都沉默地盯着她。

"Rei," Shinji said slowly, "That was terrible. Marry me."  
"丽，" 真嗣缓缓地说，"那真是糟糕透顶。嫁给我吧。"

"Too late, already done."  
"太迟了，已经办妥了。"

"Marry me too," Asuka added.  
"也向我求婚吧，" 明日香补充道。

"And me," Kaworu echoed. "还有我，" 渚薰附和道。

"Alright, but you must take me back to our room and ravish me immediately," Rei demanded.  
"好吧，但你得带我回房间，立刻把我占有，" 绫波命令道。

"Sold!" Asuka crowed, and picked up Rei over her shoulder. "Misato, you're on your own now, have the Growlskis eat anyone that acts up, yes we're staying married, and don't you dare bother us until dinnertime!" She began moving surprisingly quickly towards the door. "I love these idiots!"  
"成交！" 明日香欢呼道，将绫波扛在肩上。"美里，你现在得自己应付了，让格罗尔斯基们对付那些捣乱的家伙，对，我们还要继续结婚，别在晚饭前打扰我们！" 她开始以惊人的速度向门口移动。"我爱死这些傻瓜了！"

"What... what Hell happened?" Radontsev asked weakly. He looked up at the Growlskis, who were glaring at him. "Uh oh."  
"什...什么鬼情况？" 拉东采夫虚弱地问道。他抬头看着格罗尔斯基们，他们正瞪着他。"呃哦。"

"My kids..." Misato said, shaking her head again. "I should have expected this would happen. Vegas, man..." She looked at the unhappy bears. "Well... looks like, you, me, and the Growlskis are going to settle last nights poker bets. You got any problems with that, or should I feed you to them?"  
"我的孩子们..." 美里再次摇了摇头。"我早该料到会这样。拉斯维加斯，伙计..." 她看着那些不高兴的熊。"好吧...看来，你、我，还有格罗尔斯基们得解决昨晚的扑克赌注了。你有什么问题吗，还是我该把你喂给他们？"

"No! No! Is fine! We talk! All droogs, da?" Radontsev said hurriedly, waving his hands. He glanced at the bears again and swallowed nervously. "We make new deal on the bears, da? Good?"  
“不！不！没事的！我们谈谈！都是兄弟，对吧？”拉东采夫急忙说道，挥着手。他又瞥了一眼那些熊，紧张地咽了咽口水。“我们重新谈一下关于熊的交易，好吗？好的？”

Misato cocked her eye at Lieutenant Growlski, who shrugged. "Well, you can pacify me with the money you owe, but they might be harder to... bear."  
美里斜眼看着格罗尔斯基中尉，后者耸了耸肩。“好吧，你可以用欠我的钱来安抚我，但他们可能更难……忍受。”

Mrs. Growlski threw her fez at Misato.  
格罗尔斯基夫人把她的菲斯帽扔向美里。

"What? Where do you think my kids got it from? Eh?"  
"什么？你以为我的孩子们是从哪儿学来的？嗯？"

"This country is so fucking weird. I'm going to Monaco next time..." Radontsev said miserably.  
""这个国家真是太他妈奇怪了。下次我要去摩纳哥……"" 拉东契耶夫痛苦地说道。

Rei squeaked gleefully as Asuka tossed her onto the bed and began rapidly whipping Rei's clothes off.  
丽一边欢快地尖叫，一边被明日香扔到床上，后者迅速地剥掉了丽的衣服。

"You, Blue, are such a terrible, wicked punster and tease!" she accused as she flung Rei's pants behind her.  
"你啊，蓝，真是个糟糕透顶、恶劣至极的俏皮话大王和逗弄高手！" 她一边指责，一边将丽的裤子甩到身后。

"And yours. For our lives," Rei confessed, smiling.  
"还有你的。为了我们的生活，" 丽坦白道，微笑着。

Asuka shivered and began tearing her own clothes off too. She threw a look over her shoulder as she went. "You two sexy bakas, get naked too and get in here. I need all my loves up against me with all speed. I _want_ this now, and... and I need it. All of you."  
明日香颤抖着也开始脱掉自己的衣服。她回头瞥了一眼，说道："你们这两个性感的大笨蛋，也快脱光了进来。我需要你们所有人尽快紧紧贴着我。我现在就要，而且……我需要你们。所有人。

"We all do, Asuka," Shinji said as he lay down beside her and ran his hands through Rei's hair. "That's why it took us five years to get here. This is too much for any of us to have believed before it was real. But we all kind of knew we needed it, didn't we?"  
"我们都是这样，明日香，" 真嗣说着在她身边躺下，手指穿过绫波的头发。"这就是为什么我们花了五年时间才走到这一步。这在成为现实之前，对我们任何人来说都难以置信。但我们或多或少都知道我们需要它，不是吗？"

"Agreed," Kaworu said from Asuka's other side. "I would not even have imagined this before. This is... we have done foursomes before, yes, but... not like this. Not..." He pressed himself against Rei's side, put one arm up on Asuka's back, and the other around the top of Rei's head on the pillow to stroke Shinji's arm. "This. Us. Complete."  
"同意，" 渚薰在明日香的另一侧说道。"我之前甚至无法想象这样的情景。我们以前也尝试过四人一起，是的，但……不是这样。不是……" 他紧贴着绫波的身侧，一只手臂搭在明日香的背上，另一只手环绕在绫波头上的枕头上，轻抚着真嗣的手臂。"这样。我们。完整。"

"And in 24 hours we'll be getting on a plane, and no one can take this from us," Asuka sighed, laying down on top of Rei. "Not ever."  
"而 24 小时后我们将登上飞机，没有人能从我们这里夺走这一切，" 明日香叹息着，躺在绫波的身上。"永远不会。"

"Yes," Rei nodded. "Now please ravish your wife, Asuka?"  
"是的，" 丽点头道。"现在请享用你的妻子，明日香？"

"Little minx." "小淘气。"

"I love you all." "我爱你们所有人。"

### Chapter 7

I bet you thought we were done. Well, turns out, Hangover isn't quite done yet.  
我打赌你以为我们已经结束了。然而，事实证明，《宿醉》还没完全结束。

Boreas Anemos, a fan of A&T, was so stuck by Hangover that he wrote a set of omakes so good, I had to declare them canon, and then they inspired me to write another Hangover chapter to follow it. He's not done, either. I just proofread another 2 pieces covering days after their return to Japan, and I've got a few more ideas to follow.  
Boreas Anemos，一位 A&T 的粉丝，被《宿醉》深深打动，以至于他写了一系列如此精彩的番外，我不得不宣布它们为正史。这些番外还激发我继续创作另一章《宿醉》。他也没闲着，我刚刚校对了两篇关于他们回到日本后日子的作品，还有一些其他想法即将呈现。

So here we go, Hangover pt 7. Or more properly, 'The Four Of Us, 1-3', written by Boreas Anemos, not me, but included here with his permission to make it easier to fine. He's also got his own FFNet and AO3 pages, so give them a look too. He's got a very interesting new fic going, Two Souls, that takes on Eva canon from an unusual perspective: Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu's.  
那么，我们开始吧，《宿醉》第七部分。更确切地说，是《我们四人，1-3》，由 Boreas Anemos 所写，并非我手笔，但经他许可收录于此，以便于大家查找。他还有自己的 FFNet 和 AO3 页面，不妨也去看看。他正在创作一部非常有趣的新小说《两个灵魂》，从独特的视角——赤木律子的视角——来解读《新世纪福音战士》的正史。

This is the compilation of 3 pieces into one, for simplicity. It covers the flight back to Japan for our new foursome, and arrival at home.  
这是三篇作品的合集，为了简洁起见。它涵盖了我们新四人组返回日本的飞行旅程，以及到家后的情景。

**Four of Us - part 1**.  
我们四人 - 第一部分。  
_Tale of settling in 安顿下来的故事_

The flight to Japan from the eventful – and fateful – time in Las Vegas was filled with mix of residual excitement from the emotional overload they have been subjected to, worry about legitimisation on part of the newlywed quartet, thoughts on how to present the situation to their families from Hikari and Touji, and smug smiles on Misato's and Kaji part – that sometimes escalated into giggling, as Misato was clearly recalling some funnier part of their trip.  
从拉斯维加斯那充满事件——且命运攸关——的时刻飞往日本的航班上，充满了他们经历情感超载后的余波兴奋，新婚四重奏对合法性的担忧，光和斗司如何向家人陈述情况的思考，以及美里和加持那得意的微笑——有时升级为咯咯笑声，显然美里在回忆旅途中的某些更有趣的部分。

"Good to see that **someone** is not worried about anything," Asuka growled. While the worst of the hangover was long gone, and she was feeling rather good, there was no reason not to slide in a barb – especially that Misato was still all smug about the events.  
“很高兴看到有人对什么都不担心，”明日香咆哮道。虽然宿醉最严重的部分早已过去，她感觉相当不错，但没理由不插一句刺——尤其是美里还在对那些事件得意洋洋。

Misato gave her an amused look: "Well, now you're going to learn the fun parts of married life: strange socks everywhere, things you left in known places moving on their own, toilet seat left up-"  
美里带着戏谑的表情看着她：“好吧，现在你要开始学习婚姻生活有趣的部分了：到处都是奇怪的袜子，你放在已知位置的东西自己移动，马桶座圈还立着——”

"Oi, darling", up-to-now sleeping Kaji interceded. "**That** one is a slander, I never leave the lid up!"  
"喂，亲爱的", 一直睡着的加持插话道，"那可是诽谤，我从不让马桶盖掀着！"

"Yes, but I do. And you complain about it. Keep sleeping, **you** have the least to worry here", she grinned, he smiled back and returned to his slumber.  
"是啊，但我会的。你还抱怨。继续睡吧，你在这儿最不用担心", 她咧嘴一笑，他回以微笑，又沉沉睡去。"

Asuka rolled her eyes at the exchange. "Misato, I have been living with them for a few years already. Really, I know it, socks, toilet seat, hair in the shower – mostly mine, I admit – and more. Believe me, Shinji is perfect in handling those little nuisances. Well, maybe except things moving on their own, because he imposes his brand of order all the time."  
明日香对这段对话翻了个白眼。"美里，我和他们一起生活好几年了。真的，我知道这些，袜子乱丢，马桶盖不盖，浴室里的头发——大部分是我的，我承认——还有更多。相信我，真嗣处理这些小麻烦很有一套。嗯，也许除了东西自己移动这种情况，因为他总是坚持自己的秩序。"

Misato looked at Shinji with a little surprise in her eyes. "That you like to keep your place orderly, I know. But imposing anything does not sound like you."  
美里看着真嗣，眼中闪过一丝惊讶。“你喜欢保持整洁，我知道。但强加于人听起来不像你的风格。”

He raised his eyebrow on that. Misato was not sure whether she saw him fighting down a smile, or was it just a figment of her imagination. "I would not call it _imposing_. I just like to know where things are."  
他对此挑了挑眉。美里不确定自己看到的是他在努力忍住笑意，还是仅仅是她的想象。“我不认为这是强加。我只是喜欢知道东西放在哪里。”

"Well, by this you essentially trying to force them to keep their own order, or have their things ordered as you see fit", she elaborated. "Not that there is anything wrong with that – except I already had that experience, I could find **nothing** in my apartment for the first few weeks after you moved in – and I sympathise with the sufferers."  
“好吧，这么说你实际上是在试图强迫他们保持自己的秩序，或者按照你的想法整理他们的物品，”她详细解释道，“这并没有什么错——只是我已经有过这种经历，你搬进来后的头几周，我在公寓里什么都找不到——我同情那些受影响的人。”

This time, it was Shinji's turn to roll his eyes. "Misato-san… I was astonished you were able to find anything **before** I moved in. One of greatest regrets of my life is not taking photos of that place before I cleaned it up; they would be a great counterargument against most of your friendly comments."  
这次轮到真嗣翻白眼了。“美里小姐……我真惊讶你在我搬进来之前还能找到任何东西。我一生中最大的遗憾之一就是没在打扫前给那地方拍照；它们将成为反驳你大部分友好评论的有力证据。”

Misato and Asuka blinked in concert and looked on one another, while Shinji maintained his deadpan expression. Finally, Asuka spoke: "I'm not sure whether it's my influence changing you, or Rei's specific brand of humour rubbing on you. Could be either, but I am guessing it's me – you've been in my bed more often, after all."  
美里和明日香同时眨眼，互相看了看，而真嗣保持着面无表情。最后，明日香开口道：“我不确定是你受我影响改变了，还是丽特有的幽默感传染了你。可能是其中之一，但我猜是我——毕竟你在我床上待得更频繁。”

Shinji smiled, and Misato stifled a giggle; for a moment, she was pondering whether she should not be scandalised by that comment. After short deliberation, she reminded herself that while she is still dealing with "her kids", her erstwhile charges are adults, and – since that fateful night two days ago – married. Massively married. _'__Their life, their fun. I have my boy-toy and my life, let them have theirs.'_ Having reached that conclusion, she smiled, merely shaking her head at Asuka's usual brashness.  
真嗣笑了，美里忍住笑意；有那么一刻，她在想自己是否应该对这个评论感到震惊。经过短暂的思考，她提醒自己，虽然她仍在处理“她的孩子们”，但她曾经的监护对象已经成年，而且——从两天前那个决定性的夜晚开始——结婚了。彻底结婚了。他们的生活，他们的乐趣。我有我的小男友和我的生活，让他们拥有他们的。”得出这个结论后，她微笑着，只是对明日香一贯的大胆摇了摇头。

A silent giggle from behind had drawn their attention, making Asuka kneel on her seat and look back at Rei, who apparently woke sometime during the exchange and was listening in. Kaworu was still sleeping with his head in her lap, though, looking 'far cuter that it was legal in most prefectures', as Rei was fond of calling that appearance. "Do you wish to contest that claim, Rei? If you do, please share the scandalous details!", Asuka shot.  
身后传来的一阵轻笑吸引了她们的注意，使得明日香跪在座位上回头看向绫波，显然她在对话中某个时刻醒来并开始倾听。渚仍然在她的膝上熟睡，那模样被绫波戏称为“在大多数县都算得上合法的可爱”。“你想反驳这一点吗，绫波？如果愿意，请分享那些劲爆的细节！”明日香挑衅道。

The bluenette shook her head and spoke in what passed for amused voice in her case: "No, I do not wish to contest that claim, my dear wife"; Asuka blinked on that statement, her head spinning a bit: _'__it will take some time to get used to that'_, she thought. _'__But I think I like it. Somehow.'_ She shook it off, knowing that this train of thought will surely return – but she had time to deal with that.  
蓝发少女摇了摇头，用她那难得的轻松语气说道：“不，我不想反驳那个说法，我亲爱的妻子。”明日香听到这话眨了眨眼，脑海中有些晕眩：“适应这个称呼还需要些时间，”她想，“但不知为何，我觉得挺喜欢。”她甩开这些思绪，知道这个念头肯定还会回来——但她有时间去处理。

"I just sincerely hope this imbalance of bed-time will be amended in the light of recent events and our… bond. Of course, I do not wish nor dare to deprive you of your Shinji-time", Rei smiled softly. "Therefore, I am devising a plan of an arrangement that will satisfy us all. And I believe I already have one in mind." Her smile went from kind and soft to… mischievous? This confused Asuka. _'__Is it even possible for her to plan mischief?'_, she pondered. _'__She gets flirty, yes, but only when drunk, and we're still stone-sober.'_ "I shall share it with everyone once we are in more private environment", she finished with conviction.  
"我只是真诚地希望，鉴于最近的事件和我们之间的……纽带，这种就寝时间的不平衡能得到调整。当然，我既不希望也不敢剥夺你的‘真嗣时间’，" 绫波微笑着温柔地说，"因此，我正在构思一个能让大家都满意的安排。我想我已经有了一个主意。" 她的笑容从温和柔软变得……狡黠？这让明日香感到困惑。她真的有可能策划恶作剧吗？'她会调情，没错，但只有在喝醉的时候，而我们还清醒得很。' "等我们到了更私密的环境，我会和大家分享这个计划，" 她坚定地说道。

"And what is stopping you from doing it now?", Asuka asked before thinking.  
"那现在为什么不做呢？" 明日香脱口而出，未经深思。

"Public decency law", Rei replied with her usual deadpan.  
"公共道德法，" 绫波一如既往地面无表情地回答。

Asuka could only groan and sink to her seat. _'__Well, things have changed. Shinji is growing a spine. Rei is plotting – and I guess showing a side of herself I never thought she had… I wonder what surprise will Kaworu spring.'_, she mused with a sigh.  
明日香只能呻吟一声，瘫坐在座位上。好吧，情况变了。真嗣开始变得有骨气了。丽在谋划——我想她在展示我从未想过她会有的那一面……我好奇薰会带来什么惊喜。',她叹息着思索道。

_'__And I did this to myself. Me. I told them I love them and want to have them all – forever. Gott, I guess my art of self-sabotage has reached another peak, tie myself down like that… Well, this time the advantages outweigh the drama'_, Asuka concluded with a smile.  
这一切都是我自找的。我。我告诉他们我爱他们，想要永远拥有他们。天啊，我想我的自我毁灭艺术又达到了一个新的高峰，把自己束缚得如此之紧……不过，这次的好处超过了那些戏剧性的事',明日香带着微笑总结道。

_'__I hope'_, her smile dimmed a bit. _'__What if…'_  
我希望',她的笑容稍稍黯淡了一些。万一……'

She looked at sleeping Shinji's face; he was at peace. Nuzzling against his side suddenly seemed to be a good option. _'__No. Enough. I will worry about future tomorrow'_, she thought while adjusting her body pillow to her comfort. Soon, she fell into best sleep she could muster under these conditions.  
她看着熟睡中的真嗣的脸庞；他显得很平静。突然间，依偎在他身旁似乎成了一个不错的选择。不，够了。明天再担心未来吧，她想着，调整了一下自己的抱枕以获得舒适。很快，她就在这种条件下尽力进入了最深的睡眠。

Shinji was woken by numbness in his arm. Quick look to his right confirmed the leading hypothesis – Asuka was clinging to it, fast asleep. She looked so relaxed and happy, he would rather gnaw the arm off than wake her up… and it seemed a reasonable option, for she was clinging to it so hard, that he suspected that massive loss of circulation had already occurred. So, it was either wake Asuka, or lose an arm.  
真嗣被手臂的麻木感唤醒。他迅速向右一看，证实了主要的猜测——明日香正紧紧抱着他的手臂，睡得很沉。她看起来如此放松和快乐，他宁愿咬断手臂也不愿吵醒她……而且这似乎是个合理的选择，因为她抱得那么紧，他怀疑已经发生了严重的血液循环障碍。所以，要么叫醒明日香，要么失去一条手臂。

This was **not** an easy decision. But it was one he had to make fast. Otherwise, by the time of landing, he would not have that appendage.  
这不是一个容易的决定。但他必须迅速做出选择。否则，等到落地时，他可能就没有那条手臂了。

"Schatz", he whispered softly, moving his arm by a millimeter. Sleepy murmur was the only answer. "Asuka…", he pleaded a bit louder, caressing her back with the operational hand. This time, her reaction, while not really vocal, was a little bit more pronounced – she did shift her grip, which apparently unblocked some blood vessel, sending a wave of needles thorough the numb body part. He clenched and released his fist, trying to shake off the feeling. _'__Well, it is a temporary solution, but it has to do'_, he thought, watching his lover – no, wife – closer.  
"宝贝", 他轻声细语，手臂微微一动。只有困倦的咕哝作为回应。"明日香…", 他稍稍提高了声音恳求，用能动的那只手抚摸她的背。这次，她的反应虽然没有出声，但明显了一些——她调整了握持，显然解开了某个阻塞的血管，一阵针扎般的刺痛穿透了麻木的身体部位。他紧握并松开拳头，试图摆脱这种感觉。嗯，这是个暂时的解决办法，但总比没有好', 他想着，更仔细地看着他的爱人——不，是妻子。

Wife. A word that sounded so strange to him. A word he always knew now sounded… different. That word was never personal, never truly meaningful. A simple noun, a family relation that had nothing to do with him.  
妻子。这个词对他来说听起来如此陌生。他一直知道这个词现在听起来……不同了。这个词从未个人化，从未真正有意义。一个简单的名词，一个与他无关的家庭关系。

Now, that word had a face. No – _faces_. Eep.  
现在，这个词有了面孔。不——是面孔们。哎呀。

_'__I guess this is something that will take some more getting used to than I thought'_, he mused again. He looked across his shoulder, between the seats. Rei was awake, but absent – she was staring out of the window and caressing Kaworu's head. She was smiling one of her soft smiles; Shinji could only wonder what thoughts caused it.  
我想这比我想象中还需要更多时间去适应', 他又沉思道。他回头望向座位之间，看到丽醒着，但心不在焉——她正凝视着窗外，轻抚着渚的头。她露出了她那柔和的微笑；真嗣只能猜测是什么念头让她如此。

She and Asuka could not be more different in range of expression – Rei, while exactly as capable of emotion and feeling as Asuka, was one of hardest people to read; on the other hand, her feelings, once made clear, could be felt through her persistent actions: in hindsight, her long-present love and devotion was clear. Asuka, on the other hand, wore her emotions on her sleeve – and everywhere else, too – but was bad at expressing feelings. After all, it took her half a decade of mixed signals before she managed to spit it all out – and propose. Of course, when she did, she did it as everything else she thought worth doing – in an epic-proportion, grand way. He giggled at that vision: the grandeur of the speech, the facial expressions of them all, Asuka's eyes shining bright when they all accepted… that was an image to cherish. He would love to have his own memories of this, not just the recording. _'__Maybe they will come back. With all what happened there, another miracle would not be a surprise'_, he thought wishfully before returning to his reflections on emotional ranges.  
她和明日香在表达方式上截然不同——尽管丽在情感和感受能力上与明日香不相上下，但她是最难以捉摸的人之一；另一方面，一旦她的情感变得明朗，便能通过她持之以恒的行动感受到：事后看来，她长久以来的爱与奉献显而易见。而明日香则将情绪表露无遗——不仅在脸上，无处不在——但她不擅长表达情感。毕竟，她花了五年时间发出混杂的信号，才终于吐露心声——并求婚。当然，当她这么做时，她以自己认为值得的一切方式——宏大而壮观。他想到那一幕不禁轻笑：那番壮丽的言辞，所有人的表情，当大家都接受时明日香眼中闪烁的光芒……那是值得珍藏的画面。他希望能有自己的记忆，不仅仅是录像。也许他们会回来。经历了那么多，再来一个奇迹也不足为奇，他怀着这样的愿望，继续沉思情感的广度。

Kaworu was somewhere in the middle on scale of expressing emotions. He was more expressive than Rei – but far more soft-spoken than Asuka. Before all, he was curious. Adventurous, even.  
渚薰在表达情感的尺度上处于中间位置。他比绫波零更外露，但比惣流·明日香·兰格雷更为轻声细语。首先，他充满好奇心，甚至可以说是冒险精神。

Kaworu. A husband. **His** husband. Eep.  
渚薰。一个丈夫。他的丈夫。哎呀。

**That** was quite another nut to crack.  
这可是另一个需要破解的难题。

Shinji had no problem with relationships and intimacy with men – at least since the possibility entered his mind and he gave it good thought. On the other hand, he did not find men other than Kaworu attractive… which brought his train of mind back on the boy – no, a man – whose head was now resting on Rei's lap, smiling to his dreams.  
真嗣对与男性建立关系和亲密行为并无抵触——至少自从这个可能性进入他的脑海并经过深思熟虑后。另一方面，除了渚薰之外，他并不觉得其他男性有吸引力……这让他再次想起了那个男孩——不，那个男人——此刻正枕在绫波的膝上，对着梦境微笑。

_'__How it will look like now?'_, he mused. _'__All the sex we had was in presence of Asuka and Rei… well, most of it'_, he blushed at the memories and was suddenly glad Asuka's head was not in his lap. _'__I wonder how "marital duties" Asuka threatened me – us – with will differ from her perception of "boyfriend duties"'_, he pondered, smiling again. _'__Kaworu… what are we now?'_  
现在会是什么样子呢？', 他沉思着。我们所有的性行为都是在明日香和绫波在场的情况下发生的……嗯，大部分都是', 他因回忆而脸红，突然庆幸明日香的头不在他的膝上。我想知道明日香威胁我的“夫妻义务”——对我们——会有什么不同，与她对“男友义务”的看法相比', 他思索着，再次微笑。渚薰……我们现在算什么呢？'

It was not the first time Shinji asked himself that question. His thoughts went back to the time when he was lost and confused – again.  
这已经不是真嗣第一次问自己这个问题了。他的思绪回到了他迷失和困惑的时候——又一次。

_Three months ago 三个月前_

It was soon after another of the usual break-ups. He and Asuka had a fight; he could not even recall over what it was, even those few days later. Quite possibly the trigger was trivial and meaningless, and the argument simply occurred because some tension had built up. Predictably, the fight ended up with Asuka's _"__We're_ _**done**__! Idiot!"_, followed by her storming out of the room and refusing to talk to him. And relegating him to the old room of his, as well – by now he was so used to that that he kept a futon ready for that occasion.  
那是在又一次常见的分手之后不久。他和明日香吵了一架；他甚至记不清是为了什么，即使几天后也是如此。很可能触发点微不足道且毫无意义，争吵只是因为某些紧张情绪积累所致。不出所料，争吵以明日香的“我们完了！笨蛋！”告终，随后她冲出房间，拒绝与他交谈。还将他赶到了他以前的房间——到现在他已经习惯了，以至于他为此准备了一床被褥。

Three days later, still ignoring him, she went out for a date with some random guy. Rei was away on one of her research excursions, and Kaworu was nowhere to be seen – he tended to forget to tell anyone where he was going to half the time. Shinji was alone, without a living creature to keep him company; due to their erratic work schedules and lack of consensus on what should it be, they never had agreed on any pet.  
三天后，她仍然不理他，和某个随便的男人出去约会了。绫波去参加她的研究考察了，渚薰也不见踪影——他经常忘记告诉别人他要去哪里。真嗣独自一人，没有生物陪伴；由于他们不规律的工作时间和缺乏共识，他们从未就养宠物达成一致。

He sat in the balcony's doorway; the cup of tea he made for himself in a vain attempt to lift his mood stood there, ignored from the beginning. Shinji adjusted his position, felt a momentary resistance to his hand, and next thing he saw was the cup keeling over, losing its handle and spilling its already cold content on the whole balcony.  
他坐在阳台门口，为了提振心情而泡的一杯茶被他置之不理，从一开始就放在那里。真嗣调整了一下姿势，感觉到手上一瞬间的阻力，紧接着就看到杯子倾斜，把手脱落，里面的冷茶洒满了整个阳台。

_'__Great'_, he thought, _'__I can't even move without breaking simple things, let alone vital parts of my life'_. He sighed and went for a rag to clean up the mess. _'__At least the floor will be cleaner. I guess this is a plus.'_  
真糟糕', 他心想，'我连动一下都会打碎简单的东西，更别提生活中的重要部分了'。他叹了口气，去找抹布清理这摊狼藉。至少地板会干净些。我想这也算是个好处吧。'

Having done the cleaning without much thought given to it, he returned to his spot in the doorway. The moon was rising. Its red tint reset his train of thoughts to Asuka – her angry face, her red hair floating freely and surrounding her like a battle aura of a mythical Fury…  
心不在焉地完成了清洁工作后，他回到了门口的位置。月亮正在升起。它那红色的光晕让他的思绪回到了明日香——她生气的面孔，她自由飘扬的红发，宛如神话中复仇女神的战斗气场……

He blinked several times, trying his best not to release tears. It was, of course, futile. _'__I guess I'm not as strong as Asuka. She never cries… except from happiness'_, he thought. He closed his eyes tight and threw his head against the doorframe. Tears flowed slowly; he ignored them, listening to the wind and letting the images of angry Asuka roll before his eyes.  
他眨了几次眼，尽力不让泪水流出来。当然，这是徒劳的。我想我没有明日香那么坚强。她从不哭泣……除了因为幸福。”他想着，紧紧闭上眼睛，将头猛地撞向门框。泪水缓缓流淌；他无视它们，聆听着风声，让愤怒的明日香的形象在眼前浮现。

Shinji jumped and snapped his eyes open when he suddenly felt a touch. A familiar face of Kaworu, washed in lunar light, was looking at him with concern, his palm resting on his shoulder and feeling so warm…  
真嗣突然感到一阵触碰，吓了一跳，猛地睁开眼睛。熟悉的渚薰的面孔，在月光下显得苍白，正关切地看着他，手掌搭在他的肩膀上，感觉如此温暖……

Shinji wanted to say something, but found himself struggling to get out words. Kaworu just smiled and placed a finger on Shinji's lips. In total silence, disrupted only by the sound of their breathing, he sat himself next to Shinji, his warm hand still in place. He moved it only to gently pull Shinji to himself. Startled at first, Shinji turned his head…  
真嗣想说什么，却发现难以吐露字句。渚薰只是微笑着，将手指放在真嗣的唇上。在完全的寂静中，只有他们的呼吸声打破沉默，他坐在真嗣旁边，温暖的手依旧放在原处。他只是轻轻地将真嗣拉向自己。起初有些惊讶，真嗣转过头……

… and found himself staring into the red eyes, smile and warmth in them. Kaworu moved his lips in an inaudible whisper: _"__come to me."_ Shinji obeyed without thinking; realising that, he hesitated for a short moment, but his mind gave him no good reason not to submit. He found himself in warm embrace – only then realising how cold he was until now – and rested his head on Kaworu's chest. A moment later, Shinji felt a soft kiss on the top of his head.  
… 发现自己正凝视着那双红眸，眸中带着笑意与温暖。渚薰无声地动了动嘴唇，仿佛在说：“来到我身边。” 真嗣不假思索地顺从了；意识到这一点后，他短暂地犹豫了一下，但内心并未给出任何拒绝的理由。他发现自己被一个温暖的怀抱拥住——直到此刻才意识到自己之前有多么寒冷——他将头靠在渚薰的胸前。片刻之后，真嗣感觉到头顶传来一个轻柔的吻。

No words were spoken, but suddenly, he felt less lonely.  
没有言语交流，但突然间，他感到不再那么孤单。

It was the strangest comfort. But it was comfort, and in the end, it was all that mattered.  
这是一种奇怪的慰藉。但它是慰藉，最终，这正是最重要的。

_Present 现在_

'I suppose that was the night'  
'我想那就是那个夜晚'

, Shinji thought wistfully. _'__The night it clicked: friend, friend with party benefits, lover… it all somehow fit. Of course, I missed that, and I almost lost it. I was so confused then, too focused on Asuka to act on it.'_ He sighed. _'__As if I am less confused now; well, at least we're all in the open now. This should help communication.'_  
，真嗣感慨地想。那个夜晚一切都变得清晰：朋友，带有派对福利的朋友，恋人……这一切不知怎么地都契合了。当然，我错过了那个时刻，差点就失去了。那时我太困惑了，太专注于明日香而没有采取行动。'他叹了口气。仿佛我现在就不困惑似的；好吧，至少我们现在都坦诚相见了。这应该有助于沟通。'

Things will change – of this Shinji was certain. But for the first time in years, he was not that afraid of the coming change.  
事情将会改变——对此，真嗣深信不疑。但时隔多年，他第一次不再那么害怕即将到来的变化。

Four of us - part 2.  
我们四人 - 第二部分。

Subject of Shinji's musings was not asleep, despite the appearances. Rei was not deceived – it was nearly impossible to hide one's condition from her perception, especially when she knew the person in question well and had them at hand – but she was content with caressing him and staring in the distance, lost in her own thoughts. He welcomed the caresses – physical contact has always been pleasant to him. No, not just pleasant – even after so many years, he was hungry for it – be it a handshake, a hug from someone who did not conform to Japanese no-touching taboo, a cuddly movie evening with his lovers, or full-blown sex. This has led him on a long streak of short-to-medium relationships and one-night stands in few years after the War – none of them truly satisfying despite being pleasant and quenching his appetite for affection. In the end, he found himself entangled deeper and deeper into relationship with people that have always been closest to him.  
真嗣沉思的对象并未入睡，尽管外表如此。丽并未被蒙骗——几乎不可能在她敏锐的感知下隐藏自己的状态，尤其是当她对那个人非常了解且近在咫尺时——但她满足于轻抚他，凝视远方，沉浸在自己的思绪中。他欣然接受这些抚摸——身体接触对他来说总是愉悦的。不，不仅仅是愉悦——即便过了这么多年，他依然渴望着这种接触——无论是握手、来自不拘泥于日本非接触禁忌之人的拥抱、与爱人们依偎在一起看电影的夜晚，还是激情四溢的性爱。这导致他在战争结束后的几年里，经历了一系列短暂至中期的恋情和一夜情——尽管这些经历愉快且暂时满足了他对情感的渴望，但终究未能真正令他满足。最终，他发现自己与那些一直最亲近的人陷入了越来越深的纠葛之中。

Despite this closeness, Kaworu felt slightly out of place in this new marital arrangement. He did love his spouses, even if he was still in the process of learning what that feeling entailed; and he took the passionate proposal speech of Asuka to his heart. The words and the emotions behind them were still there, warming him up and making him smile every time he thought of that moment. He agreed – on the rational level, at least – with everything Asuka had said, but on the other hand, the facts were clear: his connection to each of them was not as strong as theirs with each other. Shinji and Asuka knew each other for the longest time of them all; they were connected since they met – even accounting for on-and-off nature of their relationship, which was never **that** off, according to what Asuka told him – and he saw their bond as the strongest of all the ties that tied four of them. Rei was connected to both of them as well, in a manner he never truly understood, but never dared to doubt. On his part, he saw himself as linked with Rei – due to their shared nature, not to mention owing her his life – but his link with Asuka and Shinji was far less pronounced.  
尽管如此亲密，在这新的婚姻安排中，渚薰仍感到些许格格不入。他确实深爱着他的伴侣们，即便他还在学习这种情感的真正含义；而明日香那充满激情的求婚誓言，他铭记于心。那些话语及其背后的情感依旧存在，温暖着他，令他每每想起那一刻都会微笑。至少在理性层面，他认同明日香所说的一切，但另一方面，事实显而易见：他与他们之间的联系，并不如他们彼此间的那么紧密。真嗣和明日香相识最久；自相遇起，他们便紧密相连——即便考虑到他们关系时好时坏的特性，据明日香所言，其实从未真正疏远——在他看来，他们之间的纽带是最为牢固的。丽与他们两人同样有着不解之缘，尽管他从未真正理解，却从未怀疑过。至于他自己，他认为与丽因共性而紧密相连——更不用说她还救过他的命——但他与明日香和真嗣的联系则远没有那么明显。

_'Still, she sounded convinced that she was right, that she loved me… and when I tried to protest… well, I got yelled at. Affectionately, I assume, considering what happened later.'_ He learned – through a lot of confusion and miscommunication, followed by long and thorough analysis – how to distinguish Asuka's displays of genuine anger from her showing affection via similar angry outbursts. The success rate was still far from 100% that would satisfy him and allow to avoid incorrect reactions, but he was getting there. Once, he envied Shinji who seemed to be able to tell those apart perfectly; but once he asked for suggestions, he found out that there are far more shades than he ever thought possible.  
尽管如此，她听起来坚信自己是对的，她爱我……而当我试图反驳时……好吧，我被吼了。考虑到后来发生的事，我想那是带着爱意的。他通过大量的困惑和误解，随后进行漫长而彻底的分析，学会了如何区分明日香真正的愤怒和她以类似愤怒爆发来表达爱意的行为。成功率仍远未达到让他满意并避免错误反应的 100%，但他正在进步。曾经，他羡慕真嗣似乎能完美区分这两者；但当他寻求建议时，才发现这其中远比他想象的要复杂得多。

_"I can usually tell between 'I'm angry, stay away' and 'I'm angry, hug me'"_ – Kaworu recalled Shinji's answer – _"but there can be 'I'm angry, I don't know what to do with myself', 'I look fine, but I am few seconds from screaming'… of course, 'I'm angry and don't want to know you' is on the list as well, but this is something you needn't to worry about"_ – Shinji's smile was heartbreakingly sad when he tried to say the last one as it was a joke. All in all, this conversation did not help Kaworu understand Asuka.  
“我通常能分辨出‘我很生气，离我远点’和‘我很生气，抱抱我’之间的区别”—— Kaworu 回想起 Shinji 的回答——“但还有‘我很生气，我不知道该怎么办’，‘我看起来没事，但我随时可能尖叫’……当然，‘我很生气，不想理你’也在列表上，但这点你不必担心”——当 Shinji 试图以玩笑的口吻说出最后一句时，他的微笑令人心碎地悲伤。总的来说，这次对话并没有帮助 Kaworu 理解 Asuka。

But it did help him understand Shinji, who was no less important to him, and no less an enigma. Just a quieter one, one where pain was concealed beneath courtesy, kind smile, and overall please-don't-mind-me attitude. He understood that Japanese culture encouraged this kind of concealment, and he saw it often in Japanese people – but Shinji was not merely following his cultural programming – he raised it to a level of art. An art Kaworu did not appreciate.  
但它确实帮助他理解了 Shinji，对他来说同样重要，也同样是个谜。只是更安静，痛苦隐藏在礼貌、友好的微笑和请不要介意我的态度之下。他明白日本文化鼓励这种隐藏，他也经常在日本人身上看到这一点——但 Shinji 不仅仅是遵循他的文化编程——他将这种隐藏提升到了艺术的境界。一种 Kaworu 并不欣赏的艺术。

He preferred other kinds of art Shinji practiced. His cooking was unparalleled; this, aside being close to people he considered the family he ever had, was the greatest advantage of all Pilots living together. His love of music helped him make his decision, and in somewhat roundabout way, saved Kaworu's life. Aside that, those hands of a musician were a wonder in so many other circumstances…  
他更偏爱真嗣所练习的其他艺术形式。他的厨艺无人能及；除此之外，与他认为的家人——那些他一直拥有的亲人——亲密相处，是所有驾驶员共同生活最大的好处。他对音乐的热爱帮助他做出了决定，并以一种迂回的方式，拯救了渚薰的生命。此外，这位音乐家的双手在许多其他场合也是奇迹般的存在……

He stopped his train of thought before it went too far and deprived him of blood to the brain. _'Not now, please. Now is not the time. I am absolutely sure there will be plenty of opportunity for that later. Back. Back on track, please.'_  
他在思绪走得太远、导致大脑供血不足之前停了下来。'现在不行，拜托。现在不是时候。我绝对相信以后会有很多机会。回到正轨，拜托了。'

His brain begrudgingly obeyed.  
他的大脑不情愿地服从了。

Bonds. Initially, he saw humans – Lilim, as he called them then – as always alone, forced to live eternally separated from each other behind their AT Fields. Later, he learned it was not the truth – some were like that, but then he saw bonds that tied them.  
羁绊。起初，他将人类——那时他称之为莉莉姆——视为总是孤独的存在，被迫永远隔绝在各自的 AT 力场之后，彼此分离。后来，他了解到这并非真相——有些人确实如此，但他也见证了那些将他们紧密相连的羁绊。

And then he started to experience them himself.  
随后，他开始亲自体验这些羁绊。

It was hard to pinpoint which bond was the first. It could either be with Rei or Shinji; once one of those bonds formed, the other followed pretty soon. He knew of Shinji first, before coming to Tokyo-3, but the genuine connections – truly human emotions – came later. And along came confusion, problems with labelling what he felt, and the general chaos of the War giving him little time to introspect. The Call and his initial reason for existence did not help things. Only when the end of the War drew closer, Rei saved him from the Call, and they spent the first night together.  
很难确定哪一段羁绊是最初的。可能是与绫波或真嗣之间的；一旦其中一段羁绊形成，另一段也很快随之而来。他在来到第三新东京市之前就听说过真嗣，但真正的联系——真正的人类情感——是在那之后才出现的。随之而来的是困惑，对自身感受的标签化难题，以及战争带来的混乱让他几乎没有时间进行内省。召唤和他最初的存在理由也未能让事情变得简单。直到战争接近尾声，绫波将他从召唤中解救出来，他们共度了第一个夜晚。

That was one of the strangest and fondest memories, one he tended not to think of too often – at least not in public. First time he was truly intimate with someone on so many different levels it made his head spin. It did make him dizzy even now.  
那是他最奇异也最温馨的记忆之一，他并不常想起——至少不在公共场合。第一次在如此多层面上与某人真正亲密，让他头晕目眩。即便现在，这仍让他感到眩晕。

He took a deep breath and tried to re-focus. _'I am the Angel of Free Will. I choose'_, he chuckled internally, a grim streak tainting that thought. There were times where those words meant difference between life and death – not only to him, but to entire human race.  
他深吸一口气，试图重新集中注意力。'我是自由意志的天使。我选择'，他在内心自嘲，一丝阴郁染上了这个念头。有些时候，这些话意味着生死之别——不仅对他，对整个人类种族亦是如此。

Those times were thing of the past, thanks to Rei; thanks to Asuka and Shinji as well. Thanks to others that were now his friends. He tended to think – and say – that his participation in the victory was minimal, that he was actually one of the problems, but they usually responded with listing the ways he helped save everyone. _'I walked the strangest road: from being incarnation of doom and tool of their demise to their lover, their husband. How strong a bond is needed for that to happen?'_, he mused sometimes. Today, he knew the answer.  
多亏了丽；多亏了明日香和真嗣。也多亏了现在成为他朋友的其他人。他倾向于认为——并说——自己在胜利中的参与微不足道，实际上他曾是问题之一，但他们通常会列举他如何帮助拯救了所有人。'我走了一条最奇特的路：从毁灭的化身、他们的灭亡工具，到他们的爱人、他们的丈夫。需要多么强大的纽带才能实现这一切？'他有时会沉思。今天，他知道了答案。

In comparison to what tied him to Rei and Shinji, his connection to Asuka was easier to map out. It started with her being suspicious and him being destined to kill her along with rest of the humanity; it then moved into comradeship of arms from being Pilots – and eventually co-conspirators; then, it turned into genuine friendship after the war. Eventually, friendship turned into friendship with occasional benefits.  
相较于他与丽和真嗣之间的羁绊，他与明日香的关系更容易梳理。起初，她对他充满怀疑，而他注定要与她及全人类为敌；随后，从作为驾驶员的战友关系发展为共谋者；最终，战后他们建立了真挚的友谊。最终，这份友谊演变成了偶尔互惠的友情。

And then they got married.  
然后他们结婚了。

_'If anyone ever tries to make our lives into a screenplay, no one would consider it for realisation. It's too inane, too improbable, too… optimistic and dark at the same time?'_, he thought with amusement. _'I can imagine that: "The characters are too complex, the setting too dark, plot twists are improbable, and this conspiracy! Unrealistic!" And that before even we get into the post-War part – us coming together, breaking up, and coming together again. Rinsing and repeating. Any responsible studio would file it under "soap opera", classify it as "young adult romance", or refuse to touch it altogether for the same reason – unrealistic!'_  
‘如果有人试图将我们的生活改编成剧本，没人会考虑将其搬上银幕。它太荒谬、太不可能、同时又太乐观和黑暗了？’他带着一丝戏谑想道。‘我可以想象：“角色过于复杂，背景过于黑暗，情节转折难以置信，还有这阴谋！不切实际！”而这些还只是战前的部分——我们走到一起，分手，又复合。反复循环。任何负责任的制片厂都会将其归类为“肥皂剧”，标为“青少年浪漫”，或干脆拒绝触碰，理由相同——不切实际！’

'Well, at least it ended with a marriage, didn't it?'  
“好吧，至少是以一场婚礼收场，不是吗？”

, he smiled internally. It was amusing to think of his life as a fairy tale. A grim one, like the German fairy tales of old, but still a fairy tale. _'No… not exactly ended. Something ended, but the tale did not'_, he corrected himself.  
，他在心里微笑。把自己的生活想象成一个童话故事，这很有趣。一个阴暗的童话，就像古老的德国童话那样，但仍然是个童话。“不……并不完全是结束。有些事情结束了，但故事并未终结”，他纠正自己。

_'For better or worse, I am now one of them'_, he thought, relaxing and shifting to a more comfortable – if less pleasant – position. That was one of the few things he was certain of. With that thought, he allowed himself to drift to sleep.  
“无论是好是坏，我现在是他们中的一员了”，他想，放松下来，调整到一个更舒适——尽管不那么愉快——的姿势。这是他为数不多确信的事情之一。带着这个念头，他让自己渐渐入睡。

Kaworu moved and straightened; his head was no longer in Rei's lap: now he was sitting straight on his seat, head tilted back. Rei smiled at him; change in position made him seek a different point of contact – reflexively or consciously, he took her hand, their fingers now intertwined. Seeing no reason to disturb him, she turned her attention back to the outside.  
渚薰移动并坐直了身子；他的头不再枕在绫波的腿上：现在他笔直地坐在座位上，头向后仰。绫波对他微笑；位置的改变使他寻求不同的接触点——本能地或是有意识地，他握住了她的手，两人的手指交缠在一起。看到没有理由打扰他，她将注意力转回到外面。

Rei was happy. Of course, it did not show much on her reserved exterior, but she felt the persistent and growing warmth inside her. Actually, most of her free-floating thoughts at the moment were about exploring her current states and sensations, both physical and mental. They were numerous, and none of them was negative.  
绫波感到快乐。当然，这在她矜持的外表上并没有太多显现，但她内心感受到了持续增长的温暖。实际上，她此刻大部分的自由浮动思绪都是关于探索她当前的状态和感觉，无论是身体上的还是心理上的。它们数量众多，且无一负面。

The emotional satisfaction and residual giddiness from happiness overload she suffered – no, enjoyed – after realising the marriage and subsequent 'scientific experiments' she conducted with her now-spouses. This was certainly going to last, especially that now she had means to reignite that state with just a touch; she squeezed Kaworu's hand on that thought and had hers squeezed back in a soft, relaxed manner; clearly a reflex, not a conscious effort.  
情感上的满足和因幸福过度而残留的兴奋感，她经历——不，享受——了意识到婚姻以及随后与现在的配偶进行的'科学实验'。这肯定会持续下去，尤其是现在她只需一个触碰就能重新点燃那种状态；她想到这一点时紧了紧渚薰的手，而他的手也以柔软、放松的方式回握了她；显然是反射性的，并非有意识的努力。

Warmth coming from bond between all four of them being in close proximity; this was going to return every time they are close, and she knew this was something to cherish. Rei sometimes pitied the limited senses of others, unable to perceive bonds as she did; on the other hand, she envied their ability to express their emotions and reach beyond their self, reach to each other. _'A different set of skills, complementing each other'_ was how she thought of that difference between herself and her loved ones.  
四人紧密相连的羁绊所带来的温暖；每当他们靠近时，这份温暖总会回归，她深知这是值得珍惜的。丽有时会怜悯他人有限的感知能力，无法像她那样感受到羁绊；但另一方面，她又羡慕他们能表达情感，超越自我，触及彼此。她认为这种差异是‘互补的技能’，是她与所爱之人之间的不同之处。

Slight soreness of her skin around the newly tattooed wings on her back and Asuka's name on her face. This will pass; she already researched the proper way to take care of fresh tattoos and was eagerly awaiting the opportunity to take care of everyone's skin – and have them take care of hers. And while the soreness may pass, the tattoos shall remain.  
背部新纹的翅膀和脸上明日香的名字周围皮肤微微的酸痛。这会过去的；她已经研究了如何妥善护理新纹身，并热切期待着照顾大家皮肤的机会——也让大家照顾她的。尽管酸痛会消退，但纹身将永远留存。

The sensation in her nether parts that was a result from her kindly asking Asuka to make good on her promise to get her out of her clothes last night – and to let her apologise for the mischievousness during the day. This, along with other little marks on her body, will pass quickly… but Rei was looking forward to those sensations returning, in various configurations and with similar emotional meaning.  
昨晚她好心请求明日香兑现帮她脱掉衣服的承诺——并让她为白天的恶作剧道歉——所带来的下体感觉。这些，连同她身体上的其他小痕迹，很快就会消失……但绫波期待着这些感觉以各种形式和相似的情感意义回归。

The feeling of being loved and claimed – coming from all of the above. This was certainly going to last; she knew from observation – and her limited experience – that feelings change, mutate, differ over time – but if cared for, last. The vows they spoke, the markings on their skins, the acceptance of the circumstances they expressed in the end… All this made Rei feel as she truly _belonged_ to them, that she was truly _claimed_ by her lovers and now-spouses.  
被爱和被占有的感觉——源自上述所有。这肯定会持续下去；她从观察和有限的体验中知道，感情会变化、变异、随时间不同——但如果被珍惜，就会持久。他们说出的誓言，他们皮肤上的标记，他们最终表达的接受环境的态度……这一切让绫波感到她真正属于他们，她真的被她的爱人和现在的配偶所占有。

Rei suddenly realised that made her aroused to a surprising degree. Granted, in the last few years, sex gradually became something familiar to her, and she was no stranger to feeling arousal. Nonetheless, the intensity of feeling that accompanied the thought of belonging to people she loved was something new and unexpected.  
绫波突然意识到这让她异常兴奋。诚然，在过去几年里，性逐渐成为她熟悉的事物，她对感到兴奋并不陌生。然而，想到属于她所爱的人所带来的强烈感觉是新的和意想不到的。

Rei shelved thoughts on that for later consideration, as something certainly worth exploring; but this was hardly the place to do so. While she trusted her body and mind to exercise restraint, she had other – safer – subjects to think of. Subjects of feelings, first and foremost: remaining physical sensations she was feeling were simple things, easily alleviated or augmented as she saw fit.  
丽将这些想法暂时搁置，留待日后深思，因为这无疑是值得探究的；但眼下显然不是合适的场合。尽管她相信自己的身心能够保持克制，但她还有其他——更安全的——话题可以思考。首先是情感方面的主题：她所感受到的残留身体感觉都是些简单的事物，可以轻易缓解或增强，全凭她的意愿。

But the matter of the bonds… this was simultaneously simple and complicated. Simple, because she loved them all, they loved her back, and they were now married, with sense of permanency augmented by the tattoos.  
但关于这些羁绊的问题……这既是简单的又是复杂的。简单，是因为她爱他们每一个人，他们也爱她，而且他们现在已经结婚了，通过纹身增强了这种永久性的感觉。

Complicated, because the thought process that was trying to differentiate types of love she felt for each of her spouses repeatedly led to confusion. Asuka was expressive in her speech – Rei actually lacked an adjective to describe the sheer force of emotion behind Asuka's words – but did not provide much useful data towards naming the feelings and telling them apart. While synthetic part of Rei's mind had no problem with the amalgamation of emotions she felt, and practical part simply accepted them and rolled on, the analytical side relentlessly tried to understand the situation on its own terms.  
复杂，因为她试图区分对每位配偶所感受到的不同类型的爱，这一思考过程反复导致困惑。明日香在言语中表现得非常直白——实际上，绫波找不到一个形容词来描述明日香话语背后那股强烈的情感力量——但她并没有提供太多有用的数据来命名这些感觉并区分它们。尽管绫波的合成思维部分对这些混合的情感处理得游刃有余，实际部分则简单地接受并继续前行，但分析性的一面却不断试图用自己的方式理解这一情况。

So far, it failed. 到目前为止，它失败了。

Rei's thoughts drifted off from the analysis, focusing on the proposal speech itself. While, as all then-intoxicated participants, she could only remember the recording of the event; on the other hand, she was certain that while none of the present remember the event, her mind must have preserved at least the emotional part of it, if not more. The state of elation she felt while watching the video was familiar to her, a kind of déja vu, despite of not feeling like this before. _'Maybe, if I search long enough, I can find it?'_, she mused. It was another thing to consider sooner or later.  
丽的心情从分析中飘散，专注于提案演讲本身。虽然，像所有当时醉酒的参与者一样，她只能记得事件的录像；另一方面，她确信尽管在场的人都不记得那次事件，但她的记忆一定保留了至少情感部分，甚至更多。观看视频时她感受到的兴奋状态对她来说是熟悉的，一种似曾相识的感觉，尽管以前从未有过这种感觉。'也许，如果我寻找得足够久，我能找到它？'她沉思着。这是迟早要考虑的另一件事。

A skein of geese came into view, providing a momentary distraction. Traveling in concert, following simple rules that organised them, focused on a distant goal. Rei blinked, her train of thought interrupted by the observation her mind recorded and filed away. Another train of thought entered to the vacated mindspace.  
一群大雁映入眼帘，提供了片刻的分散注意。它们协调一致地旅行，遵循简单的规则组织自己，专注于遥远的目标。丽眨了眨眼，她的思绪被观察到并记录在脑海中的景象打断。另一条思绪进入了空出的思维空间。

Asuka even called Rei a "goddess". A term Rei was not used to hear. _"Promising student"_, yes, from her teachers. _"Brilliant"_, for sure, from many. _"Fucking doll"_ was, fortunately, thing of the past, but _"cold and distant"_, _"beautiful, but inaccessible"_, or the old _"ice queen"_ still happened sometimes, used behind her back by people unaware of her acute senses. People she worked with on her research projects knew her well enough, but even they had had to adjust, and often failed to read her correctly, sometimes resulting in misunderstandings. _"Ayanami is fine to approach, but don't break her focus unless you need something urgent. Talk to her when she is not working"_ has become something of a mantra, an axiom given to people new to the research team. They usually listened, and gradually realised she could be talked to. _'But do they really understand? Did they really care?'_, Rei pondered, not for the first time. For most of the time, the answer was _"no, and I think I would like them to"_. Now, this answer was changing. The new one was still nebulous, but it was close to _"no, I have now people who understand, and the rest of the world matters less"_.  
明日香甚至称绫波为“女神”。这个称呼是绫波不习惯听到的。“有前途的学生”，是的，来自她的老师们。“才华横溢”，毫无疑问，来自许多人。“该死的玩偶”，幸运的是，已成为过去，但“冷漠疏远”，“美丽却遥不可及”，或是老套的“冰山女王”仍偶尔出现，被那些不知她敏锐感知的人在背后使用。与她在研究项目中合作的人对她足够了解，但即便他们也需适应，并常常未能正确解读她，有时导致误解。“绫波可以接近，但除非有紧急事务，否则不要打断她的专注。在她不工作时与她交谈”已成为一种口头禅，给予新加入研究团队的人的公理。他们通常会听从，并逐渐意识到她是可以交谈的。“但他们真的理解吗？他们真的在乎吗？”绫波思索着，并非首次。大多数时候，答案是“不，我想我会希望他们理解”。现在，这个答案正在改变。新的答案仍模糊不清，但接近于“不，我现在有了理解我的人，其余的世界变得不那么重要了”。

Rei was aware of dangers that lie on that path, but for now, she was content she could allow herself the freedom to think like this. She would have hated being called _"Wondergirl"_ in the past – if she has had been able to feel that in her then-condition – but now, this label was a term of endearment. She giggled when she recalled one of the times Asuka called her that. _"Wonder…girl… you r'lly work wonder with that t–", Asuka managed to get out, rest of the sentence cut off by an inarticulate moan. "Kkkkeep ittt upp" was all the redhead was able to say afterwards. Rei was pleased – her research has proven valuable and effective in bringing comfort to a woman she loved._ It was a night brought by unfortunate circumstances – another break-up, Asuka feeling stupid about it, but refusing to admit it – but it had a few good moments.  
丽知道那条路上潜藏着危险，但此刻，她满足于自己能这样自由地思考。过去，如果她能在当时的状态下感受到，她会讨厌被称为“奇迹女孩”，但现在，这个标签成了亲昵的称呼。她想起阿斯纳叫她那次，不禁轻笑出声。“奇迹……女孩……你真的用那……”阿斯纳勉强说出，后半句被含糊的呻吟打断。“继续……”红发女孩只能如此回应。丽感到欣慰——她的研究证明是有价值且有效的，为心爱的女人带来了安慰。那是个由不幸境遇带来的夜晚——又一次分手，阿斯纳为此感到愚蠢，却又不愿承认——但其中也有几个美好的瞬间。

A goddess. That term that was technically correct, for a given definition of divinity – not that she felt very divine. Rei could not stop wondering what exactly prompted Asuka to use it in that specific case. Of course, a very probable reason was _"because I could, it felt right at the time, and it fits you perfectly, so don't dissect it, Wondergirl"_; if asked, Asuka would likely provide that answer. Yet Rei knew that motivations could often laid in subconsciousness, and the could be something more behind it. _'This is another thing for later consideration – and actually ask my dear wife for explanation'_, Rei thought and silently giggled at the term. Sliding into new labels for her now-spouses came easy to her. This was a complicated subject before the wedding; the labels often changed, not only in regard to her. Shinji to Asuka could be _boyfriend_ at one point, _that-idiot-I-am-not-talking-to-and-about_ in the other, and _my best fucktoy_ few days after. For her it was a bit easier: Asuka was usually _friend_, sometimes someone between _lover_ and _friend-with-benefits_; Rei to Asuka was _friend_, _lover_, or _lovely pillow_, as she called Rei in affectionate, afterglow-tinted pillow talk after seeking comfort in her arms. Shinji was also _friend_, sometimes maybe _boyfriend_ – if they dated long enough to justify the term, of which Rei was never sure. Kaworu was always _friend_, although he tended to call her _my saviour_, a term Rei was vaguely uncomfortable with for several reasons. _'I guess I could call him "friend-with-benefits at times", but this felt too… specific, too… limiting'_, she mused over several times they shared a bed, celebrating the simple joy of life. It never developed into a steady relationship, but they always remained close – and retained the habit when time and other relationships permitted.  
女神。这个术语在某种定义下是正确的，尽管她并不觉得自己有多神圣。丽无法停止思考，究竟是什么促使明日香在那个特定场合使用这个词。当然，一个很可能的原因是“因为我当时觉得合适，而且它完全适合你，所以别深究了，小姑娘”；如果问起，明日香很可能会这么回答。然而，丽知道动机往往潜藏在潜意识中，背后可能还有更多含义。“这又是以后需要考虑的事情——实际上，我得问问亲爱的妻子解释一下。”丽暗自发笑，对于现在称呼她的新伴侣们的新标签，她已经驾轻就熟。这在婚礼前是个复杂的课题；标签时常变化，不仅对她而言。对明日香来说，真嗣在某一刻可能是男朋友，另一刻则是那个我绝不理睬和谈论的笨蛋，几天后又成了我的最佳玩物。 对她来说，这稍微简单些：明日香通常是朋友，有时介于恋人与炮友之间；对明日香而言，绫波既是朋友、恋人，也是她亲昵地称为“可爱的枕头”的存在，尤其是在寻求安慰后依偎在她怀中，带着余韵的枕边细语时。真嗣也是朋友，有时或许是男友——如果他们约会足够久，久到能称得上这个身份的话，对此绫波从未确定过。渚总是朋友，尽管他常称她为“我的救星”，这个称呼让绫波因多种原因而感到些许不适。“我想我有时可以称他为‘有时是炮友’，但这感觉太……具体，太……局限了。”她多次思索着他们共枕时庆祝生命简单喜悦的情景。他们的关系从未稳定发展，但始终保持亲密——并在时间和其它关系允许的情况下保留这一习惯。

Now it all became simple. Asuka was her _wife_, Kaworu and Shinji were her _husbands_. They had her last name, and she had their names inscribed on her flesh. She was theirs.  
如今一切变得简单明了。明日香是她的妻子，渚和真嗣是她的丈夫。他们共享她的姓氏，而她的肌肤上刻着他们的名字。她是他们的。

Rei realised a bit too late that there was a good reason she shelved that train of thought. She started to feel a bit funny, and raising her hand to her cheek, she realised she was blushing – hard. _'It's ironic that of all body functions, arousal is one that does not submit to control as much as I would like it to'_, she thought while taking deep breaths. She heard a murmur of protest from Kaworu next to her, and realised she squeezed his hand – hard. She forced another exhale, calming herself a bit, and relaxed the grip. While Kaworu's body was resilient, her own strength could easily prove a match to his resilience – and a medical emergency was the last thing they needed to add to their trouble.  
丽意识到有点晚了，她搁置那个思绪是有充分理由的。她开始感到有些异样，抬起手摸向脸颊，发现自己脸红了——很红。'讽刺的是，在所有身体功能中，性唤起是我无法像希望的那样控制自如的'，她一边深呼吸一边想。她听到身旁的渚发出一声低沉的抗议，意识到自己紧紧握住了他的手——很紧。她强迫自己再次呼气，稍微平复了一下心情，放松了握力。虽然渚的身体很坚韧，但她的力量很容易就能与他相匹敌——他们最不需要的就是再加上一场医疗紧急情况。

Rei's accelerated breathing did not remain unnoticed. A concerned eye peeked between the seats. "Rei? Are you all right?", Shinji inquired from his seat. "You seem… hot", he added in a worried tone.  
丽的急促呼吸没有被忽视。一双关切的眼睛从座位间窥视过来。"丽？你还好吗？"，真嗣从座位上问道。"你看起来……很热"，他担忧地补充道。

'Well, thank you' was something that sprang to Rei's mind as first response. She chided herself at this – this was not a laughing situation: Shinji was clearly worried, and a joke would be inappropriate. "I am… fine. Just a little…", Rei stumbled at lack of proper description; on one hand, she did not want to elaborate on her situation, not in a public place; on the other, she did not like to lie, especially to someone so close to her as Shinji was.  
“嗯，谢谢你”是丽脑海中首先浮现的回应。她随即责备自己——这可不是开玩笑的场合：真嗣显然很担心，开个玩笑显然不合适。“我……没事。只是有点……”，丽因找不到合适的描述而结巴；一方面，她不想在公共场合详述自己的情况；另一方面，她不喜欢撒谎，尤其是对真嗣这样亲近的人。

She noticed some fumbling in the seats before her, some hushed voices, and Asuka's unconscious sounds of protest. Before she could act on it, Shinji was kneeling in his seat, reaching to touch her face. She blushed harder.  
她注意到前排座位上的摸索声，一些低语，以及明日香无意识的抗议声。还没等她有所反应，真嗣已经跪在自己的座位上，伸手去触摸她的脸颊。她的脸更红了。

"Rei? You **are** hot", he repeated.  
“丽？你发烧了”，他重复道。

"Ebue", another voice joined in incoherently. "Of course she izz…", half-conscious female voice joined the discussion. "White-searing hot, actually, and she could… oi, wait, what is going on?", Asuka shook her grogginess and jumped up, joining Shinji in doting over Rei.  
"Ebue", 另一个声音含糊地加入进来。"当然她很……", 一个半清醒的女性声音加入了讨论。"其实是白热化的热度，而且她能……哎，等等，这是怎么回事？", 明日香摇了摇头，摆脱了昏沉，跳起来，和真嗣一起关心着绫波。

Rei was now blushing more from the embarrassment on the commotion she caused: "Please, nothing is going on", she protested, "I am fine", she inhaled and exhaled again. "I am little flustered, that is all." She paused for a moment: "I promise I will explain that later", she added in smaller voice.  
绫波现在因为自己引起的骚动而更加脸红："请，没什么事", 她抗议道，"我很好", 她深吸了一口气，又呼出来。"我只是有点慌张，仅此而已。"她停顿了一下："我保证稍后会解释", 她用更小的声音补充道。

Asuka and Shinji exchanged looks. "All right", Asuka agreed reluctantly. "You know best." After a pause, she added with a grin "but you **do** look hot with that blush". In response, Rei made a motion to hide from their eyes; regrettably, limited space of a plane seat gave her little options. She could only hide her head in her shoulders and drop her eyes. Shinji giggled at the sight: "I must agree with Asuka here, it's a rare but a welcome sight to see you blush to that degree."  
明日香和真嗣交换了一下眼神。"好吧", 明日香勉强同意道。"你最清楚。"停顿了一下，她笑着补充说 "但你脸红的样子确实很迷人"。对此，绫波试图躲避他们的目光；遗憾的是，飞机座位空间有限，她几乎没有选择。她只能把头埋在肩膀里，垂下眼睛。真嗣看到这一幕笑了："我必须同意明日香的说法，看到你脸红到这种程度，虽然罕见但很受欢迎。"

Rei looked up at them with exasperation and a silent plea for release from their attention. A treacherous thought in her mind chimed in: _'and I am going to explain this blush to them, and tell them how to cause it, won't I?'_ In reaction, she facepalmed softly with her free hand. "Thank you, but you are **not**helping", she muttered from behind the palm. On that cue, she noticed a stir in a seat next to her.  
丽抬头看着他们，眼中满是无奈，无声地恳求他们放过自己。一个狡猾的念头在她脑海中响起：‘我还要向他们解释这脸红的原因，告诉他们如何引发，不是吗？’想到这里，她用空着的那只手轻轻捂住脸。“谢谢，但你们真帮不上忙”，她从手掌后低声嘟囔。就在这时，她注意到旁边座位上有了动静。

"Is there some discussion I am being left out of?", Kaworu asked in a sleepy voice. Shinji and Asuka exchanged looks again: "Actually, there is", Shinji confirmed. "And your opinion is actually direly needed", she added with a tiny wry smile.  
“有什么讨论是我被排除在外的吗？”薰用慵懒的声音问道。真嗣和明日香再次交换了眼神：“实际上，确实有，”真嗣确认道。“而且你的意见真的非常需要，”她补充道，嘴角勾起一丝微妙的笑意。

Rei hid her face under her palm as best as she could and let out a small groan.  
丽尽可能地将脸埋在手掌下，发出一声轻微的呻吟。

Four of us – part 3.  
我们四人 – 第三部分。

"Asuka, I refuse to bite that bait, I will not answer that question!", Shinji protested as vehemently as he could without raising his voice and causing undue commotion. "You're putting me in a corner here, **and you know it**!"  
"明日香，我拒绝上钩，我不会回答那个问题！" 真嗣尽可能激烈地抗议，但没有提高声音引起不必要的骚动。"你这是在逼我，你自己也清楚！"

"I know. It is always fun to see you squirm. And I perfectly know the answer, anyway", Asuka grinned at him and received an exasperated glare in return. Kaworu had a thoughtful expression on his face – or at least he tried to, because smile was creeping in despite his best attempts to hide it. Rei was doing what she could – at least without resorting to her less mundane abilities – to hide on her seat: she slumped and concealed her blushing face in her hands.  
"我知道。看你挣扎总是很有趣。而且我无论如何都知道答案。" 明日香对他咧嘴一笑，换来了一个恼怒的瞪视。薰脸上带着沉思的表情——或者至少他试图如此，因为笑容还是不自觉地爬上了他的脸。丽正在尽力——至少没有动用她那些不寻常的能力——隐藏自己：她蜷缩着，用手遮住了脸颊上的红晕。

"Could we _not_? Please?", she pleaded with her voice tiny and muffled. Asuka just looked at her and stated with a grin: "You look so adorable I could kiss you senseless." Another small groan was all she received in response, prompting a giggle. "Absolutely adorable. All right", she turned her attention to Shinji. "If you refuse to answer my question, I shall exact retribution!" She sank to her seat and pulled Shinji down to his. Next thing he felt was her arm across him and her lips on his, soon followed by a tongue in his mouth. Teeth joined soon after.  
"我们能不能不这样？求你了？"她声音细小而含糊地恳求道。明日香只是看着她，咧嘴一笑："你看起来太可爱了，我真想吻得你神志不清。"她只得到了一声轻微的呻吟作为回应，这让她不禁轻笑出声。"绝对可爱。好吧"，她转向真嗣，"如果你拒绝回答我的问题，我可要报复了！"她坐下并将真嗣拉到自己身边。紧接着，他感觉到她的手臂环绕着他，她的唇贴上了他的，很快一条舌头探入了他的口中。随后，牙齿也加入了进来。

Shinji relented. His girlfriend – no, his _wife_ – has returned to the known phase, known as 'maniacally in love with you and making out with you whenever I feel like it'. He could only hope it will not turn into 'stay the fuck away from me' too soon.  
真嗣屈服了。他的女朋友——不，他的妻子——已经回到了那个被称为'疯狂地爱着你，随时随地都想和你亲热'的已知阶段。他只能希望这不会太快变成'离我远点'。

Misato has been watching this scene from her seat for a while now; Asuka asking _"__who is the most beautiful woman you know?"_ could be easily an attempt to start an argument, and she was relieved when it proved to be merely Asuka's way to tease Shinji.  
美里已经从她的座位上观察这一幕好一会儿了；明日香问"你认识的最美的女人是谁？"很容易被看作是挑起争吵的尝试，当发现这只是明日香逗弄真嗣的方式时，她松了一口气。

She sighed discreetly. _'__This whole trip has been a rollercoaster – and the ride is not over yet_', she though, mixed feelings making her more troubled than she would admit. Misato was aware that her kids – she still could not shake that thinking about them, their independence be damned – were in for far more emotional turmoil than they realised.  
她谨慎地叹了口气。这次旅行就像过山车一样——而且还没结束呢',她想着，复杂的情绪让她比愿意承认的更加困扰。美里知道，她的孩子们——她还是无法摆脱这种想法，他们的独立性就先不管了——将会面临比他们意识到的更多的情感动荡。

She knew enough of their love life to be aware that the current arrangement was likely for the best – this marriage, assuming they all accept it in the end, had a chance to eliminate a lot of break-up and come-back messes that weighed heavily on them over the years. But she also knew from experience – even if it was definitely not experience she was going to discuss with them – that non-monogamy was not the easiest ground to tread on. _'__Still, what can I do? Wish them the best and let them sort it out themselves. Nothing good will come from meddling into their feelings; that I learned the hard way few years back. So, sit back, old hag, and speak only when they ask for your help'_, she concluded, trying to get her mind off that track.  
她对他们的爱情生活了解得足够多，知道目前的安排可能是最好的——这场婚姻，假设他们最终都接受的话，有机会消除多年来压在他们身上的许多分手和复合的混乱。但她从经验中也知道——即使这绝对不是她会和他们讨论的经验——非一夫一妻制并不是最容易走的路。尽管如此，我能做什么呢？祝他们好运，让他们自己解决。干涉他们的感情不会有什么好结果；这是我几年前以痛苦的方式学到的。所以，坐稳了，老太婆，只在他们求助时才开口',她总结道，试图让自己的思绪远离这个话题。

_'__I wonder whether there will be a proper wedding reception. Two grooms to dance with, and I bet they both be killing it in a proper attire. Shinji will need a new suit, though… he certainly is taking it after his father when it comes to his body developing. And I don't think Kaworu has any appropriate suit at all'_. She shook her head and leaned back. _'__Stop that, you stupid mother hen. You are_ _**not**_ _their_ _**mother**__, it's not for you to plan their weddings. Wedding. You're their friend. Think of the gift you'd give them, and the dress for yourself, maybe a suit for your husband'_, Misato chided herself. _'__Speaking of dress… I wonder how the girls would look in white dress… or maybe they'd prefer kimonos?'_  
我好奇是否会有一个正式的婚宴。两位新郎共舞，我敢打赌他们穿上正装一定帅得要命。不过，真嗣得准备一套新西装了……他这身材发育，显然是继承了他爸的基因。而我不觉得渚薰有合适的西装。她摇了摇头，向后靠去。别这样，你这愚蠢的老母鸡。你不是他们的母亲，婚礼不该由你来筹划。婚礼。你是他们的朋友。想想你会送什么礼物给他们，还有你自己穿什么，或许给你丈夫也准备一套西装，美里自责道。说到礼服……不知道女孩们穿白色礼服会是什么样子……或者她们更喜欢和服？

She smiled at the picture: boys, dressed to kill in their suits; girls, both in fairy-tale-like wedding dresses. Her perception shifted for a moment, and she saw them in more traditional Japanese wear – looking equally beautiful and handsome in wedding kimonos. _'__I'll have to poke them about that, once they manage to leave the bedroom after we're back. Do not suggest anything large, anything fancy… just a simple party for friends and family'_, she decided, and paused. _'__Family. All in all, they have a chance to finally have a proper one. Their own.'_  
她对着照片微笑：男孩们身着西装，英气逼人；女孩们则穿着童话般的婚纱。她的视角一时转变，看到他们换上了传统的日本服饰——身着婚礼和服，同样美丽与英俊。等我们回来后，他们终于能离开卧室时，我得逗逗他们关于这件事。不要提议什么盛大的、花哨的……就简单地为亲朋好友办个聚会吧。'她决定，然后停顿了一下。家人。总的来说，他们终于有机会拥有一个真正的家了。属于他们自己的。'

She looked sideways at Kaji, who was snoring softly on the seat next to her, his try-to-make-me-shave face relaxed and without a worry in the world. _'__Everyone gets their shot at happiness, hm? Don't waste yours, kids.'_  
她斜眼看了看坐在旁边的加持，他正轻轻地打着呼噜，那张试图让我刮目相看的脸放松下来，无忧无虑。每个人都有追求幸福的机会，嗯？孩子们，别浪费你们的幸福。'

Asuka woke up from an indistinct dream. She could recall something about running around a big, dark castle, looking for something, maybe hiding? The place was something out of a nightmare, but the dream itself was not: she knew her nightmares, and she knew they never came when Shinji was close. Just some dream about looking for something, but without the insane emotions that happened in nightmares.  
明日香从一个模糊的梦中醒来。她记得梦中有在一座巨大而黑暗的城堡里奔跑，寻找着什么，或许是躲藏？那地方像是噩梦中的场景，但梦境本身并不恐怖：她了解自己的噩梦，知道它们从不会在真嗣在身边时出现。只是个关于寻找什么的梦，但没有噩梦中那种疯狂的情绪。

_'__Still, funny metaphor for what happened…'_, she thought, wryly. She yawned lazily, stretched, and looked around. Everyone else was asleep; it was slowly getting dark outside and the inside of the plane was silent. Only distant, soft murmurs and some snoring suggested any human activity; quick glance at the clock told her they were less than an hour from the arrival time; the lights of – presumably – Japan were already visible.  
她苦笑着想：‘这比喻倒也贴切。’她懒洋洋地打了个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，环顾四周。其他人都在睡觉；外面渐渐暗了下来，机舱内一片寂静。只有远处轻微的低语和一些鼾声表明还有人的活动；她匆匆瞥了一眼时钟，得知离抵达时间不到一小时；日本——大概是日本——的灯光已经隐约可见。

_'__Home, sweet home'_, she thought. _'__Heh. We left as a gaggle of misfits with issues, we're returning as a family. Of misfits with issues, of course, but this is an improvement. I think.'_  
她心想：‘家，甜蜜的家。’呵。我们离开时是一群有问题的乌合之众，回来时却成了一个家庭。当然，还是有问题的乌合之众，但这是一种进步。我想。

Asuka was conflicted. She **did** feel happy – "_I managed to cut the Gordian knot by tying the knot!"_, as she triumphantly told her spouses once her initial shock at seeing her own proposal speech wore off, deal was closed, and dust from collecting Misato and Kaji had settled. "_And become the mistress of Asia… well, those parts of Asia I hold most dear"_, she finished with a grin and led them off to a celebratory dinner – this time, on nearly everyone's insistence, with less alcohol – while those better-read explained the metaphor to those confused.  
明日香内心矛盾。她的确感到高兴——“我通过打结解决了戈尔迪乌姆之结！”她曾得意地向她的配偶们讲述，当她最初的震惊消退，交易达成，收集美里和加持的尘埃落定后，“并成为了亚洲……嗯，我最珍视的那部分亚洲的主人”，她笑着补充道，并带领大家去庆祝晚餐——这次，几乎所有人都坚持要少喝酒——而那些博学的人则向困惑的人解释这个比喻。

She grinned again at that memory. That day started truly weird but ended on a high note… at least the public part. The private part that happened later… '_Well, I guess Shinji would call it ended "forte"?'_ she grinned wider and her cheeks flushed a small bit. Even after Asuka fulfilled her thread – or promise – of getting back on Rei for all the horrible puns she made them suffer, Rei was softly insistent on 'her punishment' to continue after dinner. Asuka was having a hard time saying 'no' to her. _'__Not after accidentally reaching into my pocket and finding a reminder of that lovely minx's mischief. Not after Shinji and Kaworu behaved like damned_ _**lovebirds**_ _over the dinner. Not after they turned into_ _**fucking**_ _lovebirds afterwards. Not after Shinji's offer of assistance with Rei…'_, she blushed harder. Quick scan of the area around indicated she was safe from prying eyes, but she knew she had to stop that thinking soon, especially that a make-out session with Shinji those few hours prior left her tingling with… anticipation. She shook her head. Aside being happy, she felt confused.  
她再次因那段记忆而咧嘴笑了。那天开始时确实很奇怪，但结局却相当圆满……至少在公开的部分。而私下的部分，发生在那之后……“嗯，我想真嗣会称之为‘强音’结束吧？”她笑得更开了，双颊微微泛红。即便明日香完成了她对绫波的“复仇”——或者说承诺——因为她那些糟糕的双关语让他们受尽折磨，绫波依然温柔而坚持地要求“她的惩罚”在晚餐后继续。明日香很难对她说“不”。不是在她无意中摸到我口袋里那只可爱小狐狸的恶作剧提醒之后，不是在真嗣和渚薰晚餐时表现得像该死的热恋中的情侣之后，不是在他们之后真的变成那种情侣之后，也不是在真嗣提出帮忙绫波之后……”她的脸更红了。快速环顾四周，确认没有窥探的目光，但她知道必须尽快停止这种思绪，尤其是几个小时前与真嗣的亲吻让她至今还感到一阵阵……期待。她摇了摇头。除了感到幸福，她还感到困惑。

_'__Shouldn't I feel jealous of them? Of Kaworu? Of Rei? I suppose I should. Why aren't I?'_ She has been in the past. Girls that looked at Shinji. Girls that asked Shinji out. Shinji's date when Kaworu dragged him on a double-date after particularly long break in their relationship.  
难道我不应该对他们感到嫉妒吗？对渚薰？对绫波？我想我应该。为什么我没有呢？'她曾经有过。那些看着真嗣的女孩。那些向真嗣表白的女孩。真嗣的约会对象，当渚薰在他们的关系中特别长时间的休息后，硬拉着真嗣去参加双人约会。

_'__I wanted to go there and claw that girl's eyes out. I really considered it. Not my proudest moment'_, she sighed. _'__Yes, all of them. I was jealous. But…'_ Asuka stopped and peeked back and sleeping Rei. _'__Not of her. When they started dating, I was feeling bad… but I couldn't be angry at_ _**her**__. I was angry at_ _**him**__, but that felt so normal, so expected…'_  
我曾想过去那里把那个女孩的眼睛挖出来。我真的考虑过。那不是我最自豪的时刻'，她叹息道。是的，所有那些女孩。我嫉妒过。但是…' 明日香停了下来，偷偷看了一眼熟睡的绫波。不是对她。当我们开始约会时，我感到很难过…但我无法对她生气。我对他是生气的，但那种感觉如此正常，如此预期…'

'And then she pushed him, literally, back into my arms. Without a regret. And comforted me when it fell apart again.'  
'然后她把他推了回来，字面意义上的，重新推回我的怀抱。没有一丝后悔。当一切再次崩溃时，她还安慰了我。'

'And he forgave the stupid reasons for the break-up. As he always did. And always apologised, sincerely, when he thought it was his fault. And often when he wasn't.'  
“他原谅了分手的那些愚蠢理由。一如既往。每当他认为错在自己时，总是真诚地道歉。即使并非他的过错时，也常常如此。”

'And this stupid Angel of Fluff, Love and Fluffy Love. He was always there. Comforting me, over and over. Comforting Shinji, caring for him. Loving Rei.'  
“还有这个愚蠢的绒毛天使，爱与绒绒爱的化身。他总是在那里。一次又一次地安慰我。安慰真嗣，关心他。爱着丽。”

'I don't deserve them' “我不配拥有他们。”

, she hid her face in her hands. _'__But I do love them. And they do love me. They took me, the worthless Drama Queen, the girl that caused a whole lot of mess in their lives. The girl that ran away so many times, that almost ran away for good. They just accepted me.'_  
，她将脸埋在双手中。但我确实爱他们。他们也确实爱我。他们接纳了我，这个无用的戏剧女王，这个在他们生活中制造了一大堆麻烦的女孩。这个多次逃跑，几乎永远逃离的女孩。他们就这样接受了我。

Asuka realised her face was wet, and so were her hands. Tears rolled freely down her cheeks, but she failed to notice that until now. For a second, panic gripped her: she never let anyone see her like that in public, not since she was four. Only her lovers – now, her spouses – saw her that vulnerable, and it was not that common, either. _'__Yet another reason I don't deserve them. They saw my lows, all of them, and still said "yes".'_ She bit hard on her lip and took a deep breath. Fortunately for her, another quick scan confirmed no one was looking.  
明日香意识到她的脸湿了，手也是。泪水自由地顺着她的脸颊滑落，但她直到现在才注意到。有那么一瞬间，恐慌抓住了她：她从不在公共场合让别人看到她这样，自四岁起就没有过。只有她的爱人——现在，她的配偶——见过她如此脆弱，而且这种情况也不常见。'又是一个我不配他们的理由。他们看到了我的低谷，所有的低谷，却依然说“愿意”。'她用力咬住嘴唇，深吸了一口气。幸运的是，再次快速环顾四周确认没有人注意到她。

_'__And I am_ _**not**_ _letting them go. Not one of them. Not anymore. Not ever. Not until death us part. And perhaps even not then.'_  
我不会让他们离开。一个都不。不再。永远不会。直到死亡将我们分开。甚至可能在那之后也不会。

The silence that surrounded Asuka was the only witness to her thoughts. She let the tears flow in silence for a little while longer before doing her best to recover and prepare to look fine.  
包围着明日香的寂静是她思绪的唯一见证。她让泪水默默流淌了一会儿，然后尽力恢复，准备让自己看起来无恙。

The world did not have to know.  
世界无需知晓。

"What do you mean 'wrong'?! Nothing is **wrong** with them!", Asuka's voice was approaching the sound of a snarling predator. She was annoyed already, when their flight had to wait for landing. She was clearly irritated heading out through long passageways of the airport. Now, when they had been stopped on some desk over a data discrepancy, she was quickly heading towards 'livid'. People who knew her were aware that 'furious' was not far off, and not a good thing.  
“你说的‘不对’是什么意思？！他们哪里不对了！”明日香的声音接近咆哮。她已经很烦躁了，当他们的航班不得不等待降落时。她显然对穿过机场长长的通道感到恼火。现在，当他们在某个柜台因数据差异被拦下时，她正迅速变得怒不可遏。了解她的人都知道，‘暴怒’不远了，这不是什么好事。

"I am sorry, ma'am, something seems to be out of order with your papers. If you calm down, I will do my best to work it out", a young official was doing his best to placate a scary, redheaded ball of irritation in front of him. Rest of the group tried their best not to draw attention. They were all tired; trans-oceanic travels are never easy on body and mind, and while some of the people involved were used to them more than the others – for Kaji, it was like another day on the job – most were not.  
"非常抱歉，女士，您的文件似乎有些问题。如果您能冷静下来，我会尽力解决", 一位年轻的官员正尽力安抚眼前这位火冒三丈的红发女士。其余的人则尽量不引人注意。他们都疲惫不堪；跨洋旅行对身心从不轻松，尽管其中一些人比其他人更习惯这种旅程——对 Kaji 来说，这不过是日常工作——但大多数人并非如此。

"While your numbers check out, there seems to be some confusion regarding the names… there are no direct matches, but some of them seem similar…", the clerk trailed off, clearly trying to make heads and tails of the data in front of him. Hikari's reasoning clicked first. "Of course. Yes", she rummaged through her bag for a moment. "Here", she addressed the clerk while handing him the marriage certificate. "I got married abroad. It's _Hikari Suzuhara_ now." Her face lit up a bit banishing the signs of exhaustion for a moment.  
"虽然数字核对无误，但在名字方面似乎有些混淆……没有直接匹配的记录，但有些名字看起来相似……", 办事员话音渐弱，显然在努力理清眼前的数据。Hikari 首先明白了原因。"当然。是的", 她翻找了一会儿背包。"这里", 她一边递给办事员结婚证书一边说。"我在国外结婚了。现在我是 Hikari Suzuhara。" 她的脸上闪过一丝喜悦，暂时驱散了疲惫的痕迹。

"Oh. I see. I see", the man nodded. "It seems the wedding location transferred the information to prefecture's office… and it's in our new citizen registration system now. Amazing efficiency, it's country-wide… I see." He quickly scanned the passport and recorded information. "Thank you, ma'am, please keep in mind you will have to request new identification", he added.  
"哦，我明白了，明白了。" 那人点头道，"看来婚礼地点已经把信息转到了县办公室……现在我们的新公民登记系统里已经有了。真是高效率，全国范围的……我明白了。" 他迅速扫描了护照并记录信息，"谢谢您，女士，请记住您需要申请新的身份证件。" 他补充道。

"Yes, of course, I will. Thank you", Hikari bowed.  
"当然，我会的，谢谢您。" 光鞠了一躬。

In the meantime, the quad of newlyweds was engaged in internal discussion. Asuka managed to cool down – good news for everyone involved, and for the national security. But the issue at hand still stood: they were trying to determine who had the certificate. It took about ten minutes of thorough searches, whispered accusations, and fifteen other passengers passing the desk before they managed to find the document, orient it properly, and decide who was going to present it. Last part gathered them some glares: apparently, quick paper-scissor-rock matches were not common in airport queues.  
与此同时，四位新婚夫妇正在进行内部讨论。明日香终于冷静下来——这对所有相关人员以及国家安全来说都是好消息。但眼前的问题依然存在：他们正在试图确定谁持有证书。经过大约十分钟的彻底搜寻、低声指责，以及十五名其他乘客经过柜台后，他们终于找到了文件，正确地摆放好，并决定由谁来出示。最后一部分引起了些许不满：显然，在机场排队时快速进行剪刀石头布的比赛并不常见。

Kaworu stepped forward, followed by the rest. He handed the officer the marriage certificate: "We got married as well", he stated, as calmly as he could.  
渚薰向前一步，其他人紧随其后。他将结婚证书递给官员：“我们也结婚了”，他尽可能平静地说道。

"Ah, yes, Mr… Mr… Soryu-Ayanami… Hmmmm…"  
“啊，是的，先生……先生……碇-绫波……嗯……”

Kaworu found himself starting to sweat. Not that he was not used to social situations but dealing with authority was something he was not used to, and certainly not something he _liked_. Especially in a situation that could prove complicated. His legal status might have been established properly in the wake of NERV-related changes after the War, but he never truly tested how thorough his legalisation was.  
渚薰发现自己开始冒汗。并非他不习惯社交场合，而是与权威打交道是他不习惯的，也绝非他所喜欢的事。尤其是在可能证明复杂的情况下。他的法律地位可能在战后 NERV 相关变革中得到了妥善确立，但他从未真正检验过他的合法化有多彻底。

"I am afraid this does not make much sense", the clerk started with increasingly confused voice. "Your papers say 'Kaworu Nagisa', and you seem to have assumed a double name that has nothing to do with yours… same for Mr. Shinji… Ikari, now Soryu-Ayanami… Mrs. Soryu, now Soryu-Ayanami… Mrs. Ayanami… oh. This starts…", the clerk paused, making everyone light up with hope. "No, this still makes little sense. If you excuse me and please wait a moment", the clerk picked up the phone, making everyone slump back into tiredness.  
“恐怕这不太说得通。”店员的声音越来越困惑，“您的文件上写着‘渚薰’，而您似乎用了一个与您无关的双重名字……同样的情况也发生在碇先生……现在是惣流·绫波……惣流夫人，现在是惣流·绫波……绫波夫人……哦。这开始……”店员顿了顿，让所有人都燃起了一丝希望。“不，这还是没什么意义。请原谅，我稍等一下。”店员拿起电话，让众人又陷入了疲惫。

Kaworu sighed. He did not envy the man; this had to be a problem for him as well, and while he had to know English due to his line of work, the marriage certificate was far from what one would expect from a clear and standard document. Suzuharas had the same type of certificate, but it had the expected two names and one of the people had a name change – a simple case, a common one. On their certificate, there were **four** names, and all of them were changed in the process. Everything was within the realms of possibility, and within the law – although Kaworu was not entirely sure what _Japanese_ law said about their quad arrangement – but the amount of the unusual events and circumstances most likely crossed the young official's threshold of "I can handle that routinely", speeded past "I have to think how to handle it", and was rapidly passing "I need to consult my superiors lest I make a mistake that will shame me forever" level.  
渚薰叹了口气。他并不羡慕那个男人；这问题对他来说肯定也是个麻烦，尽管由于工作性质他必须懂英语，但这份结婚证书远非人们所期待的那种清晰标准的文件。铃原家的证书也是同类型，但上面只有两个名字，其中一人还改了名——一个简单常见的案例。而他们的证书上有四个名字，且每个名字都在过程中发生了变化。一切都在可能和法律允许的范围内——虽然渚薰不完全确定日本法律对这种四人关系有何规定——但这些不寻常的事件和情况很可能已经超出了这位年轻官员的“我能常规处理”的阈值，迅速越过了“我得想想怎么处理”，正急速逼近“我需要请示上级以免犯下终身耻辱的错误”的级别。

Kaworu understood the man's plight. But he was also perfectly aware that Asuka's temporary lack of violent approach could be very temporary indeed. And that was the thought that disturbed him most at the time, trumping even his own exhaustion.  
渚薰理解那个男人的困境。但他也非常清楚，明日香暂时的非暴力态度可能确实非常短暂。而这正是当时最让他感到不安的想法，甚至超过了自身的疲惫。

In the end, the resolution required calling in a senior clerk who had more experience in handling 'irregular' cases – Kaworu found it slightly amusing how the official fought to keep to the proper terminology and avoided calling the case _insane_ or _messed-up_ – recounting of the entire story – Kaworu had to remind himself to focus on _marriage_, omitting the _party_ before and _consummation_ after, not to mention the whole _recovery and rescue_ process the next day – and reassurances that they will bring the documents in order as soon as reasonably possible. By the end of it, his patience has worn thin.  
最终，解决这一问题需要请来一位经验丰富的资深职员，他更擅长处理“非正常”案件——碇真嗣觉得官方人员努力坚持使用恰当术语，避免称案件为疯狂或混乱，这一点颇为有趣——他详细叙述了整个故事——碇真嗣不得不提醒自己专注于婚姻部分，省略之前的派对和之后的圆房，更不用说第二天的康复和救援过程——并保证他们会尽快合理地整理好文件。到最后，他的耐心已经所剩无几。

The fear of Asuka-originating explosion came around once more at luggage pick-up. But the delay has proven to be minimal, and Asuka was simply too tired to care. The party split in three, said their good-byes, and each returned to their own place by a separate taxi. On the way, the four simply kept close; too tired to talk, but not too tired to look out for each other. Once they reached the apartment, suitcases went into corners, and bathrooms became things most desired.  
在取行李时，再次感受到了来自明日香可能引发的爆炸性恐惧。但延迟时间很短，明日香也实在太累了，根本不在乎。一行人分成三组，互相道别，各自乘坐不同的出租车回家。途中，四人紧紧相依；虽然疲惫得无法交谈，但还不至于累到忽视彼此。一到达公寓，行李箱就被扔到角落，浴室成了最渴望的地方。

They were home. 他们到家了。

Shinji pulled out some frozen ingredients and started on a simple supper; they did have a meal on the plane, of course, but it was hours ago, food never tasted well in the clouds, and sleeping with an empty stomach did not sound well to anyone. Once basics were set up, Shinji gladly accepted Kaworu's offer to watch over the pots and took a shower himself; only distraction that happened on the way was being stopped by freshly-showered Asuka and given a warm and steamy hug. "Thank you", she whispered in his ear before moving on. He blinked in confusion; _'__I'll have to ask later'_, he thought. Actually, there were many things to touch on later. But this was a proper qualification: later. Now, it was time to shower, eat, and go to sleep. Jet lag was a murder.  
真嗣拿出一些冷冻食材，开始准备一顿简单的晚餐；当然，他们在飞机上吃过饭，但那已是几小时前的事了，云端上的食物总是难以令人满意，而空腹入睡对任何人来说都不太好。基本料理完成后，真嗣欣然接受了渚薰帮忙照看锅子的提议，自己去洗了个澡；途中唯一的插曲是被刚洗完澡的明日香拦下，得到了一个温暖而热气腾腾的拥抱。“谢谢你。”她在耳边低语后便离开了。他困惑地眨了眨眼；‘待会儿得问问她’，他想。实际上，还有许多事情需要稍后探讨。但此刻，他决定将这些都留到以后。现在，是时候洗澡、吃饭然后睡觉了。时差真是个折磨人的东西。

He got out of the shower just in time to assist in serving the food. He smiled at the fact that everyone was in the most comfortable clothing they could find: Asuka, Kaworu, and he in their pyjamas, Rei in her soft bathrobe. For a second, part of his brain wondered why Rei did not put her pyjama; less tired part of his brain reminded her she never owned any. This conclusion did not help his cognitive capabilities; suddenly, he was glad that he was already sitting behind a table.  
他刚洗完澡，正好帮忙上菜。他笑着看到大家穿着最舒适的衣物：明日香、薰和他自己都穿着睡衣，丽则裹着柔软的浴袍。有那么一瞬间，他的大脑一部分在想为什么丽不穿睡衣；而较为清醒的那部分提醒他，丽从未有过睡衣。这个结论并没有改善他的认知能力；突然间，他很庆幸自己已经坐在餐桌后面了。

"Goodnight, every-", Shinji tried to say once he got out of the bathroom after brushing his teeth. He stopped in his tracks once he saw his spouses performing some manoeuvres with futons. "Guys?"  
“晚安，各位——”，真嗣刷完牙从浴室出来时试图说道。他停下脚步，看到他的配偶们正在铺被褥。“大家？”

"Ah, good. Do you prefer us on the left, the right, or on both sides?", Rei asked in a very matter-of-fact tone. Before Shinji could answer, Asuka chimed in with sleepy voice: "Just push the bed to the wall, put them on the other side in case someone falls, and come to bed, all of you. I'm tiiiiree-" a large yawn cut the rest off.  
“啊，很好。你更喜欢我们在左边、右边，还是两边都有？”，丽用一种非常实事求是的语气问道。真嗣还没来得及回答，明日香就带着困倦的声音插话道：“把床推到墙边，另一边铺上以防有人掉下去，然后大家都上床睡觉吧。我好困——”一个大大的哈欠打断了她的话。

Rei looked at Kaworu, and Kaworu looked at Rei. They both smiled, and the bed with Asuka on it slowly levitated towards the wall. Shinji rolled his eyes: _'__Well, yes, this_ _**is**_ _the fastest way, but I am sure some hapless technician at Geofront is now scrambling to check the Blue Pattern Alarm. They will see it originated here and ceased, and hopefully not call for recon or Eva alarm…'_. The War was over, but the sensor networks have not been dismantled. After all, no one truly knew whether it was all over, and in military, paranoia tended to be the way of life – or, as they preferred to call it, 'being prepared'.  
丽看着渚薰，渚薰也看着丽。两人相视而笑，而装着明日香的床缓缓向墙边飘去。真嗣翻了个白眼：好吧，这确实是最快的方法，但我敢肯定，地表基地的某个倒霉技术人员现在正手忙脚乱地检查蓝色警报。他们会发现警报从这里开始又在这里结束，希望他们不会派人来调查或启动 EVA 警报……'。战争已经结束，但传感器网络并未被拆除。毕竟，没有人真正知道是否一切都结束了，而在军队中，偏执往往是一种生活方式——或者，正如他们喜欢称之为'有备无患'。

He shook the thoughts off and approached the newly-placed bed. It was technically Asuka's room, and she had a large bed they both slept in when they were on good terms – but large meant 'fit for three', not for four. _'__Well, I guess one or two nights with one more will not kill us. And then we'll have to think of something else.'_  
他甩开这些念头，走向新安置的床。严格来说这是明日香的房间，她有一张大床，两人关系好时会一起睡——但大床意味着'适合三人'，而不是四人。嗯，我想一两个晚上多一个人不会要了我们的命。之后我们再想办法吧。

He turned around to ask Kaworu a question about futons – and realised this might have been a mistake. Rei already disrobed – and was standing less than half a meter from him, smiling her small smile, perfectly innocent in her nudity. Perfectly distracting, as well. "Yes, dear husband?", she smirked. "Should I put something more… decent… on, to avoid distracting you?"  
他转过身来想向渚薰询问关于被褥的问题——随即意识到这可能是个错误。绫波已经脱掉了衣服——站在离他不到半米的地方，带着她那淡淡的微笑，赤裸的身体显得无比纯真。同样也极具诱惑力。“是的，亲爱的丈夫？”她微微一笑。“我是不是该穿得更……得体些……以免让你分心？”

_'…_ _and perfectly aware of the effect she is having on me. If she keeps up this game, next few days may be… interesting. Or few next weeks'_, he realised.  
“……而且她完全清楚自己对我的影响。如果她继续这样玩下去，接下来的几天可能会……有趣。或者接下来的几周。”他意识到。

Little did he know how wrong he was.  
他不知道自己错得有多离谱。

Despite his brain still operational – at least marginally – Shinji found himself unable to answer coherently. Kaworu entered the room carrying his futon and stopped in his track. Rei looked at him equally sweetly and asked the same question, in the same innocent tone. Brains of both men were whirring, deciding between a bluescreen and turning off due to lack of blood. Rei seemed… amused.  
尽管大脑仍在运转——至少勉强如此——真嗣发现自己无法连贯地回答。薰抱着他的被褥走进房间，突然停下脚步。绫波同样甜美地看着他，用同样天真的语气问了同一个问题。两人的大脑都在飞速运转，决定是蓝屏还是因缺血而关闭。绫波似乎……觉得有趣。

The stalemate was broken by a muffled voice from the bed: "Shtop fooling 'round! I want my body pillow, sho come to **bed**! Or'll come to youu…" Asuka made a threat, waving her hand, fingers curled in claws, rest of her body wrapped in covers.  
僵局被床上一个闷闷的声音打破：“别闹了！我要我的抱枕，快来睡觉！不然我就去找你……”明日香挥舞着手，手指弯曲成爪状，身体其余部分裹在被子里，发出威胁。

Rei put her finger on her lips and cocked her head. "I believe I have a solution for this. All of this. Kaworu, please put the futon down next to the bed, as we discussed; Shinji – please go assist Asuka in acquiring a body pillow. You are one she is most familiar with in that capacity. I believe I can take care of the remaining issues that have arisen."  
绫波将手指放在唇边，歪了歪头。“我想我有一个解决办法。所有这些问题。薰，请把被褥放在床边，就像我们讨论的那样；真嗣——请去帮明日香拿抱枕。她在这个方面最熟悉你。我相信我能处理剩下的问题。”

_'__Rei certainly makes good on her word'_, Shinji thought, drifting to sleep while holding Asuka, being held by Rei, and feeling Kaworu's hand on his side. He wondered briefly whether the bruises that had to be forming on his thighs will be recognizable as bite marks – if so, it would be wise to think of an explanation before resuming his training routine – but decided to worry about that in the morning. His last conscious thought was: _'__Will it last? I'd like to see it last…'_.  
丽确实信守承诺', 真嗣想着，在抱着明日香、被丽抱着、并感受到薰的手放在他身侧的情况下渐渐入睡。他短暂地思考了一下大腿上必定形成的淤青是否会被认出是咬痕——如果是的话，在恢复训练前想出一个解释会是明智的——但他决定留到早上再担心。他最后的意识是：这会持续吗？我希望它能持续……

Surrounded by happy murmurs and soft snoring from all sides, he drifted away.  
四周环绕着愉快的低语和轻柔的鼾声，他渐渐进入了梦乡。

### Chapter 8

**Evangelion: The Hangover pt 8  
新世纪福音战士：宿醉 第 8 章**

**.**

---

.

The next morning after homecoming was a slow and lazy one, at least partly due to jet lag still insisting it was the middle of the night. But the larger reason was a mix of joy at waking up with the four of them comfortably wrapped around each other entirely openly, and of all of them sharing a residual fear that this was all a grand dream and not wanting to break the spell by getting up. Asuka certainly didn't want to move, at least. However, Kaworu's stomach loudly declaring it was empty and Shinji's bladder alerting him it was full required the happy, if somewhat cramped, pile in the bed to yield to the requirements of nature and start to stir.  
返校节后的第二天早晨，由于时差作祟，感觉还是深夜，所以显得格外缓慢而慵懒。但更主要的原因是，他们四人醒来时舒适地相互依偎，毫无保留地拥抱在一起，这种喜悦与他们心中残留的恐惧交织——担心这一切只是一场美梦，不愿起身打破这魔咒。至少，明日香绝对不想动弹。然而，渚薰的肚子大声宣告饥饿，真嗣的膀胱也发出警告，这使得床上虽有些拥挤但幸福的一堆人不得不屈服于自然的召唤，开始慢慢苏醒。

Kaworu already had the beginnings of breakfast underway by the time Shiniji exited the bathroom. While no one questioned or contested Shinji's title as King of the kitchen in their household (which it had functionally been for months, despite Rei and Kaworu still technically having their own apartments next door), Kaworu had developed a not-inconsiderable talent of his own for cooking, fueled in part by his sheer delight that it was a relatively simple way for him to elide the still lingering creative blindness that many other Lilim fields harbored for him.  
当真嗣走出浴室时，渚薰已经开始准备早餐了。尽管没有人质疑或挑战真嗣在家中厨房之王的地位（尽管丽和渚薰在隔壁仍拥有自己的公寓，但几个月来这个称号实际上已经属于真嗣），渚薰也发展出了相当不错的烹饪才能，部分原因是他对烹饪的纯粹喜爱，这相对简单的方式让他能够避开其他许多人类领域对他仍存在的创造性盲点。

That their new marital status meant Kaworu had also decided to treat his wives and husband to a traditional 'naked apron' morning was a treat, though.  
他们新婚的身份意味着渚薰决定以传统的“裸体围裙”早晨来款待他的妻子们和丈夫，这确实是个惊喜。

Shinji stopped dead in his tracks on entering the kitchen at the sight, and flushed as he contemplated that he was now staring at his _husband's_ bare ass as said cook worked on breakfast while humming contentedly. It took a moment for Shinji to kick himself back into gear and move in to cuddle up against Kaworu's delightfully warm back. "Good morning," he murmured into his ear. "Breakfast in bed for our wives?"  
真嗣一进厨房就愣住了，看到这一幕，他的脸颊泛起红晕，因为他意识到自己正在盯着丈夫赤裸的臀部，而那位厨师正愉快地哼着歌做早餐。过了一会儿，真嗣才回过神来，走上前去拥抱渚薰温暖的后背。“早上好，”他轻声在他耳边说，“给我们的妻子们准备床上早餐？”

Kaworu purred happily at Shinji's hands sliding under the apron to meet on his stomach. "If they haven't moved when we're done cooking, certainly. Or if nothing distracts us out here~..." he trailed off suggestively, giving his hips a little wiggle against Shinji.  
渚薰在真嗣的手滑入围裙下，贴在他肚子上时，开心地低声哼哼。“如果我们做完饭它们还没动，那当然可以。或者如果这里没有什么能让我们分心的话~...”他意味深长地拖长了声音，轻轻扭动臀部贴着真嗣。

Shinji shivered himself and failed to stop an outburst of compassion. "Ah... I say no only because I'm sure our ladies would be sad they missed the show. But I like your thinking."  
真嗣自己颤抖了一下，没能阻止一阵同情心的爆发。“啊...我之所以说不，是因为我确信我们的女士们会因为错过这场表演而难过。但我喜欢你的想法。”

"Well then, let's hurry and get some food to them so we can resume," Kaworu said with a wink over his shoulder.  
“那么，让我们快点给他们弄些食物，然后继续，”渚薰回头眨了眨眼说。

"And here I thought _Rei_ was the most naughty one," Shinji said with a smile. He forced himself to let go of the toned Nephilim and start finding the breakfast plates. "I think she's been a bad... _good_ influence on you."  
"我还以为丽是最调皮的呢，" 真嗣笑着说。他强迫自己放开那健美的奈非天，开始寻找早餐盘子。"我觉得她对你影响不好... 好的影响。"

Thus motivated, assembly of breakfast moved quickly. Toast, butter, jam, tea, and some rice for everyone was sufficient to get them started for the day, which happily was still part of vacation. They didn't have to worry about returning to their various jobs for a few more days. Shinji already had plans for them, most of which did not include spending much time away from either his new spouses or their bed. He imagined the others had similar thoughts.  
受到这样的激励，早餐的准备工作迅速进行。吐司、黄油、果酱、茶，还有每人一份的米饭，足以让他们开始新的一天，幸运的是，这一天仍然是假期的一部分。他们不必担心在接下来的几天内回到各自的工作岗位。真嗣已经为他们制定了计划，其中大部分时间都不打算远离他的新配偶们或他们的床。他猜想其他人也有类似的念头。

Well, he imagined Asuka and Kaworu did. With Rei, he was _certain_.  
嗯，他猜想明日香和薰也是这样。至于丽，他确信如此。

Very deliberately, he let Kaworu precede him back into the bedroom, enjoying the view the whole way. _'Gods, it feels so... liberating, not to have to hold back at all anymore that I love Kaworu too. I don't know if I ever could have admitted that out loud without Asuka, too. I... I just... I need both of them. And Rei.'_ Rei's words from that hungover morning came back to him. _''I am currently experiencing the most fascinating combination of arousal and romantic joy. I would prefer that this state last as long as possible.' Yeah, me too, Rei. Me too.'_ He'd spent half his life so lonely it hurt to even remember, and now here he was, the first morning in his own home, bringing breakfast to his wives, plural, in the company of his husband.  
他故意让渚先他一步回到卧室，一路上尽情欣赏着这番景象。'天啊，这种感觉真是...解放了，不再需要有任何保留，我也爱着渚。没有明日香，我可能永远无法大声承认这一点。我...我只是...我需要他们两个。还有丽。' 丽那次宿醉早晨的话又浮现在他脑海中。''我现在正经历着一种最迷人的兴奋与浪漫喜悦的结合。我希望这种状态能持续得越久越好。' 是啊，我也是，丽。我也是。' 他大半辈子都孤独得连回忆都痛苦，而现在，他就在这里，在自己的家中，第一个早晨，为他的妻子们——复数——端来早餐，身边还有他的丈夫。

Red and blue hair were mixed together on the bed, the only parts of their wives visible above the covers they'd pulled back over themselves once he and Kaworu rose. Kaworu placed tray he was carrying on the bedside table and snaked a hand underneath the blankets to gently rouse Rei. "Breakfast in bed, my loves. Time to wake a little."  
红色和蓝色的头发在床上交织在一起，这是他们妻子们唯一露在被子外面的部分，被子是他们和渚起床后重新拉回来的。渚把他端着的托盘放在床头柜上，伸手到被子下面轻轻唤醒丽。"早餐在床上，亲爱的们。该醒醒了。"

"Grmphlbix," Asuka replied.  
"咕噜布西，" 明日香回答道。

"But it's warm and cuddly under here, and Asuka is being cute and sleepy," Rei said drowsily.  
“但这里温暖又舒适，明日香还那么可爱又困倦，”绫波懒洋洋地说道。

"Naked apron beefcake," Kaworu said with a small smile.  
“裸体围裙的肌肉男，”渚薰微微一笑说道。

Rei sprang upright into a sitting position, eyes open. "I'm up!" She ran her eyes up and down Kaworu. "Ohhhh, I like being married. Can I untie the apron?"  
绫波猛地坐直身子，眼睛睁得大大的。“我醒了！”她上下打量着渚薰。“哦，我喜欢结婚。我能解开围裙吗？”

Kaworu smiled wider. "Of course. Unless Asuka wants to thumb-wrestle you for the chance."  
渚薰笑得更开了。“当然可以。除非明日香想和你比试拇指摔跤来争取这个机会。”

Asuka likewise sat up, yawning. "I'm up, but I'm only not trying to kill you because I love you and you're really hot," she complained. "Rei can have this one. I will de-pants Shinji and have him feed me breakfast."  
明日香也坐起身，打着哈欠。“我起来了，但我不打算杀你只是因为我爱你而且你真的很性感，”她抱怨道。“丽可以接手这个。我要扒掉真嗣的裤子，让他喂我吃早餐。”

Shinji moved to her side of the bed, only too happy to put himself in reach of her hands. But before he could get to the fun part, his phone began to ring on the table behind him.  
真嗣移到她床边，非常乐意让自己进入她的手可及范围。但就在他准备享受乐趣之前，他身后的桌子上手机开始响了起来。

Asuka glared death at the smartphone. "Shinji, I do want you to answer that, if only so we can tell them to die in a fire for interrupting the breakfast-foreplay for what was supposed to be our first proper morning four-way in our own home."  
明日香恶狠狠地瞪着智能手机。“真嗣，我确实希望你接电话，哪怕只是为了告诉他们去死，因为他们打断了我们本该在家中第一次正式四人早餐前的调情。”

Shinji handed the tray to Asuka, and retrieved his phone, glancing at the caller ID. The display on his cutting-edge smartphone said 'CPT Aida, K.' "It's Kensuke," he reported to the others. "It... could be NERV related?"  
真嗣将托盘递给明日香，拿起自己的手机，瞥了一眼来电显示。他那尖端智能手机的屏幕上显示着‘相田剑介少尉’。“是剑介，”他向其他人报告，“可能是与 NERV 有关的事？”

"At this hour? On a Saturday?" Asuka scoffed. "Oh, fine, answer him. If nothing else, we can tell him to leave us alone for," she glanced around, "eh, at least three or four days. We're going to be _busy_."  
“这个时间？还是周六？”明日香嗤之以鼻，“好吧，接吧。如果没什么重要的事，我们可以告诉他至少三四天内别来打扰我们，我们有得忙了。”

Shinji snorted. Asuka's tone said volumes about exactly _how_ she expected them to all be 'busy'. He clicked 'Accept' on his phone. "Hello, Kensuke."  
真嗣哼了一声。明日香语气中的意味，清楚地表明了她预期他们都会有多‘忙’。他在手机上点击了‘接受’。“你好，健介。”

"Shinji! Man! I have the _best news_ you're never going to believe!"  
“真嗣！伙计！我有天大的好消息，你绝对不会相信的！”

"A kaiju has appeared offshore, and you've been selected to pilot Jet Alone 2 against it while your girlfriends watch?" Shinji asked dryly.  
“一只巨兽在近海出现了，而你被选中驾驶 Jet Alone 2 去对抗它，同时你的女朋友们在旁边观看？”真嗣干巴巴地问道。

"No, though that would be almost as awesome. I want to show you! Can you put on video mode?" Kensuke asked excitedly.  
“不，虽然那也几乎同样精彩。我想给你看个东西！你能切换到视频模式吗？” 真嗣兴奋地问道。

Shinji looked at his spouses. Rei had successfully dispensed with Kaworu's apron, and the chiseled and toned Nephilim was now sprawled across her lap, with Rei teasingly feeding him bits of toast and jam... ...while also exploring his compassion. Asuka watched with interest, and when she noticed Shinji looking, smirked at him and put her hands behind her head to arc her back into a stretch. "Er... I'm not really dressed..." he said into the phone.  
真嗣看着他的配偶们。丽已经成功地脱掉了薰的围裙，这位轮廓分明、肌肉线条优美的天使现在正躺在她的腿上，丽调皮地喂他吃着吐司和果酱……同时也在探索他的温柔。明日香饶有兴趣地看着，当她注意到真嗣在看时，朝他微微一笑，双手放在脑后，身体向后伸展。“呃……我还没穿好衣服……”他对着电话说。

"Please? I promise, it's worth it! It'll only take a minute! I've got something I _really_ want to show you and Asuka! I know she's there. You two are 'on again' this month."  
“拜托了？我保证，绝对值得一看！只需要一分钟！我有样东西真的很想给你们俩看，我知道她在那儿。你们这个月又‘和好了’。”

Shinji sighed, and covered the phone's mic with his thumb. "Ah... Rei, cover yourself and Kaworu with a blanket enough for Kensuke. I'll try and keep you two out of shot, but I don't want to accidentally give him a show if I mistake the view angle."  
真嗣叹了口气，用拇指捂住手机的麦克风。“啊……绫波，用毯子把自己和薰盖好，足够让剑介看到。我会尽量让你们不出现在镜头里，但我不希望万一角度没掌握好，让他意外看到不该看的。”

"He has inconvenient timing," Rei pouted slightly, but flipped the blankets up enough that Kaworu was no longer displaying his strong compassion to the world.  
“他的时机总是那么不凑巧，”绫波微微噘嘴，但还是拉起毯子，足够让薰不再向世界展示他的深切同情。

Shinji sat down on the bed and placed himself in front of Asuka enough that her own state of undress wasn't immediately visible. Getting a nod from her, he clicked the call over to video. "Alright, Kensuke, we're here. What is it?"  
真嗣坐在床上，让自己挡在明日香前面，确保她的衣衫不整不会立刻被看到。得到她的点头同意后，他切换到视频通话。“好了，剑介，我们在这儿。有什么事吗？”

A view of three hands greeted him, one male and two female, all wearing a ring on their ring finger. "We got _married!_" Kensuke, Sayaka, and Kyoko chorused.  
三只手映入眼帘，一男两女，每只手的无名指上都戴着戒指。“我们结婚啦！”健介、沙耶香和京子齐声欢呼。

Rei slapped both her hands over her mouth and did her best to stifle an explosion of giggling. Kaworu rolled over and smashed his face into a pillow in a similar effort.  
丽双手捂住嘴，尽力压抑着爆发的笑声。薰则翻了个身，将脸埋进枕头，同样努力克制自己。

Asuka didn't even try. "Ha! About time, you three! Congratulations. Now... unless you stowed away in our luggage and snuck over to Las Vegas without telling us, how the Hell did you get the Japanese Government to agree to that? You three may have been a 'thing' since high school, but I thought you'd all decided to just live together since you couldn't do a three-way marriage."  
明日香连掩饰都懒得掩饰。“哈！终于等到这一天了，恭喜你们！不过……除非你们偷偷藏在我们的行李里，没告诉我们就溜去了拉斯维加斯，否则日本政府是怎么同意这种事的？你们三个从高中起就是‘那种关系’，但我记得你们不是决定就住在一起，因为三方婚姻是不可能的吗？”

"Turns out, it's legal in the United States!" Sayaka crowed from Kensuke's left. "Kyo-chan read about it when she was tormenting herself reading some bridal and wedding magazines. Once she told us, Ken-chan had us on a plane to Reno, Nevada in less than 24 hours! The sweetie!"  
"结果发现，这在美国的法律上是允许的！" 真由香从健介的左边欢呼道，"京子在折磨自己看一些新娘和婚礼杂志时读到了这个。她告诉我们后，健介不到 24 小时就让我们登上了去内华达州里诺的飞机！真是贴心！"

"Less than twelve hours after we landed, we were the Aidas, all three of us!" Kyoko said from the other side. "It's legal in America, and we figure with a good lawyer and playing the NERV card, we can probably make the Japanese Government take it. NERV for sure, anyhow, and if we have to live in the Geofront to make it work, then we'll do it."  
"我们落地后不到十二小时，就成了三个相田！" 京子从另一边说道，"在美国这是合法的，我们觉得找个好律师，再利用 NERV 这张牌，或许能让日本政府接受。无论如何，NERV 肯定会支持，如果为了实现这一点我们必须住在地下空间，那我们也愿意。"

Asuka's grin would have done credit to a shark. "As usual, Geek-Stooge, anything you can do, I can do better!" Without taking her eyes off the phone, she reached blindly to her right and found Rei's left hand, dragging her closer.  
明日香那得意的笑容简直能媲美鲨鱼。"一如既往，书呆子小丑，你能做的，我都能做得更好！" 她眼睛不离手机，盲目地向右伸出手，找到了丽左手，将她拉近。

The image on the phone pulled back enough to show all three Aidas looking at them in confusion. They were apparently still walking out of the airport, a luggage cart in front of Kensuke. "What?" he blinked at her.  
手机上的画面拉远，显示出三位 Aida 困惑地看着他们。他们显然还在机场出口处，Kensuke 面前推着一辆行李车。“什么？”他眨眼看着她。

"Oh, Shinji and I got married two days ago, so we did it first. _And_ we did it better because we did it _bigger_."  
“哦，真嗣和我两天前结婚了，所以我们先办了。而且我们办得更好，因为我们办得更盛大。”

"How can you and Shinji possibly be 'bigger' than the _three_ of us, Red Demon?"  
“你和真嗣怎么可能比我们三个更‘大’，红魔？”

Asuka's smirk ran from ear to ear. She pulled Rei close enough to be seen behind her, and draped Rei's arm over her shoulder, be-ringed hand prominently on display. "Because Shinji and I and _Rei_ got married... and Kaworu for good measure! Ha! Beat a four-way marriage, Stooge!"  
明日香得意地咧嘴笑着，将绫波拉到自己身后，让她环抱住自己的肩膀，戴着戒指的手格外显眼。“因为我和真嗣还有绫波结婚了……还有加持，为了保险起见！哈！你能比得过四人联姻吗，笨蛋！”

She paused for a second. "Oh, yeah, Jock-Stooge and Hikari finally got hitched too. Seems to have been a thing this week."  
她顿了一下。“哦，对了，肌肉笨蛋和光也终于结婚了。看来这周是个结婚周。”

Kesuke just stared at her. Then at Shinji, who raised his left hand to show his own ring and shyly nod confirmation. "Wut."  
美里只是盯着她。然后看向真嗣，后者举起左手展示自己的戒指，羞涩地点头确认。“什么鬼。”

Kaworu stuck his head in to the edge of the field of the phone's camera. "Hi, Kensuke, ladies! Good morning!" He was grinning like an idiot too.  
カヲルは携帯のカメラの視野の端に頭を突っ込んで、「ケンスケ、みんな！おはよう！」と言った。彼もまた馬鹿みたいに笑っていた。

Kensuke stared at Kaworu's sideways tilted head like he'd grown antlers. "You guys are... you're fucking with us, right?"  
ケンスケはカヲルの横に傾いた頭を見て、まるで角が生えたかのようだった。「お前ら... お前らは俺たちをからかってるんだろ？」

Kaworu stuck his hand into view, ring glittering. "Nope! Asuka decided I was as lovable as Shinji and Rei, somehow, and decided to keep me. The Asuka has spoken, I must obey."  
カヲルは手を視界に入れ、輝く指輪を見せた。「ノップ！明日香は何故か僕をシンジやレイみたいに愛おしいと思って、僕を連れて行くことにした。明日香様の言うことは絶対なので、従わなければならない。」

"Damn skippy," Asuka nodded. Her imperious tone was somewhat spoiled by a rising blush. "Mister Aida, Mrs Aida, Mrs Aida, say hello to the Soryu-Ayanamis!"  
"当然啦，" 明日香点头道。她那傲慢的语气被逐渐升起的红晕稍稍破坏了。"相田先生，相田太太，相田太太，来见见索伦-绫波一家！"

"How... how... how... what? I mean... all of you?" Kensuke babbled. Beside him Sayaka just smiled and shook her head at him. Kyoko started laughing. "You owe me 500 yen, Sayaka! You bet Rei and Kaworu would get married _first_!"  
"怎...怎...怎...什么？我是说...你们所有人？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说。他旁边的沙耶香只是微笑着对他摇头。绫波开始笑了起来。"沙耶香，你欠我 500 日元！你赌绫波和薰会先结婚的！"

"Sayaka, Kyoko... you have been my friends for many years, and you know your husband was one of my first friends, yes?" Rei said suddenly from behind Asuka.  
"沙耶香，绫波...你们多年来一直是我的朋友，而且你们知道你们的丈夫是我最早的朋友之一，对吧？" 绫波突然从明日香身后说道。"

"Yes?" "是的？"

"Yes?" "是的？"

"So do take it in the full spirit of our friendship when I say 'Congratulations on your marriage, now stop interrupting me when I'm feeding a naked and aroused husband in my lap and don't call us for at least 24 hours'."  
"所以请以我们友谊的全部精神来接受我的祝福：‘恭喜你们结婚，但请在我给坐在我腿上赤裸且兴奋的丈夫喂食时不要打断我，并且至少 24 小时内不要联系我们。’"

Kensuke's face reddened. "Rei, are you sure you should be quite phrasing it that way?"  
健介的脸红了。“丽，你确定应该这样表达吗？”

"I dunno, I could stand to hear a little more," Sayaka said. "It sounds like a good plan. Love ya, Rei! We'll see you all tomorrow night for dinner or something!" She reached out over Kensuke's arm and pressed the 'End Call' button on his phone.  
“我不知道，我还想再听一点，”沙耶香说。“听起来是个好计划。爱你，丽！我们明天晚上一起吃晚饭或者其他什么活动再见吧！”她伸手越过健介的手臂，按下了他手机上的‘结束通话’按钮。

Rei nodded with satisfaction. She reached up to grab Kaworu by the upper arm and pulled him back to fall into her lap again. "Now, where were we? Ah, yes: Nutrition. Breakfast."  
丽满意地点点头。她伸手抓住卡罗尔的上臂，将他拉回，再次跌坐在她的腿上。“那么，我们刚才说到哪儿了？啊，对了：营养。早餐。”

Shinji dropped his phone onto the bedside table and sat down facing Asuka. "Rei, why am I suspicious that you're planning something lewd with that train of thought?"  
真嗣把手机丢在床头柜上，面对着明日香坐下。“丽，为什么我觉得你用这个思路在策划什么下流的事情？”

"Because we know this insatiably horny little minx we married, Shinji?" Asuka supplied. "Also, the way she's got her hand wrapped around Kaworu's 'Lance of Longinus' is a hint."  
“因为我们了解这个欲求不满的小妖精，真嗣？”明日香补充道，“而且，她把手缠在卡罗尔的‘朗基努斯之枪’上的样子也太明显了。”

"I was just thinking of our dietary needs, Asuka," Rei said piously, hand moving slowly. "I'm going to watch Kaworu eat some toast, then he's going to eat me, while I eat you, while you eat Shinji. A good breakfast is important, and the best way to start the day."  
"我只是在考虑我们的饮食需求，明日香，" 绫波虔诚地说道，手慢慢移动。"我要看着渚薰吃些吐司，然后他吃我，我吃你，你吃真嗣。一顿丰盛的早餐很重要，这是开始新一天的最好方式。"

"And what am I supposed to eat?" Shinji inquired, raising an eyebrow. "Or who, maybe?"  
"那我该吃什么呢？" 真嗣挑眉问道。"或者说，该吃谁呢？"

Rei smiled... angelically. "I'm warming you up some sausage right now."  
绫波微笑了...天使般地。"我现在正在给你热一些香肠。"

"Rei, that was terrible. I'm giving you 70 or 80 years to stop that," Asuka said, leaning over to kiss her shoulder.  
"丽，那太糟糕了。我给你 70 到 80 年的时间来改掉这个习惯，" 明日香说着，侧身过去亲吻她的肩膀。

"If I said you have a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?" Rei said without the slightest change to her expression.  
"如果我说你有一个美丽的身体，你会因此怪罪我吗？" 丽面无表情地说道。

"I love breakfast," Kaworu mumbled around a mouthful of toast.  
"我喜欢早餐，" 渚薰嘴里塞满吐司含糊不清地说。
