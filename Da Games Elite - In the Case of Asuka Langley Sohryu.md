### Chapter 1

The following fanfiction is my first tale in the universe of Evangelion  
以下同人小说是我在《新世纪福音战士》宇宙中的第一部作品

The following fanfiction is my first tale in the universe of Evangelion. As you all should know, the characters are extremely developed, if not the most developed in any anime. So I was surprised that they were only a couple of fanfictions on the site that involved the characters going to a psychologist. This little tale of mine is the tale of Asuka Langley Sohryu and her psychologist. As you can very well imagine, there is much territory to cover.  
以下同人小说是我在《新世纪福音战士》宇宙中的第一部作品。众所周知，这些角色在动漫中即便不是最成熟，也是极其成熟的。因此，我惊讶地发现网站上只有少数几篇同人小说涉及角色去看心理医生。我这篇小故事讲述了惣流·明日香·兰格雷和她心理医生的故事。正如你们可以想象的那样，有很多内容需要探讨。

However, that is all the summary I need to tell you. The rest of the story, as it were, should tell itself. And please, leave reviews! I love reviews!  
然而，这些就是我需要告诉你的概要。故事的其余部分，可以说，应该让它自己展开。并且请留下评论！我喜欢评论！

**In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu  
关于惣流·明日香·兰格雷的案例**

**Part One 第一部分**

The only good thing about this entire stupid trip was the fact that she was skipping cleaning duty for her classroom. That was it.  
这次愚蠢旅途中唯一的好处，就是她可以免去打扫教室的苦差事。仅此而已。

There was nothing else good about being thrown in a car for an hour that looked as though all you needed was to give it a good kick if you wanted to make it fall apart to pieces. There was nothing good that her dear guardian Misato had gulped down a few cans of beer just before coming to pick her and that idiot up from class. Oh, and let's not forget that Wonder Girl was also thrown in between her and the stupid idiot. We couldn't forget that stupid girl and her blank expressionless face.  
被塞进一辆看起来只需一脚就能让它散架的车里，忍受一小时颠簸，实在没什么可称道的。更别提她的监护人美里在来接她和那个白痴之前，已经灌下了几罐啤酒。哦，还有，那个小怪物也被夹在她和那个白痴之间。我们可不能忘了那个面无表情的蠢丫头。

It sure was creepy just looking at that girl's face. She probably didn't object to having to be carted off to some stupid shrink. After all, a freaking shrink!  
光是看着那女孩的脸就够让人毛骨悚然了。她大概也不会反对被带到某个愚蠢的心理医生那里去。毕竟，心理医生啊！

They had been told after another one of those boring sync tests. Naturally, she had emerged on top, beating that stupid idiot and Wonder Girl. She had been pretty proud of herself, until she had started showering off the slimy bloodlike LCL from her beautiful, voluptuous frame.  
他们又一次在那些无聊的同步测试后被告知结果。自然，她再次拔得头筹，击败了那个愚蠢的白痴和奇迹少女。她曾为此颇为自豪，直到开始冲洗掉那黏糊糊的、血一般的 LCL，从她那美丽、丰满的身躯上。

"Alright, you three, the results are in."  
“好了，你们三个，结果出来了。”

Asuka had been running a bar of soap over her arms. The sound of Ritsuko's voice had surprised her, and the jolt had resulted in the soap sliding from her hands. She reached out for the soap, hoping to catch it before it fell, only for it to slip from her hands again. She repeatedly tried to get a firm grip over it, only having it slip from her fingers like an idiot! Finally, she just let the damn thing it the floor, and she picked it up.  
明日香正用一块肥皂擦洗着双臂。听到律子的声音，她吃了一惊，手一抖，肥皂从手中滑落。她伸手去抓肥皂，希望在它落地前接住，却再次让它从手中溜走。她反复尝试牢牢抓住，却像个傻瓜一样一次次让它从指间滑脱！最终，她索性任由那该死的东西掉在地上，然后捡了起来。

"What is it now?" Asuka snarled.  
"又怎么了？" 明日香咆哮道。

"Is there a problem?" Rei asked from behind the partition of the three shower stalls.  
"有什么问题吗？" 丽从三个淋浴间的隔板后问道。

"No, no problems. Everyone's doing great," Ritsuko said, "But we have a different problem."  
"不，没问题。大家都做得很好，" 律子说，"但我们有个不同的问题。"

"Yes," Maya stated. “是的，”玛雅说道。

That girl Maya had to be a lesbian. Asuka would bet all the money in her bank account that she had a crush on Ritsuko. The fact that she could see Asuka's silhouette disgusted her. She was probably having a grand old time in her fantasy land.  
那个叫玛雅的女孩肯定是个女同性恋。明日香敢用她银行账户里的所有钱打赌，她一定对律子有意思。她能看到明日香的轮廓这件事让她感到恶心。她大概正在她的幻想世界里乐得不可开交吧。

"You see, guys," Ritsuko said, "While you are progressing smoothly, we think your improvement has hit something of a roadblock."  
“你们看，伙计们，”律子说，“虽然你们进展顺利，但我们认为你们的进步遇到了一些障碍。”

"What?" Asuka stammered. A road block? That could not, would not happen. She had to be better than everyone. Ah well. She was still ahead of that idiot, anyway.  
"什么？" 明日香结巴了。路障？这不可能，也不会发生。她必须比所有人都强。唉，反正她还是领先那个白痴。

"The fact is, with the exception of Shinji, you guys have virtually stopped increasing your sync ratio."  
"事实是，除了真嗣，你们几乎都停止了同步率的增长。"

Wait, aside from the idiot? Asuka felt a chill run through her body for the briefest moment before indignation filled her.  
等等，除了那个白痴？明日香感到一阵寒意在体内掠过，转瞬即逝，随即被愤怒填满。

"What? Really?" Shinji stammered from the next stall over.  
"什么？真的吗？" 真嗣从隔壁隔间结结巴巴地回应道。

Asuka wanted to punch him.  
明日香真想揍他一顿。

"And even your development is slowing down," Maya added.  
"就连你的成长也在放缓，" 玛雅补充道。

Victory! She knew there was no way that idiot could possibly beat her anyway. He was just a greenhorn, after all.  
胜利了！她知道那个白痴无论如何都不可能打败她。毕竟，他只是个新手。

"However, we think you can still improve, there's just something blocking the way is all," Ritsuko continued, "So we've decided to let you see the NERV psychologist to—"  
“然而，我们认为你仍有进步空间，只是有些障碍罢了，”律子继续说道，“所以我们决定让你去见 NERV 的心理医生——”

"Wait, psychologist?!" Asuka stammered, "What do you think we are? Crazy?"  
“等等，心理医生？！”明日香结巴道，“你们以为我们是疯了吗？”

A psychologist. For the briefest moment, an image of a doll materialized in her mind's eye, a doll hanging by a noose from the ceiling of a room, before she returned to her normal state of mind.  
一位心理学家。在极短暂的一瞬，她的脑海中浮现出一个玩偶的形象，那玩偶被一根绳索吊在房间的天花板上，随后她恢复了正常的心境。

"I don't need a psychologist," Asuka grumbled as the idiot spoke up.  
“我不需要心理学家，”明日香咕哝着，这时那个白痴开口了。

"Uh, are you sure that's honestly necessary?"  
“呃，你确定这真的有必要吗？”

Finally the idiot spoke with some sense!  
终于，那个白痴说出了些有道理的话！

"Absolutely," Ritsuko replied, "We aren't saying you're insane or anything."  
"当然，" 律子回答，"我们并不是说你疯了或者什么的。"

"Sure you aren't." "当然不是。"

"But since the sync tests are connected to your mental state of mind, we think that if you're more at ease with yourself, maybe you'll synchronize more thoroughly than you would normally."  
"但既然同步测试与你的心理状态有关，我们认为如果你能更自在地面对自己，或许你能比平时更彻底地同步。"

"I'm perfectly fine," Asuka laughed, "It's gonna be a waste of time."  
"我完全没问题，"明日香笑着说，"这会浪费时间的。"

"I see nothing disagreeable."  
"我看不出有什么不妥。"

"I guess I'll go." “我想我还是去吧。”

And thus she recalled that moment until they pulled up in front of the damn shrink's building a good distance from NERV headquarters. Why did it have to be so damn far away, anyway? Misato opened the door, staggering a little bit, before telling the children to get out of the car.  
于是她回想起那一刻，直到他们停在了离 NERV 总部相当远的心理医生大楼前。为什么非要这么远不可呢？美里打开车门，踉跄了一下，然后告诉孩子们下车。

Naturally, Asuka got out first.  
自然，明日香第一个下了车。

"Uh, is this the place?" Shinji asked, looking at the building.  
"呃，是这里吗？" 真嗣问道，打量着建筑物。

"Well, what do you think, stupid?" snarled Asuka, "We stopped here. We're getting out of the car. It's kinda obvious that this is the place, you stupid idiot!"  
"哼，你觉得呢，笨蛋？" 明日香咆哮道，"我们停在这儿了。我们要下车了。很明显这就是地方，你这个大傻瓜！"

"You don't need to get all defensive about it," Shinji mumbled, revealing the tiny backbone he had.  
"你没必要这么防备，" 真嗣咕哝着，显露出他那微不足道的骨气。

"Don't worry, Shinji. Asuka's just worried the psychologist will find out she has some sort of horrible disorder," Misato joked.  
"别担心，真嗣。明日香只是担心心理医生会发现她有什么可怕的病症。" 美里开玩笑道。

"No I'm not!" Asuka snarled.  
"我才没有！" 明日香咆哮道。

"That theory sounds plausible," Rei replied, glancing up at Asuka, apathetic.  
"这个理论听起来挺合理的，" 绫波回答，抬头瞥了一眼明日香，表情冷漠。

They walked up the stairs through the complex building, which was apparently not solely devoted to the NERV psychologist but also a lot of other psychologists and specialists. Finally, however, they found the appropriate room, and waltzed right in. Naturally, Asuka took the most comfortable seat closest to the door out. The seat was right beside Shinji, the idiot, who was stuck in the middle of her and Rei. Well, at least the idiot would have a side-by-side comparison of what a real woman looked like, and not that stupid Wonder Girl.  
他们穿过这座复杂建筑的楼梯，这里显然不仅供 NERV 的心理学家使用，还有许多其他心理学家和专家。然而，最终他们找到了合适的房间，并径直走了进去。自然，明日香占据了最靠近门口的最舒适座位。这个座位正好在真嗣，那个笨蛋，旁边，他夹在她和绫波之间。好吧，至少这个笨蛋可以近距离比较一下真正的女人是什么样子，而不是那个愚蠢的奇迹女孩。

Misato walked up to the desk, and informed them that "the special children" had arrived. Special children? What the hell did that mean? Special cases. What were they to this bastard shrink anyway?  
美里走到桌前，告诉他们“特殊的孩子”已经到了。特殊的孩子？这到底是什么意思？特殊案例。对这个混蛋心理医生来说，他们又算什么呢？

"Alright. The doctor will see Rei Ayanami now," Misato said when she returned to them. Rei acknowledged the summons, pushed herself up, and walked to the door opposite them.  
“好的。医生现在要见绫波零。”美里回到他们身边时说道。绫波回应了召唤，站起身，走向对面的一扇门。

Finally, she was gone. That freak bothered her so much, like a stupid doll. Like an emotionless, damn—  
终于，她走了。那个怪胎让她烦透了，像个愚蠢的玩偶。像个没有感情的，该死的——

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She turned at the sound of her name to the idiot on her left. "Oh, what is it?" she asked, mildly.  
她听到自己的名字，转向左边那个白痴。“哦，什么事？”她略带不耐烦地问。

"Well, I was thinking, what is this person going to be like? Have you ever been to a psychologist before?" he asked.  
“嗯，我在想，这个人会是什么样的？你以前去看过心理医生吗？”他问道。

"Nope, but I know some people who did." A chill ran up her spine as the image of a broken woman in a hospital bed cradling a doll sprang into her mind's eye, but she suppressed that image. "They ask you a bunch of stupid questions. How was your childhood? That's very interesting. What are your dreams like? What does this stupid inkblot look like? And then when you answer all the questions they say you have an Oedipus Complex or something like that?"  
"没有，但我认识一些经历过的人。" 当她脑海中浮现出一个在医院病床上抱着玩偶的破碎女人的形象时，一股寒意窜上她的脊背，但她压制住了那个画面。"他们会问你一堆愚蠢的问题。你的童年怎么样？这很有趣。你的梦是什么样的？这个愚蠢的墨迹看起来像什么？然后当你回答完所有问题后，他们就说你有俄狄浦斯情结或其他类似的东西？"

"Oedipus Complex?" "俄狄浦斯情结？"

"Means you want to have sex with your mom and kill your dad."  
"意思是你想和你的妈妈发生性关系并杀死你的爸爸。"

This explanation left Shinji staring wide eyed at Asuka as he stammered, "But that's crazy!"  
这个解释让真嗣瞪大了眼睛盯着明日香，结结巴巴地说：“但这太疯狂了！”

"That's why I hate psychologists. They don't tell you anything useful."  
“这就是我讨厌心理学家的地方。他们从不告诉你任何有用的东西。”

The moments passed in silence for what seemed to be hours, until that damned Wonder Girl walked through those doors into the waiting room. Shinji pushed himself up the moment she walked in, only to approach Rei. Why was he so enthusiastic in greeting her, anyway?  
时间在沉默中流逝，仿佛过了几个小时，直到那个该死的奇迹少女走进了等候室。真嗣一看到她走进来就站起身，径直走向绫波。话说回来，他为什么这么热情地迎接她呢？

"So what is it like, Rei?" Shinji asked.  
"丽，感觉怎么样？" 真嗣问道。

"It was agreeable." Was that a smile on Rei's face? That must be one of the signs of the Apocalypse! Rei smiling! Now Asuka was scared. What the hell had gone in that room!?  
"感觉还不错。" 那是丽在微笑吗？这一定是世界末日的征兆之一！丽在微笑！现在明日香感到害怕了。那个房间里到底发生了什么！？

"The doctor will see Shinji Ikari now."  
"医生现在要见真嗣·碇。"

And so she spent the next session alone. In a waiting room. With a damn doll.  
于是她独自度过了下一节。在一个等候室里。还他妈的有个娃娃。

"Are you worried?" Rei asked Asuka after a long period of silence.  
"你担心吗？" 长时间的沉默后，丽问明日香。

"Not in the least," Asuka laughed.  
"一点儿也不，" 明日香笑着说。

"Then why are you so jittery?"  
"那为什么你这么紧张？"

"Jittery? What do you mean jittery?"  
"紧张？你说的紧张是什么意思？"

"You're tapping your foot irregularly."  
"你在不规律地跺脚。"

Asuka stamped on her foot with her other foot. "I don't know what you're talking about, Wonder Girl."  
明日香用另一只脚踩在自己的脚上。“我不知道你在说什么，神奇女孩。”

Eventually, Shinji walked through the doors, smiling. Alright, now this was strange. Two happy costumers to some stupid psychologist? What the hell was going on? "Alright, now this is ridiculous!" Asuka snarled, pushing herself up, and rushing at that idiot, "Just what the hell is going on?"  
最终，真嗣笑着穿过了门。好吧，现在这很奇怪。两个快乐的顾客去找某个愚蠢的心理医生？到底发生了什么？“好吧，这太荒谬了！”明日香咆哮着，推开自己站起来，冲向那个白痴，“到底发生了什么鬼事？”

"It wasn't like you said, Asuka," Shinji said, raising his eyebrows, "The psychologist never asked about our childhood or told me I had an Ed-You-Poose complex."  
“和你说的不一样，明日香，”真嗣扬起眉毛说，“心理医生从没问过我们的童年，也没说我有什么‘依赖型人格障碍’。”

"Oedipus! Oedipus Complex!" Asuka snarled before turning on the secretary, "What? Is it my turn now!?"  
"俄狄浦斯！俄狄浦斯情结！" 明日香咆哮着转向秘书，"什么？现在轮到我了！？"

"That it is," the secretary stammered, a tad taken aback.  
"确实如此，" 秘书结巴道，略显惊讶。"

Asuka marched to the door, slammed it open, and stamped her way down another hallway. Why the hell were they so many damn hallways in this stupid complex anyway? They couldn't just be one room where they threw all this crap in, could there? Could there!?  
明日香大步走向门口，猛地推开门，踏着重重的步伐穿过另一条走廊。这该死的建筑里为什么有这么多走廊？难道就不能有一个房间把所有这些乱七八糟的东西都扔进去吗？难道不行吗！？

Finally, she reached the end of the hall, and opened the door at the end. The walls were lined with shelves of books. Not all of which were psychology books, which surprised Asuka. Rather, a few of the shelves were devoted purely to manga. Sitting at a desk, a cluttered desk at that with many pictures of smiling faces and smiling children was a woman wearing glasses.  
终于，她走到了走廊的尽头，打开了那扇门。墙壁上排列着书架，上面摆满了书籍。并非所有都是心理学书籍，这让明日香有些惊讶。事实上，有几个书架纯粹是用来放漫画的。在一张凌乱的桌子前坐着一位戴眼镜的女性，桌上堆满了笑脸和孩子们的笑脸照片。

"Asuka, right?" the woman asked. She had short black hair cut into a bob, a sweet rounded face. She looked a little pudgy, but Asuka wouldn't have called her plump at all. She looked a little cute, but no where near as pretty as she, Asuka, was.  
“明日香，对吧？”女人问道。她留着齐耳的黑色短发，脸庞圆润甜美。看起来有点丰满，但明日香绝不会说她胖。她看起来有点可爱，但远不及明日香自己漂亮。

"You know, I was expecting a guy, truthfully," Asuka said, standing at the door.  
“说实话，我原本以为会是个男的，”明日香站在门口说道。

"You know, everyone says that," the woman laughed a little before saying, "Take a seat over there."  
"你知道的，大家都这么说，" 女人轻笑了一声，接着说，"去那边坐下吧。"

Asuka had expected a sprawled out couch for her to lye down, but rather found a recliner, which she tossed herself down on. It was rather comfortable. The doctor smiled as Asuka reclined the chair so that the back was parallel to the ground. "When I first got that, I always did that."  
明日香本以为会有一张可以躺下的沙发，结果却看到了一张躺椅，她便顺势坐了上去。感觉相当舒适。医生看着明日香把椅背放平，微笑着说："我第一次用那张椅子时，也总是这样。"

Asuka straightened her chair up before mumbling, "That's so childish."  
明日香把椅子调正，然后低声嘀咕道："真是孩子气。"

"Maybe, but it's always good to have a bit of innocence, I think," the doctor said, smiling.  
"或许吧，但我认为总该保留一点纯真。" 医生微笑着说。

Asuka didn't respond. 明日香没有回应。

"My name is Dr. Michiko Tamako, or just Dr. Tamako for short. Or Michiko. Whichever you prefer."  
"我叫 Michiko Tamako 医生，简称 Tamako 医生也可以。或者直接叫我 Michiko。随你喜欢。"

"I'll take the Dr. Tamako, thank you very much," Asuka mumbled.  
"我要塔穆子医生，非常感谢，" 明日香咕哝道。

"You're defensive, aren't you?" Dr. Tamako asked, smiling slightly.  
"你很戒备，不是吗？" 塔穆子医生问道，微微一笑。

"I'm not falling for your act is all," Asuka laughed, a smirk on her face, "I know what you're doing. You're going to make me feel all comfortable and relaxed, and make you think you're my friend or something, and then bombard me with questions until I start crying and having a damn epiphany or something."  
"我才不会上你的当呢，" 明日香笑着，脸上带着一丝嘲讽，"我知道你在做什么。你想让我感到舒适放松，让我以为你是我的朋友之类的，然后不停地问我问题，直到我开始哭泣，突然领悟什么鬼东西。

Dr. Tamako interlocked her soft hands, a smile on her lips, "Well, I'm not going to say you're all wrong. I am trying to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. But I'm not trying to make you think I'm your friend. I'm trying to become your friend. And I'd really rather not see you cry."  
塔摩医生双手轻轻交握，唇边带着微笑，“好吧，我不会说你们都错了。我确实在努力让你感到舒适和放松。但我并不是想让你认为我是你的朋友。我是在努力成为你的朋友。而且我真的不想看到你哭泣。”

All lies, but whatever. Asuka would see what happened. She didn't trust this idiot as far as she could throw her, but whatever.  
全是谎言，但无所谓了。明日香会看到结果的。她对这个白痴的信任程度，就像她能把她扔多远一样有限，但无所谓了。

"Alright. But I'm fine the way I am."  
“好吧。但我这样挺好的。”

"I'm sure you are." "我确信你是。"

What did she mean by that?  
她那话是什么意思？

"Say, that boy who came in here before you. He was pretty cute, huh?"  
"哎，刚才在你之前进来的那个男孩。挺可爱的，对吧？"

Her face flushed as Asuka pushed herself out of the recliner, "What the hell are you babbling about!? That idiot is so stupid! He's spineless and a pervert!"  
她的脸颊因阿斯卡从躺椅上起身而泛红，“你到底在胡说八道些什么？！那个白痴太蠢了！他没骨气还是个变态！”

"He didn't seem too stupid when I talked to him," laughed Dr. Tamako, "In fact, I thought I was kinda cute, truthfully."  
“我和他交谈时，他看起来并不太蠢，”塔摩子博士笑着说，“事实上，我觉得他还挺可爱的，说实话。”

"You lecherous pig! _Dummkof_!" Was this pedophile just like that idiot Misato?!  
“你这个色狼！笨蛋！”这个恋童癖难道和那个白痴美里一样吗？！

"And what about that other girl? Rei? She seemed nice."  
"那另一个女孩呢？丽？她看起来不错。"

"Oh, Wonder Girl?" Asuka snorted, "She'd be nice only if you told her to be. Hell, she doesn't do anything unless you tell her to. I hear her room is a real pigsty."  
"哦，神奇少女？" 明日香嗤之以鼻，"你让她友好她才会友好。见鬼，她什么都不做除非你告诉她去做。我听说她的房间简直是个猪圈。"

"I see. Well, that's your opinion. You're entitled to it," the doctor said, smiling, "So, do you want to play a game?"  
"我明白了。好吧，那是你的看法。你有权持有它，" 医生微笑着说，"那么，你想玩个游戏吗？"

"A game?" Asuka snorted, "What do you think I am? A kid or something?"  
"游戏？" 明日香嗤之以鼻，"你以为我是谁？小孩子吗？"

"Well, if you're afraid you'll lose, I understand," Dr. Tamako said, a proud grin on her face.  
"好吧，如果你害怕会输，我理解，" 田子博士脸上带着得意的笑容说道。

"Alright! I won't lose! I'll play the stupid game!" Asuka snarled, pushing herself up. So this was a challenge on her honor, was it? Well, she'd never back down from that, even if it was against a stupid shrink.  
"好！我不会输的！我要玩这个愚蠢的游戏！" 明日香咆哮着站起身来。这分明是对她荣誉的挑战，不是吗？好吧，她绝不会在这种事上退缩，哪怕对手是个愚蠢的心理医生。

The doctor withdrew a deck of cards from her desk, smiling as she shuffled them. "The name of the game is Rummy. 5000 Rummy, to be exact."  
医生从她的桌子里抽出一副扑克牌，微笑着洗牌。“这个游戏的名称是拉米，确切地说是 5000 拉米。”

"Alright! I'll play the damn game, and I'll kick your butt at it, too!" Her rather plump butt, Asuka wanted to add.  
“好极了！我会玩这个该死的游戏，而且我会把你打得落花流水！”她本想补充说，是相当丰满的屁股，但没说出口。

"Oh, we'll see." As the doctor explained the rules, Asuka felt her blood boil. So this idiot thought she'd be able to beat Asuka? Well, they'd see about that. Oh, they'd see.  
"“哦，我们走着瞧。”当医生解释规则时，明日香感到血液沸腾。这个白痴以为她能打败明日香？好吧，他们很快就会知道结果。哦，他们很快就会看到的。”

"Let's play." "来玩吧。"

As they the game went on, the doctor asked a question, "So, Asuka, you like winning?"  
随着游戏进行，医生问道：“那么，明日香，你喜欢赢吗？”

"Love it." "非常喜欢。"

"Like being the best?" "像成为最好的那样？"

"Who doesn't?" "谁不想呢？"

"Oh, I see. Never can settle for second place?"  
"哦，我明白了。永远不能满足于第二名？"

"Second? No one remembers the second best. They only care about the best. That's the name that everyone remembers. You remember who got second in last year's Olympic Fencing?"  
"第二名？没人记得第二名。他们只关心第一名。那个名字才是人人都记得的。你记得去年奥运会击剑比赛的亚军是谁吗？"

"Nope." "不记得。"

"Remember who got first?"  
"那冠军呢？"

"I don't watch Fencing," Dr. Tamako said, winking.  
"我不看击剑比赛，" 田子博士眨了眨眼说道。

"Oh, it was such a great fight, too," Asuka sighed as she laid down her hand, a victorious smile on her face, "Looks like I win."  
"哦，那场比赛真的很精彩，" 明日香叹了口气，放下手中的牌，脸上露出胜利的微笑，"看来我赢了。"

"Well, not yet, We play until we reach 5000 points."  
"嗯，还没结束呢，我们玩到 5000 分才算完。"

Asuka grinned, "So I get a few more chances to rub your face in the dirt, huh?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑，“所以我还有几次机会把你踩在脚下，嗯？”

"Oh, there will be no face rubbing here, Asuka," Dr. Tamako laughed.  
“哦，这里可不会有踩脸的事，明日香，”玉子博士笑着说。

As the games proceeded, occasionally Dr. Tamako actually pulling ahead of Asuka and occasionally the Second Child knocking the good doctor down a knotch, Asuka started to make small talk. "So who are those kids in the pictures?"  
随着比赛进行，时而玉子博士领先明日香，时而第二适格者让博士稍逊一筹，明日香开始闲聊起来。“那些照片里的孩子是谁？”

"My kids," Dr. Tamako said, smiling, "Proud mother of four."  
"我的孩子们，" 田子博士微笑着说，"四个孩子的骄傲母亲。"

Asuka felt a chill run up her spine the moment the doctor had spoken. An image of a woman cradling a doll in her arms filled her mind's eye for a moment before dissolving into nothingness.  
当医生说完的那一刻，明日香感到一股寒意沿着脊椎升起。她的脑海中瞬间浮现出一个女人怀抱玩偶的画面，随后又消散无踪。

"You want children, Asuka?" Dr. Tamako asked, smiling gently.  
"你想要孩子吗，明日香？" 田子博士轻柔地微笑着问道。"

"Not at all." "一点也不。"

"You should really reconsider. They're really great!"  
"你真的应该重新考虑一下。他们真的很棒！"

"No thanks." "不了，谢谢。"

"And you could have Shinji as the husband."  
"然后你可以让真嗣当丈夫。"

Asuka's face flushed deep red as she rushed to her feet, "Just what the hell are you implying here?!"  
明日香的脸涨得通红，她猛地站起来，“你到底在这里暗示什么？！”

"Nothing. Nothing." "没什么，没什么。"

"It better be nothing! I hate that stupid idiot! He's just so spineless and.…argh!"  
"最好别是什么大事！我讨厌那个愚蠢的白痴！他简直毫无骨气……啊！"

"You best not be distracted, Asuka."  
"你最好别分心，明日香。"

"And why is that?" "为什么这么说？"

"Distractions like that might get in the way of the game," Dr. Tamako said as she placed the winning hand down on the table.  
"那样的干扰可能会影响比赛，" 玉子博士说着，将获胜的手牌放在桌上。

"Damn!" Asuka snarled, snapping her fingers, "Ah well, there's next game! What's the score so far?"  
"该死！" 明日香咆哮道，啪地一声弹了下手指，"算了，还有下一局！目前的比分是多少？"

"Well, you have 4890, while I have…oh, I have 5100. Looks like I win!"  
"嗯，你有 4890 分，而我……哦，我有 5100 分。看来是我赢了！"

Asuka's eyes widened in shock. "Alright! Just how the hell did you do that?!"  
明日香的眼中闪过震惊。“好吧！你到底是怎么做到的？！”

"I have experience," the doctor laughed, "But don't worry. You put up a great fight, so I'm sure—"  
“我有经验，”医生笑着说，“但别担心。你打得很好，所以我确信——”

"That doesn't matter! I have to win!"  
“那不重要！我必须赢！”

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because no one cares about second place!"  
"因为没人关心第二名！"

"Is that so? But who are you fighting against?"  
"是吗？但你是在和谁竞争呢？"

Asuka looked at her. "What are you talking about?"  
绫波看着她。“你在说什么？”

"Who is it that you're trying to beat?" Dr. Tamako asked, a half grin on her lips, "Is it me? Is it Rei? Shinji? I don't think so. I think what you're doing is just beating yourself up."  
"你想打败的是谁？" 玉子博士问道，嘴角挂着半笑，"是我吗？是丽？还是真嗣？我看不是。我觉得你只是在自我折磨。

"What?!" Asuka stammered, "What do you mean I'm beating myself up?"  
"什么？！" 明日香结巴道，"你什么意思，说我自我折磨？

"Listen, Asuka," Dr. Tamako said, looking up at her, "Playing games and winning is great and all, but no one is perfect. Eventually, people lose. It's impossible to win all the time. The fact of the matter is that you don't need to be perfect to be remembered."  
"听着，明日香，" 玉子博士抬头看着她，"玩游戏并获胜固然很好，但没有人是完美的。最终，人们都会输。不可能总是赢。事实是，你不需要完美才能被人记住。

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"Eventually, Shinji will pass you."  
"最终，真嗣会超过你。"

"What?!" That idiot could not, would not pass her! She was too good for that!  
"什么？！" 那个白痴不可能，也不会超过她！她比他强太多了！

"The fact is that he's increasing at an astounding rate. And while he's getting better and better, you're essentially standing still. What you need to do is—"  
"事实是，他的进步速度惊人。而他在不断进步的同时，你基本上停滞不前。你需要做的是——"

"He won't beat me!" "他赢不了我！"

"Let me finish. What you need to do is to acknowledge that you are an amazing pilot, even if you aren't the best."  
"让我说完。你需要做的是承认你是一个了不起的飞行员，即使你不是最顶尖的。"

"I know I'm amazing! Better than everyone else!"  
"我知道我很棒！比其他人都强！"

"You know, the old saying goes that if someone is good, there's always someone better."  
"你知道，俗话说得好，人外有人，天外有天。"

"But there's only three of us. And I'm the best!" she said, smiling confidently.  
""但我们只有三个人。而我，是最棒的！"" 她自信地笑着说。

"Might not always be that way. Might be that something will happen to change that. All you need to do is understand that you might lose. Or fail. It's only human nature. Even in the Olympics, champions are beaten in their later attempts by the second place finishers or even the eigth place finishers."  
"这种局面未必会一直持续。可能会有什么事情改变这一切。你只需要明白，你可能会输，可能会失败。这是人之常情。即使在奥运会上，冠军也会在后来的比赛中被亚军甚至第八名击败。"

"So are you saying I'm going to lose?"  
"所以你是说我一定会输？"

"No. You might be the best forever, but you just need to be a little more humble about it. Winning isn't everything."  
"不。你可能永远都是最好的，但你只需要对此稍微谦虚一点。胜利并不是一切。"

"But no one really cares about someone who isn't the best," Asuka mumbled, "Just like no one cares about that Shinji—"  
"但没有人真正关心不是最好的人，" 明日香喃喃自语，"就像没有人关心那个真嗣——"

"You seem to care a lot."  
"你看起来很在意呢。"

"Will you shut up about that? I don't like the idiot!"  
"你能别再提那事了吗？我可不喜欢那个傻瓜！"

"Sure you don't. Well, try playing some Rummy with the other two, and next time, try a little harder to beat me."  
"当然你不喜欢。好吧，试着和其他两人玩玩拉米牌，下次再努力点赢我吧。"

"Oh, I will beat you! Make no mistake about it!" Asuka said, a confident little smile crawling up her lips.  
"哦，我会打败你的！别怀疑这一点！" 明日香说道，嘴角爬上一丝自信的微笑。

### Chapter 2

"Look, as much as I love Rummy, Asuka, maybe you should just do something a little more productive."  
"听着，虽然我很喜欢留美，明日香，也许你应该做点更有成效的事。"

"Like what?" "比如呢？"

"Like helping Shinji cook, maybe?"  
"比如帮真嗣做饭，怎么样？"

Misato, having drunken a good five cans of beer this far in the game, had lost consecutively for the seventh time in a row. It had been about week since Asuka had to hear that stupid shrink Dr. Tamako. She had had nearly seven days to see around Dr. Tamako's lies and deceit, to see how her mind worked.  
美里已经喝了五罐啤酒，游戏里连续第七次输掉。大约一周前，明日香不得不听那个愚蠢的心理医生玉子博士的唠叨。她几乎有七天的时间来揭露玉子博士的谎言和欺骗，看透她的心思。

"Asuka, don't you have that appointment today?" Shinji asked, placing dishes on the table.  
“明日香，你今天不是有那个预约吗？”真嗣问道，把盘子放在桌上。

"I don't need to go. Why don't you and Wonder Girl go off and enjoy yourselves?"  
“我不需要去。你和 Wonder Girl 干嘛不自己去享受一下？”

"Well, they have gone to two meetings already, and you skipped out," Misato said, frowning.  
"嗯，他们已经参加了两次会议，而你却缺席了。" 美里皱着眉说。

"The office is an hour away. I have a life, you know!" Asuka shrugged off their comment. Dr. Tamako was a fake, a liar, deceitful. She didn't care what happened to her. Hell, if she wasn't a pilot, if she wasn't a champion, that stupid doctor wouldn't give a damn about her period.  
"办公室离这里有一个小时的路程。我也有自己的生活，你知道的！" 明日香耸耸肩，对他们的评论不以为意。田中博士是个骗子，满口谎言，虚伪至极。她不在乎会发生什么。该死，如果她不是一名驾驶员，如果她不是冠军，那个愚蠢的医生才不会在乎她的经期呢。

"So you aren't going?" Misato asked, frowning.  
"所以你不去吗？" 美里皱着眉问。

"Hah! Not at all!" "哈哈！一点也不！"

"That's a shame. And I was so hoping to drive you over there myself, too."  
"真遗憾。我还挺希望能亲自开车送你过去的呢。"

Asuka's ears perked up at the sound of the masculine voice. Her heart began to pound against her ribs as she pushed herself up, spinning on her feet as she sprinted over to the doorway of the shabby apartment. Standing in the open threshold was none other than Kaji! She leapt into his arms, embracing his masculine chest as she shrieked in joy.  
听到那男性的声音，明日香耳朵一竖。她的心跳开始撞击胸腔，她撑起身来，脚下一转，疾跑向破旧公寓的门口。站在敞开的门槛处的，正是加持！她一跃而起，扑进他的怀抱，紧贴着他结实的胸膛，欢快地尖叫起来。

"Kaji!!" she shrieked, her voice high and girly.  
"加治！！"她尖叫道，声音又高又少女。

"Oh, now you want to go?" Misato snorted, "Well, go off with that idiot! See what I care!"  
"哦，现在你想走了？"美里嗤之以鼻，"好吧，跟那个白痴走吧！看我会在乎！"

"Ah, and I really wanted to take you along for the ride, Misato," Kaji said, his voice relaxed.  
"啊，我真的很想带你一起去兜风，美里，"加治说，语气轻松。

"Don't worry about her, Kaji! She's a little tipsy anyway. She wouldn't be any fun," Asuka said, rubbing her cheek against Kaji's chest.  
"别担心她，加持！她反正有点醉了。她不会有什么趣的，" 明日香说着，脸颊蹭着加持的胸膛。

"Uh! Ingrate," Misato mumbled before gulping down an entire can of beer in one go.  
"哼！不知感恩，" 美里咕哝着，一口气喝完了一整罐啤酒。

Well, at least now a real man was bringing her. At least someone who actually had a backbone, unlike that idiot who was essentially at Misato's beck and call. On a choke collar.  
好吧，至少现在有个真正的男人带她去。至少是个有骨气的人，不像那个白痴，基本上是美里呼之即来挥之即去的。像被拴在项圈上一样。

As Kaji opened the door, Asuka leapt into her seat at Kaji's side. As Kaji drove down the street, Asuka pouted slightly. "I'm hungry."  
当加持打开车门时，明日香一跃而起，坐在了加持的旁边。随着加持驾车驶过街道，明日香微微撅起了嘴。“我饿了。”

"You mean you didn't actually eat food at Misato's?" Kaji asked, a tad skeptically.  
“你是说，你没在美里那儿吃东西？”加持略带怀疑地问道。

"Well, if that idiot Shinji actually cooked the food at a reasonable hour, this wouldn't have happened."  
“哼，要是那个笨蛋真嗣能在合适的时间把饭做好，就不会有这种事了。”

"Do you want me to order something for you on the way?"  
"回去的路上要我帮你带点什么吗？"

"You mean it?" This was what a real man would do. He would honestly do his best to make sure that the beautiful girl would receive what she wanted and how she wanted it. This was the beauty of men like Kaji. Adult, not perverted!  
"你是说真的？" 这才是一个真正的男人会做的事。他会尽全力确保那位美丽的女孩得到她想要的，并且按照她的意愿。这就是像加持这样的男人的魅力所在。成熟，而非猥琐！

"Certainly. I'll get it for you after the appointment."  
"当然，会面结束后我就去给你买。"

Asuka felt her heart stop.  
明日香感到心脏仿佛停止了跳动。

"So I'll have the wait?"  
“所以我要等吗？”

"Don't worry. The appointment won't be very long. A half hour at most."  
“别担心。预约不会太久的，最多半小时。”

"And an hour trip there."  
"去那儿要一个小时。"

"You can save the world in a gigantic Eva but you can't wait an hour and a half for food," Kaji sighed, "When I was a child, younger than you, even, things weren't quite so simple."  
"你可以在巨大的 Eva 里拯救世界，却不能等一个半小时吃顿饭，""加持叹了口气，""我像你这么年轻的时候，事情可没这么简单。"

Consumed by her hunger, time seemed to go by at the pace of a mold covered sloth weighed down by an anchor that had been embedded in the Earth. By the time they did arrive, Asuka was about to puke from her hunger. Kaji exited the car and, like the gentleman he was, opened the door up for her. She nearly collapsed out of the car, dying of hunger.  
被饥饿吞噬的她，时间仿佛以长满霉菌的树懒拖着锚嵌入地球的速度流逝。当他们终于到达时，明日香几乎要饿得吐出来。加持下车后，像一位绅士一样为她打开车门。她几乎是从车里跌出来的，饿得奄奄一息。

They proceeded to the waiting room, where the secretary said, without hesitation, "The doctor will see you now."  
他们走进候诊室，秘书毫不犹豫地说：“医生现在可以见你们了。”

"See? Door-to-door service," Kaji said, patting Asuka on the back, "After this is over, I'll make sure you eat something delicious."  
“看吧？上门服务，”加持拍了拍明日香的背，“这事结束后，我一定让你吃顿好的。”

"Thanks a lot," Asuka moaned, walking down the hallway, and into Dr. Tamako's office.  
"“真是谢谢了，”明日香嘟囔着，沿着走廊走向田子医生的办公室。”

The doctor was seated behind her desk, a smile on her face. "Aren't we late today?"  
医生坐在办公桌后，面带微笑。“我们今天是不是迟到了？”

"Save it," Asuka mumbled, collapsing onto the recliner.  
“省省吧，”明日香咕哝着，瘫倒在躺椅上。

"And you skipped our last appointment."  
“而且你还错过了我们上次的预约。”

"Save it. Do you have any food, by any chance?"  
"省省吧。你碰巧有吃的吗？"

"I have a box of crackers."  
"我有一盒饼干。"

"Can I have them?" "能给我吗？"

Dr. Tamako smiled, "On one condition."  
Dr. Tamako 微笑着说：“有一个条件。”

"And what might that be?" Asuka mumbled.  
“那是什么条件？”Asuka 嘟囔道。

"I want you to answer a question. Each question you answer, I'll give you a cracker," Dr. Tamako responded, smiling.  
“我想让你回答一个问题。每回答一个问题，我就给你一块饼干，”Dr. Tamako 笑着回应。

At this point in time, she was so desperate for food that she'd do anything. Still, she was weary. The thought of food with Kaji gave her some sense of reason, after all. "What kind of questions?"  
此时此刻，她对食物的渴望已到了不择手段的地步。尽管如此，她仍心存戒备。与加持共进餐食的想法毕竟给了她一丝理智。“什么问题？”

"Nothing serious," Dr. Tamako said, "You don't have to answer any questions you don't want to answer. I'll give you a cracker for all the questions you do answer, however, so if you don't like that one, I'll ask you another one. Sound fair?"  
“没什么严肃的，”玉子博士说，“你不必回答任何不想回答的问题。不过，每回答一个问题，我都会给你一块饼干，如果你不喜欢那个问题，我会再问你另一个。听起来公平吗？”

"Fine, whatever," Asuka moaned.  
“好吧，随便，”明日香抱怨道。

"I'll give you a cracker now just because you look really hungry." The doctor tossed a cracker over at Asuka, which she caught without trouble. The cracker was the size of the palm of her hand, and did not satisfy any of her hunger after she consumed it.  
"我现在就给你一块饼干，只是因为你看起来真的很饿。" 医生朝明日香扔了一块饼干，她轻松地接住了。这块饼干有她手掌那么大，吃完后并没有缓解她的饥饿感。

"First of all, why did you miss our last appointment? Be honest."  
"首先，你为什么错过了我们上次的预约？说实话。"

"I didn't want to come. That's all. It's a waste of time. I don't need help."  
"我不想来。就这样。这是浪费时间。我不需要帮助。"

"Fair enough," Dr. Tamako said, tossing a cracker over at Asuka, which she devoured without hesitation, "Second question: who was that man who brought you here?"  
"说得有理，" 塔摩医生说道，随手扔了一块饼干给明日香，她毫不犹豫地吃了下去，"第二个问题：带你来这里的那个男人是谁？"

"You mean Kaji?" Now the doctor was talking Asuka's language. She straightened up in her chair, reverence in her eyes, "He's amazing! He's a real gentleman, perfect! And his little scuffle…AH! Just amazing!"  
"你是说加持吗？" 现在医生说的是明日香的语言了。她坐直了身子，眼中流露出敬意，"他太棒了！真是个绅士，完美无缺！还有他那小小的打斗……啊！简直太精彩了！"

"So you like him? Affectionately?"  
"这么说你喜欢他？有感情的那种？"

"Yes!" Asuka shrieked, before adding, "By the way, I get two crackers now, right? I answered two questions."  
"太好了！" 明日香尖叫道，随后补充说，"对了，我现在可以拿两块饼干，对吧？我回答了两个问题。"

"Certainly," Dr. Tamako replied, tossing both crackers at Asuka, "Now then, what makes him a gentleman?"  
"当然，" 玉子博士回答道，将两块饼干扔给明日香，"那么，他为什么是个绅士呢？"

"He's so mature and adult! Not like those other stupid kids."  
"他非常成熟稳重！不像其他那些愚蠢的小孩。"

"Like Shinji?" "像真嗣那样？"

"Exactly!" "正是！"

"I see. Well, that not withstanding, here's a cracker." Asuka caught the cracker before the doctor continued, "Now, let me ask you, exactly how old is Kaji?"  
"我明白了。好吧，尽管如此，给你一块饼干。" 明日香接住了饼干，医生继续问道，"那么，我问你，加持到底多大了？"

"Hmmm…29, maybe?" "嗯……29 岁，或许？"

The doctor tossed her a cracker before continuing. "How old is Shinji?"  
医生递给她一块饼干，然后继续问道：“真嗣多大年纪了？”

"14."

After Asuka received the cracker, the doctor continued. "And how old are you, again?"  
在明日香接过饼干后，医生继续问：“你多大了，再说一遍？”

"13."

"Pretty mature looking for 13. I would have figured 15, at least."  
"13 岁就看起来这么成熟，我以为至少有 15 岁呢。"

Asuka blushed deep red. "Oh, thanks."  
绫波脸红得深红。"哦，谢谢。"

"I mean, I didn't get boobs like that until I was 17! And that wasn't because of hormones so much as weight gain."  
"我是说，我到 17 岁才有那样的胸部！而且那更多是因为体重增加，而不是荷尔蒙。"

"Well, we can't all be as lucky as I am," Asuka said with a grin.  
"嗯，我们不可能都像我这么幸运，" 明日香笑着说。

"Apparently not. I'd kill for your beauty," Dr. Tamako said, folding her hands up, "Now, do you have a boyfriend other than Kaji?"  
"显然不是。我真羡慕你的美貌，" 环奈博士双手合十说道，"那么，除了加持，你还有其他男朋友吗？"

"A bunch of people have asked me out, but they're all a bunch of immature perverts. They aren't mature enough for my tastes."  
"有不少人向我表白，但他们都是一群不成熟的变态。他们还不够成熟，不符合我的口味。"

"And what are your tastes?"  
"你的口味是什么样的？"

"My tastes? Well, my tastes are…" Asuka thought for a moment. She leaned back in her recliner, scratching her chin. Well, Kaji was so mature, so masculine, and that idiot Shinji was just a coward who couldn't stand up for himself. But why was it that when she thought of that idiot coward that her stomach twisted and she wished for his arms to wrap around her body?  
"我的口味？嗯，我的口味是……" 明日香想了一会儿。她向后靠在躺椅上，挠了挠下巴。嗯，加持是那么成熟，那么有男子气概，而那个笨蛋真嗣只是个不敢为自己挺身而出的懦夫。但为什么每当她想到那个笨蛋懦夫时，她的胃就会纠结，渴望他的双臂环绕她的身体？

She turned white. She shook her head until the image of that idiot embracing her left her head.  
她的脸色变得苍白。她摇了摇头，直到那个笨蛋拥抱她的画面从脑海中消失。

"What's wrong?" "怎么了？"

"Nothing. Nothing at all."  
"没什么。一点事也没有。"

"So what's your answer?" "那你的答案是什么？"

Asuka was about to answer when she realized she didn't have an answer. "I don't know, really. I guess it's a case-by-case basis."  
明日香正要回答，却意识到自己并没有答案。“我真的不知道。我想这得看具体情况吧。”

"Case-by-case, huh?" Dr. Tamako repeated, nodding, "I guess that makes sense. I mean, you can't really define who you're going to fall in love with until you've actually fallen in love."  
“具体情况，是吗？”田子博士重复道，点头表示同意，“我想这说得通。我是说，不到真正爱上一个人，你无法定义你会爱上谁。”

"Exactly." “正是如此。”

"Someone you're willing to spend the rest of your life with."  
"一个你愿意与之共度余生的人。"

"Yup." "嗯哼。"

"Someone who you can imagine holding you close."  
"一个你能想象紧紧拥抱你的人。"

"Sure." "当然可以。"

"Someone like Shinji." "像真嗣那样的人。"

"Abso—WAIT A SECOND!!" Asuka stammered, pushing herself, "What are you saying?!"  
"绝——等等！！" 明日香结巴着，推开自己，"你在说什么？！"

"Oh, nothing at all, it's just when I mentioned before about what kind of man you like you turned all red and started shaking your head. I assumed that meant you saw something you would rather not want to. Still, the smile on your face before it made it seem as though you were enjoying that image."  
"哦，没什么，只是之前提到你喜欢什么样的男人时，你满脸通红，拼命摇头。我以为那意味着你看到了一些你宁愿不想看到的东西。不过，你之前的笑容让人觉得你似乎很享受那个画面。"

"No! I just…_gott in himell_…" She collapsed on the recliner before moaning, "I don't like him."  
"不！我只是……该死……" 她瘫倒在躺椅上，呻吟道，"我不喜欢他。"

"Of course you don't. How about we change subjects? What are your feelings toward Rei, hmm?"  
"当然你不会。不如我们换个话题？你对丽有什么感觉，嗯？"

"Wonder Girl?" Asuka laughed, "She's a doll. A robot. You ask her to jump of a bridge, she'd probably ask 'which one'. She's kinda scary, actually."  
"奇迹少女？" 明日香笑了，"她是个玩偶。一个机器人。你让她跳桥，她可能会问'哪一座'。其实她有点吓人。"

"Well, I'm sure she's just a little bit of an introvert."  
"嗯，我相信她只是有点内向罢了。"

"That's an understatement."  
"那简直是轻描淡写。"

"And you are more of an extrovert. You are both on opposite sides of the spectrum."  
"而你更外向。你们俩完全处于光谱的两端。"

"Got that right." "说得太对了。"

"Maybe if you tried to understand her better, though, you'd understand why she's the way she is."  
“也许如果你试着更好地理解她，你就会明白她为什么会是这样。”

Asuka was about to respond, but decided against it. Come to think of it, what did Asuka actually know about Rei, anyway? Virtually nothing. She was just there, occupying space, doing all she could to serve her superiors without complaint. She was like a butler, or a robot.  
明日香正要回应，但又决定不说了。想想看，明日香对绫波丽到底了解多少呢？几乎一无所知。她只是在那里，占据着空间，尽其所能地为上级服务而不抱怨。她就像一个管家，或者一个机器人。

Or a doll. 或者一个玩偶。

Once again, the image of a doll hanging by the rafters of a room appeared in her conscious mind, an image she struggled to suppress.  
又一次，她的意识中浮现出房间横梁上悬挂着的一个玩偶的画面，她努力压制着这个影像。

"Well, that's my advice for that situation. Now, what about your home country. I was told you lived in Germany. What's that like?"  
“好吧，这就是我对那个情况的建议。那么，你的祖国呢？我听说你住在德国。那是什么样的？”

"Beautiful. It's so much better than this stupid country!" she laughed, "I mean, really. You people all sleep on the floor. Talk about uncomfortable."  
“美丽极了。比这个愚蠢的国家好太多了！”她笑着说，“我的意思是，真的。你们这里的人都睡在地上。说起来真不舒服。”

"We do have beds here."  
"我们这里确实有床。"

"Not where I live." "我住的地方没有。"

"So you aren't adjusting to the customs?"  
"所以你还没有适应这里的习俗吗？"

"More than just the customs! The kanji are insane! Why can't your language be simple and perfect, like German?"  
"不仅仅是习俗！那些汉字简直疯了！为什么你们的语言不能像德语那样简单完美呢？"

"A matter of opinion, naturally," Dr. Tamako replied, shrugging, "I mean, you can speak Japanese, can't you?"  
"这自然是见仁见智的，" Dr. Tamako 回答道，耸了耸肩，"我是说，你会说日语，不是吗？"

"But I can't read it all too well, which is annoying. Especially in school."  
"但我读得不太好，这很烦人。尤其是在学校里。"

"Are you bright?" "你聪明吗？"

"I graduated college last year."  
"我去年大学毕业了。"

The doctor's expression of surprise was priceless. Asuka loved how her face was contorted in surprise, her eyebrows raised, her skin pale. "College? Really?"  
医生的惊讶表情无价。明日香喜欢她那因惊讶而扭曲的脸，眉毛上扬，肤色苍白。"大学？真的吗？"

"Yup!" "是的！"

"It took me years to get my final degree…" Dr. Tamako cried.  
"我花了好几年才拿到我的最终学位……" 玉子博士哭诉道。

"Well, I didn't get a doctorates or anything like that, but still…"  
"嗯，我虽然没有博士学位什么的，但还是……"

"So did you like college?"  
"那么，你喜欢大学吗？"

"Yeah, it was nice." "嗯，挺不错的。"

"Must be pretty strange, though, being so young there."  
"不过，在那里那么年轻，一定挺奇怪的吧。"

"You get used to it."  
"你会习惯的。"

"You seem to have a pretty old soul."  
"你似乎有着相当古老的灵魂。"

"What does that mean?" "那是什么意思？"

"Means you're mature for your age."  
"意味着你比同龄人更成熟。"

"Guess that's true." "看来确实如此。"

"Maybe too mature." "或许过于成熟了。"

Asuka glanced up at that statement, and eyebrow raised. Too mature? What did that mean? Was her maturity bothering the doctor or something? Well, what did she care? She didn't need that woman's approval anyway.  
听到这话，明日香抬头瞥了一眼，眉毛微微挑起。太成熟了？这是什么意思？难道她的成熟让医生感到困扰吗？哼，她才不在乎那个女人的认可呢。

"You should enjoy childhood while you can, Asuka," Dr. Tamako said, frowning, "You only are young once, and when you're an adult, you'll never have that youth again. God, what I'd give to be in high school again, with that cute uniform. Still, it won't happen. Enjoy it while you can."  
"你应该趁着还能享受童年的时候尽情享受，明日香，"田子医生皱着眉说，"你只有一次年轻的机会，一旦成年，你就再也找不回那份青春了。天啊，我多么希望能再次穿上高中时那可爱的制服，回到校园。不过，这不可能了。趁现在还能享受，就尽情享受吧。"

"So what do you want me to do?" Asuka asked, a little surprised by the speech.  
"那你希望我怎么做呢？"明日香略感惊讶地问道。

"You have to be a kid. A child. You're only 13. You still have many years ahead of you to grow up.  
"你必须还是个孩子。一个小孩。你才 13 岁。你还有很多年的时间去长大。

"But they are so many stupid people!"  
"但有那么多愚蠢的人！"

"They are just as many stupid mature people as stupid kids," Dr. Tamako laughed.  
"愚蠢的成年人也和愚蠢的孩子一样多，" 玉子博士笑着说。

"Really." "真的。"

"Yup!" "是的！"

"Well…hey! Wait a second! What about the crackers?!" Asuka walked over to the desk, and tore the box from the doctor's hands. She shook the remaining contents into her open palm, which consisted of a mere five crumbs. Asuka glanced over at the doctor's lap, only to see crumbs.  
"哎…嘿！等等！那饼干呢？！”明日香走到桌边，从医生手中夺过盒子。她摇了摇，剩下的碎屑落入她张开的手掌，只有五小块。明日香瞥了一眼医生的膝盖，只见上面也有碎屑。

"You ate them while you were smooth talking me, didn't you!?"  
"你在我甜言蜜语的时候把它们吃了，对吧！？"

"Well, keep in mind I haven't eaten either," Dr. Tamako replied, a shaky smile on her lips.  
"嗯，别忘了我也没吃，""玉子博士回答，嘴角带着一丝颤抖的微笑。

"Whatever! I'm leaving!" Asuka snarled, turning her back on the doctor and walking toward the door.  
"随你怎么说！我要走了！""明日香咆哮着，转身背对医生，朝门口走去。

"Asuka. Wait." "明日香，等等。"

She didn't know why she stopped in her steps the moment that voice reached her ears. Nevertheless, the Second Child stopped where she was, and glanced over her shoulder at the doctor. With a slight frown, Dr. Tamako spoke, slowly, "Listen. I want you to do a little homework for me."  
她不知道为什么一听到那个声音就停下了脚步。尽管如此，第二适格者还是停在了原地，回头看向医生。带着一丝皱眉，田子博士缓缓开口道：“听着，我想让你帮我做点作业。”

"Homework?" Asuka didn't like the sound of that. What kind of homework could a therapist assign, anyway?  
"作业？" 明日香不喜欢这个说法。一个心理治疗师能布置什么样的作业呢？

"I want you to do three things. One is that you have to be a little nicer to Shinji and Rei."  
"我希望你做三件事。第一件是，你要对真嗣和绫波稍微好一点。"

"You mean the idiot and Wonder Girl?" What would she gain from that? Being nice to that pervert idiot? And that doll probably didn't have emotions anyway. What was the point of being nice to that damn doll, anyway? It wasn't like she'd respond!  
"你是说那个白痴和奇迹女孩？她能从中学到什么？对那个色狼白痴友好？还有那个玩偶，大概本来就没有感情。对那个该死的玩偶友好有什么意义？又不会回应你！"

"Yes. Just try to be nicer. You don't have to be best friends, but friendly. Maybe you'll grow attached as time passes."  
"是的。试着友好一些。你们不必成为最好的朋友，但至少要友善。也许随着时间的推移，你会逐渐产生感情。"

"Alright, I get it. Next?"  
"好吧，我明白了。下一个？"

"I want you to figure out what you want in a life partner. A lover. And I want you to be honest, alright?"  
"我希望你能想清楚你想要的生活伴侣是什么样的。一个爱人。而且我要你诚实，好吗？"

"Whatever." "随便。"

"Alright. And three, I want you to congratulate someone on doing something better than you."  
"好吧。第三点，我希望你能祝贺某人在某件事上做得比你更好。"

"Wait, WHAT!?" Asuka stammered, jumping to her feet, "What does that have to do with anything?"  
"等等，什么！？" 明日香结巴着，猛地站起身，"这和任何事情有什么关系？"

"Do you remember what we discussed last session?"  
"你还记得我们上次讨论的内容吗？"

"Yes! Of course I do!"  
"是的！当然我知道！"

"Well, it correlates with that," Dr. Tamako said, frowning, "If you were to seriously fail something, I'm sure you'd be devastated. That's the truth. I don't want to see you devastated. So just try to understand that you don't have to be the best all the time. The stress is really unhealthy."  
"嗯，这与那有关，""玉子博士皱着眉说，""如果你真的严重失败了，我肯定你会崩溃的。这是事实。我不想看到你崩溃。所以试着理解你不必总是最好的。这种压力真的很不健康。"

"Alright, whatever!" Asuka mumbled. She'd probably lie about everything next session anyway, assuming there even would be a next session.  
"好吧，随便！""明日香咕哝着。她下次咨询时大概会把一切都撒谎过去，假设还会有下次咨询的话。"

"And I'll know if you're lying. I'll have Misato and Kaji on the look out. And Ritsuko, for that matter," said a rather amused Dr. Tamako.  
"如果你撒谎，我会知道的。我会让美里和加持留意着。还有律子，也是一样，" 塔摩利博士带着几分戏谑地说道。

"Kaji wouldn't betray me like that!" stammered Asuka.  
"加持不会那样背叛我的！" 明日香结结巴巴地说。

"Whatever you say," Dr. Tamako replied, smirking, "You can go, if you want, Asuka."  
"随你怎么说，" 塔摩利博士回答，嘴角带着一丝笑意，"如果你想走，明日香，你可以走。"

"Good-bye." “再见。”

Asuka lumbered out of the room, only then remembering just how hungry she was. If that woman hadn't forgotten to give her crackers, then maybe, just maybe, she wouldn't be so damn hungry right now. She was sick by it all.  
明日香拖着沉重的步伐走出房间，这才想起自己有多饿。如果那个女人没忘记给她饼干，也许，只是也许，她现在就不会这么饿得要命了。她对这一切感到厌烦。

In the waiting room, Kaji jumped erect and straight upon Asuka's arrival. He had been talking to the now flustered secretary about something. Knowing Kaji it had been something reasonable and ordinary, though. Probably serious, because that secretary was extremely flustered.  
在等候室里，看到明日香的到来，加持立刻站得笔直。他刚才正和现在显得慌张的秘书谈论着什么。以加持的作风，应该是些合理而平常的事情。可能很严肃，因为那位秘书显得非常慌乱。

"Are you done already?" Kaji asked, raising an eyebrow.  
“你已经好了吗？”加持问道，扬起眉毛。

"Yeah. It was boring," Asuka sighed, walking away, Kaji behind her, "And I'm hungry. So can we get something along the way?"  
“嗯。很无聊，”明日香叹了口气，走开去，加持跟在她后面，“而且我饿了。我们可以在路上吃点什么吗？”

They eventually purchased ramen. While not specifically romantic, it was nice to eat it with Kaji. Still, the doctor's words still haunted Asuka with every mouthful of food. What did she mean by everything she said? What did she mean that Asuka would be devastated if she lost? She would never be devastated because, well, she'd never lose. She was the best, and that was all there was to it. And what was she on about congratulating someone else? Of course she congratulated people other than herself. She congratulated Kaji on being so beautiful. She had thanked Misato for that one time she brought them to that ramen stand after stopping that one angel, right? And she was always nice to Hikari. So what did she mean?  
他们最终买了拉面。虽然不是特别浪漫，但和加持一起吃还是很愉快。然而，医生的那些话仍然在明日香每吃一口食物时萦绕在心头。她说的那些话是什么意思？她说的如果失去会让她崩溃是什么意思？她永远不会崩溃，因为她永远不会输。她是最好的，仅此而已。还有，她说的祝贺别人是什么意思？当然她也会祝贺自己以外的人。她祝贺加持如此英俊。她感谢过美里那次在阻止那个使徒后带他们去那个拉面摊，对吧？而且她对光总是很友好。那她到底是什么意思呢？

And she had told the doctor about what she looked for in a life partner. Was she hard of hearing or something? Well, that didn't matter anyway. None of it mattered. Not even the being nicer to Shinji or Rei thing. That was all but useless. She was sure that something would happen if she didn't comply, but she refused to acknowledge it. Whatever, she'd probably just tell Shinji that he cooked food good or tell Rei that she wasn't a complete idiot. Whatever. No big deal.  
她曾向医生透露过自己对生活伴侣的期望。难道她听力有问题吗？不过，这也不重要了。什么都不重要。甚至对真嗣和绫波好一点也无所谓。那都是徒劳的。她确信如果不照做会有什么后果，但她拒绝承认。随便吧，她大概只会告诉真嗣他做饭好吃，或者告诉绫波她不是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。随便了，没什么大不了的。

None at all. 一点也没有。

After eating her fill of ramen, the two of them started off towards Misato's apartment. As they drove down the road, Asuka spoke up, "Kaji, ever go to one of those shrinks before?"  
吃饱了拉面后，两人动身前往美里小姐的公寓。在驾车行驶的路上，明日香开口问道：“加持，你以前去过那些心理医生那儿吗？”

"A psychologist? Certainly."  
"心理学家？当然。"

"What? Even you?" But Kaji was so sane, so ordinary. Was it forced upon him, as Dr. Tamako was forced upon her?  
"什么？连你也是？但加持那么理智，那么普通。这是强加给他的吗，就像玉子医生强加给她一样？"

"Well, everyone needs help once in a while. No one can just stand alone without a helping hand. Everyone needs a light in the darkness."  
"嗯，每个人偶尔都需要帮助。没有人能独自站立而不需要援手。每个人都需要黑暗中的一束光。"

"That makes sense, I suppose," Asuka admitted. What he was saying made sense. Still, she didn't need help right now. She was perfectly fine. Beautiful. A champion. Why would someone like her need help, anyway?  
"这么说也有道理，我想，" 明日香承认道。他说的确实有道理。不过，她现在并不需要帮助。她一切都好。美丽动人。是个冠军。像她这样的人，又怎么会需要帮助呢？

And then the image of her mother hanging from the ceiling exploded through her cranium, along with the haunting sound of her voice saying, weakly, "Come die with me."  
紧接着，她母亲悬吊在天花板上的画面如爆炸般冲击她的脑海，伴随着那幽灵般微弱的声音："和我一起死吧。"

"What's wrong, Asuka?" Kaji asked, glancing over at her with a concerned expression on his face, "You're really pale."  
"怎么了，明日香？" 加持问道，转头看向她，脸上带着关切的表情，"你脸色真的很苍白。"

"It's nothing," Asuka said, smiling in spite of the grizzly image in her mind, "Nothing at all! I'm perfectly fine."  
"没什么，" 明日香说道，尽管脑海中浮现出可怕的画面，她还是笑了笑，"一点事都没有！我完全没事。"

"If you say so." "你这么说的话。"

Eventually, Asuka returned home. Kaji said he wanted to talk to Misato personally, and walked Asuka up to the front door. Misato answered it, wearing a tank top and short shorts. Upon seeing Kaji's face, she attempted shoving the door shut. Had it not been for Kaji holding it open, she would have succeeded.  
最终，明日香回到了家。加持说他想亲自和美里谈谈，于是陪明日香走到前门。美里开门时穿着背心和短裤。一看到加持的脸，她试图把门关上。要不是加持撑着门，她早就成功了。

"Now, I know my presence must be electrifying, but you don't need to go to such measures to keep me out, Misato," Kaji said.  
"现在，我知道我的出现一定很震撼，但你不必采取如此手段来阻止我，美里，" 加持说。

"Only reason I'm not shoving you out of the room is because Asuka needs to come in," Misato grumbled.  
"我没把你赶出房间的唯一原因是因为明日香需要进来，" 美里咕哝道。

"Very true, but I have to ask you about that event in a couple of nights. The wedding."  
"确实如此，但我得问你关于那晚的事。婚礼的事。"

"Yes, what about it?" Misato asked as Asuka weaved underneath her arm and into the room.  
“是的，怎么了？”美里问道，而明日香则从她胳膊下钻过，进入了房间。

The first thing she noticed was the lack of Shinji. He must be asleep or something. That idiot just couldn't stay awake for his life. Or perhaps he was just isolating himself in his room with that stupid tape player of his. It was the 21st Century! Why couldn't he upgrade to digital music storage like the rest of them, anyway?  
她首先注意到的是真嗣不在。他肯定是在睡觉或者什么的。那个白痴就是没法保持清醒。或者他可能只是把自己关在房间里，用他那愚蠢的磁带播放器。这可是 21 世纪了！他为什么就不能像其他人一样升级到数字音乐存储呢？

The second thing she noticed was the bowl on the table. It was wrapped in clear wrap, a pair of chopsticks lying at its side. A post-it note on the surface read "For Asuka".  
她注意到的第二件事是桌上的碗。它被保鲜膜包裹着，旁边放着一双筷子。贴在表面的便签上写着“给明日香”。

For a moment, all Asuka could do was stare at it. Who had saved it for her? Misato? Shinji? Had they known she would be hungry and saved it for her?  
有那么一会儿，明日香只能盯着它看。是谁为她保存了这份食物？美里？真嗣？他们是否知道她会饿，特意为她留着？

"Doesn't matter what time I tell him. He's probably going to be late anyway, just like he was now," Misato mumbled as he walked away from the locked door.  
“我告诉他几点都没关系。他反正多半会迟到，就像现在这样，”美里咕哝着，从锁着的门边走开。

"Hey, Misato," Asuka asked, glancing over her shoulder, "Who saved that food?"  
“嘿，美里，”明日香回头问道，“那份食物是谁留的？”

"Oh, Shinji felt bad for you because you left before the meal started, so he saved it for you. It was really delicious warm. Want me to warm it up?"  
“哦，真嗣觉得你没吃到饭就走了，挺可怜的，所以给你留了一份。热乎的时候真的很好吃。要我帮你热一下吗？”

Asuka was silent for a moment before saying, "I already ate. I don't need it."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后说：“我已经吃过了。不需要了。”

Despite this, she still walked over to the microwave, and opened it up to warm up the bowl of food.  
尽管如此，她还是走到微波炉前，打开它，准备加热那碗食物。

### Chapter 3

**Part Three 第三部分**

"Uh, Asuka?" “呃，明日香？”

"What is it, Hikari?" "什么事，光？"

They were cleaning the classroom after school one evening, across from that idiot and doll. They were so consumed by their work that they didn't even notice that the two friends were long done with their own work. Not to mention that those two were holding her up from actually getting on with her arrival home.  
那天傍晚放学后，他们正在教室里打扫卫生，对面是那个白痴和玩偶。他们全神贯注于自己的工作，甚至没注意到那两个朋友早已完成了自己的任务。更别提那两人还拖着她，让她没法早点回家。

"What was going on last night?" Hikari asked, "I called Misato's, but they told me you weren't there."  
“昨晚怎么了？”光问，“我给美里家打电话，但他们说你不在那儿。”

"I was at a stupid shrink," Asuka grumbled, "I don't have a choice."  
“我去看了一个愚蠢的心理医生，”明日香抱怨道，“我别无选择。”

"I think I understand," Hikari replied, shrugging.  
"我想我明白了，" 光回答道，耸了耸肩。

Asuka had thought she'd ask her more questions. Wasn't she curious why Asuka was going to a shrink? What they were talking about? Why was Hikari acting as though it were something ordinary and insignificant? Was she missing something?  
明日香本以为她会问更多问题。难道她不好奇明日香为什么要去看心理医生？他们在谈些什么？为什么光表现得好像这是件普通且无关紧要的事？她是不是漏掉了什么？

"It's so annoying! I don't need a stupid shrink," Asuka whined.  
"真是烦人！我不需要什么愚蠢的心理医生，" 明日香抱怨道。

"Ah, it can't be so bad," Hikari replied, "I went to a psychologist for a little while after my mother died."  
"啊，不会那么糟糕的，" 光回答道，"我母亲去世后，我曾短暂地去看过心理医生。"

"Wait, you went to a psychologist?" Asuka stammered, staring in awe at her friend. How could she, such a perfectly ordinary girl, need to go to a psychologist? Why would she need to go, anyway? She was so normal, so ordinary, so sane. Why would she need to go to a damn shrink?  
"等等，你去看过心理医生？" 明日香结结巴巴地说，惊讶地看着她的朋友。她这样一个普通得不能再普通的女孩，怎么会需要去看心理医生呢？无论如何，她那么正常，那么普通，那么理智。她为什么要去看那种该死的心理医生？

"Well, I needed to talk to someone," Hikari said, scratching the back of her neck, "I mean, who was I going to talk to? My sisters were all just devastated. Our father was just so concerned, and devastated himself for that matter. He found a good psychologist, and we all went as a family."  
"嗯，我需要找个人谈谈，" 光说着，挠了挠后颈，"我是说，我还能找谁呢？我的姐妹们都悲痛欲绝。我们的父亲也非常关心，他自己也为此感到悲痛。他找到了一位不错的心理医生，我们全家一起去看了。"

A family? Two images emerged in Asuka's mind, both side-by-side. One was of her father, making love with her future stepmother as Asuka's real mother was stroking the check of a doll. The other image, which surprised her very much, involved Misato and Kaji with Shinji and that doll Rei.  
一个家庭？两个画面在明日香脑海中浮现，并排而立。一个是她的父亲，与她未来的继母缠绵，而她的亲生母亲正抚摸着一个玩偶的脸颊。另一个画面让她大为惊讶，是美里和加持与真嗣以及那个玩偶绫波。

Why the hell was Rei in that picture anyway?  
为什么绫波会出现在那幅画面里？

"Everyone needs to talk to someone, Asuka," Hikari said, smiling.  
“每个人都需要和某个人谈谈，明日香，” 光笑着说。

"Not me!" Asuka laughed, "I'm fine the way I am."  
“我才不需要！” 明日香笑着说，“我这样挺好的。”

Hikari smiled gently, "Well, what about a boyfriend."  
光温柔地笑了笑，“那么，男朋友呢？”

Again, the image of that idiot appeared in her brain. She wanted to rip the image of that Third Child's face out of her mind's eye, but if she tried clawing open her scalp, she mind look a little unstable in front of Hikari. She resisted the urge, and replied, in a strained voice, "Well, most guys are so immature, too."  
那个白痴的形象再次在她脑中闪现。她想把那个第三适格者的脸从脑海中撕扯出去，但如果她试图抓破头皮，可能会在光子面前显得有些不稳定。她忍住了这种冲动，用勉强压住的声音回答道：“嗯，大多数男生都太不成熟了。”

"Well, my older sister knows this guy who has a really big crush on you," Hikari said, blushing deep red.  
"嗯，我姐姐认识一个家伙，他对你迷恋得不得了，" 光子说着，脸颊深红。

Asuka blushed deep red. A dirty pervert, no doubt. All men were such perverts. She loved how much power she had over men, sure, but the fact that they were just so perverse and immature disgusted her. "No thanks."  
明日香脸颊深红。肯定是个肮脏的变态。所有男人都是这样的变态。她喜欢自己对男人的掌控力，当然，但他们那种变态和不成熟的行为让她感到恶心。"不用了。"

"But he's really nice." "但他真的很不错。"

"I don't think he's my taste," Asuka said, simply.  
"我觉得他不是我的菜，"明日香简单地说道。

Despite her friend persisting, she didn't budge on her decision. The fact of the matter was that Asuka really didn't want to go out with her sister's friend. Hell, she didn't even know the guy! She'd at least like to know what he was like so she didn't waste her time. Besides, if he liked her so much, she might as well go tell her how he felt himself.  
尽管朋友一再坚持，她仍不为所动。事实是，明日香真的不想和她姐姐的朋友出去。见鬼，她甚至都不认识那个家伙！她至少想知道他是什么样的人，以免浪费时间。而且，如果他那么喜欢她，她不妨自己去告诉他他的感受。

Regardless, after school, as she walked beside Shinji and Rei (Rei on the other side of their little trio with Shinji in the middle), immediately after Shinji told them he was going to visit his mother's grave the next day for the anniversary of his mother's death, she told them that she was, in fact, going on a date.  
尽管如此，放学后，当她与真嗣和丽（丽在他们这个小三人组的另一边，真嗣在中间）并肩走着，真嗣刚告诉他们明天要去祭拜他母亲的墓，以纪念他母亲的忌日，她随即告诉他们，实际上，她要去约会。

"Wow, congratulations," Shinji said, a little surprised. Was he disappointed?  
“哇，恭喜啊，”真嗣说道，有点惊讶。他是不是感到失望了？

"What is a date?" Rei asked, annoyed.  
“什么是约会？”丽问道，显得有些不耐烦。

"You don't know?" How could she not know what a date was? After all, she was a doll, not retarded! "How can you not know? Aren't you in the least bit feminine?"  
"你不知道？" 她怎么可能不知道什么是约会？毕竟，她是个玩偶，又不是智障！"你怎么会不知道？你难道一点女性气质都没有吗？"

Rei narrowed her eyes. She was actually showing some form of emotion? How incredibly shocking. "I do not enjoy things like that. Not in particularly, in any case."  
丽眯起了眼睛。她居然表现出了一丝情感？真是令人难以置信。"我不喜欢那种事。无论如何，都不特别喜欢。"

"But how? I mean, ah forget it!" Asuka mumbled, holding her hands behind her head in exasperation.  
"但怎么会这样？我是说，啊，算了！" 明日香咕哝着，双手抱头，显得十分无奈。

She would have said more, but a certain doctor's words had begun echoing in her cranium. Words that said she had to be nicer to those two idiots. Well, one was an idiot. The other was just a brain-dead doll. Nevertheless, she might as well make some effort to be nice to them. Knowing her luck, they'd probably rat her out to that shrink if she wasn't.  
她本想再说些什么，但某位医生的叮嘱开始在她脑海中回响。那些话告诉她必须对那两个白痴好一点。好吧，一个是白痴，另一个只是个脑死亡的玩偶。尽管如此，她不妨努力对他们好一点。以她的运气，如果她不这样做，他们很可能会向那个心理医生告发她。

But how the hell would she go about doing this?!  
但她到底要怎么才能做到这一点？！

The next day, Misato had gone out to go to a wedding of some sort. And, in order to play along, Asuka had left on her "date", which essentially meant she was going to walk around in a fancy dress for a while, get something to eat, and then go back home before it got dark out. She had already left that idiot behind to visit his dead mother, money in hand.  
第二天，美里出门参加某个婚礼去了。为了配合演出，明日香也开始了她的“约会”，其实也就是穿着漂亮的裙子四处走走，吃点东西，然后在天黑前回家。她已经让那个白痴带着钱去探望他那死去的母亲了。

"Pilot Sohryu." “惣流驾驶员。”

That voice. She slowly turned around to see Rei's expressionless face staring right back at her. When had she gotten here? Hell, where did she even come from? Wouldn't she be happier just sitting in her room like a doll on a shelf waiting until someone needed her or something?  
那个声音。她缓缓转过身，看到绫波丽那张毫无表情的脸正盯着她。她是什么时候来的？天哪，她又是从哪儿冒出来的？难道她不会更愿意像橱窗里的玩偶一样坐在房间里，等待着有人需要她吗？

"Rei? What are you doing here?" Asuka stammered.  
“丽？你怎么在这里？”明日香结巴道。

"I like going on walks," Rei said, simply.  
“我喜欢散步，”丽简单地说。

She actually had preferences? She had given Rei less credit than what was due. Rei noted the look of surprise, and replied, apathetically, "Why do you look so shaken, Pilot Sohryu?"  
她居然有自己的喜好？她给丽的评价比实际低了。丽注意到惊讶的表情，漠然回应：“你为何如此震惊，惣流·明日香·兰格雷？”

"What? I'm not shaken!" "什么？我才没动摇！"

"And why aren't you on your 'date'?"  
"那你为什么不在你的'约会'上？"

"Date? Uh, I was actually just going over to it," she lied, "Yeah…"  
"约会？呃，我其实正要去呢，"她撒谎道，"是啊……"

Rei stared into her eyes, her blank red eyes driving into Asuka's azure ones. Finally, Rei sighed. "Alright, I'll accompany you to this 'date'."  
丽盯着她的眼睛，她那空洞的红色眼眸直射入明日香湛蓝的眼睛。最终，丽叹了口气。"好吧，我陪你一起去这个'约会'。"

"Wait, what?" "等等，什么？"

"I'll go with you. I am curious as to what this 'date' is," Rei replied, approaching Asuka's side.  
"我跟你一起去。我对这个所谓的'约会'很好奇，"丽回答道，走到了明日香的身边。"

No, she wouldn't. Rei would tell those idiots that she was lying about having a date. She'd rat her out without a moment's hesitation. But what if Asuka demanded her to be quiet? She was just a damn doll, anyway. The image of a doll hanging by a noose sprang to life in her brain, which she suppressed instantly.  
不，她不会的。丽会告诉那些白痴她撒谎说有约会。她会毫不犹豫地出卖她。但假如明日香要求她闭嘴呢？反正她不过是个该死的玩偶罢了。脑海中突然浮现出一个玩偶被吊在绳套上的画面，她立刻将其压制下去。

"Uh, Rei, about that date…"  
"呃，丽，关于那个约会……"

"You were lying, weren't you?"  
"你当时是在撒谎，对吧？"

"Wait, how did you know?" Was Asuka that terrible of a liar?  
"等等，你怎么知道的？" 难道明日香撒谎就这么差劲吗？

"Well, the fact of the matter is that you've been wondering for a good five minutes without any real destination."  
"事实是，你已经毫无目的地徘徊了整整五分钟。"

"Wait, you were following me?!" Why hadn't she noticed that Rei as she was walking? What was she, anyway? A stalker? A lesbian? Just what the hell was she? Or had she been sent to spy on her? It wouldn't surprise Asuka if she had been sent to do just that.  
"等等，你在跟踪我？！" 为什么她没注意到绫波在她走路时跟着她？她到底是什么人？跟踪狂？同性恋？她到底算什么？还是说她被派来监视她的？如果真是这样，明日香也不会感到惊讶。

"When I set out on my walk, I found you. And I thought I might as well see what you were up to," Rei said.  
“当我开始散步时，我发现了你。我想不妨看看你在做什么，”丽说道。

"So wait, you weren't ordered to follow me or something?" Asuka asked, relief settling in.  
“等等，你不是被命令来跟踪我的吗？”明日香问道，松了一口气。

"Pilot Sohryu, not everything I do is because I'm ordered to do it," Rei said, an actual note of emotion, of annoyance, in her voice, be it ever so subtle.  
“驾驶员惣流，并非我做的每件事都是因为被命令去做，”丽说道，她的声音中确实带有一丝情感，一丝恼怒，尽管非常微妙。

Funny, that had always been Asuka's assumption.  
有趣的是，这始终是明日香的想法。

"Regardless, what do you plan on doing, Pilot Sohryu?"  
“无论如何，你打算怎么做，惣流·明日香·兰格雷？”

"I don't know, truthfully. I was going to just walk around and wait until it got dark, then head on back."  
“老实说，我不知道。我原本打算四处走走，等到天黑再回去。”

"Back to Pilot Ikari?" "回到碇司令那里吗？"

"Yes, exactly," Asuka replied, "And maybe eat something along the way."  
"是的，没错，" 明日香回答，"或许还可以顺便吃点东西。"

"Eat?" Rei repeated. "吃东西？" 绫波重复道。"

"Yes, you do eat, right? Oh, that's right, you're a vegetarian," Asuka replied.  
"是的，你确实吃东西，对吧？哦，对了，你是素食者，" 明日香回答道。

"Why are you so condescending?" Rei asked in a horse, irritated voice.  
"你为什么这么居高临下？" 绫波用一种恼怒的语气问道。

"Come again?" Condescending? What did she mean condescending? She wasn't being condescending at all. She was just being brutally honest.  
"再说一遍？" 居高临下？她是什么意思？她一点也没有居高临下。她只是非常直率而已。

"You are no better than either myself or Pilot Ikari," Rei replied, her eyes determined in their blankness, "You have no right to simply waltz around acting as though you are somehow superior to us."  
"你并不比我或碇真嗣强，" 绫波零回答，她的眼神坚定而空洞，"你没有权利就这样四处走动，仿佛你比我们优越似的。"

"I'm a better pilot." "我是个更优秀的驾驶员。"

"That is inconsequential."  
"那无关紧要。"

What did that mean? Inconsequential? Was she the only one who knew that, in order to be respected and loved, you had to be the best? You had to be the greatest? No one remembered failures or second-rate hacks. Hell, by the time this was all done, no one would remember someone like Rei, who was the slowest of all the Eva pilots. And besides, she was a doll!  
那是什么意思？无关紧要吗？难道只有她知道，要想得到尊重和爱，你必须是最好的？你必须是最伟大的？没有人会记住失败者或二流角色。见鬼，等这一切结束时，没有人会记得像丽这样的人，她是所有 Eva 驾驶员中最慢的。而且，她不过是个玩偶！

Right? 对吧？

"In the end, it will not matter who is the best or who isn't," Rei replied, apathetic, "Only those whose lives you have touched will remember you. If you touch them the wrong way, those memories will be rather unpleasant."  
“最终，谁是最好的或谁不是，并不重要，”丽冷淡地回答，“只有那些你触动过生命的人会记得你。如果你触动的方式不对，那些记忆将会相当不愉快。”

"And how would you know?" Asuka snarled back, roughly, "You're just a damn doll!"  
"你怎么会知道？" 明日香粗暴地反驳，"你不过是个该死的玩偶！"

"I am not a doll."  
"我不是玩偶。"

"Yes you are! You do everything you're told and you don't even bother to argue. You don't show any emotion at all! You're just a blank, expressionless, damn doll!"  
"你就是！你只会照吩咐做事，连争辩都不屑。你完全没有表现出任何情感！你只是一个空洞、无表情、该死的玩偶！"

The image of the doll hanging on a noose, slowly waving back and forth from the ceiling rafters. The image of that damned doll, that God damn doll!  
那个挂在绳套上的玩偶形象，缓缓地从天花板梁上前后摆动。那个该死的玩偶，那个该死的玩偶！

"What is wrong, Pilot Sohryu?"  
“怎么了，碇司令？”

So now she was showing concern, huh? She was showing emotion? Well, God damn her! Damn her to Hell! She shoved Rei aside, backing away as she ran a hand roughly through her hair, her eyes unable to avert themselves from the powerful image of the doll in her brain, the nightmare.  
现在她表现出关心了，是吗？她展现出情感了？好吧，该死的她！让她下地狱去吧！她推开绫波，后退着，粗鲁地用手梳理着头发，她的眼睛无法从脑海中那个强烈的玩偶形象上移开，那个噩梦。

"Pilot Sohryu…" Rei's voice trailed off as comprehension dawned on her face, "I understand now."  
"飞行员惣流…" 绫波的声音渐渐减弱，当她脸上露出理解的神情，"我现在明白了。"

"You could never understand," Asuka snarled, rising to her full height, the image of the doll now a memory.  
"你永远无法理解，" 明日香咆哮着，站直了身子，那娃娃的形象如今已成为记忆。"

"You're afraid of me." "你害怕我。"

"What? Afraid of you? Why would I be afraid of you?" Asuka laughed, shaking her head.  
“什么？怕你？我为什么要怕你？”明日香大笑着，摇了摇头。

"You're afraid of dolls."  
"你害怕娃娃。"

"Why would I be afraid of dolls?" Asuka laughed.  
"我为什么要怕娃娃？" 明日香笑了。"

"I don't know, but that reason sounds extremely plausible."  
"我不清楚，但这个理由听起来非常合理。"

"It isn't! It's stupid." "不是的！这太蠢了。"

"Be honest with yourself."  
"对自己诚实点。"

"Just shut up! Shut up!" The image of the doll returned to her brain, now accompanied with a second body hanging from the rafters beside it, the two swinging limply back and forth, no longer filled with the breath of life.  
"闭嘴！闭嘴！" 那个玩偶的形象再次浮现在她脑海中，现在旁边还多了一具尸体悬挂在横梁上，两者无力地前后摇摆，不再充满生命的气息。

"Do you need anything, Pilot Sohryu?" Rei asked, concern in her voice.  
"你需要什么吗，碇君？" 绫波零问道，声音中带着关切。

"Just shut up! Please!" Asuka fell to her knees, trying to tear her scalp open just so she could rip that image of those two out of her brain. Why was she getting so worked up over this? She was stronger than this! She was way too strong for this stupid emotion!  
"闭嘴！求你了！" 明日香跪倒在地，试图撕开自己的头皮，只为将那两人的影像从脑海中抹去。为何她会如此激动？她比这更强！她远比这种愚蠢的情感强大！

"Would it be more suitable, Pilot Sohryu, if I adapted a more appropriate personality when around you?"  
"碇君，如果我在你身边表现得更为得体，会不会更合适呢？"

"What the hell are you babbling about?" Asuka snarled, rising to her feet, glaring hatefully at Rei.  
“你到底在胡说八道些什么？”明日香咆哮着站起身，恶狠狠地瞪着绫波。

"Asuka? What's wrong?" “明日香？怎么了？”

This snapped Asuka back to her senses. Standing behind her was Hikari, an ice cream cone in her hands, her eyes suprised, if not downright horrified. Asuka felt, to her horror, tears forming in her eyes. Why was she crying? She had sworn she'd never cry for the rest of her life. She'd never cry. She was too damn strong. Crying was for the weak.  
这番话让明日香回过神来。站在她身后的是光，手里拿着一个冰淇淋蛋筒，眼神中带着惊讶，甚至可以说是惊恐。明日香惊恐地感觉到，泪水开始在她的眼眶中打转。她为什么要哭？她发誓过这辈子再也不会流泪。她永远不会哭。她太他妈坚强了。哭泣是弱者的表现。

Was she weak? 她很弱吗？

The next thing she realized, she was lying in a bed, both Hikari and Rei watching her, Hikari concerned and Rei outwardly apathetic. She pushed herself into a sitting position, running a hand through her hair as she felt the large buildup of sweat on her forehead. "Just what happened?"  
接下来她意识到，自己正躺在床上，光和丽都在旁边，光面露关切，而丽则显得漠不关心。她撑起身子坐了起来，用手梳理着头发，感觉到额头上大滴的汗珠。“到底发生了什么？”

"You completely broke down in the middle of the street, and then you fainted," Hikari said, her voice shaky, "I was so worried."  
"你在大街上彻底崩溃了，然后就晕倒了，"光说，她的声音颤抖着，"我真的很担心。"

"I fainted?" "我晕倒了？"

"Yeah," Hikari replied, "Rei helped me bring you to my house."  
"是的，"光回答，"丽帮我把你带到我家去了。"

Rei had helped Hikari? Probably because she was told to. Probably because Rei had been asked to do it. Asuka glanced over at Rei, who said, in her raspy voice, "Your body was heavier than I had anticipated, Pilot Sohryu."  
丽帮助了光？大概是因为被吩咐了。大概是因为丽被请求这么做。明日香瞥了一眼丽，她用沙哑的声音说道：“你的身体比我想象的要重，惣流驾驶员。”

"Wait, are you calling me fat or something?" Asuka snapped, pushing herself up into a sitting position.  
"等等，你是在说我胖吗？" 明日香厉声说道，用力坐起身来。

"I think she's returned to her ordinary state," Rei replied, a small note of confidence in her voice.  
"我想她已经恢复到平常的状态了，" 绫波回答，声音中带着一丝自信。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Why were you so dressed up, anyway?" Hikari asked, curiously, "Did you change your mind about the date?"  
"话说回来，你为什么穿得这么正式？" 光好奇地问，"难道你改变主意要去约会了？"

"Not at all," Asuka replied, frowning.  
“一点也不，”明日香皱着眉回答。

"It's been approximately three hours since you fainted," Rei replied, checking a watch around her wrist.  
“你昏迷大约三个小时了，”丽回答，检查着她手腕上的手表。

"Wait, three hours?" Asuka stammered.  
"等等，三个小时？" 明日香结巴道。

"Yeah, you were completely gone. We even tried dumping water on you." Hikari's skin grew pale as she glanced down at her knuckles, which were clenched around the blanket. "You were mumbling a lot, though. About dolls."  
"是啊，你完全昏过去了。我们甚至试过往你身上泼水。" 洞木光的脸色变得苍白，她低头看向紧握着毯子的拳头。"不过你一直在喃喃自语，关于玩偶的事。"

"You also mentioned something about your mom dying," Rei added, that slightest note of emotion in her otherwise soft emotionless voice.  
"你还提到了你妈妈去世的事，" 绫波零补充道，她的声音依旧柔和却毫无感情，只是隐约透出一丝情绪。

Asuka slumped down onto the bed, and sighed. "What did I say?"  
明日香一屁股坐在床上，叹了口气。“我说了什么？”

"Uh…" Hikari didn't meet Asuka's eyes. Her expression looked as though she had walked into something she private, something she should not have seen.  
“呃……” 光没有直视明日香的眼睛。她的表情看起来像是无意中闯入了某个私密场合，一个她本不该看到的地方。

"What did I say?" “我说了什么？”

Despite Hikari not looking up, Rei responded in her place. "You mentioned that, in your mother's heart, you were replaced by a doll. Not in those words, exactly, but that was the meaning."  
尽管光没有抬头，丽却代她回答了。“你提到，在你母亲的心中，你被一个玩偶取代了。不是用那些确切的词，但意思就是那样。”

"Anything else?" “还有别的吗？”

"You mentioned," Hikari said, softly, "your mother wanting to…to…"  
“你提到，”光轻声说，“你母亲想要……想要……”

"Die?" "死？"

"Yes," Hikari said, glancing down, "I had no idea that's what you had to go through. I'm sorry."  
"是的，"光说，目光低垂，"我不知道你经历了这些。我很抱歉。"

So now everyone knew? So now everyone knew her secret? That figured. She didn't want anyone to know. It didn't matter to her. That was all behind her now. She didn't need to dwell on that, right? Then again, if she didn't need to dwell on it, then how come she had been seeing that image in her brain every day for years?  
所以现在每个人都知道了？现在每个人都知道她的秘密了？这在意料之中。她不希望任何人知道。这对她来说无关紧要。那都是过去的事了。她不需要沉溺于此，对吧？然而，如果她不需要沉溺其中，那为什么多年来她每天都在脑海中看到那个画面？

"Is that why you find me disagreeable?" Rei asked, looking at Asuka intensely, "Because I remind you of that incident?"  
"这就是你对我有意见的原因吗？" 丽盯着明日香，语气尖锐，"因为我让你想起了那件事？"

Asuka slowly nodded. 明日香缓缓点头。

"I see." Rei rose to her feet, glancing down at Asuka. Was that sympathy in her eyes? "Pilot Sohryu, is there anything I can do for you?"  
"我明白了。" 丽站起身来，低头看向明日香。她的眼中是否闪过了一丝同情？"驾驶员惣流，有什么我能为你做的吗？"

"What? What are you talking about?"  
"什么？你在说什么呢？"

"Do you need a glass of water?"  
"你需要来杯水吗？"

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Or food?" "还是食物？"

"Come again?" "你说什么？"

Rei's expression was intense. This was shocking. Asuka had always assumed the lacked the ability to display any sort of emotion. Nevertheless, she looked so determined and all. Asuka sighed, and said, "Sure. Water's fine."  
丽的表情异常严肃。这令人震惊。明日香一直以为她缺乏表达任何情感的能力。然而，她看起来如此坚定。明日香叹了口气，说道：“当然，水没问题。”

"I'll be right back," Rei replied before leaving the room.  
“我马上回来，”丽回答后离开了房间。

The moment Rei had left, Hikari turned back to Asuka. "She was really worried about you, you know."  
丽一离开，光就转向了明日香。“她真的很担心你，你知道的。”

"Really?" “真的吗？”

"I had told her that she could go home if she really wanted to, but she refused," Hikari replied, "Not to mention that she pretty much was just waiting the entire time for you to open your eyes. She insisted that you were strong enough to wake up."  
“我告诉过她，如果她真的想回家，她可以走，但她拒绝了，”光回答道，“更别提她几乎一直在等你睁开眼睛。她坚持认为你有足够的力量醒来。”

Rei had been worried over her? Asuka had someone else cater to her? Worried about her? Asuka sighed. Rei probably didn't care about her as a person so much as her skills as a pilot. Her mind didn't quite work the same way others did. Still, on the off-chance, no, the impossible chance, that Rei had actually been concerned for her, as a person, then maybe, just maybe, Asuka had misjudged her.  
丽一直在为她担心吗？明日香有人照顾她吗？担心她吗？明日香叹了口气。丽可能并不在乎她这个人，更多的是在乎她作为驾驶员的能力。她的思维方式与其他人不太一样。不过，万一，不，是几乎不可能的机会，丽真的关心她这个人，那么也许，只是也许，明日香误解了她。

Of course, she'd need to do more than just get her a glass of water to prove that she actually gave a damn about her.  
当然，她需要做的不仅仅是给她倒杯水来证明她真的在乎她。

"Asuka, maybe you should talk to that psychologist about your breakdown," Hikari recommended.  
"明日香，也许你应该和那位心理医生谈谈你的崩溃，" 光建议道。

"What?" "什么？"

"It would do you some good, I think. It would get a lot off your shoulders."  
"我觉得这对你有好处。可以让你卸下很多负担。"

"Maybe…" "或许吧…"

After thirty minutes, Asuka had left Hikari's house and was walking down the street toward her house, Rei silently at her side. She didn't know what to say to that blue haired girl. That shrink had told her to try understanding Rei a little better, but right now, she was just more confused. Rei was a doll, right? Then why was she showing enough concern for her to walk her home?  
三十分钟后，明日香离开了光的家，沿着街道走向自己的住处，丽默默地陪在她身边。她不知道该对那个蓝发女孩说些什么。那个心理医生告诉她要试着更好地理解丽，但此刻，她只是更加困惑。丽不是个玩偶吗？那为什么她会表现出足够的关心，陪她走回家呢？

"This is your stop, Pilot Sohryu," Rei replied, stopping abruptly before the apartment complex, "Do you want me to walk you—"  
"你的目的地到了，惣流·明日香·兰格雷驾驶员，" 丽突然停在了公寓楼前，"需要我陪你进去吗——"

"No thanks," she interrupted, "I'm fine."  
"不用了，"她打断道，"我很好。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

"Rei?" "丽？"

"Yes?" “是？”

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

The blue haired girl's expression changed suddenly from emotionless to suddenly embarrassed, blush running up her cheeks, before her lips slowly curled into a thin, fragile smile. This was the first time Asuka had ever before seen Rei display such a powerful positive emotion. Never before had she smiled, period!  
蓝发女孩的表情突然从无情绪转变为尴尬，脸颊上泛起红晕，随后她的嘴角慢慢弯成一个纤细而脆弱的微笑。这是明日香第一次看到丽展现出如此强烈的正面情感。她从未笑过，一次也没有！

"This is the expression I was told would be suitable for such an occasion," Rei replied, turning around as she still wore that sheepish smile.  
“这是我被告知在这种场合适宜的表情，”丽回答道，转身时脸上依旧挂着那抹尴尬的微笑。

So she was just a programmed doll nonetheless! Programmed to smile when the occasion called for it. Still, she couldn't help but feel her own smile come out.  
原来她不过是个被编程的玩偶罢了！被设定在需要时微笑。尽管如此，她还是忍不住露出了自己的笑容。

As Rei descended into the dark depths of the street, Asuka ascended the stairway illuminated by cheap lamps until she reached the apartment. She unlocked the door, and waltzed right into the room. The sound of the cello filled the room, at which the sweet song echoed into her eardrums. She found the music pleasant, if not beautiful. It was almost melancholy, and soothed her nerves, made her feel as though she were one with the world around her.  
当丽步入街道的幽暗深处时，明日香则沿着廉价灯光照亮的楼梯向上，直到抵达公寓。她打开门，径直走进房间。大提琴的声音弥漫开来，那甜美的旋律回荡在她的耳膜中。她觉得这音乐既悦耳又美丽。它带着几分忧郁，抚慰着她的神经，让她感觉自己与周围的世界融为一体。

Trying not to interrupt the beautiful music, she made her way gently toward the living room, where Shinji played note after note of music that he had clearly rehearsed and replayed several times in the past, practicing just like he was now, flawlessly.  
她小心翼翼地走向客厅，尽量不打断那美妙的音乐，客厅里真嗣正一个接一个地弹奏着音符，这些曲子显然他已经反复排练过多次，就像现在这样，完美无瑕地练习着。

Finally, as the piece concluded, she began to applaud. He deserved credit where credit was due, after all. He turned around to look at her as she said, impressed, "That's really good."  
终于，随着曲子结束，她开始鼓掌。毕竟，他值得得到应有的赞赏。他转过身来看着她，当她赞叹地说“真的很棒”时，他的脸上露出了惊讶的表情。

"Thanks, I guess," he replied.  
“谢谢，我想，”他回答道。

"Never knew you knew how to play the, uh…"  
"从不知道你还会拉，呃……"

"Cello." "大提琴。"

"Right. Never knew you could play that."  
"对。从不知道你还会拉那个。"

"Well, my teacher had recommended I learned how to play the cello when I was five, so I decided to try. I haven't gotten much better, but no one told me to stop, so…"  
"嗯，我五岁时老师建议我学大提琴，所以我就尝试了一下。虽然进步不大，但也没人让我停下来，所以……"

So he was also programmed to obey orders? That just figured. "That's not a good enough reason."  
所以他也被设定为服从命令？这倒是意料之中。 "这不是一个充分的理由。"

"So why are you back so soon?"  
"那你为什么这么快就回来了？"

"Huh?" It was only then that she remembered that she had told Shinji she had actually gone on that date. Why did she tell him that, anyway? She couldn't even remember anymore. Ah well, she'd just make up a story, as usual.  
"嗯？" 直到这时她才想起，自己曾告诉过真嗣她真的去赴了那个约会。她为什么要告诉他呢？她甚至都不记得了。唉，算了，她就像往常一样编个故事吧。

"Well, we went to an amusement park, but he was just so boring. I mean, he was handsome and all, but just so stupid and just not my taste. So on the line to ferris wheel, I went to the bathroom, and didn't go back."  
“好吧，我们去了一个游乐园，但他实在太无聊了。我是说，他长得帅是帅，但就是太蠢了，完全不是我的菜。所以在排队等摩天轮的时候，我去了趟洗手间，就没再回去。”

His expression was clearly unimpressed. "That's a little cruel."  
他的表情明显是不以为然。“那有点残忍。”

Well, what did you expect for such a stupid lie, anyway?  
哎，你还能指望这种愚蠢的谎言有什么好结果呢？

Asuka took a seat, thinking silently about what had happened over the past couple of days. She couldn't forget her breakdown so quickly. She had just completely fallen apart in front of Hikari and Rei. She knew Hikari would keep it to herself, and she only hoped Rei didn't mention anything about it. Still, what if someone else had seen that?  
明日香坐了下来，默默地思考着过去几天发生的事情。她无法那么快忘记自己的崩溃。她刚刚在光和丽面前彻底崩溃了。她知道光会保守秘密，她只希望丽没有提到这件事。尽管如此，如果其他人看到了呢？

"Is something wrong?" “有什么不对劲吗？”

Asuka glanced over at Shinji. He was concerned about her. Asuka was too tired by this point to really care about things like pride or anything of that sort. Without that in the way, she couldn't deny he was kinda cute—  
明日香瞥了一眼真嗣。他在为她担心。到了这个时候，明日香已经太累了，根本不在乎什么自尊之类的事情。没有了这些阻碍，她无法否认他有点可爱——

What was she thinking!? 她到底在想什么！？

"Uh, you have no idea," Asuka mumbled, her head falling on her forearms.  
"呃，你完全不知道，" 明日香喃喃自语，头靠在了前臂上。

There was no denying it. She just wanted to touch him. That was all. She didn't want to love him or anything like that. Just a quick poke, or to feel his skin. That was all. Nothing major or important. It wasn't like she liked him or had a crush at all.  
无可否认，她只是想触碰他。仅此而已。她并不想爱上他或任何类似的事情。只是轻轻一碰，或是感受他的肌肤。仅此而已。不是什么大事或重要的事。并不像她喜欢他或对他有任何迷恋。

Why was her heart beating so hard.  
为什么她的心跳得如此剧烈。

She distracted herself by focusing on the TV, but she was interrupted from that when the phone rang. Shinji answered it. After a moment of conversing, he hung up, and informed Asuka that Misato was drinking with Kaji.  
她分心于电视节目，但电话铃声打断了她。真嗣接了电话。交谈片刻后，他挂断电话，告诉明日香美里在和加持喝酒。

She felt her stomach twist. Misato and Kaji? She felt a chill run up her spine as she realized that maybe, just maybe, she was being replaced with that beer guzzling sexaholic. Still, maybe she was wrong. They were at a wedding, or something like that.  
她感到胃部一阵扭曲。美里和加持？她意识到或许，仅仅是或许，自己正被那个喝啤酒的色鬼所取代，不禁打了个寒颤。不过，也许她想错了。他们可能是在参加婚礼，或者类似的活动。

In order to cover for her anxiety, she informed Shinji that they weren't coming home any time soon.  
为了掩饰自己的焦虑，她告诉真嗣他们不会很快回家。

Still, now that the phone had torn her away from the TV, she couldn't focus on anything other than that idiot in the corner, who had abandoned his cello and was now just sitting there, bored. She needed him, she wanted him. She didn't understand why or what she was thinking. She didn't actually like him, right? Not at all. He was just an idiot. An immature pervert. Not worthy of her beauty. Not at all.  
然而，电话将她从电视前拉开后，她的注意力再也无法集中在其他事物上，除了角落里那个笨蛋，他丢下了大提琴，现在只是无聊地坐在那里。她需要他，她想要他。她不明白为什么，也不清楚自己在想什么。她其实并不喜欢他，对吧？一点儿也不。他只是个笨蛋，一个不成熟的变态。根本配不上她的美貌。一点儿也不。

Besides, she couldn't let that stupid shrink be right! Not now!  
再说了，她不能让那个愚蠢的心理医生说中！现在不行！

Still, she just needed to touch him, somehow. How could she get him to comply? She couldn't just go up and kiss him or something, right?  
尽管如此，她就是需要触碰他，以某种方式。她怎么能让他顺从呢？总不能直接上去亲他或者什么的，对吧？

And then the plan formed itself in her brain in one swift go.  
然后，一个计划在她脑海中迅速成型。

"Hey, do you wanna kiss?"  
"嘿，你想接吻吗？"

As expected, the idiot glanced up at that mention, a look of confusion on his face. "What?"  
不出所料，那傻瓜听到这话抬头看了一眼，脸上满是困惑。“什么？”

"You know. Kiss." "你知道的。接吻。"

"But why?" "但是为什么？"

"We don't have anything else to do."  
"我们也没别的事可做。"

"That's not a good reason to kiss."  
"那不是接吻的好理由。"

Why the hell was he being so damn resistant, anyway? After all, it was just a damn peck. Nothing major. "Why? Are you afraid to kiss someone on the anniversary of your mother's death?" That was hitting a little below the belt, even by her standards. She made sure the next one had a bit less sting, but would prove a little more effective. "Or are you just scared."  
他到底为什么这么顽固抗拒？毕竟，那不过是个该死的轻吻。没什么大不了的。“为什么？你害怕在母亲忌日这天亲吻别人吗？”这话有点过分了，即使按她的标准来看。她确保下一句稍微缓和些，但效果会更明显。“还是说，你只是害怕。”

"I'm not scared! Pucker up."  
"我才不怕呢！来吧，亲一个。"

Perfect! Best way to get to a man was to attack their manhood. She cheered inside her heart. She shouldn't be this enthusiastic after all. She was just kissing this idiot because she wanted to touch him. That's all. Nothing else. "Did you brush your teeth?"  
完美！接近男人的最佳方式就是攻击他们的男子气概。她内心欢呼雀跃。毕竟，她不该如此兴奋。她只是因为想触碰他才亲吻这个傻瓜的。仅此而已。别的什么都没有。“你刷牙了吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"Well, here I come." “那么，我来了。”

She approached the idiot, feeling her heart race against her chest. She felt anxious, wanting to just hold him, to embrace him now. Funny how clear her mind was. Now that she was this close to kissing him, that image from before, the image of her and Shinji embracing each other, was clear. Now she could reach that beautiful fantasy, that amazing dream.  
她走向那个傻瓜，感觉心跳在胸腔中加速。她感到焦虑，只想抱住他，此刻就拥抱他。有趣的是，她的思绪变得如此清晰。现在她离吻他如此之近，之前那个画面，她和真嗣相拥的画面，变得清晰起来。现在她可以触及那个美丽的幻想，那个美妙的梦境。

"Your breath is tickling me," she noted, almost as though to explain her momentary hesitation. She pinched his nose between her fingers, and, suddenly, locked lips with him.  
"你的呼吸在逗弄我，"她指出，几乎像是在解释她那一瞬间的犹豫。她用手指捏住他的鼻子，突然间，与他唇齿相依。

She felt a surge fill her body. She felt a tingle run up her entire body as she enthusiastically smooched him, filling his mouth with her tongue. She felt life fill her, felt energy invigorate her body, her veins pulsating powerfully as the moments passed. Yes, this was what she wanted! She felt ecstasy fill her body in waves.  
她感到一股力量涌遍全身。当她热情地亲吻他时，一阵酥麻感贯穿全身，她的舌头充满他的口腔。她感到生命力充盈，能量激发她的身体，随着时间的流逝，她的血管有力地跳动。是的，这就是她想要的！她感到一波波的狂喜充满全身。

But something was missing.  
但总觉得少了些什么。

Why the hell was that idiot not touching her back? She continued kissing. Maybe he was surprised. Granted, she could understand that minor detail. Surely he was just taken aback, that was all. As the seconds passed, she felt her heart race with anxiety. Why wasn't he touching her? Why the hell wasn't he holding her? Why the hell wasn't he even doing anything?!  
那个白痴为什么还不碰她的背？她继续吻着。也许他惊呆了。当然，她能理解这个小细节。肯定只是被吓到了，仅此而已。随着时间的流逝，她感到焦虑让心跳加速。他为什么不碰她？为什么他妈的不抱住她？为什么他妈的什么都不做？！

Finally, he tore his mouth from hers, gasping for air. It was almost as though it had been painful for him to go through with it. But she couldn't cry twice in the same day. She wouldn't cry twice in the same day. She sprinted off in the opposite direction, lying about how disgusting that kiss had been, praying that her façade would hold up long enough for her to hide her tears.  
最终，他挣脱了她的唇，喘着气。这几乎像是他经历这件事很痛苦。但她不能在同一天哭两次。她不会在同一天哭两次。她朝相反方向跑去，谎称那个吻有多恶心，祈祷她的伪装能坚持到她藏起泪水。

### Chapter 4

"You want to play some Rummy?"  
“你想玩点拉米牌吗？”

"I don't care about that stupid game."  
“我才不在乎那个愚蠢的游戏。”

She didn't care about the damn game. She didn't care about any of that anymore. All that the Second Child thought of was that idiot's mouth around hers, his arms at his side, not even making an attempt to embrace her, to hold her, to make her feel wanted. Why the hell did no one ever try to go out of their way to make her feel wanted? Why the hell did they always just ignore her? Why the God damn hell didn't they care!?  
她对那个该死的游戏毫不在意。她再也不在乎那些了。二号孩子满脑子都是那个白痴的嘴环绕着她的，他的手臂垂在身旁，甚至没有试图拥抱她，抱紧她，让她感到被需要。为什么从来没有人试图特意让她感到被需要？为什么他们总是忽视她？为什么他们他妈的不在乎！？

"I thought you loved winning," Dr. Tamako replied, frowning slightly.  
"我以为你喜欢赢。" 玉子博士微微皱眉回答道。

"I don't feel in the mood, alright?" Asuka snarled, angrily.  
"我没心情，行了吧？" 明日香咆哮着，愤怒不已。

"Oh, okay." The shrink folded her hands on her desk as she glanced down at a random notepad. She remained quiet for a moment or two before saying, softly, "Did you talk to Shinji?"  
"哦，好吧。" 心理医生将双手叠放在桌子上，目光扫向一本随意摊开的笔记本。她沉默了一会儿，然后轻声问道，"你和真嗣谈过了吗？"

"Who gives a damn about that stupid bastard anyway?!" Asuka rose to her feet, her temple pulsating painfully as her fists clenched, her eyes wild.  
"谁他妈在乎那个蠢货？！" 明日香猛地站起身，太阳穴剧烈跳动，疼痛难忍，她紧握双拳，眼神狂乱。

Dr. Tamako flinched, almost as though Asuka had thrown a punch at her. However, after her recoil, she said, softly, "Did you talk to him?"  
塔摩博士一缩，仿佛明日香朝她挥了一拳似的。然而，在她退缩之后，她轻声问道：“你和他谈过了吗？”

"I told you I don't give a damn about him!" she snarled, falling onto the recliner, running her nails down her scalp. She wanted to rip that idiot's face from her brain. Rip it out of her conscious mind so she could tear it to pieces in her hands. Tear it into so many pieces so that she'd never be able to put them together.  
“我说了我根本不在乎他！”她咆哮着，跌坐在躺椅上，用指甲划过头皮。她想把那个白痴的脸从脑海中撕扯出来。从她的意识中拔除，这样她就可以亲手将其撕成碎片。撕成无数碎片，让她永远无法再拼凑起来。

"Asuka, listen. I know you'll feel better if you just get this off your chest," Dr. Tamako said, her face pale.  
“明日香，听着。我知道你只要把这些话说出来，就会感觉好些，”塔摩博士说，脸色苍白。

"There's nothing to say!"  
"没什么好说的！"

"Yes there is. Look at yourself for a second. You're breaking apart in front of me. You're screaming over someone you said you didn't care about. I can even see tears in your eyes."  
"不，有的。你看看你自己，在我面前快要崩溃了。你对着一个你声称不在乎的人大喊大叫。我甚至能看到你眼里的泪水。"

"I'm not crying!" Asuka snarled, brushing aside salty drops of water from the corner of her eyes.  
"我没哭！" 明日香咆哮着，拂去眼角咸咸的水珠。

"Please, do yourself a favor and just tell me," Dr. Tamako said, her voice trembling now. What was she worried about? Why the hell was she so concerned, anyway? Who cared that that idiot had ignored her like he did? Hadn't even bothered touching her? Hadn't even bothered to kiss her back!  
"求你了，帮自己个忙，直接告诉我吧，" 田子博士说道，她的声音现在颤抖着。她在担心什么？她到底为什么这么在意？谁在乎那个白痴像那样忽视她？甚至懒得碰她？连回吻她都懒得！

"I don't want to talk about that spineless bastard!" she repeated, "He doesn't even bother to touch me. Why should I give a damn about him?"  
"我不想谈那个没骨气的混蛋！" 她重复道，"他甚至都不愿意碰我。我为什么要关心他？"

"Touch you?" Dr. Tamako asked.  
"碰你？" 田子博士问道。

Had she said that aloud? Had she let that slip? Asuka wanted to rip herself out of her skin, wanting to tear her flesh apart by hand. She gripped her arms, squeezing them, shaking with fury. She couldn't take it any more. She just couldn't take it! She was losing her mind. She wanted to just escape, to run out of her skin and extend out into the edges of eternity.  
她是不是说出口了？她是不是不小心泄露了？明日香想要撕裂自己的皮肤，亲手撕开自己的肉体。她紧抓着自己的手臂，用力挤压，愤怒地颤抖。她再也受不了了。她就是受不了了！她快要疯了。她只想逃离，想要冲出自己的皮肤，延伸到永恒的边缘。

"You don't mean have sex, do you?"  
"你不是说要做爱吧？"

Asuka shook her head, feeling tears run down her cheeks. She was so filled with fury that she didn't even try to brush them aside. If she let go of her arms, stopped the squeezing and scratching, she would have been swallowed up by anxiety and strangled herself with her fury. "No, I just wanted to touch him. I ended up kissing him."  
明日香摇了摇头，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。她心中充满了愤怒，以至于连擦去泪水的念头都没有。如果她松开双臂，停止挤压和抓挠，她就会被焦虑吞噬，被愤怒扼杀。“不，我只是想碰碰他。结果却吻了他。”

"Kissing him? How did that work out?"  
“吻他？那进展如何？”

"I asked him if he wanted to kiss me."  
“我问他想不想吻我。”

"Out of the blue?" "突然之间？"

"Yes. I told him I was bored and there was nothing else to do. He was anxious. I just edged him on, told him he was afraid. And that got him edged up, and we got close."  
"是的。我告诉他我感到无聊，没有其他事情可做。他很紧张。我只是激他，告诉他他害怕。这让他更加激动，我们就接近了。"

"Then what?" "然后呢？"

Why was she spilling her guts to that damn shrink like this? Why was she so open? But, as though a great dam had been shattered and had allowed water to spill out uncontrolled, she couldn't hold back her confession. "I hesitated, and his breath was tickling me. So I held his nose shut and kissed him."  
为什么她要对这个该死的医生如此掏心掏肺？为什么她这么坦白？然而，仿佛一座巨大的堤坝被冲垮，水流失控地倾泻而出，她无法抑制自己的坦白。“我犹豫了，他的呼吸轻拂着我。于是我捏住他的鼻子，吻了他。”

"Did it feel good?" “感觉好吗？”

"It was magnificent. I was just so happy. Happier than I have been in a long time. But he didn't do anything. He didn't kiss back. He didn't even bother holding me! He didn't try touching me! And then he pulled away gasping for air!"  
“美妙极了。我那时无比快乐，很久没有这么开心过了。但他什么也没做。他没有回吻我。甚至都没抱我一下！他连碰都没碰我！然后他就挣脱开，喘着气离开了！”

"How did you respond?" “你是怎么回应的？”

"I went away. I didn't face him. I didn't even look at him. I just couldn't let him see me…see me…see me…" Her face fell into her hands as tears spilled from her eyes. She hadn't cried in so long. She hadn't let others see her cry for years. No, this wasn't true. There was before with Hikari and Rei, when she had fainted. That seemed so insignificant now. So small and petty. Hikari had told her to confess this to the shrink, but that would have to be saved for another day.  
"“我离开了。我没有面对他。我甚至没有看他一眼。我只是不能让他看到我……看到我……看到我……”她的脸埋进双手，泪水从眼中溢出。她已经很久没有哭过了。她已经多年没有让别人看到她哭泣。不，这并不完全正确。在和光和丽之前，当她昏倒时，有过那么一次。现在看来，那显得如此微不足道。如此渺小和琐碎。光曾告诉她要向心理医生坦白这一切，但这得留到另一天了。”

Besides, right now, there was no room in her heart for anything else than rejection.  
况且，现在，她的心里没有空间容纳除了拒绝之外的任何东西。

"He loves you, you know."  
"他爱你，你知道的。"

Asuka glanced up at Dr. Tamako as she lowered her gaze to her eyes. Love her? That idiot loved her? Hell, he didn't even love himself! Was that damn shrink just trying to pacify her? To make her happier? To cheer her up? Well, damn her! Damn her stupid help! Damn her stupid session! Damn everything about her!  
明日香抬头看向田子博士，当她将目光移到她的眼睛上。爱她？那个白痴爱她？见鬼，他甚至不爱自己！那个该死的心理医生是不是只是想安抚她？让她更快乐？让她振作起来？好吧，该死的她！该死的愚蠢帮助！该死的愚蠢疗程！该死的她的一切！

"How could he love me when he doesn't even love himself?!"  
"他连自己都不爱，又怎么可能爱我？！"

Dr. Tamako's face was paper white. She ran a hand through her hair, anxiously. Obviously, she had spoken out of line. "Look, I can't tell you anything that he told me. Nor can I tell him anything you tell me. It's against the law. But I can interpret everything from what you told me. For one, I think he was suffocating, and because he had trouble breathing, he couldn't just—"  
塔摩医生脸色苍白如纸。她焦虑地用手梳理着头发。显然，她刚才的话有些失言。“听着，我不能透露他告诉我的任何事情，也不能转告他你对我说的。这是违法的。但我可以根据你告诉我的信息进行解读。首先，我认为他当时感到窒息，因为呼吸困难，他无法——”

"Are you telling me that he told you that he loved me?" Asuka asked, her voice shaking.  
“你是说，他告诉你他爱我？”明日香问道，声音颤抖。

Dr. Tamako didn't meet her eyes still, but finally, very slowly, said, "I'm sorry. I can't tell you."  
塔摩医生依然没有直视她的眼睛，但最终，非常缓慢地说：“对不起，我不能告诉你。”

"Can't or won't?" "不能还是不愿？"

"I can't. It's illegal. You need to figure that out on your own."  
"我不能。这是违法的。你得自己解决这个问题。"

Asuka felt her heart race against her ribs as she rose to her feet. If that idiot loved her, why the hell didn't he just say it? Was he a damn coward? Was he afraid of what she'd say? That idiot just couldn't admit his own feelings to anyone, could he? But then she remembered how many times she had insulted him, or called him stupid, or called him weak, or any one of the colorful insults she had dealt upon him. Obviously he'd be afraid to tell her anything. Asuka had never given the idiot a chance.  
明日香感到心跳撞击着胸腔，她站起身来。如果那个白痴爱她，为什么不直接说出来？他是个胆小鬼吗？他害怕她会说什么吗？那个白痴就是不能向任何人承认自己的感情，对吧？但随后她想起了自己曾多少次侮辱他，或骂他愚蠢，或说他软弱，或是那些她施加给他的各种恶毒的侮辱。显然他会害怕告诉她任何事情。明日香从未给过那个白痴机会。

She collapsed onto the armchair, holding her head in her hands as she mumbled, anxiously, "It's my fault, isn't it? I scared him off, didn't I?"  
她瘫坐在扶手椅上，双手抱着头，焦虑地喃喃自语，"是我的错，对吧？我把他吓跑了，不是吗？"

"I don't think he understood your feelings, either," Dr. Tamako replied, a frown on her face.  
"我觉得他也没理解你的感情，" 田子博士回答道，脸上带着一丝忧虑。

"Why wouldn't he? No one just asks for a kiss out of the blue."  
"他怎么会不理解呢？没人会无缘无故要求接吻的。"

"Well, think of it this way. Shinji relies on the opinions of others to make him feel important. You called him a coward, so, in order to improve your opinion of him, and thus his own importance, he went with what you said. And when you held his nose, he couldn't focus on the kiss because he was struggling to breathe. It's that simple. It had nothing to do with him rejecting you. It was all a struggle to him."  
"这么想吧，真嗣依赖别人的看法来感到自己的重要性。你骂他是懦夫，所以他为了改善你对他的看法，进而提升自己的重要性，就按照你说的去做了。而当你捏住他的鼻子时，他因为呼吸困难而无法专注于接吻。就是这么简单。这与他拒绝你无关，对他来说，这一切都是挣扎。"

"A struggle?" "挣扎吗？"

"A struggle to breathe. A struggle to get you to appreciate him. And a struggle with his own insecurities. I'm sure if you didn't hold his nose, he would have embraced you after a moment or two."  
"呼吸的挣扎，让你欣赏他的挣扎，还有与自己不安全感斗争的挣扎。我敢肯定，如果你不捏住他的鼻子，他过一会儿就会拥抱你了。"

"So what you're saying is that it's my fault he didn't hold me?!" Asuka snarled.  
"所以你的意思是，他没抱我都是我的错？！" 明日香咆哮道。

"No, what I'm saying is that you have to understand that he didn't hold you for reason you might not of considered."  
"不，我想说的是，你得明白他没抱你是因为有些你可能没考虑到的理由。"

"I get it," Asuka finally responded, running an anxious hand through her hair, realizing that it was easier to control her body than it had been before.  
"我明白了，" 明日香终于回应道，焦虑地用手梳理着头发，意识到控制自己的身体比以前容易多了。

"Are you okay?" "你还好吗？"

"Yeah, I'm better." "是啊，我好多了。"

"I see. Look, do you want anything? Like water?"  
"我明白了。你看，你需要什么吗？比如水？"

"No, I'm fine." "不用，我很好。"

"Okay, well, out of curiosity, given the chance to kiss Shinji again, would you?"  
"好吧，出于好奇，如果再有机会亲吻真嗣，你会吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Well, the hint next time is not to squeeze his nose shut, alright?" Dr. Tamako replied.  
"嗯，下次的提示是不要捏住他的鼻子，好吗？" 玉子博士回答道。

Asuka left the room, only to find both Misato and Kaji, along with that idiot and Rei, waiting for her. She averted her gaze from the two adults. When Misato and Kaji had returned from drinking, Asuka smelt Misato's perfume on Kaji's clothes. This made it painstakingly clear, now more than ever, that Kaji was lost to her. Well, as crushing as that was, it wasn't nearly as crushing as that idiot.  
明日香离开房间，却发现美里和加持，还有那个白痴和绫波，都在等着她。她避开了两位成年人的目光。当美里和加持从喝酒回来时，明日香在加持的衣服上闻到了美里的香水味。这让她痛苦地明白，加持已经离她远去，这一点现在比以往任何时候都更加明显。虽然这令人心碎，但远不及那个白痴带给她的心碎。

Still, she couldn't make eye contact.  
然而，她还是无法直视对方。

Rather, she looked at her two comrades, and watched as Rei rose to her feet, and said, in her hoarse voice, "Your eyes are red, Pilot Sohryu."  
相反，她看向她的两位同伴，只见丽站起身来，用她沙哑的声音说道：“你的眼睛红了，碇司令。”

"It's nothing," Asuka said, "Allergic reaction, I think…"  
“没什么，”明日香回答，“我想是过敏反应吧……”

That idiot hadn't responded at all. Rather, he had his ears plugged up with that stupid tape player. Asuka approached him, and ripped the plugs from his ears. He glanced up, a stunned expression on his stupid face. "Why did you do that?"  
那个白痴根本没回应。相反，他把耳朵塞满了那个愚蠢的随身听。明日香走近他，一把扯掉了耳机。他抬头看着她，脸上满是惊讶的表情。“你为什么这么做？”

"Why? Because a boy like you should pay more attention to the more graceful, prettier things in life. Like me."  
“为什么？因为像你这样的男孩应该多关注生活中更优雅、更美丽的事物。比如我。”

Why was she talking to that idiot? Why did she depend on his acknowledgement of her, anyway? Was she just as bad as he was, depending on other's views in order to survive? Well, was she?  
她为什么要跟那个白痴说话？为什么她要依赖他的认可呢？难道她和他一样糟糕，依赖别人的看法才能生存吗？那么，她是不是也一样呢？

A day passed. A second day passed. As the sun rose and set, Asuka waited for Shinji to show a sign of regret, a chance to try kissing her again, to apologize for not touching her, to explain that he couldn't breathe during that smooch. And yet, each night, Asuka fell to her bed, her eyes screwed up as she swore that tomorrow would be the day that she heard the words she wanted to hear. And, naturally, tomorrow would come and she'd swear that the next day would be the day.  
一天过去了。第二天也过去了。随着太阳升起又落下，明日香等待着真嗣表现出后悔的迹象，一个再次尝试亲吻她的机会，为没有触碰她而道歉，解释他在那个吻中无法呼吸的原因。然而，每个夜晚，明日香倒在床上，紧闭双眼，发誓明天一定会听到她想听的话。当然，明天会到来，她又会发誓下一天会是那一天。

"Hey, are you okay?" Hikari asked as school was wrapping up after a week of Asuka's inner turmoil.  
“嘿，你还好吗？”放学时，在一周的内心挣扎后，光问道。

"What? Yeah, I'm fine." “什么？嗯，我没事。”

"Doesn't have to do with a that breakdown, right?"  
"这和那个崩溃无关，对吧？"

"No, it doesn't. It's just…"  
"不，无关。只是……"

"Just what?" Hikari's face was curious for a moment before realization dawned upon her face, "Oh! It isn't a crush, is it?"  
"只是什么？" 光的脸上一时好奇，随即恍然大悟，"哦！这不是迷恋，对吧？"

Asuka sighed, in defeat. "Alright. I admit it. It is."  
明日香叹了口气，无奈地说：“好吧。我承认。确实是。”

"Wow, I expected more of a struggle," Hikari replied.  
“哇，我还以为你会挣扎得更厉害些呢，” 光莉回答道。

"Did you?" “是吗？”

"Yeah. Well, who is it? Can I guess?"  
"是啊。那会是谁呢？我能猜猜吗？"

"Sure, go ahead." "当然，猜吧。"

"Is it that cute upper—"  
"是不是那个可爱的学长——"

"Wrong." "错了。"

"What about that one guy in our class, the guy with that long hair—"  
"我们班那个长头发的家伙呢——"

"Try again." "再试试。"

"Kensuke?" "健介？"

"No."

"Wait, I know! It's Shinji, isn't it!"  
"等等，我知道了！是真嗣，对吧！"

"Try—wait, how did you figure that one out?" Asuka replied, glancing up in mild surprise.  
"试试——等等，你怎么猜到的？" 明日香回答道，略带惊讶地抬头看了一眼。

"I was only guessing!" Hikari stammered, blushing deep red, "But you guys do live together, so it makes sense I suppose."  
"我只是猜测而已！" 光 stammered，脸红得深红，"但你们确实住在一起，所以我想这很合理。"

"Yeah, well, I guess it would, wouldn't it?"  
"是啊，嗯，我想也是，不是吗？"

"Still, I can't believe you like him. You're always making fun of him. Were you in denial or something?"  
"不过，真不敢相信你喜欢他。你总是取笑他。你是不是一直在否认或者什么的？"

"Maybe." "或许吧。"

"Well, do you need my help?" Hikari asked.  
"那么，你需要我的帮助吗？" 光问道。"

"No, that's fine. I think I'll try by myself." Asuka walked off, hands behind her head, as Hikari followed, a look of keen interest in her eyes.  
"不用了，没关系。我想自己试试。" 明日香双手枕在脑后走开了，而光紧随其后，眼中闪烁着浓厚的兴趣。"

"So when and how did you figure this out?"  
"那么，你是什么时候又是怎么发现的？"

"About a week ago." "大约一周前。"

"After you left my house?"  
"你离开我家之后？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"What did you do when you found out?"  
"你发现后做了什么？"

Asuka remembered the kiss. Sure, it had been utterly unromantic in every sense of the word, but she couldn't help but blush deep scarlet as she recalled the desire, the pleasure, of locking lips with him. Hikari also blushed, but not because she was recalling an embarrassing memory so much as piecing together the reasons why Asuka was blushing so deeply.  
明日香想起了那个吻。当然，从任何意义上来说，那都绝对不浪漫，但她还是不由自主地脸颊深红，回忆起与他唇齿相依时的渴望和愉悦。光也脸红了，但更多是因为她在拼凑明日香为何如此深红脸颊的原因，而非回忆起什么尴尬的记忆。

"You didn't kiss him, did you?" Hikari asked, her voice hushed so only Asuka could hear.  
"你没吻他吧？" 光小声问道，声音低得只有明日香能听见。

She nodded, silently 她点点头，默不作声

The reaction was instantaneous. Hikari's mouth accelerated into motion, speaking faster than Asuka had ever seen her freckled friend speak before. "Wait a second! You kissed him? For real? How did it feel? Was it special? Was it grand? Did he hug you tight? Does he know you like him? How did you get him to kiss you? You didn't walk up to him and smooch him randomly, did you? Did you French Kiss him or was it just a peck. Did you—"  
反应是即刻的。光子的嘴巴加速动了起来，说话速度比明日香见过的任何时候都要快。“等一下！你亲了他？真的吗？感觉如何？特别吗？隆重吗？他紧紧抱住你了吗？他知道你喜欢他吗？你是怎么让他亲你的？你不是随便走过去就亲了他吧？你们是法式接吻还是只是轻轻一吻？你还——”

"That idiot didn't even hold me," Asuka complained, throwing her nose into the air, "Personally, he was a very lousy kisser."  
“那个笨蛋甚至都没抱我，”明日香抱怨道，把鼻子翘得老高，“就个人而言，他吻技非常糟糕。”

"He was probably so badly in shock he couldn't react."  
"他可能震惊过度，以至于无法反应。"

"Plus I was holding his nose shut."  
"而且我还捏着他的鼻子。"

"That would do it, I suppose."  
"那应该就是原因了，我想。"

"What would do what?" "做什么会怎样？"

Asuka jumped into the air as Rei appeared behind the two of them. Jesus, just where did she come from, anyway? Popping out of nowhere like a ghost or something. Hikari, however, had a less pronounced reaction, perhaps because she was distracted by her curiosity over Asuka's story.  
明日香一跃而起，因为丽突然出现在他们两人身后。天哪，她到底是从哪儿冒出来的？像鬼魂一样突然出现。光却反应不大，可能是因为她被明日香的故事分散了注意力。

"What's up, Rei?" "怎么了，丽？"

"Pilot Sohryu, do you remember that we have Synch Tests today?" Rei asked, her voice hoarse as usual.  
"飞行员惣流，你还记得我们今天有同步测试吗？" 绫波问道，她的声音一如既往地沙哑。

"Oh, forgot about that," Asuka admitted, "Do we have to go now?"  
"哦，忘了这事儿了，" 明日香承认道，"我们非得现在去吗？"

"Yes. Now." "是的。现在。"

"Alright. I'll see you later, Hikari."  
"好的。回头见，光。"

"See you later, Asuka!" "回头见，明日香！"

Rei guided Asuka away from Hikari, and into the doorway where both Shinji and Misato were waiting for them. Asuka didn't look at either of them. That bitch Misato had taken Kaji, and that idiot had ruined her first kiss. She didn't owe those two anything. Still, right now, she'd take the lesser of two evils.  
绫波引导明日香远离光，走向门口，那里真嗣和美里正在等她们。明日香没有看他们中的任何一个。那个婊子美里抢走了加持，而那个白痴毁了她的初吻。她不欠那两个人任何东西。尽管如此，眼下她会选择较小的那个恶。

"So, Misato, I guess we have to go now?"  
"那么，美里，我们该出发了吧？"

"Yeah. Actually, we're running a little late, so hurry up," Misato said, guiding them to her car, which looked brand new.  
"是啊。实际上，我们有点晚了，快点吧，"美里说着，引导他们走向她那辆崭新的车。"

"Wow, you got a new car?" Shinji asked, surprised. Asuka wanted to ever so delicately inform him that even a dirt poor drunken slut like Misato would at least be able to afford fixing her car after her promotion, or, as it appeared, buy a new car that looked nearly identical to the original one.  
"哇，你买了新车？"真嗣惊讶地问。明日香很想委婉地告诉他，即使是像美里这样贫穷又酗酒的邋遢女人，在晋升后至少也能负担得起修车，或者像现在这样，买一辆看起来与原车几乎一模一样的新车。"

"Yeah, well, don't worry about that. It was actually a gift," Misato said, blushing as she opened the driver's seat door.  
“嗯，别担心那个。其实是个礼物，”美里说着，脸颊微红地打开了驾驶座的车门。

"From Kaji?" Asuka asked, gloomily.  
“是加持送的？”明日香闷闷不乐地问。

"Yeah, actually," Misato replied, shutting the door behind her as the children piled into the back three seats. Asuka found herself sitting next to Shinji, who sat in the center seat.  
“对，确实是，”美里回答道，关上车门，孩子们挤进了后座。明日香发现自己坐在真嗣旁边，真嗣坐在中间的座位上。

The car ride there was momentary, but Asuka would have preferred it to take less time. She already knew what was going to happen. She would beat Shinji, who would beat Rei, who would be at the bottom of the pole. Always the same, invariable. There wasn't a big surprise about that or anything.  
前往那里的车程短暂，但明日香宁愿它再短些。她早已预见接下来会发生什么。她会击败真嗣，真嗣会击败绫波，绫波总是垫底。一如既往，毫无变化。对此毫无意外可言。

The moment Ritsuko saw them, she smiled. That idiot was the one who had carted them off to shrinks in the first place. Asuka still wasn't happy about that. Not one damn bit. Nevertheless, she stripped naked, placed the skintight plug suit over her body, and walked into the entry plug where the test began.  
当律子看到他们时，她笑了。那个傻瓜是最初把他们送去接受心理治疗的人。明日香对此仍心怀不满。一点儿也不爽。尽管如此，她还是脱光了衣服，穿上紧身的插入栓服，走进了插入栓，测试随即开始。

After a moment of silence, of integration, of everything of that sort that could not be defined by ordinary descriptions alone, Ritsuko's voice acknowledged them that they had done enough. She cleaned the LCL off of her body, not looking at her two comrades, before Ritsuko and Maya walked in on them, again, as they were half naked.  
经过一段沉默、融合、诸如此类无法仅用寻常描述定义的时刻后，律子的声音告知他们已经足够了。她清洗掉身上的 LCL 液体，没有看向她的两位同伴，随后律子和玛雅再次走进来，他们半裸着。

"Well, this certainly was interesting," Ritsuko said, smiling.  
"嗯，这确实挺有意思的，" 律子笑着说。

"What was so interesting?" Shinji asked, interested.  
"什么这么有趣？" 真嗣问道，感到好奇。

"Well, for starters, Rei and Shinji's synchronization rate skyrocketed. Asuka, yours did increase significantly, but the other two increased extraordinarily."  
"首先，丽和真嗣的同步率飙升了。明日香，你的也有显著提升，但那两人的增幅异常之大。"

"So what does that mean?" Asuka asked, noting that her heart was racing in her chest. Was she nervous? Afraid? That wasn't possible. She was the best. It was that simple. The best at everything, the best pilot. Perfect!  
"那这意味着什么？" 明日香问道，注意到自己的心跳在胸腔中加速。她紧张吗？害怕吗？那是不可能的。她是最好的。就这么简单。在所有方面都是最好的，是最优秀的驾驶员。完美！

"Well, what that means is that, Asuka, Shinji's synchronization rate actually excelled five percent beyond yours."  
"嗯，这意味着，明日香，真嗣的同步率实际上比你高出五个百分点。"

### Chapter 5

"This isn't happening! This just isn't happening!"  
“这不是真的！这绝对不是真的！”

It had to be a nightmare. A dream. Something foul and wicked in the back of her brain. Something horrific and devious. All of this! It couldn't be real. The fact is that she could never, ever, be bested by that stupid, weak, idiot!  
这一定是个噩梦。一个梦。脑海深处某个邪恶的东西。某种可怕而狡猾的东西。所有这一切！这不可能是真的。事实是，她永远，永远，不可能被那个愚蠢、软弱、白痴打败！

Asuka Langley Sohryu pounded into the nearby locker, the metal physically bending under her brute force. She wanted to bash it down, bash it into itself, completely bash it to pieces. In fact, she just wanted to bash the entire world in, bash that stupid idiot's face in, bash Ritsuko, bash the damn computers that made that damn miscalculations (it had to be a miscalculation. There was no way he was better than her!), and then there'd be no one left to tell her she wasn't the greatest anymore.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷猛地撞向附近的储物柜，金属在她蛮力的作用下扭曲变形。她想要将其彻底摧毁，将其砸成碎片。事实上，她只想把整个世界都砸个稀巴烂，把那个愚蠢白痴的脸砸烂，把赤木律子砸烂，把那些该死的电脑砸烂，它们居然算错了（一定是算错了，他不可能比她强！），然后就没人能再说她不是最棒的了。

"Pilot Sohryu." “惣流驾驶员。”

Asuka swirled on her feet to see Rei looking back at her, a slight note of concern in her otherwise apathetic face. Was she here to pity her? To tell her it was alright and comfort her? Well, she didn't need sympathy! Not in the least!  
明日香转身看到绫波零正看着她，那张原本冷漠的脸上流露出一丝关切。她是来可怜她的吗？来告诉她一切都会好起来并安慰她？哼，她才不需要同情！一点儿也不需要！

"I don't want your stupid pity," Asuka snarled, squeezing her fists tightly.  
"我不需要你那愚蠢的怜悯，"明日香咆哮着，紧紧握住双拳。

"I wasn't going to give it," Rei replied, her hoarse voice soft and gentle.  
"我本就没打算给予，"丽回答道，她沙哑的声音柔和而温婉。

"Then what were you here for?"  
"那你来这里是为了什么？"

"Advice." "忠告。"

"Save it." "省省吧。"

"It would do you good to hear it. What do you have to gain from being the best?"  
"听听对你有好处。你成为最好的，能得到什么呢？"

Asuka laughed. "Just because you're at the bottom of the barrel doesn't mean that I should be happy about that. I am still the best. This was just a fluke!"  
明日香笑了。“就算你垫底，也不代表我该为此高兴。我还是最棒的。这只是个意外！”

"Well, according to the tests, our scores increased greatly while yours didn't. I wonder why?"  
“好吧，根据测试结果，我们的分数大幅提升，而你的却没有。真奇怪，为什么呢？”

Asuka knew what the reason was without even thinking of it. It had to be the damn shrink. That was the reason for all of it. Still, regardless of that, she couldn't accept it. She couldn't give Dr. Tamako the satisfaction of knowing she could help her. No, she'd handle this matter as she had all her life: by herself, on her own.  
明日香不用想也知道原因。肯定是那个该死的心理医生。一切都是她的错。尽管如此，她还是无法接受。她不能让田子博士知道她能帮到自己。不，她会像一直以来那样处理这件事：独自一人，靠自己。

Rei was about to say something else, perhaps to add onto her speech, when the intercom rang out into the air. Misato's voice shouted out words that word have ordinarily sent adrenaline pumping through Asuka's veins, but, as they were now full of leaden fury, she felt nothing but fury.  
丽正要再说些什么，或许是想补充她的发言，这时广播突然响起。美里通过扩音器大声呼喊，这些话本应让明日香肾上腺素激增，但此刻她体内充斥着沉重的愤怒，只感到无尽的怒火。

"Guys! There's a new angel!"  
“大家！有新的使徒出现了！”

"Alright, whatever," Asuka snarled.  
“好吧，随便了，”明日香咆哮道。

She took a few seconds to gear up before approaching her Eva. She couldn't believe how she could be beaten like that. She couldn't get that idiot's smiling face out of her brain, out of her mind. To think she had been thinking of things like kisses only an hour before, worried over something stupid and petty like that. Well, that idiot could forget the possibility of a second kiss right now, she guaranteed that.  
她花了好几秒钟调整状态，然后走向她的 Eva。她无法相信自己竟然被打败得如此惨。那个白痴的笑脸在她脑海中挥之不去。就在一小时前，她还在为那种愚蠢的小事烦恼，比如接吻。哼，那个白痴现在就别想有第二次接吻的机会了，她保证。

Before she knew it, they were on the surface, geared in their great monstrous machines, wielding weapons of massive proportions. Still, as each Eva ducked for cover behind the skyscrapers, Asuka could tell she had never seen an Angel quite as weird as this one. It was a perfect sphere levitating in the air, strange white stripes that resembled a fingerprint wrapped around its surface. The entire thing gave Asuka a strange chill for a reason she could not comprehend.  
不知不觉间，他们已经来到了地面，装备着那些巨大的机械怪物，挥舞着比例惊人的武器。尽管每台 Eva 都躲在高楼大厦后寻求掩护，但 Asuka 能感觉到，她从未见过像眼前这样奇怪的天使。它是一个悬浮在空中的完美球体，表面环绕着类似指纹的奇怪白色条纹。整个景象让 Asuka 感到一种无法理解的诡异寒意。

"Is that an Angel?" The sound of that idiot Shinji's voice made Asuka sick. Not just sick, but furious.  
“那是天使吗？”那个白痴 Shinji 的声音让 Asuka 感到恶心。不仅仅是恶心，更是愤怒。

"Well, we haven't confirmed that yet, but consider it your target, the Twelfth Angel." Misato's voice disgusted her too, just for taking Kaji.  
"嗯，我们还没确认这一点，但把它当作你的目标吧，第十二使徒。" 美里提到使徒时那种厌恶的语气也让她自己感到不快，仅仅是因为提到了加持。

"So what should we do?" Shinji asked.  
"那我们该怎么办？" 真嗣问道。

"Wait until we have an idea what this Angel's capabilities are," Misato replied.  
"等我们弄清楚这个使徒的能力后再说，" 美里回答道。

Wait? That wasn't happening. Still, she needed to figure out what that Angel's powers were. Ordinarily, she'd leap at the Angel headlong and attack, but she wasn't in the mood for that. No, this strange angel might have some bizarre ability or something like that. She didn't know why this angel was so bone chilling for her. Well, that didn't matter. She just needed to send a decoy out to provoke it into attacking.  
等等？那并没有发生。尽管如此，她需要弄清楚那个天使的能力是什么。通常情况下，她会直接冲向天使并发起攻击，但她现在没那个心情。不，这个奇怪的天使可能拥有某种奇特的能力或类似的东西。她不知道为什么这个天使对她来说如此令人毛骨悚然。不过，这并不重要。她只需要派出一个诱饵去激怒它，让它攻击。

And what better decoy then their number one?  
还有什么比我们的头号人物更好的诱饵呢？

"Well, why don't we have the invincible Shinji go off to attack that itty bitty angel?" Asuka goaded at Unit 01.  
“那么，为什么不让无敌的 Shinji 去攻击那个小不点的天使呢？”Asuka 挑衅地对初号机说。

"What?" That idiot replied in his stupid high voice.  
"什么？" 那个白痴用他那愚蠢的高音回答道。

"Well, you're the best, right? I'm sure you could kill that damn angel, can't you?"  
"好吧，你是最棒的，对吧？我相信你能干掉那个该死的天使，不是吗？"

"Asuka, the orders are—" "明日香，命令是——"

"Ah, you're just a stupid coward."  
"啊，你不过是个愚蠢的懦夫。"

"I'm not a coward!" "我不是懦夫！"

Perfect. 完美。

Unit 01 rushed around the building, firing his oversized pistol straight into the depths of the gigantic sphere in the air. The moment the bullets collided, the sphere dematerialized completely.  
初号机绕着建筑物疾奔，将他那巨大的手枪直射向空中巨型球体的深处。子弹碰撞的瞬间，球体完全消散了。

"It's an Angel!" Asuka heard one of the assistances on the loudspeakers in her machines shout. Well, Asuka could assume it was an Angel from the beginning. Did they always have to state the obvious?  
“那是使徒！”明日香听到她机甲中的扩音器里一位助手喊道。好吧，明日香从一开始就猜到是使徒了。他们总是得把显而易见的事说出来吗？

Beneath Unit 01, the ground grew dark. Asuka watched in shock as the buildings began to sink into the dark depths of oblivion before her. Unit 01, to Asuka's shock, slowly began to descend into the darkness, as though he were sinking in quicksand. Unit 01 fired bullet after bullet into the dark depths, but that proved useless. That idiot, the Third Child, Shinji, was screaming to high heaven in sheer terror as he sank into the depths of darkness, before any of them could do anything.  
在初号机下方，地面变得昏暗。明日香震惊地看着建筑物开始沉入她面前的黑暗深渊。令明日香震惊的是，初号机缓缓地开始沉入黑暗中，仿佛陷入了流沙。初号机向黑暗深处连发子弹，但那证明毫无用处。那个白痴，第三适格者，真嗣，在陷入黑暗深渊之前，尖叫着极度恐惧，而他们却无能为力。

No.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go. That idiot couldn't have died. He couldn't have. Asuka was about to dive into the dark depths to grab him when Misato ordered them to fallback.  
事情不该是这样的。那个白痴不可能死了。他不可能。明日香正要潜入黑暗深处去救他，却被美里命令撤退。

"But—" “但是——”

"Unit 01 and Shinji are still in there," Rei replied, concerned.  
“初号机和真嗣还在里面，”绫波回答，显得担忧。

"This is an order! Retreat!"  
"这是命令！撤退！"

The following amount of time went slowly. Useless terms and statistics were stated that left no lasting impression in Asuka's mind, despite her understanding what they meant completely. What she took from the descriptions of this Angel was that this freak had Shinji in some sort of dimension inside of itself, and that he was trapped within the Twelfth Angel.  
接下来的时间缓慢流逝。无用的术语和统计数据被一一陈述，尽管明日香完全理解它们的含义，但这些信息并未在她心中留下深刻印象。从对这使徒的描述中，她得知这个怪物将真嗣困在了其内部某个维度中，而他正陷于第十二使徒之内。

And it was all her fault.  
而这一切都是她的错。

If she hadn't tricked Shinji into jumping headlong into the fray, none of this would have happened. She wanted to see that idiot get out of there for her own good. It was her fault, all her fault! She couldn't endure that. She wouldn't endure the knowledge that, had she not been such a bitch, not been so arrogant, Shinji would have still been here with her.  
如果不是她诱骗真嗣一头扎进这场混战，这一切都不会发生。她本意是想让那个傻瓜为了自己好而离开那里。这都是她的错，全是她的错！她无法忍受这一点。她不愿忍受这样的认知：如果她不是那么泼辣，不是那么傲慢，真嗣还会和她在一起。

So it wasn't her fault. She had to blame Shinji. After all, he didn't need to listen to her complaining. He could have obeyed orders, right? And not been such a cocky bastard, right? Right?  
所以这不是她的错。她必须怪罪真嗣。毕竟，他不需要听她的抱怨。他本可以服从命令，对吧？而不是那么自大的混蛋，对吧？对吧？

"Good grief! Taking matters into his own hands, ignoring the plan. Honestly, talk about getting what he deserved. Just because he got a little better score on those tests, he was going to show me how it's done?! What a big-headed idiot!"  
天哪！擅自行动，无视计划。老实说，真是自作自受。就因为他那些测试成绩稍微好一点，就要向我展示怎么做吗？！真是个自大的白痴！

She felt someone breathe on the back of her neck, at which she turned around to see Rei glaring at her. Why was she so angry? What did she have to complain about? "What? Is my bad-mouthing of Shinji that much of a problem for you?!"  
她感觉到有人在她颈后呼吸，转身一看，是丽正瞪着她。她为何如此生气？有什么好抱怨的？“什么？我骂真嗣对你来说有那么严重吗？！”

"Tell me, do you pilot Eva just for the praise of others?"  
“告诉我，你驾驶 Eva 只是为了别人的赞扬吗？”

She had replied to that with some smart comment, but even then, she knew that Rei was 100 correct. That was the reason. She depended on other people's opinions of her to survive. She depended on hearing them congratulating her, on telling her good job and patting her on the back. That's all. Without that, she had nothing. Absolutely nothing whatsoever. She wasn't any better than that damn idiot, was she?  
她当时用一句俏皮话回应了，但即便如此，她知道丽说得完全正确。这就是原因。她依赖于别人对她的看法来生存。她依赖于听到他们祝贺她，告诉她做得好并拍拍她的背。仅此而已。没有这些，她一无所有。绝对一无所有。她并不比那个该死的白痴好到哪儿去，不是吗？

At the thought of Shinji, her mind returned to the dark depths of oblivion once more, at which she internalized her emotions, not letting anyone else see how she felt. She couldn't let them see. Not now.  
一想到真嗣，她的思绪再次沉入遗忘的深渊，她将情感深藏心底，不让任何人窥见她的感受。她不能让他们看到。现在不行。

Hours later, Misato called her and Rei into the Command Center. Her face was grim, her lips thin, and her expression intense with a note of melancholy. This did not bode well.  
几小时后，美里叫她和绫波进入指挥中心。她的面容严峻，嘴唇紧抿，表情中带着一丝忧郁。这可不是什么好兆头。

"So did you figure out a way to save Shinji?" Asuka asked, trying to control the note of despair in her voice.  
“所以，你们找到救真嗣的办法了吗？”明日香问道，努力压抑着声音中的绝望。

"The plan is to drop every N2 mine we have into the Angel's body, while your AT Fields control the mass. We think we'll be able to salvage Unit 01."  
“计划是将我们所有的 N2 地雷投放到使徒体内，同时利用你的 AT 力场控制质量。我们预计能够回收 01 号机。”

"What about Pilot Ikari?" Rei asked, her soft, hoarse voice also intense.  
“碇司令怎么办？”绫波问道，她那柔和而沙哑的声音同样充满了紧迫感。

Misato did not answer, but rather said, "The orders are already in place. Get ready."  
美里没有回答，而是说道：“命令已经下达。准备行动。”

Did that mean they were giving up on him? Going to let him die? Was he already dead to them? Just replaceable? Well, that should be a good thing for Asuka, right? Now she was Number One again, right? Why did that knowledge not cheer her up whatsoever? Why did she feel so empty, so vacant all over again? Why did she feel so alone?  
这是否意味着他们要放弃他？任由他死去？他已对他们毫无意义？只是可有可无的存在？这对明日香来说应该是好事，对吧？现在她又重回第一了，对吧？为何这份认知丝毫没有让她感到振奋？为何她感到如此空虚，再次被掏空一般？为何她感到如此孤独？

Once more, the image of a young girl waiting outside a plate of glass as she watched her mother stroking a doll emerged in her mind's eye. But she didn't react with anxiety or fear, or sorrow. She was too overwhelmed to do anything other than walk to her Eva, and board it.  
又一次，一个小女孩站在玻璃窗外，看着母亲抚摸着玩偶的画面浮现在她眼前。但她没有表现出焦虑、恐惧或悲伤。她太过压抑，除了走向她的 EVA 并登上它，别无他法。

The moment she emerged on the surface, she saw the now massive black see of darkness that was the Angel, and the large sphere drifting above it. She wanted to shoot that damned ball, but knew that the ball itself was not truly the Angel. The black sea was. She walked to the shore of the darkness, and waited, patiently, Rei opposite her, as the multitude of jets soared above them, filled with N2 mines.  
当她出现在地面上时，她看到了那片如今已变得巨大的黑暗之海——天使，以及漂浮在其上方的大球体。她想射下那该死的球，但知道球本身并非真正的天使。那片黑海才是。她走向黑暗的边缘，耐心等待，丽与她相对，众多载满 N2 地雷的喷气机在他们上方飞过。

They were really going to do it. They were really going to blow Shinji to Kingdom Come. She gripped the controls tightly. She prayed for a miracle. For something to happen. Something miraculous to come so that Shinji would be safe.  
他们真的要这么做。他们真的要把真嗣炸到天边去。她紧紧握住操纵杆。她祈祷着奇迹。希望有什么事情发生。希望有奇迹出现，让真嗣能够安全。

And then it happened. 然后，事情发生了。

There was a bulge emerging within the gigantic sphere in the sky. Asuka looked to the sky as the surface of the sphere snapped open, releasing a torrent of blood! She stared on in horror as a pair of claws wrenched apart the sphere angel's side, a gash large enough for Eva Unit 01's head to emerge, drenched and sodden with blood as it roared like a monstrous fiend into the air, like a demon from the deepest pits of Hell.  
天空中巨大的球体内部开始隆起。明日香抬头望去，只见球体的表面突然裂开，喷涌出大量鲜血！她惊恐地注视着，一对利爪撕裂了球体天使的侧身，一道足以让 EVA 初号机头部通过的巨大伤口出现，头部浸满鲜血，如同来自地狱深渊的恶魔般咆哮着冲入空中。

"My God, is that what I'm piloting…?"  
"我的天，这就是我要驾驶的…？"

She couldn't believe it. This wasn't Shinji. This wasn't him at all. Was this the will of Unit 01? No, that wasn't possible. It was just a machine, right? It didn't have a will, right? But, as the beast leapt onto the depths of the dark see, which shattered to pieces upon impact, the sight of the machine's deep white eyes burned into the back of her head.  
她难以置信。这不是真嗣。这根本不是他。这是初号机的意志吗？不，那不可能。它只是一台机器，对吧？它没有意志，对吧？然而，当那巨兽跃入深邃的黑暗之海，撞击之下海面碎裂成片，机器那深邃的白色眼眸深深烙印在她的脑海中。

However, as the Angel disappeared into a smear of blood, the Eva's eyes became bleak, and his body collapsed to the ground.  
然而，随着使徒消失在一片血雾中，Eva 的眼眸变得黯淡无光，它的身躯也随之倒地。

The events that followed went by slowly and yet it felt as though the moment the events had occurred they had ended. They had first taken Shinji out of Unit 01. Asuka was excited to see he was still in one piece. However, he was unconscious, and had thus been taken to the medical ward in order to recover. After some time of waiting (most of the time Asuka was waiting outside of the room, too embarrassed to be the first thing Shinji saw when he woke up), the idiot woke up from his coma.  
随后发生的事情进展缓慢，但感觉上就像事件一发生就结束了。他们首先将真嗣从初号机中救出。看到他完好无损，明日香感到兴奋。然而，他处于昏迷状态，因此被送往医疗病房以恢复。等待了一段时间（大部分时间明日香都在房间外等待，太害羞了，不想成为真嗣醒来时看到的第一个人），这个笨蛋终于从昏迷中醒来。

Rei, who had been waiting at his bedside, had walked out of the room, and said, gently, "Go in."  
一直在他床边等待的绫波，轻轻地走出房间，说道：“进去吧。”

"Sure, whatever," Asuka replied, hiding her jubilation within herself. She walked into the room, and plopped herself onto the side of Shinji's bed. "Feeling better?"  
“当然，随便吧，”明日香回答，掩饰着内心的喜悦。她走进房间，一屁股坐在真嗣床边。“感觉好些了吗？”

"I think so." "我想是的。"

"So what happened in there?"  
"那里面发生了什么？"

"I don't really know." "我真的不知道。"

"You went completely berserk."  
"你完全失控了。"

"I wasn't in control." "我当时无法自控。"

"Then what was?" "那是什么在控制？"

"I have no idea." "我不知道。"

"I see. That's freaky." "我明白了。真诡异。"

"Hey, Asuka?" "嘿，明日香？"

"Yeah? What is it?" "是吗？什么事？"

"About before, with the tests…"  
"关于之前，那些测试的事……"

Asuka had almost forgotten that Shinji had beaten her. She sighed, "You just had to go and remind me of that, did you?"  
明日香几乎忘了真嗣曾赢过她。她叹了口气，“你就非得提醒我那件事，是吧？”

"I'm sorry." "对不起。"

"What?! You're apologizing for winning? Grow a damn backbone," Asuka snarled, rushing to her feet, "Damn, can't you just be like everyone else and brag a little about how good you're doing? Or be proud of it at least? I won't be beaten by someone who isn't excited about victory."  
"什么？！你赢了还要道歉？长点骨气吧，"明日香咆哮着跳起来，"该死，你就不能像其他人一样，稍微炫耀一下自己做得多好吗？或者至少为此感到自豪？我不会输给一个对胜利无动于衷的人。"

At that, she left him alone to stare at her, a tad confused.  
说完，她留下他独自困惑地盯着她的背影。

After that, it took a mere day for them to be driven right back to Dr. Tamako. Naturally, Shinji spent the most time there because of his accident. Rei and Asuka were alone for some time before Rei broke the silence.  
自那之后，他们仅用了一天时间就被送回了玉子博士那里。自然，因为事故，真嗣在那里待的时间最长。在真嗣离开期间，绫波和明日香有一段时间是单独相处的，直到绫波打破了沉默。

"Regarding my comment to you while Shinji was gone," Rei replied, "I apologize if you found it offensive."  
“关于真嗣不在时我对你的评论，”绫波回答道，“如果让你感到不快，我为此道歉。”

"Its no problem," Asuka replied, "You were right. Nothing to apologize about."  
“没关系，”明日香回答，“你说得对。没什么需要道歉的。”

Rei showed the faintest hint of gratitude. Had she been beating herself up over something as trivial as that? Well, she certainly had more emotion than Asuka had ever given her credit for.  
丽露出了最微弱的感激之色。她是否一直在为如此琐碎的事情自责呢？嗯，她的情感确实比明日香曾经给予她的评价要丰富得多。

"The doctor will see Asuka now," the secretary said as Shinji walked out of the office, a relieved expression on his face.  
“医生现在要见明日香了，”秘书说道，而真嗣走出办公室，脸上带着释然的表情。

"Right," Asuka replied, pushing herself up, and walking past Shinji. There was a hint of a smile on her face as she walked down the hallway and into the office.  
“好的，”明日香回答，撑起身来，从真嗣身边走过。她走进办公室时，脸上隐约带着一丝微笑。

"Ah! Asuka! How're you feeling?" Dr. Tamako asked, smiling thinly.  
"啊！明日香！你感觉怎么样？" 玉子医生微笑着问道。

"Fine, I guess," Asuka said, throwing herself into the recliner.  
"还好吧，我想，" 明日香说着，把自己扔进了躺椅里。

"Fine? That's perfect," Dr. Tamako replied, smiling, "Quite a day, huh? Yesterday, I mean."  
"还好？那太好了，" 玉子医生笑着回答，"真是充实的一天，对吧？我是说昨天。"

"It was pretty stressful, I admit."  
"我承认，那确实挺紧张的。"

"Were you worried about your husband to be?"  
"你是不是担心你即将成为的丈夫？"

"Will you cut that out?"  
"你能别这样了吗？"

"Nah! It's just so cute and sweet!"  
"才不呢！它只是太可爱太甜了！"

"There is nothing going on between us."  
"我们之间什么都没有。"

"That's not what you told me last time."  
"上次你可不是这么跟我说的。"

"Will you shut up about that!?" Asuka stammered, blushing deep red.  
"你能别再提那件事了吗？！" 明日香结结巴巴地说，脸红得深红。

"Nope!" Dr. Tamako replied with a grin, "You're just a match made in heaven, you two are."  
"不行！" 玉子博士笑着回答，"你们俩简直就是天造地设的一对。"

"What do you mean by that? He's spineless!"  
"你这么说是什么意思？他一点骨气都没有！"

"Well, the way I see it, you both depend on other's opinions entirely."  
“嗯，依我看，你们俩完全依赖对方的看法。”

Asuka felt a knife stab straight into her heart. How did she know? How did she figure it out before Asuka figured it out? Was she that easy to read? Dr. Tamako smiled thinly as she continued, "Well, Asuka, I'm sure your relationship with Shinji is progressing smoothly, but there is something else on your mind, isn't there?"  
明日香感到一把刀直插心脏。她怎么知道的？她怎么比明日香自己还早看透？她有那么容易读懂吗？玉子博士淡淡一笑，继续说道：“好吧，明日香，我相信你和真嗣的关系进展顺利，但你心里还有别的事，对吧？”

She nodded, truthfully. 她点了点头，如实回答。

"You lost, didn't you?" "你输了，对吧？"

"I was beaten once! It was a fluke! It won't happen again."  
"我曾被打败过一次！那是侥幸！不会再发生了。"

"Listen, Asuka, I want you to do something until our next session," Dr. Tamako said.  
"听着，明日香，我希望你在我们下次会面之前做一件事，" 玉子医生说。

"What?" "什么？"

"I want you to look at the people around you, and I want you to see if they treat you any different than they used to treat you now that you've lost to Shinji," Dr. Tamako replied.  
"我希望你看看周围的人，我想让你看看他们现在对你的态度是否与你在输给真嗣之前有所不同，"玉子博士回答道。

"But my friends don't know about that," Asuka replied.  
"但我的朋友们并不知道那件事，"明日香回答说。

"Then tell them," Dr. Tamako replied.  
"那就告诉他们，"玉子博士回答说。

"But what if I lose Hikari?"  
"但如果我失去了光呢？"

"Hikari?" "光？"

"She's a really good friend of mine."  
"她是我非常好的朋友。"

"I'm sure if she loves you, she won't just abandon you over something as insignificant as a synch test. I'm sure you'll be fine. Now, please tell me next session if you see even the smallest difference in how people treat you. I don't think they'll even care. People who love you only for how good you are aren't worth being your friends. Now, how about some Rummy?"  
"我相信如果她爱你，她不会因为像同步测试这样微不足道的事情就抛弃你。我确信你会没事的。现在，请在下一次会话时告诉我，你是否注意到人们对待你的方式有哪怕最细微的差别。我认为他们甚至不会在意。那些只因为你有多优秀才爱你的人，不值得成为你的朋友。那么，来玩一局拉米牌怎么样？"

### Chapter 6

"Hey, Hikari." "嘿，光。"

Hikari glanced over her shoulder to see Asuka approaching her, her head down in shame. Her eyes displayed concern as she approached, anxiously, "What's wrong? Did something happen?"  
光回头一看，是明日香朝她走来，羞愧地低着头。她的眼神流露出关切，急切地走近，"怎么了？发生什么事了吗？"

"I guess," Asuka replied, taking a seat next to her.  
"算是吧，"明日香回答，在她旁边坐下。"

"You don't sound right. Are you sure you're okay?"  
"你听起来不对劲。你确定你没事吗？"

Of course she wasn't okay. She wanted to inform Hikari just how not okay she was at the moment. For one, she wanted to touch Shinji. The drive was so powerful that she could barely contain it behind her façade, and even it was a struggle. She really did love him, she had figured out, not just a crush or a passing fancy. But even more important, more horrible than that, was that she had been beaten. She had failed, and she had devoted her entire life to success. After all, if she wasn't someone, no one would acknowledge her. She prayed to God that Hikari wouldn't reject her.  
当然，她并不好。她想告诉光她现在有多么不好。首先，她想触碰真嗣。这种冲动如此强烈，以至于她几乎无法在伪装下控制住，即使这样做也很困难。她真的爱他，她已经明白了，不仅仅是迷恋或一时兴起。但更重要的是，比这更可怕的是，她被打败了。她失败了，而她一生都致力于成功。毕竟，如果她不是某个人，没有人会承认她。她祈祷上帝光不会拒绝她。

"You know those Synchronization tests we have to take all the time?" Asuka asked.  
"你知道那些我们得一直做的同步测试吗？" 明日香问道。

"Yeah. What about them?" "是啊。他们怎么了？"

"Do you know how I usually win all the time?"  
"你知道我通常是怎么一直赢的吗？"

"Uh-huh." "嗯哼。"

"Well, yesterday, um, Shinji…"  
"嗯，昨天，呃，真嗣…"

"He beat you, didn't he?"  
"他打败你了，对吧？"

"Yeah, he did," Asuka muttered, softly so that only Hikari would hear her.  
"是啊，他赢了，" 明日香低声嘟囔，只有光听得到。

"Aw, that stinks," Hikari replied, frowning slightly, "Sorry. That must stink, huh?"  
"哎呀，真糟糕，" 光回答道，微微皱眉，"抱歉。那一定很难受吧？"

"It does," Asuka said, waiting patiently for the moment where Hikari left her, unwilling to spend time with a loser like her. A failure.  
"确实，" 明日香说，耐心等待着光离开她的那一刻，不愿与像她这样的失败者共度时光。"

"Well, the way I see it, at least now you can try harder to beat him, right?" Hikari said.  
"嗯，依我看，至少现在你可以更努力地打败他，对吧？" 光说道。"

Asuka glanced back at Hikari, an eyebrow raised. Was she giving her advice to win? Was she lessening the blow? Hikari frowned again as she said, "I know that meant a lot to you, right? Being the best?"  
明日香回头瞥了一眼光，眉头一挑。她是在教她如何取胜吗？还是在减轻打击？光再次皱起眉头说道：“我知道那对你很重要，对吧？成为最好的？”

"It meant everything," Asuka sighed, lowering her head in shame again. Why wasn't Hikari rejecting her? Why wasn't she getting up and leaving her? No one wanted to associate with a loser like her. She was better off just keeping it a secret between the Pilots, although surely that idiot would have told his idiot friends about this!  
“那意味着一切，”明日香叹了口气，再次羞愧地低下头。为什么光不拒绝她？为什么不站起来离开她？没有人愿意和一个失败者扯上关系。她最好还是把这个秘密藏在驾驶员之间，尽管那个白痴肯定已经告诉了他的白痴朋友们这件事！

"I'm sorry. I really am," Hikari said, putting an arm around Asuka's shoulder, "I mean, I don't know how it feels to have something like that happen to me. It must be terrible."  
“对不起，我真的感到很抱歉，”光说着，一只手臂搭在明日香的肩上，“我是说，我不知道那种事发生在我身上会是什么感觉。一定很糟糕。”

"I wouldn't be surprised if you just went off and left me," Asuka sighed.  
"如果你就这么离开我，我也不会感到惊讶的，"明日香叹息道。

"Why would I do that?" Hikari asked, a tad confused.  
"我为什么要那么做呢？" 美里有些困惑地问。

"Because no one wants to be around a loser like me."  
"因为没人愿意和一个像我这样的失败者待在一起。"

"So because you lost once you're a loser?"  
"所以就因为输了一次，你就是个失败者？"

"Basically." "基本上。"

"That's stupid." "这太蠢了。"

Was she calling her entire philosophy on life stupid? Was she calling the method of which she had lived every waking moment of her existence stupid? Well, was she? The fact of the matter was that this attention she was receiving, to actually receive criticism for her philosophies, which normally would have hurt her and offended her, now sent a charge of joy through her heart.  
她是在说她整个人生哲学的愚蠢吗？她是在说她每时每刻所遵循的生活方式愚蠢吗？好吧，她是在这么说吗？事实是，她现在得到的关注，实际上是因为她的哲学而受到批评，这通常会伤害她并冒犯她，但现在却让她的心中充满了喜悦。

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"What do I mean? Well, for one thing, you aren't a loser if you don't win all the time," Hikari said, frowning, "No one's perfect. For another thing, the fact is that you beat Shinji at every one of these tests since the beginning, so you've certainly been the champion for awhile."  
"我是什么意思？嗯，首先，如果你不是每次都赢，并不意味着你就是失败者，" 光说，皱着眉头，"没有人是完美的。再者，事实上你从一开始就在这些测试中每次都打败了真嗣，所以你已经当了很久的冠军了。"

"I guess." "我想是的。"

"Wait, I'm not done yet! Number three, it doesn't matter if you can win or not. You are still a great person, even if you don't win all the time."  
“等等，我还没说完！第三点，无论你是否能赢，这都不重要。即使不是常胜将军，你依然是个了不起的人。”

A great person? What did she have to offer other than her abilities as a pilot? Asuka had always depended one hundred percent on her piloting abilities to survive, to identify herself. That much she had figured out on her own since that Angel battle. Since Shinji was swallowed up.  
了不起的人？她除了作为驾驶员的能力外，还有什么可提供的呢？明日香一直百分之百依赖她的驾驶技能来生存，来定义自己。自从那次使徒战斗，真嗣被吞噬后，她自己就已经明白了这一点。

Asuka fell onto Hikari, hugging her tightly. Hikari, obviously surprised by her reaction, replied in the only way she could think of replying: hugging her back. They sat there for what had to be at most fifteen seconds, simply hugging. Hikari's embrace was warm, soothing, if not completely enthralling. Asuka didn't wish for her to let go, in fact only wishing for the warmth from her friend's arms to wrap her up and consume her entirely.  
明日香倒在光怀里，紧紧拥抱她。光显然被她的反应吓了一跳，只能想到用同样的方式回应：回抱她。她们就这样坐了最多十五秒，只是互相拥抱。光的怀抱温暖而抚慰，虽然并不完全令人着迷。明日香不希望她放手，实际上只希望朋友的温暖能包裹她，完全吞噬她。

Their moment was interrupted quite abruptly, however, as that idiot's friend Toji shouted, "Class Rep, I don't know if it's such a good idea to be in such close contact with that Demon."  
然而，他们的时刻被那个白痴的朋友东治非常突然地打断了，他喊道："班长，和那个恶魔靠得这么近，我觉得不太好吧。"

"Will you shut up?!" snarled Asuka, rising to her feet. Hikari didn't respond, but rather glanced at her toes, blushing deep red.  
"你能闭嘴吗？！" 明日香咆哮着站起身来。光没有回应，而是瞥了一眼自己的脚尖，脸红得深红。

Toji shrugged her off as he mumbled, "How Shinji can live with you is beyond me."  
冬二耸耸肩把她甩开，咕哝道：“真不知道真嗣怎么能跟你住在一起。”

Asuka wanted to slug him, but was prevented by the arrival of Rei, who chose to specifically walk right between the two of them. By the time she crossed, the urge to slug Toji had passed. Instead, Asuka threw herself into her seat, angrily, and brooded silently.  
明日香本想揍他一拳，但被零的到来打断了，零特意径直走到他们两人之间。等她走过去时，揍冬二的冲动已经消退。相反，明日香气呼呼地坐回座位，沉默地生着闷气。

As class passed, she paid attention to the rest of her surroundings. Nothing was different. Hikari still occasionally sent her texts through their laptops, despite her trying to maintain a good example as class rep. Rei still looked out the window abysmally, occasionally glancing at the surrounding people, including Asuka and Shinji. Shinji still maintained his shy glances to the side, paying attention mostly to the laptop with a dull expression on his face. The teacher was still as boring as only God knew what. In fact, it felt like another day, as though the world around her didn't care that she had lost.  
随着课堂的进行，她留意着周围的其他事物。一切都没有变化。尽管作为班长努力树立好榜样，光依然时不时通过笔记本电脑给她发消息。零依旧忧郁地望着窗外，偶尔瞥向周围的人，包括明日香和真嗣。真嗣依然保持着羞涩的侧目，大部分时间都盯着笔记本电脑，脸上带着呆滞的表情。老师依旧无聊得只有上帝才知道。事实上，这感觉就像又一天过去了，仿佛周围的世界并不在乎她已经失去了什么。

Would it be the same if they all knew about her failure? Would they be so boringly the same if they knew about her defeat? Her loss? She doubted it. Sure, Hikari told her otherwise, but that was Hikari. She was Asuka's friend. Surely she was just being nice.  
如果他们都知道她的失败，情况会一样吗？如果他们知道她的失败，他们会如此无聊地一致吗？她的损失？她对此表示怀疑。当然，光告诉她不是这样的，但那是光。她是明日香的朋友。她肯定只是在表示友好。

And then the doctor's words reverberated through her brain. The words about how a true friend would love her for her qualities as a person and not just the fact that she was good at piloting. Was that true? Could that be the truth and not just a myth? Not just a lie? A façade? She prayed it was the case. She prayed to God in Heaven.  
然后医生的那些话在她脑海中回响。那些关于真正的朋友会因为她的个人品质而爱她，而不仅仅是因为她擅长驾驶的话。那是真的吗？那可能是真的，而不是一个神话吗？不仅仅是一个谎言？一个假象？她祈祷那是真的。她向天堂的上帝祈祷。

As class ended, she came to a conclusion: simply experimenting in school wasn't enough. These idiots were clueless about the inner workings of NERV. She'd have to go to HQ herself and see what was going on. However, as she was leaving, she noticed Hikari and Toji talking from the corner of her eyes. Asuka had known, for some time now, just what Hikari's feelings for Toji were like. She knew that Hikari liked him the same way Asuka liked Shinji. However, unlike herself, Hikari had no problem walking up to Toji and trying to start friendly conversation. What was different about their relationship as opposed to the relationship Asuka and Shinji shared? Was there a difference? Was it just that Hikari was a stronger person than she, Asuka, was?  
随着课程结束，她得出了一个结论：仅仅在学校里实验是不够的。这些傻瓜对 NERV 的内部运作一无所知。她必须亲自去总部看看发生了什么。然而，当她离开时，她注意到光子和冬二在眼角余光中交谈。明日香早就知道光子对冬二的感觉如何。她知道光子喜欢他，就像明日香喜欢真嗣一样。但是，与她自己不同，光子毫不犹豫地走向冬二，试图开始友好的对话。他们的关系与明日香和真嗣的关系有什么不同？有区别吗？是不是光子比她，明日香，更坚强？

Whatever the case may be, she left the two love birds, only to run into Shinji. His expression was tense. She wondered, for a moment, why he would have a reason to be tense. However, his anxiety was soon explained as he glanced up at her, and said, softly, "Well, uh, Asuka, about before…"  
无论情况如何，她离开了那对情侣，却撞见了真嗣。他的表情紧张。她一时好奇，为何他有理由紧张。然而，他的焦虑很快得到了解释，当他抬头看向她，轻声说道：“嗯，呃，明日香，关于之前的事…”

"Eh, don't worry about it," Asuka said, a smirk on her lips, "That just goes to show me that I was taking things too easy. Next time, watch out."  
“哎，别放在心上，”明日香嘴角带着一丝笑意，“那只是说明我之前太松懈了。下次，小心点。”

"I don't really care about these tests."  
“我对这些测试并不在意。”

Asuka glanced back at him. "Oh really? Why don't you care?"  
明日香瞥了他一眼。"哦，真的吗？你为什么不在乎？"

"I really don't think they matter too much. If you want to win, then I'll let you win. If you want to, I mean—"  
“我真的不认为它们太重要。如果你想赢，那我就让你赢。我是说，如果你愿意的话——”

"Look! If you just let me win, that wouldn't be fair! I want to beat you in an all out, fair match. I don't want you just throwing in the towel for my sake, here me?"  
"看！如果你让我赢，那就不公平了！我要在一场全力以赴、公平的对决中打败你。我不希望你为了我而放弃，明白吗？"

"Uh, okay. I just thought—"  
"呃，好吧。我只是以为——"

"You thought wrong, I'm afraid."  
"恐怕你想错了。"

Why was she getting so worked up over such a simple matter? Why was she getting so excited over Shinji offering to lose on purpose? After all, if he lost, then she would be number one always. She would maintain the title, and no one would take it away from her. Why wouldn't she want Shinji to lose on purpose for her? Why not?  
为什么她会因为这么简单的事情如此激动？为什么她会对真嗣故意输掉比赛如此兴奋？毕竟，如果他输了，那么她将永远是第一名。她将保持这个头衔，没有人能夺走它。为什么她不希望真嗣故意输给她呢？为什么不呢？

Well, the reason was simple: she had pride!  
嗯，原因很简单：她有自尊！

"Don't get used to winning, though. I'll beat you next time," Asuka laughed, walking past him with a smug smile on her face.  
"别习惯赢了，下次我会打败你，" 明日香笑着走过他，脸上带着得意的微笑。

"If you say so." "你这么说的话。"

"I say so." "我说了算。"

"Alright." "好吧。"

Asuka was about to go when Shinji spoke up. "Where are you going?"  
明日香正要离开时，真嗣开口问道：“你要去哪儿？”

"To headquarters." "回总部。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because I feel like it."  
"因为我乐意。"

"Well, a good a reason as any, I guess."  
"嗯，这理由挺好的，我想。"

"Hey, Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"Wanna come with me?" “想跟我一起来吗？”

Why was she inviting that idiot with her anyway? Was it because she wanted to spend time with him, God forbid? Was it because she didn't want to be alone? Well, whatever the reason was, she had gone ahead and said it. There was no turning back now.  
她到底为什么要邀请那个白痴跟她一起呢？难道是因为她想和他共度时光，天哪，千万别是这个原因。还是因为她不想独自一人？不管是什么理由，话已经说出口了。现在无法回头了。

Shinji smiled, slightly, "If you want me to."  
真嗣微微一笑，“如果你希望我去的话。”

"No, I want to know if you want to. Here you go again relying on what everyone else wants. What do you want?"  
“不，我想知道你自己的意愿。你又来了，总是依赖别人的期望。你自己想要什么？”

"Well, I don't know what I want. I guess I'd like to go with you, I suppose."  
“嗯，我不知道自己想要什么。我想，我愿意和你一起去，大概吧。”

"Good!" Asuka said, smiling thinly, "Then let's go."  
"好极了！" 明日香微微一笑，"那我们走吧。"

"We walking?" "我们步行吗？"

"Sure. Good for your body, right?"  
"当然。对身体有好处，不是吗？"

"I suppose so." "我想是的。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji by the wrist, and pulled him out of the doors, a brisk jump in her step. Why was she so damn excited? Why was she even happy? Sure, she liked Shinji, but not this much, surely. Surely not! But still, nevertheless, she was going to take advantage of this surge of happiness while she could.  
明日香抓住真嗣的手腕，拉着他走出门口，脚步轻快地跳跃着。她为何如此兴奋？为何如此高兴？当然，她喜欢真嗣，但肯定没到这种程度。肯定没有！但尽管如此，她还是打算趁现在尽情享受这份突如其来的快乐。

"Hey! Quit dragging me." "嘿！别拽我。"

"Ah, shut up." "啊，闭嘴。"

Asuka let go of him only after they were a good mile away from the school. The moment she released him, he obediently followed in her step like a trained dog. She wished he could show even just a little more backbone. That was the one thing she wanted to see from him more than anything else. Just for him to stand up for himself. Still, she was glad that he was paying attention to her, even though he was now a superior pilot.  
直到离学校有一英里远，明日香才放开他。她一松手，他就乖乖地跟在她后面，像条训练有素的狗。她希望他能稍微有点骨气。这是她最想从他身上看到的。哪怕只是为自己挺身而出一次。尽管如此，她还是很高兴他在关注她，即使他现在是一名更高级的驾驶员。

"So why did you want to go to headquarters anyway, Asuka?" Shinji asked, curiously.  
"那么，你为什么想去总部，明日香？" 真嗣好奇地问。

"I just want to say hi."  
"我只是想打个招呼。"

"That's it?" "就这样？"

"Basically." "基本上。"

"Couldn't you have waited until we were needed to say hi?"  
"你就不能等到我们需要打招呼的时候再说吗？"

"Well, it's spontaneous and random," Asuka explained, "That's why it's important. The spontaneity of it all."  
"嗯，这是自发的，随机的，" 明日香解释道，"正因为如此才重要。这种自发性才是关键。"

"Spontaneity?" "自发性？"

"Exactly!" "正是！"

"If you say so." "你这么说的话。"

As they reached the entrance to NERV, Shinji said, softly, "Um, Asuka?"  
当他们到达 NERV 的入口时，真嗣轻声说道：“呃，明日香？”

"What is it?" Asuka asked as she ran her ID card across the card swipe.  
“这是什么？” 明日香边问边用她的 ID 卡在刷卡器上划过。

"Why were you hugging Hikari before?"  
“你之前为什么拥抱光？”

"It's a girl thing," Asuka said, walking through the now open door as Shinji swiped his card.  
“这是女孩子的事，” 明日香说着，穿过已经打开的门，而真嗣正在刷他的卡。

"I see. But what was the reason?"  
"我明白了。但原因是什么呢？"

"You really want to know, don't you?"  
"你真的想知道，对吧？"

"I'm just curious. That's all."  
"我只是好奇而已。仅此而已。"

Showing backbone? Well, she could respect that. "Alright, the truth is that I was afraid."  
展现骨气？嗯，她能尊重这一点。“好吧，真相是我害怕了。”

"Afraid? But you're always so confident."  
“害怕？但你总是那么自信。”

"Ah, well, it isn't so much that I'm not confident. It's just that I was worried about something, you know?"  
“啊，其实，我并不是不自信。只是有些事情让我担心，你懂的吧？”

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"Well, I just love being number one. I was afraid that if I wasn't number one, people wouldn't…and why the hell am I telling an idiot like you all this anyway!?" Asuka couldn't believe she had spilt her guts to this idiot! This moron! This spineless fool!  
"哼，我就是喜欢当第一。我担心如果我不是第一，人们就不会……我他妈的为什么要跟像你这样的白痴说这些！？" 明日香简直不敢相信自己居然对这个白痴吐露了心声！这个蠢货！这个没骨气的傻瓜！

And yet he had asked. He had displayed courage and asked. He hadn't left her. He hadn't abandoned her because she had lost. If anything, he had come to her, not the other way around. He wasn't leaving her alone. He hadn't left now. He wasn't about to leave.  
然而，他确实问了。他展现了勇气并问了。他没有离开她。她失败了，他没有因此抛弃她。相反，他来找她，而不是她去找他。他没有让她孤单一人。现在没有离开。他也不会离开。

Asuka sighed, and said, softly, "I was afraid that everyone would leave me."  
明日香叹了口气，轻声说道：“我担心大家都会离开我。”

"Leave you? Why?" “离开你？为什么？”

"Because no one cares about losers, you know?" Asuka said, frowning, "They only like the winners. The best."  
“因为没人关心失败者，你知道吗？”明日香皱着眉说，“他们只喜欢赢家。最好的那个。”

"I don't know about that. I mean, you are a very strong person."  
"我不确定这一点。我的意思是，你是一个非常坚强的人。"

"You think so?" "你这么认为吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Well, I guess you're right."  
"嗯，我想你是对的。"

Shinji smiled, "I know I'm right. You're always so strong and confident. And you never give in to anyone else. That's strength."  
真嗣微笑着说：“我知道我是对的。你总是那么坚强和自信。而且你从不向任何人屈服。这就是力量。”

"I guess you're right." “我想你是对的。”

"Well, I—" Shinji began, but they were interrupted by none other than Misato.  
“嗯，我——”真嗣刚开口，就被美里打断了。

"What are you guys doing here?"  
"你们在这里做什么？"

Asuka wanted to thank Misato personally for interrupting a perfect moment between her and Shinji. Rather, she just glared at Misato, a vein pulsing in her forehead, as she mumbled, "Misato…nice of you to drop by."  
明日香本想亲自感谢美里打断了她和真嗣之间的完美时刻。然而，她只是瞪着美里，额头上的青筋跳动，低声咕哝道：“美里……你来得真是时候。”

"The feeling's mutual," Misato said, a smirk on her face, "Did you guys just come to see me?"  
“彼此彼此，”美里脸上带着一丝得意的笑容，“你们是专程来看我的吗？”

"Maybe," Asuka said, "I just wanted to see Kaji."  
“也许，”明日香说，“我只是想见见加持。”

"I see. Well, that idiot's busy with something else," Misato said, "So if you'll excuse—wow!"  
“我明白了。好吧，那个笨蛋正忙着别的事，”美里说，“所以如果你不介意——哇！”

She stumbled onto the floor, dropping a clipboard which fell to Asuka's feet. She picked it up as Shinji helped Misato to her feet. She glanced the paper over, and, in a moment, felt the hairs stand up on the back of her neck. "Wait a second. What the hell?!"  
她绊了一下摔倒在地，手中的文件夹掉落在明日香脚边。她捡起文件夹，同时真嗣扶美里站起身。她匆匆扫了一眼文件，瞬间感到后颈的汗毛竖了起来。“等等，这到底是什么鬼？！”

"What is it?" Shinji asked after helping Misato to her feet.  
"这是什么？" 真嗣扶起美里后问道。

"It's nothing at all," Misato said, reaching out for the clipboard, only for Asuka to twirl out of the way.  
"没什么大不了的，" 美里说着伸手去拿文件夹，却被明日香一转身躲开了。

"This looks like something if you ask me," Asuka said.  
"依我看，这可不简单，" 明日香说道。

"But what is it?" Shinji asked.  
"但这是什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Does he know about this yet?" Asuka asked, skeptically.  
"他知道这件事吗？" 明日香怀疑地问。

"We haven't discussed it with us yet, but they plan on recruiting him," Misato admitted in defeat. "Look, it might not even happen. He'd need to consent and all."  
"我们还没跟他说过，但他们计划招募他，" 美里无奈地承认。"看，这甚至可能不会发生。他需要同意才行。

"What are you guys talking about?"  
"你们在聊什么呢？"

"The new pilot of Eva Unit-03!" Asuka said, handing Shinji the clipboard, "It's Toji."  
"Eva 三号机的新驾驶员！" 明日香递给真嗣一个夹板，"是东治。"

---
### Chapter 7

"So he's the new pilot?"  
"所以他是新来的飞行员？"

"Uh…yes…" "呃…是的…"

"And how long did you know?"  
"那你之前知道多久了？"

"Just found out five seconds ago."  
"刚刚五秒钟前才发现的。"

"And when were you planning on telling us, oh so intelligent one?"  
"哦，那么聪明的你打算什么时候告诉我们呢？"

"I was going to tell you eventually, don't worry about that."  
"我本来就打算迟早告诉你们的，别担心这个。"

"I'm sure you were." "我确信你是。"

"He's the new pilot?" "他是新来的飞行员？"

"Yes, he is." "是的，他是。"

Asuka wondered just how long she was going to take to tell them. She probably wouldn't have been so defensive with the info if she was planning on just telling them as soon as possible. Well, regardless, that just meant that there was another one of them to pilot the Evas. That meant more competition. Did the threat of another Shinji spur her on, or intimidate her?  
明日香在想，她到底还要多久才会告诉他们。如果她打算尽快说出来，可能就不会这么防御性了。不过，无论如何，这意味着又多了一个人来驾驶 EVA。这增加了竞争。是另一个真嗣的威胁激励了她，还是让她感到害怕？

"Well, why do they need a Unit 03 anyway?" Asuka asked.  
“嗯，他们为什么需要三号机呢？”明日香问道。

"The more Evas defending the city the better, they feel," Misato said.  
“他们觉得，保卫城市的 EVA 越多越好，”美里说。

"But why Toji?" Shinji asked, confused.  
"但为什么是冬二？" 真嗣困惑地问。

"Well, the truth is that every member of your class, Shinji, is an ideal candidate for piloting an Eva," Misato confessed.  
"嗯，事实是，真嗣，你们班上的每个成员都是驾驶 Eva 的理想人选，" 美里坦白道。

"Even Hikari?" "连光也是？"

"Even her, Asuka." "连她，明日香。"

"What about Kensuke?" Shinji asked.  
"那健介呢？" 真嗣问道。"

"Yes, although it might not be such a good idea to let him be a pilot," Misato said, considerately.  
"是的，不过让他当驾驶员可能不是个好主意，" 美里体贴地说道。"

"Yeah, you're right," Asuka said, "That idiot would probably think it was all a lot of fun."  
“是啊，你说得对，”明日香说，“那傻瓜大概会觉得这一切都很有趣。”

"But that's why Toji shouldn't pilot," Shinji said, softly, "He'd hate it! I'm sure he would!"  
“但正因为如此，真嗣才不应该驾驶，”真嗣轻声说，“他会讨厌的！我确信他会！”

Asuka glanced over at him. He was concerned over his friend's wellbeing? And he vocalized his concerns? The latter surprised Asuka. Never before had she heard Shinji actually make vocalize his concerns for others like that. Was he developing a backbone? Shinji with a backbone was a concept completely alien to Asuka. In fact, the very nature of it both aroused her interest and also disturbed her pleasantly.  
明日香瞥了他一眼。他在担心朋友的安危吗？而且他还表达了自己的担忧？后者让明日香感到惊讶。她从未听过真嗣像这样明确地表达对别人的关心。他是在变得有主见吗？真嗣变得有主见，对明日香来说是个完全陌生的概念。事实上，这种变化既引起了她的兴趣，也让她感到愉悦的困扰。

"Well, we'll see what happens."  
“好吧，我们拭目以待。”

And they did indeed see what happened. The next day, Toji was subdued as he walked in. Had Misato already interrogated him about piloting? Asuka didn't speak, but Shinji did approach him, a concerned expression on his face, and, to Asuka's utter disbelief, actually admitted he knew about him piloting Unit-03. Even more startling, he actually stated his concerns to him. To his face. Right then and there.  
他们确实看到了接下来发生的事。第二天，冬二走进来时显得有些消沉。美里已经审问过他关于驾驶的事了吗？明日香没有说话，但真嗣确实走向了他，脸上带着关切的表情，更让明日香难以置信的是，他竟然承认自己知道冬二驾驶了 03 号机。更令人震惊的是，他居然当面表达了自己的担忧。就在那时那地。

The shock Toji felt was nothing compared to Asuka's shock. Where had he grown a spine? How could he have grown a spine? This child, this boy, that idiot, that she had made fun of, humiliated, and even gone as far as to taunt and ridicule over his lack of a backbone, was now sporting a rather firm backbone, a rather strong one, a rather confident one. Where had this happened? Where was she when it was growing?  
冬二所感受到的震惊与明日香的震惊相比简直不值一提。他什么时候长出了脊梁骨？他怎么会长出脊梁骨？这个孩子，这个男孩，这个白痴，她曾经嘲笑过、羞辱过，甚至嘲讽和讥笑他缺乏骨气，现在却展现出了相当坚强的脊梁，相当坚定的脊梁，相当自信的脊梁。这一切是在哪里发生的？她当时又在哪里？

Those questions remained unanswered as Asuka approached the situation. She could hear Toji stammering, in disbelief, "How did you hear about that?"  
那些问题依旧悬而未决，随着明日香接近情况。她能听到真嗣结结巴巴，难以置信地说：“你怎么会知道那件事？”

"We ran into Misato. She spilt the beans," Asuka replied in Shinji's place.  
“我们碰到了美里。她全说了，”明日香替真嗣回答道。

"So you know too? That just figures," Toji mumbled, "Look, I don't want anything to do with those things. The only reason I agreed was because they said they'd try to treat my sister in their hospital."  
“所以你也知道了？真是意料之中，”真嗣嘟囔着，“听着，我不想和那些东西扯上关系。我唯一同意的原因是他们说会在他们的医院尝试治疗我妹妹。”

"Well, that's an upside," Asuka admitted.  
"嗯，这算是个优点吧，" 明日香承认道。

"Toji, it isn't too late to back down," Shinji said, "It really isn't pleasurable. It's actually a horrible experience to pilot."  
"剑介，现在退出还不晚，" 真嗣说，"真的不愉快。驾驶 EVA 实际上是一种可怕的经历。"

"A horrible experience?" Just what kinds of things was Shinji experiencing in Eva? She was reminded of him being sucked into the depths of those shadows. He hadn't mentioned anything about what happened in there yet. Maybe he had mentioned it to that Dr. Tamako, though. Maybe she knew about this.  
"可怕的经历？" 真嗣在 EVA 里到底经历了什么？她想起了他被那些阴影吞噬的情景。他还没提过在那里面发生了什么。也许他对那个田子博士提过，也许她知道这些。

And then it clicked in her mind. It was the shrink. That was the reason Shinji was growing a backbone. That was the secret! The shrink had developed one for him, raised it up from nothing. And that's where that doll Rei had developed a true personality, a vocal one, an understanding one.  
然后她恍然大悟。是那个心理医生。这就是真嗣开始变得有骨气的原因。这就是秘密！心理医生为他培养出了骨气，从无到有。而那个玩偶丽也由此发展出了真正的个性，一个能发声的，一个能理解的。

What had she grown? 她培养出了什么？

"Hey, Asuka. What're you guys talking about?"  
嘿，明日香。你们在聊什么呢？

Asuka jumped a little in the air, startled by her friend Hikari's voice. She was about to confess that Toji was now the pilot of Unit-03 when Toji gave her a look that locked the words up in her throat before they could reach Hikari's ears. Naturally, it made sense that Toji didn't want her to know. He wasn't proud of being a pilot. Why would he want the entire world to know his business?  
明日香被好友光的声音吓得微微跳起。她正要坦白说现在驾驶 03 号机的是真嗣，但真嗣一个眼神让她喉咙里的字句卡住了，没能传到光的耳朵里。自然，真嗣不想让她知道是有道理的。他并不以成为驾驶员为荣。他为什么要让全世界都知道他的事呢？

"It's nothing," Asuka replied.  
“没什么，”明日香回答道。

"Sure doesn't look like nothing," Hikari said, "I thought I heard you guys talking about Unit-03."  
“肯定不像没什么，”光说，“我以为我听到你们在谈论 03 号机。”

"No point hiding it now," Toji mumbled. Asuka had to comment that his will sure was weak if he was going to give up that easily. Hell, even Shinji would fare better. Well, maybe.  
"现在藏也没用了，" 冬二嘟囔着。明日香不得不评论说，如果他这么轻易就放弃，那他的意志力肯定很弱。见鬼，就连真嗣也会表现得更好。嗯，也许吧。

"Toji's the newly selected pilot of Unit-03," Shinji said, darkly.  
"冬二被选为新任三号机驾驶员，" 真嗣阴沉地说道。

"That's fantastic!" Hikari said, amazed, "Listen, we have to celebrate!"  
"那太棒了！" 光惊叹道，"听着，我们得庆祝一下！"

"Why?" Toji asked, "What's to celebrate about? All those damned machines do is just cause trouble and hurt people."  
"为什么？" 冬二问道，"有什么好庆祝的？那些该死的机器只会惹麻烦，伤害人。"

"Well, that's one way of looking at things," Hikari admitted, "But to think that you're actually protecting all those lives with that machine. You're like a hero to so many now, Toji. Just like Asuka and Shinji and Rei."  
"嗯，这是一种看待事情的方式，" 光子承认道，"但想想你其实是在用那台机器保护着所有人的生命。你现在对很多人来说就像个英雄，冬二。就像明日香、真嗣和绫波一样。"

"But it isn't so simple," Shinji said, "Some of the things we see in there are horrible. And I don't even know what the Evas even are."  
"但这并不简单，" 真嗣说，"我们在里面看到的一些东西很可怕。我甚至不知道 EVA 到底是什么。"

"Aren't they just huge machines?" Asuka aksed.  
"它们不就是些巨大的机器吗？" 明日香问道。

"I don't think so," Shinji said, "I think there's more to it than that. But I don't know what else there can be."  
"我不这么认为，" 真嗣说，"我觉得事情没那么简单。但我也不知道还有什么其他的可能。

"Well, it doesn't matter, right?" Toji mumbled, "All I need to know is that once Unit-03 reaches Japan, I'm piloting it."  
"嗯，这无所谓，对吧？" 东治嘟囔着，"我只需要知道一旦三号机抵达日本，我就要驾驶它。

"Well, I don't know about how little it matters," Shinji said, cautiously, "I just think that you should be careful. That's all."  
"嗯，我不确定它有多无关紧要，" 真嗣谨慎地说，"我只是觉得你应该小心点。仅此而已。"

"Okay, if you say so."  
"好吧，既然你这么说。"

Later that day, Kaji arrived at Misato's apartment to take Asuka to Dr. Tamako's. Asuka had lost the vigor she had felt around Kaji, and simply strode over to him, plopping herself down gently in the seat beside him. Kaji noticed the difference immediately.  
那天晚些时候，加持来到美里公寓接明日香去田子医生那里。明日香在加持身边已失去了往日的活力，只是默默地走到他旁边，轻轻地坐进座位。加持立刻注意到了这种变化。

"What's the mater? Unhappy?" Kaji asked.  
"怎么了？不开心吗？" 加持问道。

"Not that. Just…" "不是那样。只是……"

"You're in love, aren't you?" Kaji asked, smiling.  
"你恋爱了，对吧？" 加持笑着问。

Asuka grinned. "Is it that obvious?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“有这么明显吗？”

"Oh, I can see it in your eyes, clear as day. Let me guess. It's the Third Child, isn't it?"  
“哦，我一看你的眼睛就知道了，清清楚楚。让我猜猜，是第三适格者，对吧？”

Asuka grinned again. "That idiot?"  
明日香再次笑了。“那个傻瓜？”

"Why not? You both have an awful lot in common. Both pilots. Both young. Both rather magnificent children with much to offer."  
"为什么不呢？你们俩有很多共同点。都是飞行员。都年轻。都是相当出色的孩子，有很多可以奉献的。"

"Well, he's spineless, I'm beautiful. What does he have to offer that I don't already have?"  
"哼，他没骨气，我美丽动人。他能提供什么我还没有的？"

"Well, if I were to be bluntly obvious, he does have that Y chromosome you lack."  
"好吧，如果我要直白地说，他确实有你缺少的那个 Y 染色体。"

"Funny." "有趣。"

"I remember watching a movie years ago. It survived the Second Impact, as it were. An American movie. I believe it was called Moonstruck, or something to that effect."  
"我记得多年前看过一部电影。它可以说是挺过了第二次冲击。一部美国电影。我想它叫《月色撩人》，或者类似的名字。"

"What's your point?" "你想说什么？"

"One of the characters mentions how men seek women out because, in the beginning, Adam's rib was removed to create Eve. Perhaps man is simply seeking woman to complete himself, as woman is seeking to return to Adam."  
"其中一个角色提到，男人追求女人是因为起初亚当的肋骨被取走创造了夏娃。或许男人只是在寻找女人以完善自己，而女人则在寻求回归亚当。"

"So are you saying I'm a rib?"  
"所以你是说我是一根肋骨？"

"Not exactly," Kaji said, "What I mean is that you are the rib that Shinji so desperately seeks."  
"不完全是，" 加持说，"我的意思是，你是真嗣如此迫切寻找的那根肋骨。"

"Maybe more like an entire backbone."  
"或许更像是一整副脊梁骨。"

"Perhaps, but perhaps not," Kaji said, smiling thinly, "You never know when it comes to true love."  
"或许吧，但也未必，" 凯吉淡淡一笑，"真爱这东西，你永远猜不透。"

"True love?" "真爱？"

"Yes, true love. Frightening concept. Love for the remainder of your days. You never know when you'll come across it. You may even be in denial that such a thing even exists, and yet it is undeniable that, once you fall in true love, you can never escape it. No matter how much you ignore it, the feelings will only consume you. Consume you until you allow love to merge the two of you into one being."  
"是的，真爱。一个令人畏惧的概念。一生的爱。你永远不知道它何时会降临。你甚至可能否认这种东西的存在，但不可否认的是，一旦你陷入真爱，就永远无法逃脱。无论你多么忽视它，这些感觉只会吞噬你。直到你允许爱将你们两人融合为一个存在。"

And so the trip went on until, finally, Asuka arrived at the psychologist's office. At once, she went to Dr. Tamako's office, plopping herself down on the recliner as Dr. Tamako replied, a smile on her face, anxiously wriggling her fingers, "So?"  
于是，旅行继续进行，直到最终，明日香到达了心理医生的办公室。她立刻走进田子医生的办公室，一屁股坐在躺椅上，田子医生带着微笑，紧张地扭动着手指，问道：“那么？”

"What?" "什么？"

"Remember last session?" "还记得上次会面吗？"

"It was only a few days ago."  
"那只是几天前的事。"

"But do you remember your assignment?"  
"但你还记得你的任务吗？"

"About seeing how people treated me?" Asuka had almost forgotten about that. If anything, it had been wiped from her mind after the entire Toji affair, as it came to be known.  
"关于观察人们如何对待我？" 明日香几乎忘记了这件事。如果说有什么的话，那件事在所谓的“与真嗣的事件”之后就已经从她的记忆中抹去了。

"Yes. Any difference?" “是的。有什么不同吗？”

"Well…" Asuka remembered Hikari's face, remembered how everything had been normal. Even Misato hadn't changed. Kaji still treated her the same. The only thing that changed was Shinji, and he was growing up, becoming a man, right in front of Asuka's eyes. Nothing had grown for the worse, only changed for the better. So, with a smile, Asuka confessed, "Nothing's gotten worse. If anything, for the first time in a long time, I'm actually…happy…"  
“嗯……” 明日香想起了光的脸，记得一切曾经都是正常的。甚至连美里都没有改变。加持对待她的方式依旧。唯一改变的是真嗣，他正在成长，就在明日香的眼前成为一个男人。没有什么变得更糟，只是变得更好了。于是，带着微笑，明日香坦白道，“没有什么变得更糟。如果说有什么不同的话，这是我很久以来第一次……真的……感到快乐……”

Dr. Tamako smiled, "I'm glad to hear that, Asuka."  
田子博士微笑着说，“听到你这么说，我很高兴，明日香。”

"I couldn't believe it at first. I mean, I had thought that winning was everything. And I still want to win. That hasn't changed. I just feel more optimistic about it. Just all around…happier. I don't know how exactly to describe it. Everything is just better for me."  
"起初我简直不敢相信。我是说，我一直以为赢就是一切。我仍然想赢。这一点没变。我只是对此感到更加乐观。整个人都…更快乐了。我不知道具体该怎么形容。对我来说一切都变得更好了。"

"What about your lover?" "那你的爱人呢？"

"Are you talking about Shinji?"  
"你是在说真嗣吗？"

"So he isn't 'the idiot' now? Seems like things are improving."  
"所以现在他不再是‘那个白痴’了？看来情况有所改善。"

"Well, let's not jump the gun here. He's still an idiot. That isn't different. But he's changed. He's grown up more."  
"好吧，我们别急于下结论。他还是个白痴，这一点没变。但他变了，成熟了不少。"

"So have you." "你也一样。"

"How so?" “怎么变了？”

"Well, believe me when I say that you've been changing since I met you. They are still many things that can improve. They are things that are causing you pain deep inside that I'm sure you've locked away from me. Hopefully in time we can change that."  
"好吧，相信我，自从我遇见你以来，你一直在改变。还有很多可以改进的地方。那些深藏在你内心、你肯定对我隐瞒的痛苦之事。希望随着时间的推移，我们能改变这一点。"

The image of a doll hanging from the rafters of the ceiling emerged for a brief second in Asuka's mind before dissolving away. The image was faint now, and the effects minimal.  
一个玩偶悬挂在天花板横梁上的影像在明日香脑海中短暂闪现，随即消散。现在这个影像已经模糊，影响也微乎其微。

"Still, you've grown into a woman. I'm happy for you."  
"尽管如此，你已经成长为一个女人。我为你感到高兴。"

Asuka smiled. 明日香微笑了。

Afterwards, the next day, to be exact, Asuka noticed that Toji was nowhere to be seen. She knew where he was, of course. Testing Unit-03. Misato was gone too that day. Kensuke, still in the dark, joked about where Kaji could have been. But Hikari approached Asuka, and asked, gently, "You know where he is, right? Toji, I mean."  
确切地说，第二天，明日香注意到找不到真嗣的身影。她当然知道他在哪里。正在测试三号机。那天美里也不在。剑介还蒙在鼓里，开玩笑说加持可能去了哪里。但光子走向明日香，轻声问道：“你知道他在哪儿，对吧？我是说真嗣。”

"Yeah. Synching with Unit-03 for the first time," Asuka said, "He should be fine."  
“嗯。第一次与三号机同步，”明日香说，“他应该没事的。”

"I hope so." "希望如此。"

The day proceeded slowly, but the slow procession was interrupted by the sounds of a siren. Asuka leapt to her feet, in shock. Shinji rose to his feet as well, along with Rei. The three of them exchanged looks. They knew what the sign meant.  
日子缓缓推进，但缓慢的进程被警笛声打断。明日香惊跳起身，震惊不已。真嗣也站了起来，绫波零跟着起身。三人互相对视，他们知道这意味着什么。

An angel attack was imminant.  
天使的攻击即将来临。


---
### Chapter 8

"There has been an accident."  
“发生了一起事故。”

Asuka stared back at Commander Ikari with an eyebrow raised, in confusion. The enigmatic bespectacled commander had summoned them all at once for an angel attack, only to inform them that there was an accident? What kind of accident? Who or what was involved? Was there actually an angel or did he just ring the bell to inform them there was an accident? Knowing how much of an asshole this guy was, she wouldn't put it past him to do something like that.  
明日香皱着眉头，困惑地盯着碇司令。这位戴着眼镜、神秘莫测的指挥官突然召集他们所有人，声称有使徒袭击，结果只是告诉他们发生了一起事故？什么类型的事故？涉及谁或什么？是真的有使徒还是他只是敲响警钟通知他们有事故？考虑到这家伙有多混蛋，她毫不怀疑他可能会做出这种事。

"What kind of accident?" Shinji asked.  
“什么类型的事故？”真嗣问道。

"During the synchronization process with Unit-03, the newest angel appeared and caused a massive explosion. We do not know the damage yet, but we know that the majority of the people there are now dead."  
“在同步过程中，与三号机接触时，最新的使徒出现了并引发了大爆炸。我们还不清楚具体的损害情况，但知道那里的大部分人现在已经死亡。”

Asuka's heart stopped for a moment. Although she didn't care about the majority of the people there, she did know one thing: both Toji and Misato had been there. Toji, piloting Unit-03. Misato, standing unprotected and vulnerable. Surely Unit-03 would survive with his AT Field and armor, but Misato had no protection. She was toasted. Doomed! She wouldn't have a place to live, sure, but even worse was that she had grown attached to Misato over the years. She could feel the loss in her heart.  
明日香的心跳停了一拍。尽管她并不在意在场的大多数人，但她确实知道一件事：真嗣和美里都在那里。真嗣，驾驶着三号机。美里，毫无防护地站立，脆弱不堪。三号机肯定能凭借 AT 力场和装甲幸存下来，但美里没有任何保护。她被烤焦了。注定完蛋！她当然会失去住所，但更糟糕的是，这些年来她已经对美里产生了深厚的感情。她能感受到心中的失落。

Shinji's expression was mortified, as expected. Asuka's would have been too, but there was that small voice in her head that told her that there was a chance that Misato survived the explosion. That powerful voice convinced her to remain calm and patient.  
真嗣的表情惊恐万分，正如所料。明日香本也会如此，但她的脑海中有个微小的声音告诉她，美里有可能在爆炸中幸存。那个有力的声音说服她保持冷静和耐心。

"Now, get into battle positions," Commander Ikari said, walking away, "As Misato is not present, I will be in command of this operation. Any objections?"  
“现在，进入战斗位置，”碇司令说着，走开了，“由于美里不在场，我将指挥这次行动。有异议吗？”

No one replied. 无人应答。

Asuka boarded the Eva, and, before long, was out on the surface, rushing to a point just outside the city. And there they waited, staring at the setting sun. For a moment or two, there was nothing. Asuka wondered what this Angel looked like. Was it strange and chilling like that last Angel? Would they have to suffer as a result of it, like having Shinji separated from time and space once again? Or was this ordinary, and would be dispatched with ease?  
明日香登上 Eva，不久便冲出地表，疾驰至城外某处。他们就在那里等待着，凝视着夕阳西下。有那么一瞬间，四周一片寂静。明日香好奇这个使徒会是什么模样。它会不会像上一个那样诡异而令人心寒？他们是否又要因此遭受苦难，比如真嗣再次被时空分离？还是说这只是一个普通的使徒，能轻易被击败？

And then the silhouette against the setting sun emerged. At first, Asuka could scarcely see it. The brilliance of the sun prevented them from being able to take in its slender frame. However, as it approached, its calculated manor haunting and chilling, Asuka recognized it not as an Angel, but as an Evangelion.  
随后，夕阳下的轮廓逐渐显现。起初，明日香几乎看不清它。太阳的耀眼光芒让他们无法看清其纤细的身躯。然而，随着它逐渐靠近，那计算精准的举止既令人不安又寒意袭人，明日香意识到它并非使徒，而是一台 Eva。

Did Toji kill the Angel? Was he coming back in triumph? Was he just so weak he couldn't move fast? Was that all? Asuka smiled in triumph. So they weren't even needed. That's good. And at least Toji was safe now, right?  
东治杀死了使徒吗？他是凯旋而归吗？还是他太虚弱了，以至于无法快速移动？就这些吗？明日香得意地笑了。看来他们根本就不被需要。这样也好。至少东治现在安全了，对吧？

"That is your target." “那就是你的目标。”

"Wait, come again?" Asuka replied.  
“等等，再说一遍？”明日香回应道。

"But that's Unit-03, right?" Shinji asked.  
"但那是 03 号机，对吧？" 真嗣问道。

"Consider it the Thirteenth Angel," Commander Ikari said, "Your orders are to destroy it."  
"将其视为第十三使徒，" 碇司令说道，"你的命令是摧毁它。"

"But Toji's in there!" Shinji stammered.  
"但里面有东治！" 真嗣结巴道。

"Irrelevant." "无关紧要。"

Asuka wanted to bash that idiot's head in right now. That condescending bastard! Well, killing Toji wasn't an option. If Toji died, then Hikari would be sad. It was that simple. Sure, Hikari would be a little bit more than simply sad, but the concept remained just the same. What she needed to do was simply remove that plug from Unit-03's back. That was all. She just needed the right—  
明日香现在真想把那个白痴的脑袋砸开。那个自以为是的混蛋！不过，杀死真嗣可不是个选项。如果真嗣死了，光会伤心的。就这么简单。当然，光会远不止是简单地伤心，但概念上还是一样的。她需要做的只是把那个插头从零三号机背后拔掉。仅此而已。她只需要找到合适的——

"Unit-00 is down!" "零号机倒下了！"

Asuka's attention jerked into focus. Unit-00? Rei? Was she beaten already by Unit-03? By Toji? The Angel had to be in control of his unit. That had to be it. She prepared herself for combat, ready for Toji's Eva to attack. She couldn't allow Shinji to engage the target. If he did, he would be devastated. And that was something she would not, could not allow. And besides, how could he possibly hurt his best friend?  
明日香的注意力猛地集中起来。零号机？绫波？她已经被三号机打败了吗？被真嗣打败了？天使一定控制了他的机体。一定是这样。她准备投入战斗，准备迎击真嗣的 Eva。她不能让真嗣与目标交战。如果他这么做，他会崩溃的。而这是她绝不允许，也无法允许的。而且，他怎么可能伤害他最好的朋友呢？

"I'll handle this, Shinji," Asuka snarled, rushing headlong at Unit-03 with a firearm in hand. Bullets exploded at Unit-03, slamming against its steel hide. He staggered backward, the bullets ramming up against his front. If Asuka knew anything, it was that, despite hurting, the bullets wouldn't kill Toji so much as devastate the Eva. However, as the bullets slammed against the hide, a massive barrier materialized itself between her and Unit-03. An AT Field!  
“我来处理这个，真嗣，”明日香咆哮着，手持枪械向三号机冲去。子弹在三号机上爆炸，撞击着它的钢铁外壳。它踉跄后退，子弹猛烈地击打在前方。如果明日香知道什么，那就是尽管会受伤，子弹不会杀死真嗣，而是会摧毁 Eva。然而，当子弹撞击外壳时，一个巨大的屏障在她和三号机之间显现出来。AT 力场！

The bullets bounced harmlessly off of the shield. The gun was useless. She tossed it aside, and withdrew her formidable blade. She slashed at the AT Field, only for it to embed itself inside the field. She had to concentrate her AT Field into the barrier, to rip it and corrode it. Before she could do anything other than struggle, the fiend's claws clasped at her Unit-02's throat, squeezing the air out from her windpipe.  
子弹在护盾上无害地弹开。枪已经没用了。她将其扔到一旁，拔出了她那可怕的刀刃。她向 AT 力场挥砍，刀却嵌入了其中。她必须将 AT 力场集中到屏障上，撕裂并腐蚀它。在她只能挣扎的时候，那恶魔的爪子紧紧抓住了她的 02 号机喉咙，挤压着她的气管，让她无法呼吸。

She struggled against it, trying to convince herself that the pain wasn't real. And yet it hurt so terribly. She could no longer draw breath, but she couldn't give up. If Shinji fought Toji himself, he would lose his mind! Surely something horrible would happen! And so she could not, would not allow that to happen!  
她挣扎着，试图说服自己疼痛不是真的。然而疼痛却是如此剧烈。她再也无法呼吸，但她不能放弃。如果真嗣亲自与东治战斗，他会崩溃的！肯定会发生可怕的事情！所以她不能，也不会允许那种事情发生！

She stabbed straight through the AT Field, and straight through Unit-03's skull! She felt the hands slacken against her throat, at which she shook them off, and withdrew the knife as harshly as possible. Unit-03 remained motionless and still. Asuka gasped in and out for air for a moment before she slammed her elbow into the back of Unit-03's skull, and knocked it to the floor!  
她直接刺穿了 AT 力场，直刺入 03 号机的头颅！她感觉到掐住她喉咙的手松开了，于是她甩开它们，尽可能粗暴地拔出刀。03 号机一动不动地静止着。明日香喘息着呼吸了一会儿，然后猛地用肘部撞击 03 号机的后脑勺，将其击倒在地！

"Asuka! What are you doing!?" Shinji shrieked.  
"明日香！你在干什么！？" 真嗣尖叫道。

Asuka's stomach was in a knot. He was so terrified of what she was doing. She didn't look at his image on her screen as she replied, "Trying to settle this as quickly and painlessly as possible."  
明日香的胃里像打了结一样。他对她正在做的事情感到极度恐惧。她没有看屏幕上他的影像，只是回答道："试图尽可能快速且无痛地解决这件事。"

"But you'll kill him!" "但你会杀了他的！"

"No I—WOW!!" "不，我——哇！！"

Asuka tumbled to the ground as she saw Unit-03's claws clasped around her Unit-02's ankle! She should have known it wasn't going to be that easy! She reached for her gun, which was in close proximity, and aimed straight at Unit-03's skull! With rapid fire, she blasted against his head. His AT Field held for a moment or two before shattering to pieces, allowing the bullets to pierce straight through it. The arm slackened, at which she began to fire bullets into that too. After several rounds, she tore against the arm, only to wrench it out of its socket. Blood exploded from the torn socket, or at least a substance that resembled blood, like LCL.  
明日香看到三号机的爪子紧紧抓住了她的二号机脚踝，摔倒在地！她早该知道不会那么容易的！她伸手去拿近在咫尺的枪，直接瞄准了三号机的头颅！她迅速开火，子弹击中他的头部。他的 AT 力场支撑了一会儿就破碎了，让子弹直接穿透。手臂松弛下来，她开始向那里射击。经过几轮射击，她撕裂了那条手臂，将其从关节中扯出。从撕裂的关节中喷出血液，或者说是一种类似血液的 LCL 液体。

"Asuka! Stop it! Please, stop it!"  
"明日香！停下来！求你了，停下来！"

"Don't worry! It's over!" Asuka snarled, grabbing the Entryplug that was sticking out of Unit-03's back. With one sharp movement, she ripped it out of the Eva's back. The fungus-like substance that had connected the Entryplug to the rest of the Eva snapped, as did the majority of the fungus on Unit-03. Was the Angel alive only within the integration of Unit-03 and Toji? Perhaps. Then that would mean that, by separating the connection, the Thirteenth Angel had been disposed. Unit-03 was still salvageable.  
"别担心！已经结束了！" 明日香咆哮着，抓住插在零三号机背上的插入栓。她猛地一扯，将它从 Eva 的背部拔出。连接插入栓与 Eva 其余部分的真菌状物质断裂了，零三号机上的大部分真菌也随之断裂。天使是否仅在零三号机与东治的融合中存活？或许。那么这意味着，通过切断连接，第十三使徒已被消灭。零三号机仍可修复。

Asuka placed the Entryplug on the ground, gently, as she said gently into the monitor, "I've salvaged the pilot. The Thirteenth Angel is dead."  
明日香将插入栓轻轻放在地上，温柔地对着监视器说："我救出了驾驶员。第十三使徒已死。"

"Good work, Asuka." "干得好，明日香。"

She felt pride fill up in her heart. She had done it. She had actually done something heroic. Something special. Something important that even Shinji would congratulate her for. As Shinji's face appeared on her monitor, she grinned happily as she said, "So, what do you think?"  
她感到自豪在心中涌起。她做到了。她真的做了一些英勇的事。一些特别的。一些重要的，甚至连真嗣都会为她祝贺的事。当真嗣的脸出现在她的屏幕上时，她开心地笑着问道：“那么，你觉得怎么样？”

"Is Toji alive?" “东治还活着吗？”

"Yeah, of course he is," Asuka grinned, "What did you expect?"  
“当然活着，”明日香笑着说，“你以为呢？”

"I was so worried he'd be killed or something like that," Shinji stammered.  
"我真的很担心他会死掉或者发生类似的事情，" 真嗣结结巴巴地说。

"Don't be!" Asuka laughed, "He's perfectly fine!"  
"别担心！" 明日香笑着说，"他完全没事！"

Planes were flying overhead as Shinji said, gently, "Thank you."  
飞机在头顶飞过，真嗣轻声说道："谢谢你。"

The planes landed in close proximity to the Entryplug. They walked over to the doors, and twisted the emergency latch. Asuka watched from her high perspective as the door was twisted open, and the technicians walked into the LCL filled tube. She watched as they slowly pulled an unconscious Toji from the plug. He must have been unconscious after she blew his skull up. Thankfully, his body was unscathed.  
飞机紧挨着插入栓降落。他们走到门前，扭动了紧急拉手。明日香从高处俯视着门被扭开，技术人员走进了充满 LCL 的管道。她看着他们缓慢地将昏迷的冬二从插入栓中拉出。他一定是在她击碎他的头骨后昏迷了。幸运的是，他的身体并未受伤。

"He's out like a light," one of the technicians said in a message that was sent across to all the other Evas, and probably Commander Ikari as well, "But he looks alright."  
“他完全昏过去了，”一名技术人员在发给所有其他 EVA 以及可能还有碇司令的消息中说，“但他看起来没事。”

"Agreeable," Commander Ikari replied, coldly, "And Unit-03? Is it salvageable?"  
“同意，”碇司令冷冷地回复，“那三号机呢？还能修复吗？”

"The damage is repairable," another technician said, "It'll take a day or two, but we've seen worse."  
"损坏可以修复，" 另一位技术员说道，"需要一两天时间，但我们见过更糟的情况。"

"Perfect. Commence the recovery of both Unit-03 and Unit-00. How is Rei?"  
"很好。开始回收三号机和零号机。绫波情况如何？"

"She's perfectly fine." "她完全没事。"

"Excellent." "太好了。"

Hey, what about Asuka? What about her great triumph? Didn't they care that she had saved both Unit-03 and Toji? Ah well. Commander Ikari was an asshole and everyone knew it. That wasn't a problem.  
“嘿，那明日香呢？她的伟大胜利呢？难道他们不关心她救了零三号机和真嗣吗？唉，算了。碇司令是个混蛋，这是人尽皆知的事。这倒不是问题。”

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

Asuka recognized that voice. She jumped against the screen of her Eva's vision as she stammered, "Misato?"  
明日香听出了那个声音。她急忙扑向 Eva 的视野屏幕，结结巴巴地说：“美里？”

"Misato?!" Shinji stammered, "You're alive?!"  
"美里？！"" 真嗣结巴道，""你还活着？！"

"Yeah, me and Ritsuko. Is Toji alright?" Misato's voice asked.  
“嗯，我和律子。东治还好吗？”美里的声音问道。

"Yeah, he's alive," Shinji said, gratefully.  
“是啊，他还活着。”真嗣说道，感激万分。

"Who stopped him?" “谁阻止了他？”

"I did!" Asuka said, proudly, hoping Misato would congratulate her.  
“我做到了！”明日香自豪地说，希望美里会表扬她。

"Great job, Asuka!" Misato said, happily.  
“干得漂亮，明日香！”美里开心地说。

"Thanks! I think it is a great job," Asuka said, confidently.  
“谢谢！我觉得做得很好。”明日香自信地说。

"Don't let it go to your head," Shinji replied.  
“别得意忘形了，”真嗣回答道。

"Will you shut up, you stupid idiot!?"  
"你能闭嘴吗，你这个蠢货！？"

Still, she couldn't help but smile as she returned to base to depart from her Eva. She had saved Toji. Although she really didn't care all too much about that idiot Toji, the fact that she had saved him sent a surge of joy through her heart. Now Hikari would be happy. She couldn't imagine what would have happened if someone like Shinji had handled it. He would have frozen up, been unable to crush Unit-03. He probably would have been killed. Surely that would have been the case.  
尽管如此，当她回到基地离开 Eva 时，还是忍不住笑了。她救了真治。虽然她对那个笨蛋真治并不怎么在意，但救了他的事实让她的心中涌起一阵喜悦。现在光会高兴的。她无法想象如果是像真嗣这样的人来处理会怎么样。他可能会僵住，无法摧毁 03 号机。他大概会被杀掉。肯定是这样。

Unless some horrible miracle had happened, like Unit-01 going insane again.  
除非发生了某种可怕的奇迹，比如 01 号机再次发狂。

She had to make a phone call before anything else. Withdrawing a cell phone, she dialed Hikari's number. After all, she deserved to know everything. Hikari answered, quickly. "Hello, Asuka?"  
她得先打个电话。拿出手机，她拨通了光的手机号。毕竟，她有权知道一切。光很快接了电话。"喂，明日香？"

"Yeah, hey!" “嗯，嗨！”

"What's going on? Are you okay?"  
“发生什么事了？你还好吗？”

"I'm fine. Listen, there was an accident preparing Unit-03."  
"我没事。听着，在准备 03 号机时发生了意外。"

"Oh my God! Is Toji alright?"  
"哦天哪！东治还好吗？"

"He's fine. You see, his Unit-03 was possessed by this Angel, and we had to stop it. Don't worry. I took it down and saved Toji."  
"他没事。你看，他的 03 号机被这个使徒附身了，我们不得不阻止它。别担心。我把它击倒了，救了东治。"

"You did? Thank God." "你真的做到了？感谢上帝。"

"Tell me about it. So Toji will probably be sent to our hospital. I'll arrange it so you can visit him."  
"说来话长。所以，冬二可能会被送到我们医院。我会安排好，让你能去探望他。"

"What?" "什么？"

"He's unconscious now, but how would you like to be the first thing he sees when he wakes up?"  
"他现在昏迷不醒，但你想不想成为他醒来时看到的第一个人？"

Hook, line, and sinker. That romantic concept was enough to convince Hikari to sprint to the NERV hospital, to which Asuka gave her directions. Hikari remained at Toji's bedside until he woke up five hours later.  
钩、线、坠，这一浪漫的概念足以让光子飞奔至 NERV 医院，阿斯卡给了她指引。光子一直守在真嗣的床边，直到他五小时后醒来。

Asuka, however, was not present for that moment.  
然而，阿斯卡并未在场见证那一刻。

Rather, she was with Shinji, waiting by Rei's bedside. She had been severally hurt by Unit-03, but should recover. Asuka waited patiently for Rei to awaken, yes, but also was here to see Shinji. He had remained uninvolved in this battle. He was extremely grateful to Asuka for saving Toji, as he had made it clear as they had waited there. Asuka teased him how it was nothing and that now Shinji owed him for saving his friend.  
相反，她和真嗣一起守在丽床边。丽在三号机事件中受了重伤，但应该会康复。阿斯卡耐心等待丽醒来，是的，同时也是为了见真嗣。他在这场战斗中一直置身事外。他对阿斯卡救了真嗣深表感激，这一点在他们等待时已经明确表达。阿斯卡调侃他说这没什么，现在真嗣欠她一个人情，因为她救了他的朋友。

"So, now that I've saved Toji, I want you to do something for me," Asuka said, smirking.  
"所以，既然我救了冬二，我想让你帮我个忙，" 明日香说着，嘴角上扬。

"Uh, okay. Sure. What?" Shinji asked, curiously.  
"呃，好的。当然。什么忙？" 真嗣好奇地问。

Asuka grinned, "Are you sure you can do this?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑，"你确定你能做到吗？"

"I think so. Just tell me what it is."  
"我想是的。告诉我是什么就行了。"

"And you better not screw up again."  
"你最好别再搞砸了。"

"Wait, again?" "等等，又搞砸了？"

Asuka gestured for him to draw closer. Shinji inched forward slowly, a little worried and cautious. As he drew closer, Asuka could hear his breathing, his anxious gasps for air. She noticed that her breathing was similar, although rather than nervous anxiety, she was invigorated by desire, by a strong, anxious need. And, once Shinji was an inch away, realization dawned upon him.  
明日香示意他靠近些。真嗣缓缓向前挪动，带着些许担忧和谨慎。当他靠近时，明日香能听到他的呼吸声，那急促不安的喘息。她注意到自己的呼吸也相似，尽管她感受到的不是紧张焦虑，而是被欲望激发，被一种强烈而急切的需求所驱使。而当真嗣近在咫尺时，他恍然大悟。

"Wait, you want to kiss me again?"  
“等等，你是想再吻我一次吗？”

Asuka nodded. 明日香点了点头。

"You aren't going to hold my nose closed again, are you?"  
"你不会又要把我鼻子捏住吧？"

"Not at all," Asuka said, moving her body closer to Shinji's seat so that it would be easier for him to hold her, "But I'm just curious if the second kiss will be as lousy as that first time."  
"一点也不会，"" 明日香说着，将身体挪近真嗣的座位，以便他更容易抱住她，""我只是好奇，第二次接吻会不会还像第一次那样糟糕。"

"What? It wouldn't have been lousy if you hadn't kept my nose shut!"  
"什么？如果不是你一直捏着我的鼻子，才不会糟糕呢！"

"Oh! The perfect excuse!" laughed Asuka, "For one, you didn't hold me. For two, you didn't go all into it. I mean, seriously!"  
"哦！完美的借口！" 明日香笑着说，"首先，你没抱紧我。其次，你根本没全力以赴。我是说，认真点好吗！"

"I couldn't breathe!" "我差点喘不过气来！"

"Well, here's a second chance."  
“好吧，这是第二次机会了。”

"But Rei's right here." "但丽就在这儿。"

"Oh, she won't care. Besides, she's unconscious. She won't even know."  
“哦，她不会介意的。再说，她昏迷了。她根本不会知道。”

"But…" "但是…"

"Are you afraid?" “你害怕吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

"Are you still scared?" "你还害怕吗？"

"No, I'm not." "不，我不怕了。"

"Then prove it." "那就证明一下。"

And he did just that.  
而他确实就这么做了。

### Chapter 9

"For the last time! We are not dating!"  
"最后一次！我们没有在交往！"

"I'm sure you aren't, Asuka," Misato laughed at the two teenagers as scarlet filled their youthful faces, "You totally weren't just staring mesmorized into each others eyes, just like you weren't kissing over Rei's body yesterday!"  
"我当然知道你们没有，明日香，"美里笑着对两个青少年说，他们的脸颊因羞涩而泛红，"你们绝对没有刚刚那样深情对视，就像昨天你们没有在丽身上接吻一样！"

"It wasn't like that," stammered Shinji, defensively.  
"不是那样的，"真嗣辩解道，结结巴巴。

"Okay, whatever. If it's some big secret, you know what? That's fine! Fine! But let's not lie. I won't tell anyone! I promise!"  
"好吧，随便。如果是某种大秘密，你知道吗？没关系！真的没关系！但我们不要撒谎。我不会告诉任何人的！我保证！"

"We aren't dating!" Asuka snarled.  
"我们没有在交往！" 明日香咆哮道。"

"It wasn't a kiss," Shinji replied, embarrassed, "Just ask Rei."  
"那不是接吻，" 真嗣尴尬地回答，"去问丽吧。"

"Rei was unconscious," Misato laughed, "She just came to this morning. And you were kissing last night. We have security cameras. We saw it happen."  
"丽当时昏迷了，"美里笑着说，"她今早才醒过来。而你们昨晚在接吻。我们有监控摄像头。我们都看到了。"

"What!? Didn't you NERV people ever hear of privacy?!" Asuka stammered.  
"什么！？你们 NERV 的人难道没听说过隐私吗？！"明日香结巴地说。

"Can't say we have. Sorry," Misato laughed.  
"这还真不好说。抱歉，"美里笑着回答。

"I hate you with a passion," Asuka stammered, "Just tell me how many other morons saw this recording?"  
"我恨你恨得要死，" 明日香结巴地说，"就告诉我还有多少白痴看过这个录像？"

"Oh, just me, Maya and the rest of her crew, Ritsuko, Commander Fuyutski, Commander Ikari, oh, and Kaji too."  
"哦，就我、玛雅和她那帮人，律子，副司令冬月，司令碇，哦，还有加持。"

"What?! My father!?" Shinji stammered.  
"什么？！我父亲？！" 真嗣结巴道。

"What?! My Kaji!?" Asuka stammered.  
"什么？！我的加持？！" 明日香结巴道。

"Yes," Misato said, "And you're being awfully greedy, Asuka. I mean, both Shinji and Kaji? Pick one."  
“是的，”美里说，“而你真是太贪心了，明日香。我是说，真嗣和加持都想要？选一个吧。”

"Oh fine! Take Kaji." "哦好吧！带上加持。"

"So you'll take Shinji?" "那你愿意带上真嗣？"

"We aren't dating! You understand? Swear them all to secrecy!" Asuka stammered.  
"我们没在交往！你明白吗？让他们都保密！" 明日香结巴地说道。

"My father knows?" Shinji stammered, his voice faint.  
"我父亲知道？" 真嗣结巴着，声音微弱。

"Oh, he won't give a crap!" Asuka snarled.  
"哦，他才不在乎呢！" 明日香咆哮道。

"Don't worry," Misato said, "If anything, Commander Ikari actually encouraged your relationship."  
"别担心，" 美里说，"如果有谁支持，那就是碇司令实际上鼓励你们的关系。"

"He…He did?" Shinji asked, an expression of confusion on his face.  
"他…他真的这么做了？" 真嗣问道，脸上露出困惑的表情。

"Yeah," Misato replied, nodding, "He seemed to be proud that his son had found a girlfriend."  
"是的，" 美里点头回答，"他似乎为儿子找到了女朋友而感到自豪。

That didn't sound like the cipher that Asuka had the privilege of not knowing. The Commander had always appeared to be a distant, indifferent figure. Almost a sociopath. Except when it came to his precious Rei and precious Unit-01. After all, the way he treated them they might as well have been his wife or something ridiculous and bizarre like that.  
这听起来不像是不幸的明日香所不知道的那个谜一样的人物。司令官总给人一种遥远、冷漠的形象。几乎像个反社会者。除了对他珍爱的零和珍贵的零一单位。毕竟，他对他们的态度简直就像他们是他的妻子或类似荒谬怪异的东西。

"So my father actually approves of this?" Shinji asked, still in shock.  
"这么说，我父亲真的同意这件事？" 真嗣问道，仍然处于震惊之中。

"Your father is still human," Misato replied.  
"你父亲还是个人类，" 美里回答道。

"Really? I thought he was a robot or something crazy like that," Asuka replied, bluntly.  
"真的吗？我还以为他是个机器人或者类似那种疯狂的东西，" 明日香直截了当地回答。

"So my father actually approved of it?"  
"这么说，我父亲真的同意了？"

"How many times do you have to repeat that?" Asuka asked, "Yes, he approves. Why is that such a big shock?"  
"你还要重复多少遍？" 明日香问道，"是的，他同意了。这有什么好震惊的？"

"Well, my father has rarely shown me any attention," Shinji replied, "It's almost as though he doesn't want me or something."  
"嗯，我父亲很少关注我，" 真嗣回答，"就好像他根本不想要我似的。"

Instantly, Asuka's mind returned to a single event. A single room. There she was, a little girl, abandoned by her mother as she stared into her maddening petting of a little doll, a lifeless doll, as she asked it if she saw the strange girl staring back at her from the window. Asuka. The strange girl.  
刹那间，明日香的心思回到了一个特定的场景。一个特定的房间。在那里，她还是个小女孩，被母亲抛弃，凝视着母亲疯狂地抚摸着一个小玩偶，一个没有生命的玩偶，她问它是否看到了那个从窗户里回望她的陌生女孩。明日香。那个陌生女孩。

And then the image of a noose occupied by a doll beside the limp and dead figure of her mother flashed for a moment in her brain. And the next second, the vision had dissolved back into reality. She hadn't had an episode like that for awhile now. She had forgotten just how horrible those experiences were. She ran a hand through her hair, brushing the sweat from her brow. She rarely reacted this terribly from the images before. Had she become unaccustomed to them as of late?  
紧接着，一个玩偶悬挂在绳索上，旁边是她母亲软弱无力的尸体，这一画面在她脑海中闪现了一瞬。下一秒，幻象便消散回现实。她已经有一段时间没有这样的发作了。她几乎忘记了那些经历有多可怕。她用手梳理着头发，拂去额头的汗水。她很少像这样被这些画面吓到。难道她最近变得不习惯这些了吗？

"What's wrong, Asuka?" Shinji asked.  
“怎么了，明日香？”真嗣问道。

"Oh, nothing," Asuka replied, "Just thinking of something."  
"哦，没什么，" 明日香回答，"只是在想些事情。"

Misato glanced at her, a concerned expression on her face. "Uh, Asuka?"  
美里瞥了她一眼，脸上带着关切的表情。"呃，明日香？"

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"Do you want to talk about something?"  
"你想谈谈什么吗？"

"Not at all." Asuka had forgotten that Misato knew all about that day years ago. Well, Asuka didn't want anyone else to hear about that. Telling Hikari and Rei all that time ago had been therapeutic, sure, but it wasn't a story to tell Shinji. She didn't want him to know that about her.  
"一点也不。" 明日香忘记了美里多年前就知道那一天的事。好吧，明日香不希望其他人听到那件事。多年前告诉光和丽确实有治愈效果，但这不是告诉真嗣的故事。她不想让他知道她的这一面。

"Like I said," Asuka continued, "Just thought of something. Hikari and Toji must be enjoying themselves."  
"就像我说的，" 明日香继续道，"只是想到了一些事。光和透一定玩得很开心。"

"He's in a hospital, Asuka," Shinji said, "And Toji isn't a pervert."  
"他在医院里，明日香，" 真嗣说，"而且透不是个变态。"

"Oh, all boys are perverts," Asuka replied.  
"哦，所有男孩都是色狼，" 明日香回答道。

"That's a stereotype, you know," Shinji replied, bluntly.  
"那是刻板印象，你知道的，" 真嗣直截了当地回答。

"Yeah, but like most stereotypes, it has some basis in fact."  
"是啊，但就像大多数刻板印象一样，它也有一些事实基础。"

"She has a very good point," Misato replied.  
"她说的很有道理，" 美里回答道。

"I don't know how to take that response coming from a sex addict like you," Asuka replied.  
"我真不知道像你这样的色情狂说出这种话是什么意思，" 明日香回应道。

"Oh, that just does it!" Misato snarled, aggressively, "Maybe I should make a few posters with stills from that rather private moment in Rei's room, eh?"  
"哦，那就别怪我了！" 美里咆哮着，语气充满挑衅，"或许我该做几张海报，用上丽房间里那个相当私密的瞬间的截图，嗯？"

"You wouldn't dare!" Asuka snarled.  
"你不敢的！" 明日香咆哮道。

"Dare I would." "我敢。"

It was later that day that Asuka chose to visit Toji. Well, actually she went to visit Hikari, as she had taken it upon herself to watch over Toji's recovery for every waking moment. Ritsuko had informed Asuka that many tests were necessary to check to see if any contamination had been caused by the Angel. Naturally, however, they had found nothing. They were also checking Unit-03 for any of the Angel's remains, but had so far found nothing. Asuka was certain that she had effectively eliminated the Angel when she separated Toji from Unit-03.  
那天晚些时候，明日香决定去探望真嗣。实际上，她是去探望光，因为光自告奋勇在真嗣康复的每一个清醒时刻照顾他。律子告诉明日香，为了检查天使是否造成了污染，需要进行许多测试。然而，自然地，他们什么也没发现。他们也在检查 03 号机是否有天使的残留物，但到目前为止一无所获。明日香确信，当她将真嗣从 03 号机中分离出来时，已经彻底消灭了天使。

Upon opening the door, she saw Hikari feeding Toji, delicately, a home cooked dish of some sort. It looked like chicken, but Asuka wasn't certain. Whatever it was that they were doing, the moment Asuka let the door close behind her, Hikari dropped the chopsticks, blushing deep scarlet, as she turned around to see Asuka. Toji turned beet red as well.  
门一打开，她看到光在给真嗣喂食，小心翼翼地，似乎是一道家常菜。看起来像是鸡肉，但明日香不太确定。无论他们在做什么，当明日香让门在身后关上时，光立刻放下了筷子，脸颊深红，转过身来看见明日香。真嗣的脸也变得通红。

"Hey! Don't mind me," Asuka replied, plopping down at a chair at Hikari's side, "Please. Proceed."  
"嘿！别在意我，"明日香回答，一屁股坐在光旁边的椅子上，"请继续。"

"Um…" Hikari looked at her knees, unable to look up, as she replied, "Nice to see you, Asuka."  
"嗯…"光看着自己的膝盖，不敢抬头，回答道，"见到你真好，明日香。"

"The feeling is mutual," Asuka replied, a smile on her lips.  
“彼此彼此，”明日香回答，嘴角带着微笑。

"Listen, if you tell other people, they'll talk," Hikari said, still bashfully.  
“听着，如果你告诉别人，他们会说的，”光子仍然害羞地说。

"Oh, don't worry about them," Asuka laughed, "They're just jealous because they can't eat your delicious food."  
“哦，别担心他们，”明日香笑着说，“他们只是嫉妒，因为他们吃不到你做的美味食物。”

"Look, I'm sure Shinji knows about this—" Toji started, only to be interrupted by Asuka.  
“看，我敢肯定真嗣知道这件事——” 东治刚开口，就被明日香打断了。

"Actually, he's oblivious," Asuka lied.  
"实际上，他很迟钝，" 明日香撒谎道。

"Really?" Hikari asked, "But when he went to the bathroom last night he saw me and asked me how Toji was."  
"真的吗？" 光问，"但昨晚他去洗手间时看到我，还问我东治怎么样了。"

"What? Well, uh, he probably knew you were visiting him, yeah…" Asuka said.  
"什么？呃，他大概知道你在探望他，是吧…" 明日香说。

"And then he asked me if he should be there," Hikari replied, "Or if I wanted to be alone with him."  
"然后他问我他是否应该在场，" 光回答道，"或者我是否想和他单独相处。"

"He isn't as unobservant as I thought…" Asuka mumbled silently, taking note of this incident.  
"他并不像我想的那么不细心……" 明日香默默地嘀咕着，记下了这一幕。"

"How's Rei?" Hikari asked.  
"丽怎么样了？" 光问道。"

"Rei is…Rei…" Asuka said, simply.  
“丽她……是丽……”明日香简单地说道。

The fact was that the First Child had woken up, and asked them, upon awakening, what had happened. After they had patiently explained the situation to her, Rei had asked how long the two of them had stayed, at which they had responded, truthfully, for several hours. Rei had then told the two of them to go home and get sleep, that she wasn't worth worrying over that much, and, all the while maintaining her signature apathetic expression, asked if, on the chance that they visited her again, if they could give her a book to read.  
事实是，第一适格者已经醒来，并在苏醒时询问发生了什么。在他们耐心地向她解释了情况后，丽又问他们两人待了多久，他们如实回答，有好几个小时。随后，丽告诉他们回家休息，说自己不值得这么担心，同时保持着她标志性的冷漠表情，问他们下次来访时能否带本书给她读。

Naturally, Asuka had delivered a popular light novel over to her.  
自然，明日香给她带去了一本流行的轻小说。

"Oh, so she's okay?" Hikari asked.  
"哦，那她没事了？" 洞木光问道。

"She'll be fine in a day or so. She said she's had worse injuries in the past," Asuka replied.  
"她一两天就会好的。她说她以前受过更严重的伤，" 明日香回答道。

"I see," Toji replied, slumping over, "So at least I didn't hurt Rei too badly."  
"我明白了，" 冬二回答，身体瘫软下来，"至少我没有把丽伤得太重。"

"You didn't hurt anyone," Hikari said, her voice soothing and soft, "It was that Angel. It wasn't you."  
"你没有伤害任何人，" 光说，她的声音温柔而抚慰，"那是使徒干的，不是你。"

"Yeah, I guess," Toji mumbled, "Still, do I have to pilot that thing again?"  
"嗯，我想是吧，" 真嗣咕哝着，"不过，我非得再驾驶那东西吗？"

Asuka remembered Shinji, who had so frequently asked not to pilot the Eva. Why were they all so object to piloting Eva anyway? Sure, Toji had some excuse. He had been possessed by an Angel upon entering the Eva, sure, but aside from that, what was so terrible about it? They could receive glory and happiness from piloting, not to mention saving the world. It was a great experience, after all. Magnificent, to say the least. Toji just needed to jump back on the horse was all.  
明日香想起总是请求不要驾驶 Eva 的真嗣。为什么他们都这么反对驾驶 Eva 呢？当然，真嗣有些理由。他曾被使徒附身进入 Eva，确实，但除此之外，驾驶 Eva 有什么可怕的呢？他们能从驾驶中获得荣耀和幸福，更不用说拯救世界了。毕竟，这是一段非凡的经历，至少可以说是壮丽的。真嗣只需要重新上马就行了。

"What you need to do is pilot again," Asuka replied, a smile on her lips, "You should be up and running by the next Angel attack. What you need to do is just fight alongside us, and you'll be fine."  
"你需要做的是再次驾驶，" 明日香回答，嘴角带着微笑，"下次使徒来袭时你应该已经准备好了。你需要做的就是和我们并肩作战，一切都会好起来的。"

"But what if that Angel returns?" Toji asked, anxiously.  
"但如果那个使徒回来了呢？" 真嗣焦虑地问道。

"Don't be a coward!" Asuka snarled, "Once you get back into the Eva, you should be fine. I mean, it was just a fluke the Angel possessed you. A chance in a million. But now the Angel's dead. Gone. Kaput."  
"别这么胆小！" 明日香咆哮道，"一旦你回到 EVA 里，应该就没事了。我是说，使徒附身你只是个意外。百万分之一的几率。但现在使徒已经死了。消失了。完蛋了。"

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"What, Toji?" "怎么了，真嗣？"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

"What?" "什么？"

Toji glanced at his hand. He flexed his fingers, tensely, as he said, slowly, "Without you, I don't know what would have happened. I mean, I would have killed so many innocents, wouldn't of I? I would have made so many people suffer. I would have made them cry and die. I'm sure that something horrible would have happened. Something terrible. But, throughout that entire experience, I kept hearing a voice in my head."  
冬二瞥了一眼自己的手。他紧张地弯曲着手指，缓缓说道：“没有你，我不知道会发生什么。我是说，我会杀死那么多无辜的人，不是吗？我会让那么多人受苦。我会让他们哭泣和死去。我确信会发生一些可怕的事情。一些恐怖的事情。但在整个过程中，我脑海里一直有个声音。”

"A voice?" Asuka asked, curiously.  
“一个声音？”明日香好奇地问。

"Yeah. A voice that was almost trying to relax me," Toji said, frowning, "It kept asking me if I wanted to find peace, or something like that. And it mentioned someone named Kaworu."  
“嗯。一个几乎试图让我放松的声音，”冬二皱着眉说，“它一直问我是否想找到平静，或者类似的东西。它还提到了一个叫薰的人。”

"Kaworu?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow, "What the Hell? Who's Kaworu?"  
"卡沃鲁？" 明日香挑起眉毛问道，"搞什么鬼？谁是卡沃鲁？"

"I don't know," Toji said, "The voice was practically worshipping this "Kaworu person."  
"我不清楚，" 冬二说，"那声音简直像是在崇拜这个叫'卡沃鲁'的人。"

"Did you tell Ritsuko about this?" Asuka asked.  
"你跟律子说了这件事吗？" 明日香问。

"Yeah, I did," Toji said, "Told Hikari about it too."  
"嗯，我说了，" 冬二说道，"也告诉了光。"

Hikari confirmed this with a nod. "I think it's obvious the voice was the Angel, but is this Kaworu maybe the leader of the Angels? Maybe?"  
光点头确认道："我觉得很明显那声音是使徒，但这个渚薰可能是使徒的领袖吗？或许？"

"Yeah, maybe," Asuka replied, nodding, "But we really don't know much about the Angels at all, so I don't know."  
"或许吧，" 明日香点头回应，"但我们对使徒几乎一无所知，所以我也不确定。"

"You don't know anything about them and you're fighting them?" Hikari asked.  
"你对他们一无所知，却要和他们战斗？" 光问道。

"Well, of course. If an enemy attacks you, you have to fight back, right?" Asuka asked.  
"当然，如果敌人攻击你，你必须反击，对吧？" 明日香问道。

"Didn't you ever think of talking to them?" Hikari asked.  
"你难道没想过和他们谈谈吗？" 光问道。

"Talking to them!? They're Angels? They're violent and rude and, in case you didn't notice, not very vocal characters."  
"跟他们说话！？他们是使徒？他们既暴力又粗鲁，而且，如果你没注意到的话，他们并不是很爱说话的角色。"

"Sorry. Just a possibility."  
"抱歉。只是个可能性。"

"Don't worry about it," Asuka said, "You haven't seen quite as many Angels as we have. Most of the time it's kill first, ask questions later. Like, after all this is over."  
"别担心，"明日香说，"你没我们见过的使徒多。大多数时候都是先杀后问，就像，等这一切结束后再说。"

"Hopefully that's sooner than later," Toji said, "I'd hate to have to keep fighting forever."  
“希望那一天早点到来，”冬二说道，“我可不想永远打下去。”

Asuka had never really thought of the end of their journey before. After the last Angel was beaten, what would they do? Would they simply go back to their ordinary lives? Would there be room for a relationship with Shinji? It was only then that Asuka asked herself a question that she had never asked before.  
明日香从未真正思考过他们旅程的终点。在击败最后一个使徒之后，他们会做什么？他们会回到平凡的生活吗？她和真嗣之间是否还有发展的空间？直到那时，明日香才问了自己一个从未问过的问题。

Aside from piloting, what was it that she did that truly defined her as a person?  
除了驾驶 EVA，还有什么真正定义了她作为一个人的身份？

Who was she, really? She was a Pilot. Even Rei called her "Pilot Sohryu". That was her true calling. But after piloting was all over, after all the Angels were disposed of, then what? What was her true calling then? What was left of her? What could she do? Would she even be able to pilot after that? She'd have to keep her Evangelion after that. She'd have to be able to pilot, right? She'd have to. Hell, she'd even fight in military missions if it meant just being able to pilot.  
她究竟是谁？她是一名驾驶员。就连丽也称她为“惣流驾驶员”。那是她的真正身份。但当驾驶结束，所有使徒都被消灭后，她又是什么呢？那时她的真正身份又是什么？她还有什么？她能做什么？她还能驾驶吗？她必须保留她的 EVA。她必须能够驾驶，对吧？她必须。见鬼，即使这意味着要参与军事任务，只要能继续驾驶，她也会去做。

But maybe there'd never stop being Angels. Maybe they'd just keep coming forever. Asuka would like nothing better than for that to happen. Just to continuously fight Angels just so she'd pilot until the end of time.  
但也许使徒永远不会停止出现。也许它们会永远不断地来。对明日香来说，没有比这更好的事了。只要能一直战斗，直到时间的尽头，她愿意不断地与使徒作战。

"Earth to Asuka?" “地球呼叫明日香？”

"Oh! Sorry. Miles away," Asuka replied, "Daydreaming a little, you know?"  
"哦！抱歉。走神了，" 明日香回答，"有点白日梦，你知道的？"

"Yeah, I hear you," Hikari replied, and eyebrow raised, "But you looked like you were about to cry for a moment there."  
"是啊，我懂你，" 光回答，挑了挑眉毛，"但你刚才看起来像是要哭了一样。"

"Cry? I never cry," Asuka laughed.  
"哭？我从不哭，" 明日香笑着说。

"Asuka, this isn't about, well, you know," Hikari asked, with her voice slowly growing lower. Asuka knew what she meant. She meant what happened to her mother. Asuka shook her head.  
"明日香，这和...嗯，你知道的，" 光问，她的声音渐渐低了下来。明日香知道她指的是什么。她指的是她母亲的事。明日香摇了摇头。

"Honestly, just daydreaming."  
"老实说，只是在胡思乱想。"

"Okay, Asuka. I believe you," Hikari said, smiling, "But it must have been a lousy daydream."  
"好吧，明日香。我相信你，" 光笑着说，"但这肯定是个糟糕的白日梦。"

"It was. Kinda depressing, actually."  
"确实如此。实际上，还有点令人沮丧。"

And yet, even after Asuka left the two lovebirds to themselves, Asuka couldn't help but think about the end. The end of her adventure. The end of an era. She felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach as she contemplated that possibility. A day where Evas would be unnecessary. Would be disowned. Would be abandoned. Outclassed. Obsolete.  
尽管如此，即使明日香让那对恋人独处后，她还是忍不住思考结局。她冒险的终结。一个时代的结束。每当她想到这种可能性，心中就涌起一股沉重的失落感。那一天，EVA 将变得不再必要。被抛弃。被遗忘。超越。过时。

She prayed that the sun would never rise on a day like that.  
她祈祷那样的日子永远不会到来。

The next day at school, both Rei and Toji returned to school. And, naturally, Hikari returned to school with Toji. Although they didn't make a rather big deal of it, somehow the entire school deduced they were dating due to the fact that Hikari had the tendency of "accidentally" making too much lunch for one person and continuously "just happened" to give the extra lunch to Toji, who always "happened" to forget his lunch that day.  
次日，丽和真嗣都回到了学校，自然，光也和真嗣一起返校。虽然他们并未大张旗鼓地宣扬，但不知怎的，全校都推测他们正在交往，原因在于光有“不小心”做多一人份午餐的倾向，并且总是“恰好”将多出的午餐送给真嗣，而真嗣那天又总是“恰好”忘了带午餐。

In fact, the normal nature of life had left Asuka almost relaxed. She and Shinji were now starting to spend a lot more time with one another. Whenever Shinji hung out with Toji and Kensuke, Hikari would join Toji and Asuka would join Shinji. Rei would also invite herself to their group, a calm relaxed smile on her face, as always. The nature of their relationship was nice. The days they spent together, Asuka had to admit, were so serene, so gentle, almost soothing.  
事实上，日常生活的平静让明日香几乎感到放松。她和真嗣现在开始花更多时间在一起。每当真嗣和真希、健介一起玩时，光会加入真希，明日香则加入真嗣。丽也会自告奋勇加入他们的团体，一如既往地带着平静放松的微笑。他们之间的关系很美好。共度的时光，明日香不得不承认，是如此宁静，如此温柔，几乎令人感到慰藉。

Happy. 幸福。

In fact, due to this almost ordinary and normal life, Asuka had forgotten about synchronization tests entirely. A total of four days after Rei and Toji were taken out of the hospital, they had a synchronization test. And, surprisingly, a fourth plug was set up for Toji.  
事实上，由于这种近乎平凡的日常生活，明日香已经完全忘记了同步测试这回事。在绫波和剑介出院后的第四天，他们进行了一次同步测试。而且，令人惊讶的是，为剑介准备了一个第四插槽。

Ritsuko informed them after the test that, despite Toji being behind Rei, Toji had done exceedingly well for his first try, almost as good as Asuka and Shinji's first try. Even more interesting to Asuka, however, was that now Asuka and Shinji were nearly tied for the top spot. The difference was so marginal that Ritsuko had barely detected it. As of now, Shinji was only barely in the lead.  
测试结束后，律子告诉他们，尽管剑介落后于绫波，但作为初次尝试，他的表现非常出色，几乎与明日香和真嗣的初次尝试不相上下。然而，更让明日香感兴趣的是，现在她和真嗣几乎并列第一。差距微乎其微，律子几乎难以察觉。截至目前，真嗣仅以微弱优势领先。

Only barely. 只是勉强而已。

"Ha! Don't worry, Shinji," Asuka laughed, "Next time, you won't be ahead! Next time I'll blow you away, just like the amateur you are!"  
"哈！别担心，真嗣，" 明日香笑着说，"下次，你就不会领先了！下次我会把你打得落花流水，就像你这个业余的一样！"

"Is she always that arrogant?" Toji asked Shinji.  
"她总是那么傲慢吗？" 冬二问真嗣。

"Oh, you get used to it after awhile," Shinji replied, blushing.  
“哦，过一段时间你就会习惯的，”真嗣回答道，脸颊泛红。

"Hey!" “嘿！”

"After awhile, Pilot Sohryu's complaints almost feel like white noise," Rei replied, a note of amusement in her voice.  
"过了一会儿，飞行员惣流似乎在抱怨，听起来几乎像是白噪音，" 丽回答道，声音中带着一丝戏谑。

So even Rei was poking fun at her? Well, that just figured! That was just great, great! Now she was the laughing stock of the—  
连丽也在取笑她吗？好吧，这真是意料之中！太好了，太好了！现在她成了——

"Angel Attack!" "使徒来袭！"

"What?" Asuka stammered, "Right now?"  
"什么？" 明日香结巴道，"现在？"

"Oh God! Now I have to pilot that Eva again?" Toji grumbled.  
"哦天哪！现在我又得驾驶那台 EVA 了？" 真嗣抱怨道。

"Don't worry," Rei said, "Chances are you won't even be damaged."  
"别担心，"丽说，"很可能你连一点损伤都不会有。"

Asuka grinned. "Hell, chances are this will be five second's worth of—WOW!!"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。"见鬼，搞不好这只会是五秒钟的——哇！！"

The entire facility began to shake fiercely as something exploded high above NERV headquarters. Asuka tumbled onto Shinji, who landed on the floor. Shinji's hand, somehow, had found itself on Asuka's breast. The moment she realized this, Asuka slugged Shinji right in the face.  
整个设施开始剧烈摇晃，因为 NERV 总部上方发生了爆炸。明日香跌倒在真嗣身上，后者摔在了地板上。真嗣的手不知怎么地，竟然放在了明日香的胸部上。她意识到这一点时，明日香一拳打在了真嗣的脸上。

"Stupid animal!" "愚蠢的动物！"

"Pilots! Get your asses in the Eva! Right now!"  
"驾驶员们！快进 Eva 里！立刻！"

"This can't be good," Rei replied, her voice displaying, for perhaps the first time Asuka had ever known her, a note of fear.  
"这肯定不是好事，" 绫波回答道，她的声音中，或许是明日香认识她以来第一次，流露出了一丝恐惧。

### Chapter 10

"Okay! Prepare yourselves!"  
“好！准备好了吗！”

Asuka gripped the control mechanism to her Eva, anxiety filling her body. Why was she so damn nervous, anyway? It was just a stupid Angel. They had killed each and every one of those bastards already, and none of the Pilots had died yet. So surely, surely, today would pass without a single difficulty. Besides, the last two Angels had been tricky. What were the chances that the next one would be just as difficult to dispatch?  
明日香紧握住她的 EVA 控制装置，焦虑感充斥全身。她到底为什么这么紧张呢？不过是个愚蠢的天使罢了。他们已经干掉了每一个这样的混蛋，而且至今没有一位驾驶员牺牲。所以今天肯定也会顺利度过，不会有任何困难。而且，最后两个天使都很棘手。下一个天使同样难对付的概率能有多大呢？

The roof to the Geofront exploded inward as the Angel descended from the sky. Asuka didn't get a good look at the Eva before she grabbed the arsenal of weaponry at her side, aiming, and firing straight into the thick cloud of smoke. The bullets were deflected off into the air as they slammed into the Angel's AT Field. Just where the hell were those other three pilots, anyway? She needed backup!  
随着使徒从天而降，地底都市的屋顶轰然内爆。明日香还没来得及看清那台 Eva，便迅速抓起身边的武器装备，瞄准，直射入浓烟之中。子弹在撞击使徒的 AT 力场后被弹飞到空中。话说回来，那三个飞行员到底跑哪儿去了？她需要支援！

She abandoned the two machine guns in favor of rocket launchers. The explosives flew at the Angel as it descended from the ceiling, only for the bombs to explode harmlessly against the AT Field. She swore in German under her breath as she fired a second barrage of rockets, and then another set. And again. And again. Every rocket exploded against the AT Field, leaving not even a mark against the Angel's hide.  
她放弃了双机枪，转而使用火箭发射器。爆炸物随着使徒从天花板降下而飞向它，但炸弹在 AT 力场前无害地爆炸。她低声用德语咒骂着，连续发射了第二轮火箭弹，然后又是一轮。再一轮。再一轮。每一枚火箭都在 AT 力场前爆炸，使徒的表皮上连一丝痕迹都未留下。

Finally, the Fourteenth Angel descended to the ground. It resembled and armless tube, a dark fearsome creature, wearing a haunting mask where its face should have been. Two flaps hung limply by its sides where its arms should have been. They almost resembled flags of some sort.  
终于，第十四使徒降落到地面。它形似无臂的圆筒，一个黑暗而可怕的生物，本该是脸的地方戴着一副令人毛骨悚然的假面。两侧本该是手臂的地方垂着两片软塌塌的翼状物，它们几乎像是某种旗帜。

"Well, what a stupid looking Angel," Asuka laughed. It wasn't scary at all.  
"哎呀，这天使看起来真蠢，" 明日香笑道。一点儿也不吓人。

Then why was she shivering?  
那她为什么在发抖？

She extended her rocket launchers, and fired, rapidly, at the Angel. Naturally, they exploded harmlessly against its AT Field. Suddenly, without warning, it's flag-like arms extended, like massive, violent ribbons, flying directly at Unit-02! Her eyes widened as the ribbons extended out to her Eva's shoulders.  
她展开火箭发射器，对着天使迅速开火。当然，这些攻击在它的 AT 力场前毫无作用。突然，没有任何预兆，它那旗子般的臂膀像巨大的、狂暴的丝带一样伸展出来，直扑二号机！明日香瞪大了眼睛，看着这些丝带向她的 Eva 肩部延伸过去。

"Damn it!" "该死！"

There was an explosion. The arms were warped around the impact of the dual rocket launchers from far off. Asuka felt her body tremble as Toji's avatar appeared on her screen as it snarled, "Damn it! You just had to go out ahead of us! This isn't an egotrip, you know."  
一声爆炸响起。远处的双火箭发射器冲击下，手臂扭曲变形。明日香感到身体颤抖，屏幕上显示着真嗣的虚拟形象，它咆哮道：“该死！你就非得抢在我们前面吗！这不是为了炫耀，你知道的。”

"Damn greenhorn! I was simply assessing the problem before you guys got there," Asuka replied.  
“该死的新手！我只是在你到达之前评估问题，”明日香回应道。

"That is an ignorant course of action to take," Rei said, her avatar appearing in her screen.  
“那是无知的行为，”绫波零说道，她的虚拟形象出现在屏幕上。

"You could have gotten your arms sliced off," Shinji added.  
"你本可以把胳膊都给切掉的，"真嗣补充道。

"Will you all just shut the hell up already!? _Gott in Himmell_!" Asuka snarled.  
"你们能不能都他妈的闭嘴！？天杀的！"明日香咆哮道。

The Angle had yet to fall. It glared at the Four Evangelions as they surrounded it, each one occupying a corner. Asuka felt annoyed that a novice like Toji had to go ahead and save her. Hell, that was even worse than if, say, Rei had saved her life or something ridiculous like that. Still, that was just one small thing. She would pay Toji back in full later, if she felt like it.  
天使尚未坠落。它瞪着四台福音战士将它团团围住，每台占据一个角落。明日香感到恼火，一个新手如东治居然得去救她。见鬼，这比说绫波救了她一命还要荒唐。不过，那只是小事一桩。如果她愿意，以后会好好回报东治的。

She had paid back Shinji, but, naturally, Shinji was higher up on Asuka's list of interests.  
她已经还了真嗣的人情，但自然，真嗣在明日香的关注列表上排名并不高。

The Angel's ribbon-like arms extended outward toward Toji, who managed to evade the weaponry. He extended his two rocket launchers straight at the Angel, firing a dual round of lethal explosions straight into the Angel's mask. They exploded harmlessly against its AT Field, as expected.  
天使那如同丝带般的手臂向真嗣伸展开来，他机敏地躲开了这些攻击。真嗣将两支火箭发射器直接对准天使，发射出一对致命的爆炸弹，直击天使的面具。正如预料的那样，这些爆炸在天使的 AT 力场前毫无作用，被轻易化解。

"What we have to do is eliminate the AT Field," Rei replied, anxiously.  
“我们必须消除 AT 力场，”绫波回答道，语气中带着焦虑。

"Rei, you are aware that you only have one arm, right?" Asuka asked, bewildered by Eva Unit-00's mauled frame. Had they not fixed her all the way since the last fight.  
“绫波，你意识到你只有一只手臂了吗？”明日香问道，对零号机的残破身躯感到困惑。难道他们自上次战斗后没有完全修复她吗？

"The damage is minimal," Rei replied, "I don't even feel the arm, so it's completely fine. Insignificant."  
“损伤很小，”绫波回答，“我甚至感觉不到手臂的存在，所以完全没问题。微不足道。”

"You're Eva's missing a freakin' arm and that's insignificant?" Toji stammered.  
“你的 EVA 少了一条手臂，这叫微不足道？” 东治结巴地说。

The Angel's ribbon-like arms returned to their original location. The hideous mask glared straight at Toji, its eyes glowing brilliantly for an instant. Before any of them could do anything, there was a massive explosion that enveloped Unit-03! Asuka stared in horror as the Eva was thrown into the air, landing heavily on the ground. There was a large hole in the Eva's chest. Gingerly, Unit-03 pushed itself up, only for the ribbon-like arms to extend sharply at Unit-03.  
天使般的带状手臂回到了原位。那张丑陋的面具直勾勾地盯着真嗣，眼中闪耀着一瞬间的光芒。在他们能做出任何反应之前，一场巨大的爆炸吞噬了 03 号机！明日香惊恐地看着 Eva 被抛向空中，重重地摔在地上。Eva 的胸口有一个大洞。小心翼翼地，03 号机推起身来，却见那带状手臂猛地向 03 号机伸去。

It was time to pay him back for his debt. Asuka sprinted over to the middle ground as the arms shot at Toji. However, she could see Unit-01 dashing toward the same location, only toward the opposite arm. Asuka snarled into her moniter "Shinji! You grab one, and I'll grab the other! Got it?"  
是时候还他的债了。明日香冲向中间地带，手臂向真嗣射去。然而，她能看到 01 号机正朝着同一地点疾驰，只是朝着相反的手臂。明日香对着监视器咆哮道：“真嗣！你抓住一个，我抓住另一个！明白吗？”

"Yeah!" “明白！”

Unit-01 complied with the strategy. The moment they reached the arms, before they had a chance to slice off Unit-03's head, he grabbed the ribbon-like arm, squeezing it with intense ferocity. At the same time, Unit-02 grabbed the same arm with both hands. She felt her palms being shredded as the arm skidded against her Eva's hands. She ignored the pain, only to squeeze harder against the arm. At long last, the arms stopped, within her grasp at last. The same could be said for Eva-01.  
初号机遵循了策略。在他们有机会砍下三号机的头部之前，他猛地抓住了那条带状的手臂，以极大的力量紧握。与此同时，二号机用双手抓住了同一条手臂。她感觉到手掌被撕裂，因为手臂在她 Eva 的手中滑过。她无视疼痛，只是更加用力地挤压手臂。最终，手臂在她手中停止了动作。初号机也是如此。

"Rei! Slice these arms off with your knife!" Asuka snarled, struggling to keep the arm from escaping.  
“绫波！用你的刀把这些手臂砍掉！”明日香咆哮着，努力不让手臂逃脱。

"Affirmative." “明白。”

Rei rushed forward, the progressive knife in her single hand. She extended the weapon, and sliced down upon the ribbon. Asuka felt the arm slacken as the blade severed the arm. Blood splattered out of the devastated arm, now hanging limply from the Angel's body. Before Rei could sever the second arm, however, she was blown backward by a sudden explosion of light, thrown straight into the ground.  
绫波丽疾冲向前，单手持着那把渐进之刃。她伸出武器，向着丝带猛力劈下。随着刀刃切断手臂，明日香感到那只手臂的力量松弛下来。血从被摧毁的手臂中喷溅而出，如今它无力地悬挂在使徒的身体上。然而，就在绫波准备切断第二只手臂之前，她被突如其来的光芒爆炸击中，直接被抛向地面。

"Damn it!" Shinji screamed as she struggled against the other arm.  
“该死！”真嗣尖叫着，挣扎着对抗另一只手臂。

Asuka was about to sever that arm, but, before he could, Unit-03 pushed itself up, and dashed around Unit-01, and toward the Angel. With a sharp slice, the other arm was severed.  
明日香正要切断那只手臂，但就在他行动之前，三号机自行起身，绕过初号机，冲向使徒。随着一记利落的斩击，另一只手臂也被切断了。

The Angel shrieked in pain as it staggered backward, its limp arms hanging at its sides. Asuka grinned. Now that those damned arms have been taken care of, all that remained was that Angel.  
天使痛苦地尖叫着，踉跄后退，无力的双臂垂在身侧。明日香咧嘴一笑。既然那该死的双臂已经被解决了，剩下的就只有那个天使了。

"Rei, are you okay?" Shinji asked.  
"丽，你还好吗？" 真嗣问道。

"The pain isn't crippling," Rei replied, gingerly, "I'm still able to fight."  
"疼痛并不致命，" 丽小心翼翼地回答，"我还能继续战斗。"

"Well, that works for me," Toji said, "I can keep this up."  
"那对我来说正好，" 东治说，"我能坚持下去。"

"We need to corrode its AT Field!" Asuka replied, smirking, "That's it. Alright, Shinji and I will head over there to corrode the field, and Rei will fire a rocket straight into its S2 Engine."  
"我们需要腐蚀它的 AT 力场！" 明日香回答道，嘴角带着一丝得意的笑，"就是这样。好吧，我和真嗣过去腐蚀力场，而零会直接向它的 S2 引擎发射火箭。"

"What do I do?" Toji asked, curiously.  
"我该做什么？" 冬二好奇地问道。"

"Distract it by firing rockets into its back. That way, it'll focus on you more," Asuka replied.  
"用火箭攻击它的背部来分散它的注意力。这样，它就会更多地关注你。" 明日香回答道。"

"So I'm a damn decoy?!"  
"所以我他妈的就是个诱饵？！"

"Exactly." “正是如此。”

"Jesus!" "天哪！"

They were brought back to reality the moment Rei leapt out of the way to avoid a massive explosion. Her Eva was undamaged, but it was enough to alert them to reality. The duo of Shinji and Asuka sprinted toward the Angel as Toji fired rapid fire at it from a distance, dashing around in circles in order to avoid the inevitable explosions that followed him. The bullets were enough to bring out the Angel's AT Field, visible to the naked eye. Asuka and Shinji, on opposite sides of the Angel, reached out for the field, and grabbed it in their hands.  
就在 Rei 跳开躲避一场巨大爆炸的瞬间，他们被拉回了现实。她的 Eva 完好无损，但这足以提醒他们面对现实。Shinji 和 Asuka 这对搭档朝着使徒冲刺，Toji 则从远处对其进行快速射击，绕着圈子疾跑以躲避紧随其后的爆炸。子弹足以激发出使徒的 AT 力场，肉眼可见。Asuka 和 Shinji 分别位于使徒两侧，伸手触碰力场，并紧紧抓住。

Asuka could feel energy surging throughout her body. An unpleasant strain consumed her as she struggled for dear life to wrench the field apart. She could see Unit-01 doing the same, struggling against the Angel's field. The ground shook with their effort as sparks flew from the AT Field. In a matter of moments, the duo had wrenched a gap in the Field. That gap gave, and soon the entire AT Field had been wrenched to pieces!  
Asuka 能感受到能量在她体内涌动。一种不愉快的压力吞噬着她，她拼尽全力试图撕裂力场。她看到初号机也在做同样的事情，与使徒的力场抗争。地面因他们的努力而震动，AT 力场迸发出火花。转眼间，两人已在力场上撕开一道裂口。那裂口扩大，很快整个 AT 力场就被撕得粉碎！

"Rei! Do it now!" Asuka snarled.  
“Rei！就是现在！”Asuka 咆哮道。

Rei fired a single rocket straight into the Angel's S2 Engine. The moment it collided, the very instant of impact, they exploded outward. The Angel shrieked in pain as a hole was drilled straight through its body. Blood splattered on the ground as the Angel fell to the floor, still and motionless.  
丽发射了一枚火箭，直击使徒的 S2 引擎。碰撞的瞬间，爆炸向外扩散。使徒痛苦地尖叫，身体被直接贯穿了一个洞。鲜血四溅，使徒倒在地上，静止不动。

For a moment, no one moved. Asuka exhaled deeply as she struggled to breathe. The effort to take the Angel down had been extensive. It had been almost impossible to eliminate the field, had it not been for Shinji. Alone, it would have been impossible. Hell, she couldn't imagine what it would have been like it they had fought it one by one. Asuka would be down, for one, as would the rest of them. Maybe they'd wear it down, just maybe, but the fact remained it would have been damn near impossible. They'd need a miracle of some sort.  
一时间，无人动弹。明日香深呼吸，努力喘息。击倒使徒的战斗异常艰巨。若非真嗣的帮助，消除那个力场几乎是不可能的。单独一人，根本无法做到。天哪，她无法想象如果他们一个个上会是什么情景。明日香自己会倒下，其他人也一样。或许他们能慢慢消耗它，但事实是，这几乎是不可能的。他们需要某种奇迹。

"Good work, guys!" Misato's face appeared on her screen, a congratulatory look upon her face, "You did amazing back there!"  
“干得好，伙计们！”美里出现在屏幕上，脸上带着祝贺的表情，“你们刚才的表现太棒了！”

"Thanks!" Asuka said, smiling.  
"谢谢！" 明日香笑着说。

"You worked together as a team. That's why you won," Misato replied, "I'm proud of all of you."  
"你们作为一个团队合作无间。这就是你们获胜的原因，" 美里回答道，"我为你们所有人感到骄傲。"

"Thank you…" Shinji said, in awe at how powerful such a compliment was.  
"谢谢你……" 真嗣说道，对如此赞誉的力量感到敬畏。

"Wow! Thanks a bunch, Misato!" Toji said, his eyes dialated as he stared into Misato's avatar.  
"哇！太感谢了，美里！" 冬二说道，他的眼睛因盯着美里的虚拟形象而放大。

"Toji, don't forget Hikari," Asuka mumbled in a threatening tone.  
"冬二，别忘了光，" 明日香用威胁的语气咕哝道。

"Hey! Just window shopping! No big deal."  
"嘿！只是随便看看！没什么大不了的。"

"Oh right. Window shopping. Well, Hikari might want to return a certain product, unsatisfied."  
"哦对了，逛街。嗯，光可能想退掉某个不满意的产品。"

"Hey!" “嘿！”

"Uh, guys?" Misato attempted to regain order. She managed to succeed. "Well, that's it for today. Great job!"  
"呃，各位？" 美里试图恢复秩序。她成功了。"好了，今天就到这里。干得不错！"

The moment the Evas returned to base, Asuka leapt out of the Eva, and sighed, exhausted, "Hey Shinji! Did that AT Field take a lot out of you? I mean, I'm exhausted."  
EVA 一回到基地，明日香就从 EVA 里跳了出来，疲惫地叹了口气，"嘿，真嗣！那个 AT 力场让你很吃力吗？我是说，我累坏了。"

"Same here," Shinji replied, sighing.  
“我也是，”真嗣回答道，叹了口气。

"Well, at least you didn't get holes drilled in you or have to be a walking target," Toji mumbled.  
“好吧，至少你没被钻孔或者被迫成为移动靶子，”东治咕哝着。

"All of you are over exaggerating your own misfortunes," Rei replied, shaking her head, "None of you fought with one arm, received serious damage, and still fought."  
“你们都在过分夸大自己的不幸，”丽回答道，摇了摇头，“你们没有人是用一只手臂战斗，受了重伤，还继续战斗的。”

"Eh, she has a point," Toji replied, shrugging.  
"嗯，她说得有道理，" 冬二回答，耸了耸肩。

"Yeah. Wonder Girl does have a point there," Asuka mumbled.  
"是啊。小姑娘说得没错，" 明日香咕哝道。

"You haven't called me Wonder Girl in some time," Rei replied.  
"你已经很久没叫我小姑娘了，" 丽回答道。

"Oh? I haven't? Yeah, you're right."  
"哦？我还没吗？是啊，你说得对。"

"And you haven't been a complete Demon lately either," Toji replied, stretching out his arms, "Just a small one."  
"而且你最近也不是一个完全的恶魔，" 冬二回答道，伸了个懒腰，"只是个小恶魔。"

"A small demon!? I'll show you a small demon…" Asuka mumbled, venomously.  
"小恶魔？！我让你见识见识小恶魔……" 明日香嘀咕着，带着怨气。"

"Still, it's been nice, hasn't it?" Shinji replied, surprising himself by his tone.  
"不过，这段时间还是挺不错的，不是吗？" 真嗣回答道，连自己都惊讶于他的语气。

"Yeah. It really has been," Asuka replied, smiling serenely.  
"是啊。确实如此，" 明日香微笑着平静地回答。

"Well, knowing our luck, maybe it will screw itself up somewhere along the lines," Toji mumbled, "Just how many more of these angels are we going to fight, anyway?"  
"唉，凭我们的运气，也许哪天就会搞砸，" 冬二嘟囔着，"话说回来，我们到底还要对付多少个使徒啊？"

"Commander Ikari said that there might only be a total of three additional angels," Rei replied.  
"碇司令说可能总共只有三只额外的使徒，" 绫波回答道。

"Wait, three?" Asuka replied, surprised, "Are you sure?"  
"等等，三只？" 明日香惊讶地回应，"你确定吗？"

"Yes. Three." "是的。三只。"

"But how does he know? He could be wrong, right?"  
"但他怎么知道？他可能是错的，对吧？"

"Perhaps, but that is extremely unlikely."  
"或许吧，但这种可能性极低。"

"Don't tell me you're gonna miss those freaks, are you?" Toji asked, "Or do you simply relate to Demons like you?"  
"别告诉我你会想念那些怪胎，是吗？" 东治问道，"还是说你就像那些恶魔一样，能感同身受？"

"Shut up!" “闭嘴！”

She could feel anxiety consume her once again. Only three angels? No, that couldn't be right. The end couldn't be so damn near. She couldn't be that close to the end of such a massive chapter of her life. She was an Eva Pilot. That was it. It was that simple, God damn it. Without that, without that column, that pillar, supporting her very life, what did she have left? What was she without it? She felt sweat explode from every pore on her body as she felt her heart sear with pain.  
她能再次感受到焦虑吞噬着她。只有三个天使？不，这不可能对。末日不可能如此临近。她不可能如此接近自己生命中如此宏大篇章的终结。她是一名 EVA 驾驶员。就是这样。就这么简单，该死的。如果没有那个支柱，那个支撑她生命的柱子，她还剩下什么？没有了它，她是什么？她感到汗水从全身每一个毛孔中迸发出来，心脏因疼痛而灼烧。

But she couldn't let the others see. They'd think she was nuts. Hell, maybe she was nuts. After all, if she was losing her mind over the fact that she couldn't pilot anymore, she had to be insane! She had to be a lunatic, right? Right? She had to be unstable, had to be on the edge, right? Right?! Someone just had to tell her! Someone had to tell her she was either a nut or she was perfectly sane. She just couldn't live without someone just assuring her that she'd be alright!  
但她不能让其他人看到。他们会认为她疯了。见鬼，也许她真的疯了。毕竟，如果她因为不能再驾驶 EVA 而失去理智，她一定是疯了！她一定是疯子，对吧？对吧？她一定是不稳定的，一定是在边缘，对吧？对吧？！总得有人告诉她！总得有人告诉她，她要么是个疯子，要么完全正常。她就是不能在没有别人保证她会没事的情况下生活！

Somebody answer!! 快来个人回答！！

"Asuka, what's wrong?" “明日香，怎么了？”

Asuka glanced up as Shinji shook her to her senses. The others were staring at her. Had she gone through some sort of strange episode? Had she been acting funny? Well, if the emotions bubbling beneath the skin were any indication of how she had been acting, chances are it would appear to the ordinary human being that her panic attack was more akin to a full blown heart attack or psychotic episode.  
明日香抬头一看，真嗣正摇晃着她让她回神。其他人都在盯着她看。她是不是经历了一段奇怪的插曲？她的行为是不是很滑稽？嗯，如果皮肤下涌动的情绪能说明她的行为，那么对普通人来说，她的恐慌发作很可能看起来更像是一场严重的心脏病发作或精神病发作。

"Nothing. Nothing at all," Asuka stammered, rising to her feet as she brushed her hair out of her eyes, "Just…I don't know."  
“没什么，什么都没有，”明日香结巴着，站起身来，一边将头发从眼前拨开，“只是……我不知道。”

"You looked like you were having a spasm or something like that," Toji replied.  
“你看起来像是在抽搐或者类似的情况，”真嗣回答道。

"Are you having an anxiety attack, Pilot Sohryu?"  
“你是不是在焦虑发作，驾驶员惣流？”

"No, just…I'm fine. Really. Perfectly fine."  
“不，只是……我没事。真的。好得很。”

And yet, as the days passed, as weeks passed, as an entire month and then some passed, the possibility of a day dawning without Eva and Angels and conflicts and all other sorts of struggles seemed to permeate throughout her life. She couldn't help but see herself in a matter of months, without Eva, a nervous wreck unable to control her own emotions. She could see the others happy, see Hikari feeding Toji whatever delicious dish she had concocted that night. See Misato and Kaji having sex and pleasuring each other. See Rei patiently reading a book by the lake. See Shinji playing his cello delicately. But then she'd see herself, huddled in a corner, naked, crying all alone without anyone else beside her to console her. To tell her that she had a purpose in life.  
然而，随着日子一天天过去，周复一周，乃至一个多月悄然流逝，生活中似乎渗透了没有明日香、使徒、冲突和种种挣扎的可能性。她不禁想象自己在几个月后，没有了明日香，成为一个情绪失控的神经质。她能看到其他人幸福的样子，看到光在给真治喂她那晚精心烹制的美味佳肴。看到美里和加持在享受彼此的欢愉。看到丽在湖边耐心地读书。看到真嗣细致地演奏大提琴。但随后她会看到自己，蜷缩在角落里，赤裸着，独自哭泣，身边没有一个人来安慰她。没有人告诉她，她在生活中有存在的意义。

And just what was that purpose? To pilot Eva, of course. That was her sole purpose in the world.  
那意义究竟是什么？当然是驾驶 EVA，这世上她唯一的使命。

"That's ridiculous!" Dr. Tamako laughed, "Piloting Eva isn't the only thing you're good at."  
"那太荒谬了！" 玉子博士笑着说，"驾驶 Eva 并不是你唯一擅长的事情。"

"What else am I good for?" Asuka asked her as she finished her hand in Rummy, "I mean, I've lived to be a pilot my entire life. It's all I'm good at!"  
"我还能擅长什么呢？" 明日香一边完成她的拉米牌局，一边问她，"我是说，我一生都在为成为一名驾驶员而活。这是我唯一擅长的！"

"You graduated college as a teenager. I'm sure you're good at many other things."  
"你十几岁就大学毕业了。我相信你在很多其他事情上也一定很出色。"

"That's not the point." "那不是重点。"

"Then what is the point?"  
"那重点是什么？"

"The point is I have to pilot it! It's my job! My life!"  
"重点是我必须驾驶它！这是我的工作！我的生命！"

"You define your existence on your job?" Dr. Tamako replied, frowning.  
"你以工作来定义自己的存在吗？" 玉子博士皱着眉头回答。

"Yes." "是的。"

"I thought you had gotten over being the best."  
"我以为你已经不再执着于成为最优秀的那个人了。"

"No! It isn't just being the best anymore, it's actually piloting," Asuka cried, "I have to pilot. I just can't take life if I don't have Eva! I need it! I need it…"  
"不！不仅仅是成为最优秀，而是真正地驾驶，" 明日香哭喊道，"我必须驾驶。如果没有 Eva，我无法承受生活！我需要它！我需要它……"

"Well, no one said you couldn't pilot Eva after the Angels were gone, you know," Dr. Tamako replied, "I mean, they'll still be opportunities to pilot the Eva, like in warfare and whatnot."  
"好吧，没人说过在使徒消失后你不能驾驶 EVA，你知道的，" 田子博士回答道，"我的意思是，仍然会有驾驶 EVA 的机会，比如在战争和其他什么的场合。"

"But I don't want to be a soldier," Asuka mumbled, "I want to pilot. The glory. The respect. Everything. And the excitement. The thrill. I just need it to survive. I need it!"  
"但我不想成为一名士兵，" 明日香嘟囔着，"我想驾驶。那份荣耀。那份尊重。一切。还有那份兴奋。那份刺激。我需要它来生存。我需要它！"

"Listen," Dr. Tamako said, putting a hand on Asuka's shoulder, "There are more things that define a person than simply their functions. A lot more. Like the people you know. The experiences you've had. Your own personal opinions of yourself. Even if you don't acknowledge that now, those elements are still a part of you and your being. You can ignore them, sure, but they're a part of you. Your past, present, and future are all influencing your existence."  
"听着，" 田子博士说，把手放在明日香的肩膀上，"定义一个人的不仅仅是他们的功能。还有很多。比如你认识的人。你经历过的经历。你对自己个人的看法。即使你现在不承认，这些元素仍然是你的组成部分。你可以忽视它们，当然，但它们是你的一部分。你的过去、现在和未来都在影响着你的存在。"

"Of course my future is!" Asuka snarled, "Without Eva, I'm worthless. I don't even deserve to—"  
"当然我的未来是！" 明日香咆哮道，"没有 Eva，我一文不值。我甚至不配——"

"Don't say that," Dr. Tamako said, her voice serious, "Listen to yourself. Killing yourself just because you can't pilot Eva is probably one of the most cowardly things you can possibly do."  
"别这么说，" 环奈博士严肃地说，"听听你自己。仅仅因为不能驾驶 Eva 就选择自杀，这可能是你能做的最懦弱的事情之一。"

The image of her mother hanging by a noose right in front of her eyes reappeared in her vision. She could hear herself, in her memories, crying "Don't kill me too!!" Tears sprang to her real eyes as she slumped against her own knees, crying into them. Dr. Tamako raised an eyebrow as she stared down at Asuka's sobbing form.  
她母亲吊在绳索上的画面再次浮现在她的视线中。她能听到自己在记忆中哭泣："不要也杀了我！！" 泪水涌上她的双眼，她瘫坐在自己的膝盖上，哭泣着。环奈博士扬起眉毛，低头凝视着明日香哭泣的身影。

"What's wrong? Asuka? Asuka?"  
"怎么了？明日香？明日香？"

"I've had enough," Asuka replied, her voice barely a whisper, "I'm going home. I want to go home. Please let me go home."  
"我受够了，" 明日香回答，她的声音几乎细不可闻，"我要回家。我想回家。请让我回家。"

"Asuka, are you sure you don't want to get it off—"  
"明日香，你确定不想把它取下来——"

"Let me go home!" snarled Asuka, violently slamming her fist against Dr. Tamako's desk.  
"让我回家！" 明日香咆哮着，猛地一拳砸在田子博士的桌子上。

"Control yourself. Listen, please. Do you want me to play some music for you?" Dr. Tamako reached for a CD player, and pressed play. A soothing song emanated from the speakers, at which Asuka felt her body loosen and the tension ebb away.  
"控制一下自己。请听我说，你想让我给你放点音乐吗？" 田子博士伸手去拿 CD 播放器，按下了播放键。一首舒缓的歌曲从扬声器中传出，明日香感到身体放松，紧张感逐渐消散。

"What is this?" Asuka asked.  
"这是什么？" 明日香问道。

"This is music by a man named Bach," Dr. Tamako replied, "Beautiful song, no?"  
“这是巴赫的作品，”玉子博士回答道，“很美妙的曲子，不是吗？”

"Why are you playing it now?"  
“为什么现在播放它？”

"It's supposed to relax you. Make you more open. I want to talk to you. Clearly you need to talk to someone right now. You're overly stressed out. I can't blame you. You have so many responsibilities in this world and they're all piled up on top of your shoulders one by one. Surely you need a vent. Please, just tell me what's wrong."  
"这应该是让你放松的。让你更敞开心扉。我想和你谈谈。显然你现在需要和某个人谈谈。你压力太大了。我不能怪你。你在这个世界上有太多责任，它们一个接一个地压在你的肩上。你肯定需要发泄一下。请告诉我，到底怎么了。"

Asuka thought of her mother, hanging from the rafters. She needed to tell her. She just had to explain the source of all her pain and suffering. She had to tell someone! But she kept her mouth shut. She had remained silent about that incident for years. She didn't want people who didn't have to know about her past know just what had happened to her mother. It wasn't their business. Even if she was a shrink, Dr. Tamako didn't need to know. Neither did Shinji, for that matter.  
明日香想起了她的母亲，挂在横梁上。她需要告诉她。她必须解释她所有痛苦和苦难的根源。她必须告诉某个人！但她闭上了嘴。多年来她一直对那件事保持沉默。她不想让那些不必了解她过去的人知道她母亲发生了什么。这不关他们的事。即使她是个心理医生，田子医生也不需要知道。至于真嗣，就更不用说了。

"I want to go home."  
"我想回家。"

It took a minute for her to leave Dr. Tamako behind. Fifty minutes later, Asuka was alone next to Kaji as they drove down the dark street. Kaji ran a hand up his hair as he said, gently, "You know, Asuka, you've been loosing weight."  
她花了点时间才把玉子医生抛在脑后。五十分钟后，明日香独自坐在黑暗的街道旁，与加持并肩而行。加持一边用手梳理着头发，一边温柔地说道：“你知道吗，明日香，你最近瘦了不少。”

Asuka didn't response. 明日香没有回应。

"You aren't growing up to become anorexic, right? You were always a thin girl."  
“你不会是正在变成厌食症吧？你一直都很苗条的。”

No response. 没有回应。

"Listen to me. I'm going to go away for a little while. Just a few weeks."  
"听我说。我要离开一小段时间。就几周。"

"Where?" "去哪儿？"

"She speaks. At long last. Well, the truth is that I'm not entirely sure quite where this place is right now. I mean, it could be several different places."  
"她终于开口了。好吧，说实话，我不太确定这个地方现在具体在哪里。我的意思是，它可能在好几个不同的地方。"

"Really? Enlighten me," Asuka said in a hollowed out husk of a voice.  
"真的吗？请指教，" 明日香用一种空洞的声音说道。

"Well, one place might be pretty hot. Fiery, actually. Down south."  
"嗯，有一个地方可能会很热。实际上，是相当火热。在南方。"

"Hot?" "热？"

"I hope I don't head down there, though. Awfully nasty bunch of people there. Thankfully, I think I'm safe from being sent down to that pit."  
"我希望我不会被派到那里去，那儿的人可真是糟糕透顶。谢天谢地，我觉得我应该不会被送到那个鬼地方。"

"What's the name? I might have been there in the past. I've been to a few different places like that."  
"那地方叫什么名字？我可能以前去过。我曾去过几个类似的地方。"

"It's awfully hellish, I'll tell you that. But another place may just be a bit more north of here. Rather pleasant place. I hope to end up being sent up there, but I am not entirely certain I have all of the qualifications."  
"那地方可真是地狱般糟糕，我得告诉你。不过，另一个地方可能就在这北边一点。相当不错的地方。我希望最终能被派到那里，但我并不完全确定自己是否具备所有资格。"

"What do you mean?" Asuka asked, apathetically.  
"你什么意思？" 明日香漠不关心地问。

"I just need to be able to say that I've made sure that I've affected people positively in my life. Like you, Asuka. I wouldn't bare to head up there knowing I still have to help you guys out."  
"我只是希望能说，我确保了自己在生活中对人们产生了积极的影响。就像你，明日香。我不忍心就这样上去，还知道我得帮你们一把。"

"Why not? Go off and enjoy yourself. You've earned it," Asuka mumbled.  
"为什么不呢？去享受吧，这是你应得的，"明日香咕哝道。"

"Perhaps. But I'd be away from Misato for quite some time. I'd hate to do that," Kaji said, his voice distant.  
"也许吧。但我将离开美里很长一段时间。我不愿意那样做，"加持说，声音遥远。"

"You love her, right?" "你爱她，对吧？"

"Yes, I do." "是的，我相信。"

"Did you do it with her?"  
"你和她做过那事吗？"

"Have sex? Why, that's something of a private question."  
"做爱？哎呀，这可是个私密的问题。"

"I don't care. It won't affect the way I see you."  
"我不在乎。这不会影响我对你的看法。"

"Well, to answer your curiosity, we have."  
"好吧，满足你的好奇心，我们确实有过。"

"Figures." "意料之中。"

There was a moment of silence before Kaji said, softly, "Asuka, I might not be able to see you for some time."  
有那么一刻的沉默，随后加持轻声说道：“明日香，我可能有一段时间不能见你了。”

"Okay. I'll wait for you."  
“好的，我会等你。”

"Don't worry about that, Asuka," Kaji said, pulling into the parking lot complex of Misato's apartment. Of Shinji's apartment. Of Asuka's home.  
“别担心这个，明日香，”加持说着，驶入了美里公寓的停车场，也就是真嗣的公寓，明日香的家。

"Why not?" “为什么不呢？”

Kaji frowned, "Listen, Asuka, before I go. I just want to tell you something important."  
加持皱眉，"听着，明日香，在我走之前。我只想告诉你一些重要的事情。"

"What's that?" "什么事？"

Kaji leaned in closer to Asuka. At first, she thought he was going to whisper something in her ear, but his lips missed her ear and skidded across her cheek. She felt Kaji peck her check, only for blush to run scarlet up her face. Kaji pulled his face away, and said, delicately, "I need to tell you two things. Number one, if you love someone, please don't wait for them. Pursue it. Make sure that if you're in love you grab it with both hands and never let go. And number two, don't let anyone else tell you who you are. You are who you are. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But at the same time, never base your entire life on one thing. You are too good to have one function."  
加持凑近了明日香。起初，她以为他会附在她耳边低语些什么，但他的唇错过了她的耳朵，滑过了她的脸颊。她感觉到加持轻吻了她的脸颊，顿时，她的脸颊泛起了绯红。加持移开脸，温柔地说：“我有两件事要告诉你。第一，如果你爱一个人，请不要等待。去追求它。确保如果你爱上了，就要用双手紧紧抓住，永不放手。第二，不要让任何人告诉你你是谁。你就是你自己。不要让任何人说不是。但同时，永远不要将你的整个人生建立在一项事物上。你太优秀了，不应该只有一种功能。”

Asuka didn't know it as she let Kaji drive away that night that, for as long as she lived, she would never lay eyes on the one named Ryoji Kaji ever again.  
明日香不知道，就在那个夜晚，她让加持驾车离去时，她将永远不再见到那个名叫加持良治的人。

### Chapter 11

"Aren't you hungry?" “你不饿吗？”

"No. It tastes like crap."  
“不饿。这东西难吃死了。”

"What about TV?" "电视怎么办？"

"Nothing's on." "什么都没有。"

"Do you want to go shopping?"  
"你想去购物吗？"

"Don't need anything." "什么都不需要。"

"Don't worry about that sync ratio test. I mean, you were probably just not—"  
"别担心那个同步率测试。我是说，你可能只是没有——"

"Will you shut up?!" Asuka snarled at Shinji, rising to her feet, her eyes full of fury.  
"你能闭嘴吗？！" 明日香对真嗣咆哮道，站起身来，眼中充满了愤怒。

"Uh, sure. Okay…" Shinji said, pulling away anxiously as Asuka returned to her seat by the dinner table, throwing her head into her arms.  
"呃，好的。好吧……" 真嗣说着，焦虑地退开，明日香回到餐桌旁，将头埋进双臂中。

The previous three hours remained embedded in her mind's eye. She hadn't just dropped her sync ratio. It had plummeted, was destroyed. She was at the same level as that damn Toji! Toji, for God's sake! And why was that? She had no idea. She didn't understand why that had to be the case. Why she had fallen.  
过去的三个小时深深烙印在她的脑海中。她不仅仅是同步率下降了，而是直线暴跌，彻底崩溃。她现在和那个该死的东治一个水平了！东治，天哪！而为什么会这样？她毫无头绪。她不明白为什么会变成这样。为什么她会跌落。

No, she knew why. She knew exactly why she had failed. A lot was on her mind. Only three Angels left? The end in sight? Not possible. It could not happen to her! It just wasn't fair! It was like a person with cancer being told how many days she had left until she died. You know the end is in sight, and you dread it with all your heart. Well, that was exactly how it felt now, in this very situation. Her end was in sight. The end of her life, piloting, was in sight.  
不，她知道为什么。她非常清楚自己为何失败。她的思绪纷乱。只剩下三个使徒了？终点在望？不可能。这不能发生在她身上！这不公平！就像一个癌症患者被告知她还能活多少天一样。你知道终点近在眼前，你全心全意地害怕它。嗯，现在的情况正是如此。她的终点就在眼前。她作为驾驶员的生活的终点就在眼前。

"I'm just worried, you know," Shinji said, sitting down next to her, a concerned expression on his face.  
“我只是担心，你知道的，”真嗣说着，坐在她旁边，脸上带着关切的表情。

"Go away. Don't talk to me."  
"走开。别跟我说话。"

"Listen, please!" "请听我说！"

"What?!" "什么？！"

"You're killing yourself over this. Over piloting, aren't you?"  
"你这是在自寻死路。为了驾驶，对吧？"

"Oh, you're quite the observant one, aren't you? Why don't you right a damn book about how God damn observant you are? Why don't you go off and be observant with Rei and Toji and the rest of your damn friends? Why don't you—"  
"哦，你真是观察入微啊，不是吗？怎么不写本该死的书，讲讲你有多该死的观察力？怎么不和真嗣、飞鸟还有你那些该死的朋友一起去观察？你怎么不——"

"You're killing yourself over all of this!" Shinji cried.  
"你这是在自寻死路！" 真嗣哭喊道。"

"No I'm not." "不，我没有。"

"You haven't eaten properly for the last week. You almost look sick."  
"你这周都没好好吃饭，看起来都快病倒了。"

This was very true. She had lost weight. Her skin was pasty and pale. Just walking into the synchronization room, Ritsuko actually did a double take, her eyes in complete shock at how ill she looked. Maya had even asked if she was up to taking the test. Perhaps they'd say that Asuka's results were invalid because of how sick she looked. Well, she did feel sick. Very sick. Disgusting.  
这话一点不假。她瘦了不少，皮肤苍白无光。走进同步室时，律子甚至愣了一下，完全被她那副病态的样子震惊到了。玛雅还问她是否能应付测试。也许他们会因为她的病容而判定结果无效。嗯，她确实感觉不舒服，非常不舒服，甚至觉得恶心。

"Listen, just leave me alone," Asuka muttered, "Please, leave me alone."  
"听着，别管我了，"明日香低声说道，"求你了，让我一个人待着。"

""You're going into your shell."  
""你要缩回你的壳里了。""

"I don't have a damn shell. Just leave me—"  
"我没有该死的壳。只是让我——""

"I won't." "我不会的。"

Asuka glanced up at his determined eyes, how serious his expression was. How intense. Well, his passion was admirable. She'd give him that. Still, she found it funny how the longing she had had to touch him was, despite the pain she felt inside, even more intense. And yet she was held back from touching him, her body weighed down as though lead weights had been attached to her appendages.  
明日香抬头看着他坚定的眼神，他的表情是多么严肃。多么强烈。好吧，他的热情值得赞赏。她会承认这一点。尽管如此，她觉得有趣的是，尽管内心感到痛苦，她对触碰他的渴望却更加强烈。然而，她被阻止去触碰他，她的身体沉重得仿佛四肢被绑上了铅块。

"Listen, Asuka. You're tearing yourself up over this. I can't let you just kill yourself because of something so minor. Please! I don't want you to leave my life!"  
"听着，明日香。你因为这件事把自己搞得心力交瘁。我不能让你因为这么小的事情就自暴自弃。求你了！我不希望你离开我的生活！"

"What?" "什么？"

"I need you in my life. It's that simple. I don't want you to leave me!"  
"我需要你在我生活中。就这么简单。我不希望你离开我！""

"You don't want me to leave you?" Asuka repeated. As she did so, the image of a sobbing little girl crying "Don't leave me, mommy!" She grabbed her hair as she snarled, angrily, "Please shut up! Don't talk anymore!"  
"你不想让我离开你吗？" 明日香重复道。与此同时，一个哭泣的小女孩喊着"妈妈，别离开我！"的画面浮现在她脑海。她抓着头发咆哮着，愤怒地说："请闭嘴！别再说了！"

"Please, Asuka—" "求你了，明日香——"

"Just get the Hell out!"  
"滚出去！"

School wasn't much different either. She had joined her friends for lunch, sure, but made little to no effort to talk to them. With the exception of Hikari, in fact, none of them had been able to get a word. Although, Hikari was able to feed Asuka some of her lunch. She was the only one who Asuka would even willingly acknowledge, let alone talk to. Had it not been for Hikari, Asuka might have died of starvation.  
学校生活也没什么两样。她确实和朋友们一起吃了午饭，但几乎没怎么和他们说话。事实上，除了光之外，其他人连一句话都没能从她嘴里撬出来。不过，光倒是成功喂了明日香一些午餐。她是唯一一个明日香愿意主动回应，甚至与之交谈的人。要不是有光在，明日香可能早就饿死了。

"You're getting too thin, Asuka," Hikari said, anxiously, "I mean, you're a thin girl and all, but your cheekbones are starting to stick out."  
"你越来越瘦了，明日香，" 光子焦急地说，"我是说，你本来就瘦，但现在连颧骨都突出来了。"

"Do I look gaunt or something?"  
"我看起来很憔悴吗？"

"Not quite, no. But you might if you keep this up."  
"倒也不至于，但如果你继续这样下去，可能会的。"

"Figures." "意料之中。"

"Are you trying to become an anorexic?" Hikari asked, "Because if you are—"  
"你是在试图变成厌食症患者吗？" 光问，"因为如果你是的话——"

"No, it's just that nothing tastes good at all," Asuka replied, "It just tastes like sand in my mouth."  
"不，只是现在什么都尝不出味道，" 明日香回答，"吃起来就像嘴里含着沙子一样。"

"I see…" "我明白了…"

Aside from Shinji and Asuka, only Misato and Rei had tried to open Asuka up. Misato's attempts had simply been trying to take her aside and force her to eat. However, as of late, Asuka had noticed that Misato was more melancholy than usual. She was drinking coffee instead of beer. It wasn't uncommon to see her eyes red and puffy. Whatdid she have to cry about? Being separated from Kaji for a week or two? Well, he'd be back before Misato knew it.  
除了真嗣和明日香，只有美里和丽试图打开明日香的心扉。美里的尝试仅仅是试图把她拉到一边强迫她吃东西。然而，最近明日香注意到美里比平时更加忧郁。她喝的是咖啡而不是啤酒。看到她眼睛红肿并不罕见。她有什么好哭的呢？和加持分开一两周吗？好吧，他很快就会在美里意识到之前回来的。

Rei's approach was different. Appearing out of nowhere as Rei only could, she'd seek Asuka out, and follow her for an hour on end, attempting to talk in her hoarse, soft voice about inconsequential things. Occasionally, Asuka would respond with brief, short answers. Still, Rei didn't deserve such an offhand, indifferent treatment. Her heat was in the right place. It was just that Asuka really didn't care.  
丽的接近方式与众不同。她就像只有她能做到的那样，突然出现在阿斯卡身边，一连一个小时紧随其后，用她沙哑而轻柔的声音尝试谈论一些无关紧要的事情。偶尔，阿斯卡会简短地回应几句。然而，丽并不应受到如此漫不经心、漠不关心的对待。她的热情是真诚的，只是阿斯卡真的不在乎。

She really didn't care about anything, anymore.  
她真的对任何事情都不再关心了。

It was during another sync test, Asuka gaunt and weak, sickly, the taste of LCL nauseating, that the alarm sounded off.  
在一次同步测试中，阿斯卡憔悴而虚弱，病态尽显，LCL 的味道令人作呕，这时警报突然响起。

"Alright, we have confirmation of a new Angel," Misato informed the four pilots as they were taken out of their tests earlier than necessary, "The target is in space. We will have Shinji fire the Positron—"  
"好了，我们确认了一只新的使徒，" 美里通知四位驾驶员，他们被提前从测试中带出，"目标在太空中。我们将让真嗣发射阳电子炮——"

"Let me do it," Asuka snapped.  
"让我来吧，" 明日香厉声说道。

"What? Asuka…" Misato grumbled, tensely.  
"什么？明日香……" 美里紧张地咕哝道。

"I have to do it. I need to do it. I have to kill it. We don't have all too many chances left."  
"我必须这么做。我需要这么做。我必须消灭它。我们剩下的机会不多了。"

"What do you mean?" Misato asked, an eyebrow raised.  
"你是什么意思？" 美里问道，眉毛微微一挑。

"They're only three angels left, right?" Asuka asked, a little stunned.  
"只剩下三个使徒了，对吧？" 明日香有些震惊地问道。

"This is true," Rei replied, "Commander Ikari told me."  
"这是真的，" 绫波回答，"碇司令告诉我的。"

"So you mean we're almost done?" Misato cheered, pounding the air, "So the Angels are almost extinct?"  
"所以你是说我们快完成了？" 美里欢呼着，挥拳向空中，"那么使徒们快要灭绝了？"

"You aren't helping the situation," Asuka snarled, "That just means I have less chances to get this right. To finish these Angels once and for all. Let me kill this one!"  
"你这不是在帮忙，" 明日香咆哮道，"那只是意味着我成功的机会更少了。要彻底消灭这些使徒。让我干掉这一个！"

"Alright. If it means so much to you, do it. But have the others as backup."  
"好吧。如果这对你意义重大，那就去做吧。但要其他人作为后备。"

"Agreed." “同意。”

Asuka was on the surface with a Positron Rifle in hand about a minute later. The Angel drifted beyond her view, high into space. Even if there hadn't been a plethora of clouds in the way, Asuka wouldn't have seen it. Still, her rifle's aiming mechanism could see it. She aimed into the sky, followed by the digital crosshairs. This was one of her last chances to kill an Angel. Not only was it one of the last Angels, but with her performance lately, she knew that Ritsuko saw that she was useless. Her synch ratio was so low it was ridiculous. All she needed was one failure, and she'd be banned from piloting.  
一分钟后，明日香手持正电子步枪站在地面上。使徒已经飘离她的视线，高高升入太空。即便没有云层的遮挡，明日香也看不见它。然而，她的步枪瞄准系统却能捕捉到它的踪迹。她向天空瞄准，紧随着数字十字准线。这是她击杀使徒的最后机会之一。不仅因为这是仅存的使徒之一，而且她最近的表现让律子认为她已无用武之地。她的同步率低得可笑。只需一次失败，她就会被禁止驾驶。

There was a flash of light that illuminated the world around her. She heard the chorus of angels around her. At first, she felt nothing. However, a second passed, and she felt anxiety fill her entire body. She felt fear overtake her, terror, pain that was all consuming, as she felt drills of several assortments drilling straight through her skull and straight into her brain!  
一道闪光照亮了她周围的世界。她听到了天使们的合唱。起初，她什么感觉都没有。然而，一秒钟过去，她感到全身被焦虑填满。恐惧、恐怖、痛苦如潮水般涌来，仿佛各种钻头直穿头骨，直刺入她的大脑！

She screamed in undying agony as she grabbed her skull, crying in pain as weights slammed against her body. She saw images and voices explode in her head. She fired the rifle randomly, perhaps only for the sake to squeeze something, anything, as agony overtook her. She couldn't endure this psychotic pain.  
她尖叫着，痛苦永无止境，双手紧抓头骨，泪水与痛楚交织。脑海中影像与声音炸裂，她盲目地开枪，或许只是为了释放些什么，任何东西，当痛苦如潮水般淹没她。这疯狂的痛楚，她无法承受。

And then the world disappeared around her. She was dragged into a dark, endless abyss of bleak dark pain and suffering. She could hear her mother's voice whispering in her ears.  
随后，世界在她周围消逝。她被拖入一个黑暗、无尽的深渊，那里只有阴郁的痛苦与折磨。她能听到母亲的声音在耳边低语。

"Come die with me." “来与我同逝。”

And her own voice responding.  
而她自己的声音回应着。

"If that's what you want…just don't stop being my mother…"  
“如果那是你想要的……只是不要停止做我的母亲……”

A solitary doll hung by a noose, a never-ending noose that stretched up into oblivion. A flash of words and concepts repeatedly reappeared in her conscious mind, burning into her brain as the image of herself as a little girl crying. Sobbing. Why was she crying? She had sworn she would never cry, that she'd remain strong and unable to cry. Why was she being such a damn baby now?  
一个孤零零的玩偶被一根永无止境的绳索吊着，那绳索向上延伸至虚无。一连串的词句和概念在她清醒的意识中反复闪现，如同烙印般刻入她的脑海，伴随着她幼时哭泣的画面。抽泣着。她为何哭泣？她曾发誓永不哭泣，要坚强到无法流泪。为何现在她却像个该死的小孩一样哭泣？

And then the scene dissolved to show a doll with its head wrenched off as painfully as possibly, the stuffing spilled over the floor. "Why don't you like dolls?" she could hear a voice asking her.  
接着，场景消融，显现出一个被残忍扭断头部的玩偶，填充物散落一地。“你为什么不喜欢玩偶？”她能听到一个声音在问她。

She stamped down on the doll with her own foot, wanting the doll just disappear forever. Just to get it out of her life. "I don't need to play with dolls!" she cried, kicking the stuffing aside, as though that would make it disappear.  
她用脚狠狠踩在玩偶上，希望它永远消失。只想把它从生活中赶走。“我不需要玩偶！”她哭喊着，踢开那些填充物，仿佛这样就能让它消失。

And then everything dissolved again, only for her to see herself, smiling. She could see herself speaking things she had said in the past, again. And again. And again. And again. And again.  
然后一切再次消融，她看到自己，微笑着。她能看见自己在重复过去说过的话，一遍又一遍。一遍又一遍。一遍又一遍。一遍又一遍。一遍又一遍。

"Charmed, huh?" "被迷住了，嗯？"

"Are you stupid?" "你傻吗？"

"Now's my chance." "现在机会来了。"

"Look at me damn it! Look at me!"  
“看着我，该死的！看着我！”

Was this what people thought she was like? Was this what she was in their brains. She fell to her knees as her own face remained in the forefront of her vision, the same statements repeated over and over and over again. She screamed at the top of her lungs as the images remained embedded in her brain, unable to disappear despite how much she willed the image to vanish.  
这就是人们眼中的她吗？这就是他们在脑海中对她的印象吗？她跪倒在地，自己的面孔始终占据着她的视线，同样的陈述一遍又一遍地重复着。她用尽全力尖叫，但那些影像依旧深植于她的脑海，无论她多么希望它们消失，都无法消散。

And then it all disappeared. She was alone on a street, watching as many voiceless silhouettes, all like dolls, drifted against her, knocking her into oblivion. As she tumbled into the street, she could see only one face: Shinji.  
然后一切都消失了。她独自站在一条街上，看着许多无声的剪影，都像玩偶一般，从她身边飘过，将她撞入虚无。当她跌入街道时，她只能看到一张脸：真嗣。

Why the hell was he here?! Was it because that she loved him? That she wanted him? But did he want her? She was about to scream that he had never even touched her or held her, but it was only then that everything stopped exactly where it was.  
他到底为什么会在这里？！是因为她爱他吗？因为她想要他？但他想要她吗？她几乎要尖叫出来，他从未碰过她，也未曾拥抱过她，但就在那一刻，一切都戛然而止，静止不动。

"Wait a second…" "等一下……"

Shinji had touched her. The image of his face remained superimposed before her vision. She had been touched by Shinji. If anything, he had reached out more to her than she had to him. She had ignored him, hurt him, abused him. She didn't deserve to be touched if she was so cruel to him. She felt tears come to her eyes as Shinji's face disappeared.  
真嗣曾触碰过她。他的面容依旧在她眼前重叠。她被真嗣触碰过。如果说有什么，他对她的关心甚至超过了她对他的。她忽视他，伤害他，虐待他。如果她对他如此残忍，她就不配被触碰。当真嗣的面容消失时，她感到泪水涌上眼眶。

She was naked on the floor, in the middle of a jungle gym, as a new figure appeared. It looked like her, holding a little doll, as it stared down at her, with pity. Asuka glanced up, tears in her eyes, as she asked, weakly, "Just who are you?"  
她赤裸地躺在地板上，身处一个攀爬架的中央，这时一个新的身影出现了。它看起来像她，手里拿着一个小玩偶，带着怜悯的目光俯视着她。明日香抬头望去，眼中含泪，虚弱地问道：“你到底是谁？”

The girl smiled, "An Angel."  
女孩微笑着，“一个天使。”

"Why are you doing this to me?" Asuka asked, weakly, "Why do you enjoy hurting me like this?"  
“你为什么要这样对我？”明日香虚弱地问，“为什么你这么喜欢伤害我？”

"Why do you enjoy killing my brothers?"  
“你为何喜欢杀害我的兄弟？”

"Brothers?" “兄弟？”

The girl nodded. "My big brothers came here one by one, and you attacked first. You attacked first, so my last two made the first strike. And then you killed them."  
女孩点点头。“我的哥哥们一个接一个来到这里，而你总是先动手。你先动手，所以我的最后两个哥哥才先发制人。然后你就杀了他们。”

"So are you doing this to punish me?"  
"所以你这么做是为了惩罚我吗？"

"No, just to see why you do what you do. You are a sad individual."  
“不，只是想看看你为何如此行事。你真是个悲哀的人。”

"What?" "什么？"

"You have lived in misery all your life. You can only survive by hurting us and killing us."  
"你一生都活在痛苦中。你只能通过伤害我们和杀害我们来生存。"

"But I'm saving the world!"  
“但我是在拯救世界！”

"You're doing it for selfish reasons. You are only doing it to preserve your own self-image. Without it, you'd fall apart. If I wanted to, I could destroy your mind and make you a vegetable. If I wanted to, anyway. Then Kaworu would rise and avenge us."  
“你这么做是出于自私的理由。你只是为了维护自己的形象。没有它，你会崩溃。如果我想，我可以摧毁你的心智，让你变成植物人。如果我想的话。然后，薰会崛起并为我们复仇。”

"Who's Kaworu?" “薰是谁？”

"Your humans will call him Tabris, just as you humans will label me with the name Arael."  
"你们人类会称他为塔布里斯，正如你们人类会用阿雷尔这个名字来称呼我。"

"Please don't. Please don't kill me."  
"请不要。请不要杀我。"

"Yes, but on a single condition."  
"是的，但有一个条件。"

"What?" "什么？"

"You allow me to occupy your shell. I will offer you power enough to defend your race when the time comes. Your greatest challenge will not be against an Angel, but against your fellow Lilim."  
"你允许我占据你的躯壳。届时，我将赋予你足够的力量，以保卫你的种族。你最大的挑战并非来自天使，而是你的同类利利姆。"

"Lilim? Power? Alright. As long as you let me be me and stop this nightmare!"  
"利利姆？力量？好吧。只要你让我保持自我，结束这场噩梦！"

"Don't worry. If anything, your piloting skills will become perfect."  
"别担心。如果有什么，你的驾驶技术将会变得完美无缺。"

The world dissolved around her again. She plummeted through darkness, hearing a voice in her ear.  
世界再次在她周围消融。她坠入黑暗，耳边传来一个声音。

"The Lance of Longinus has missed the target. Target…self-destrcuted?"  
"朗基努斯之枪未能命中目标。目标……自我毁灭了？"

"Was it Asuka?" "是明日香吗？"

"Her Synch Ratio is…99.9!?"  
"她的同步率是……99.9%！？"

"This doesn't make sense!"  
“这说不通！”

As reality returned around Asuka, her true eyes fluttered shut as the darkness of unconsciousness overtook her.  
随着现实感在明日香周围回归，她的真目缓缓闭合，无意识的黑幕笼罩了她。

### Chapter 12

Slowly, light filled Asuka's vision. Blinding light from an open window. She blinked, slowly forcing the blue hue burned into her retina into submission. She could see a ceiling, a tiled one, rather unfamiliar to her. The moment after adjusting to the mild surprise that she was not actually in her own bed, she noticed something else. A massive vase filled with yellow roses.  
慢慢地，光线充满了明日香的眼界。来自一扇敞开的窗户的刺眼光芒。她眨了眨眼，缓缓地将烙印在她视网膜上的蓝色光影压制下去。她能看到天花板，一个瓷砖铺成的，对她来说颇为陌生。在适应了轻微的惊讶——她并非真的躺在自己的床上——之后，她注意到了别的东西。一个巨大的花瓶里插满了黄玫瑰。

"Roses?" “玫瑰？”

"They're supposed to represent friendship. At least, that's what Hikari said when she and Rei sent them."  
“它们代表着友谊。至少，这是光和丽送来时说的。”

"Rei sent roses? Now that's strange…"  
"丽送了玫瑰？这可真奇怪……"

Asuka glanced over to her left side. Leaning in a chair was Shinji. His eyes were filled with relief. Had he been waiting for her? Well, if he had, he hadn't been alone. Next to him was Hikari, whose expression was also relieved. Joyous, almost, at seeing her friend return to consciousness. Beside her was Rei, who was placing the same light novel that Asuka had given her before into her bag. Even Toji was there, although he was standing behind Hikari with his hands on her shoulders.  
明日香瞥向左侧。椅子上倚着的是真嗣，他的眼中满是释然。他一直在等她吗？嗯，即便如此，他并非独自一人。他旁边是光，她的表情同样松了口气，几乎可以说是欣喜，看到朋友恢复意识。她旁边是丽，正将明日香之前送给她的轻小说放入包中。就连剑介也在，尽管他站在光身后，双手搭在她的肩上。

"Why are you guys here?" Asuka asked, weakly.  
“你们怎么在这儿？”明日香虚弱地问道。

"We've been worried," Hikari replied, "The doctor said that your body gave out from fatigue. You haven't been eating nearly enough, he said. You couldn't take the stress from whatever happened to you in that Eva."  
“我们很担心，”光回答，“医生说你是因为疲劳过度身体撑不住了。他说你吃得不够，承受不了那台 EVA 给你带来的压力。”

"Was that it?" Asuka replied, her head slumping down on her soft pillow.  
“就这样吗？”明日香回答道，头无力地垂在柔软的枕头上。

"What did happen there?" Rei asked, curiously.  
“那里到底发生了什么？”绫波问道，带着好奇。

Asuka recalled what had happened. She had had that horrific nightmarish hallucination. She felt filthy, violated. It was almost as though she had been raped, only rather than her body being intruded it had been the sanctuary of her very mind. And then she had seen Shinji's face, and the pain had sort of dissolved. It had sort of just fizzled out. She had still been miserable, yes, but it had sort of fallen and subsided into a weak sensation as opposed to an all consuming one. And then Arael had spoken to her, and had merged with her.  
明日香回想起发生的事情。她经历了那个可怕的噩梦般的幻觉。她感到肮脏，被侵犯。仿佛她被强奸了，只是入侵的不是她的身体，而是她心灵的圣所。然后她看到了真嗣的脸，痛苦似乎消散了。它几乎只是噼啪一声消失了。她仍然很痛苦，是的，但它已经减弱，变成了一种微弱的感受，而不是那种吞噬一切的感觉。然后亚拉尔对她说话，并与她融合了。

Was that all just a dream?  
那一切只是一场梦吗？

"Not certain," Asuka replied, "I don't know what was real and what wasn't."  
"不确定，"明日香回答，"我不知道哪些是真实的，哪些不是。"

"Ritsuko mentioned something about having the angel intruding your mind," Toji replied, "Trying to understand your thought process or something to that effect."  
“律子提到过天使侵入了你的意识，”冬二回答，“试图理解你的思维过程，或者类似的意思。”

"So that part was real," Asuka mumbled, running a hand through her hair.  
“那部分是真的，”明日香喃喃自语，用手梳理着头发。

"What happened?" Hikari asked.  
“发生了什么？” 光问。

Funny. For all the times she loved to hog the spotlight, now was a moment in her life where she wished everyone would just leave her alone. Irony in its greatest form. She had to just sort her own thoughts out for herself. And yet she couldn't bear to be alone. She needed someone, anyone, to talk to and communicate with. She needed to see them for herself.  
真讽刺。尽管她曾无数次喜欢占据聚光灯下，现在却是她希望所有人都离她远去的一刻。这真是最大的讽刺。她必须自己整理思绪。然而她又无法忍受孤独。她需要有人，任何人，来交谈和沟通。她需要亲眼见到他们。

"Well, it was a nightmare," Asuka mumbled, gently, "Everything horrible about myself, I saw just placed out there on the table. Every horrible thing I've done, every horrible thing done to me, around me, and by the end it was just so unbearable."  
"唉，那真是一场噩梦，" 明日香喃喃道，语气轻柔，"所有关于我自己的可怕事情，我都看到了，就那样摊在桌面上。我所做的每一件可怕的事，我经历的每一件可怕的事，我周围的每一件可怕的事，到最后，简直让人无法忍受。"

"Did you even see—" Hikari began, only to be cut off by Asuka again.  
“你到底有没有看到——”光子刚开口，又被明日香打断了。

"Yes, I saw the whole thing with my mother."  
"是的，我看到了我和母亲的那一幕。"

"What whole thing with—" Toji began, only for Hikari to shoot him a dirty look that shut him up.  
"整个那件事——" 冬二刚开口，就被光希一个凶狠的眼神给堵住了嘴。

Asuka felt tears rush to her eyes. Why was she being so weak? Why couldn't she just muster enough strength to just tell a damn story? Why did it feel so good just to cry and let it all out? Why did it feel right when she was sobbing and showing the world exactly how she felt? She had been strong her entire life. Had that been restraining her? Holding in her emotions like chains binding Prometheus to his prison?  
明日香感到泪水涌上眼眶。为什么她会如此软弱？为什么她就是无法鼓起足够的勇气来讲述一个该死的故事？为什么哭泣和发泄出来会感觉如此之好？为什么在她抽泣着向世界展示自己真实感受时会感觉如此正确？她一生都很坚强。难道这束缚了她？压抑着她的情感，就像锁链将普罗米修斯束缚在他的牢狱中？

"After that," Asuka went on, "The Angel appeared in my vision. Arael, I think he or she or whatever it was said its name was. He told me about someone named Kaworu."  
"在那之后，"明日香继续说道，"天使出现在我的幻象中。阿拉尔，我想它或他或无论那是什么，它自称的名字。他告诉我关于一个名叫渚薰的人。"

"Same name that the Angel in Unit-03 mentioned," Toji mumbled.  
"和初号机里的那位天使提到的名字一样。" 真嗣喃喃道。

"Said that it just wanted to see why I killed the other Angels," Asuka continued, brushing tears aside, "So it had looked through my memories and made me suffer."  
"它说只是想看看我为什么杀死了其他天使，" 明日香继续说道，擦去泪水，"所以它浏览了我的记忆，让我痛苦不堪。"

"Bastard," Hikari mumbled.  
"混蛋，" 美里喃喃道。

"But he said he f-felt b-b-bad for me," Asuka continued, starting to stutter in her sobbing, "Said he pitied me. He told me that he should of just d-d-d-deleted my mi-mind or something so Kaworu would r-rise. But he said that he-he-he wa-wanted to…to…"  
"但他說他對我感到難過，" 明日香繼續說道，哭泣中開始結巴，"他說他同情我。他告訴我，他應該直接刪除我的記憶什麼的，這樣渚薰就能復活。但他說他...他...他想要...想要..."

Asuka paused a moment for the tears to run their course. She now had no real reason to cry. Arael had granted her power. Granted her strength beyond even Shinji. Surely that was nothing to cry about. And yet, if Asuka said that she had an Angel living inside of her, wouldn't they report her to Ritsuko? Have the Angel removed? Well, she couldn't allow that. She'd lose her power if that happened.  
明日香停顿片刻，任泪水流淌。如今她已没有真正哭泣的理由。亚拉尔赋予了她力量，赋予了她超越真嗣的强大。这当然不值得落泪。然而，若明日香坦言体内寄宿着天使，他们会不会向律子报告？要求将天使移除？不，她绝不能允许这种事发生。那样她将失去这份力量。

"What did he say?" Hikari asked, worried.  
"他說了什麼？" 美里擔心地問道。

"I don't remember," Asuka mumbled, "All I do know is that I didn't like it, I struggled against him, and I actually reversed his power back on him."  
"我不记得了，" 明日香咕哝道，"我只知道我不喜欢那样，我反抗了他，甚至将他的力量反噬回他自己身上。"

"That's pretty intense!" Toji applauded, "Well, that shows that bastard whose boss, huh?"  
"那真是激烈啊！" 冬二鼓掌道，"哼，这就告诉那混蛋谁才是老大，对吧？"

"Yeah, but I had this feeling come over me that he knew something I didn't. Involving something called Lilim. Whatever they are."  
“是啊，但我有种感觉，他知道一些我不知道的事。涉及到一个叫莉莉姆的东西。不管它们是什么。”

"Well, once this Kaworu guy shows up, we'll have to figure it out," Toji said.  
“好吧，一旦这个叫渚薰的家伙出现，我们就得想办法应对，” 真嗣说。

"Something about the last enemy we'd need to fight being a Lilim. I don't get what a Lilim is, though."  
“关于我们最后需要对抗的敌人是一个莉莉姆。我不太明白莉莉姆是什么。”

"We'll find out," Shinji sighed.  
“我们会弄清楚的，” 真嗣叹了口气。

It took a few days for Asuka to be let go of the hospital. In that short amount of time, she had recovered greatly. The doctors had suggested that she went to an anorexic rehabilitation center, but she had insisted that she had no intension of being anorexic and that she had lost a lot of weigh related to stress, not some obsessive desire to be skinny. Still, she might as well had gone to a rehabilitation center because Misato put her on a brief diet that involved her eating foods high in starch until her weight stabilized at her ordinary level.  
过了几天，医院才同意让明日香出院。在这短短的时间里，她的恢复情况非常显著。医生建议她去厌食症康复中心，但她坚持说自己并无厌食倾向，体重下降是因为压力而非对瘦身的偏执追求。尽管如此，她其实和去了康复中心没两样，因为美里让她进行了一段时间的饮食控制，让她大量摄入淀粉类食物，直到体重稳定在正常水平。

"But what if I get fat?" Asuka complained as Shinji handed her a bowl of rice.  
“但如果我变胖了怎么办？”明日香抱怨道，此时真嗣递给她一碗米饭。

"You won't," Misato said, "This is a temporary thing. You're eating habits are too well developed to change over the course of a week or two."  
“不会的，”美里说，“这只是暂时的。你的饮食习惯已经根深蒂固，不可能在一两周内改变。”

This was true. Asuka returned to her original weight in a matter of days. The moment the diet was dropped, Asuka immediately returned to her ordinary habits, finding no difficulty in doing so. She was grateful for that much.  
这是真的。短短几天内，明日香就恢复了原来的体重。一旦停止节食，明日香立刻回归了平常的习惯，对此毫无困难。她对此心存感激。

However, she did notice that Shinji was catering to her more. Sure, during the entire diet thing this made sense. However, after it had ended, it didn't make sense that Shinji would ask her how she felt more frequently than usual, pay extra attention to her when she was watching television, or even why he'd make sure she slept comfortably! Sure, she wasn't really complaining, as the extra pampering was incredibly pleasurable, but it didn't make sense to her.  
然而，她确实注意到真嗣对她更加照顾了。当然，在整个节食期间，这还可以理解。但节食结束后，真嗣频繁询问她的感受、在她看电视时格外关注她，甚至确保她睡得舒适，这些行为就让她感到不解了。虽然额外的宠爱让她非常享受，但这在她看来并不合理。

No, it did make sense.  
不，这确实有道理。

He loved her. 他爱她。

"Hey, Shinji?" Asuka asked one night as Misato left to handle important business, "Did I ever tell you about my mother?"  
“嘿，真嗣？” 某晚，当美里出门处理重要事务时，明日香问道，“我有没有跟你提起过我妈妈的事？”

"Your mother?" Shinji asked, raising an eyebrow, "No, you never did mention it."  
"你母亲？" 真嗣问道，扬起眉毛，"不，你从未提过。"

Asuka sighed, "Yeah, that's right. Never told you. Just Hikari and Rei."  
明日香叹了口气，"是啊，没错。从未告诉过你。只有光和丽。"

"You mentioned you didn't like your stepmom though. Sometime in the past."  
"但你提过不喜欢你的继母。过去某个时候。"

"It's not that simple. I just don't think she's like my mom. I mean, it's not that I don't like her, she's just sort of there."  
“没那么简单。我只是觉得她不像我妈。我的意思是，并不是我不喜欢她，她就是那么存在感不强。”

"I think I can understand."  
“我想我能理解。”

Could he? Did he ever have a stepmom? She knew his mother had died years ago, but clearly his father hadn't pursued any other relationship. If he had a feminine touch his life, maybe Commander Ikari wouldn't be such a damn stiff. Still, regardless, the fact remained that he didn't have a clue just how she felt.  
他能吗？他有过继母吗？她知道他的母亲多年前就去世了，但显然他的父亲并没有追求任何其他关系。如果他的生活中有女性的温柔，也许碇司令就不会那么死板了。不过，无论如何，事实是他根本不知道她的感受。

Although, she hoped, by the end of their little conversation, he would.  
虽然，她希望，在他们简短的交谈结束时，他会。

"Listen, my mother, she was involved with work on Eva Unit-02 when they were working on something important to it. They never told me. I was too little to understand."  
"听着，我母亲，她在他们为 Eva 二号机做重要工作时参与其中。他们从未告诉我。我当时太小，无法理解。"

"Really?" Shinji asked, somewhat surprised.  
“真的吗？” 真嗣问道，有些惊讶。

"Yeah. All I know is that when she returned, she was different. She had lost her mind. I was told later that she had started regretting her life up until that point or something. I'm not sure. All I know is that I had been replaced by a doll."  
"是啊。我只知道她回来后，整个人都变了。她疯了。后来我听说她开始后悔之前的生活，或者什么的。我不太确定。我只知道我被一个玩偶取代了。"

"A doll?" "一个玩偶？"

"She thought the doll was me."  
"她以为那个玩偶是我。"

"But that doesn't make sense."  
“但这说不通。”

"Well, it doesn't need to. Imagine spending every day staring at your mother through a sheet of glass, watching her stroking a doll while you watched, speaking to it like it were you. Imagine seeing the woman who raised you and gave birth to you losing her mind in front of your eyes and all you can do is watch. As it all progressed, I remember her saying that she wanted to die. I remember hearing it for months, years, watching the two of them in that room while my father made love to her damn nurse in the other room."  
“好吧，它不需要说得通。想象一下，每天透过一块玻璃凝视着你的母亲，看着她抚摸一个玩偶，仿佛那就是你，对她说话。想象一下，亲眼目睹抚养你、生下你的女人在你面前精神崩溃，而你只能旁观。随着这一切的进展，我记得她说过她想死。我记得几个月、几年地听着这些话，看着她们在那房间里，而我父亲却在另一个房间和她的该死的护士做爱。”

Shinji's eyes were wide, mortified even, but Asuka had not finished her story. "Then, one day, I received the news of a lifetime. I was chosen to be an Eva pilot. It was so amazing that I ran all the way home, excited and joyous. So happy. She had been sent home because the doctors thought she was improving. I thought maybe she'd be able to recognize me for who I was and recognize what was happening. I was laughing so hard when I opened the door to my house. My mother…my mother…she was there, just sort of…hanging from the ceiling. Her body was just rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Just there. In a noose. And next to her was the doll that she thought was me."  
真嗣的眼睛瞪得大大的，甚至有些惊恐，但明日香的故事还未讲完。“后来，有一天，我收到了一生中最重大的消息。我被选为 Eva 驾驶员。那感觉太不可思议了，我一路跑回家，兴奋又快乐。如此幸福。她被送回家是因为医生认为她有所好转。我以为她或许能认出我是谁，能明白正在发生的事。我打开家门时笑得那么开心。我的母亲……我的母亲……她就那样……挂在天花板上。她的身体像钟摆一样前后摇晃。就那样。在绳套里。而她旁边，是那个她以为是我的娃娃。”

Shinji's face was white, his eyes wide and his mouth distressed. Asuka couldn't look at him, so rather she looked at her white knuckles as they clenched into fists on the table. "She had wanted to die. And she wanted me to die with her. Do you know how it feels to know that your own mother wanted to kill you? And not only to kill you, but to kill herself with you? I couldn't endure it. I thought that I was worthless and powerless. But I never cried. I never cried when they put her in the grave. I could only stare on, helplessly. I didn't cry. I couldn't cry."  
真嗣的脸色苍白，双眼圆睁，嘴角流露出痛苦。明日香无法直视他，于是转而盯着自己紧握成拳、指节发白的双手。“她曾想死。她还想让我陪她一起死。你知道那种感觉吗？知道自己的母亲想要杀死你是什么感觉？不仅是要杀你，还要与你同归于尽？我无法承受。我觉得自己毫无价值，软弱无力。但我从未哭泣。他们把她下葬时，我也没有哭。我只能无助地凝视着。我没有哭。我哭不出来。”

Tears slid down the bridge of her nose as her eyes scrunched up, her mouth contorting as she began to sob silently, "I kn-kn-knew that I-I coul-couldn't cry. I had to b-b-b-be strong fo-for her. S-s-s-so she would acknowledge me, an-an-and not j-j-just want me to—"  
泪水顺着她的鼻梁滑落，双眼紧闭，嘴角扭曲，她开始无声地啜泣，“我知-知-知道我-我不能哭。我必须坚-坚-坚强，为了她。这样她才会认可我，而-而-不仅仅希望我——”

Asuka felt arms wrap around her body as Shinji held her close to his body. She felt warmth fill her as tears that had been held back for an eternity spilled out of her body all in one gigantic tidal wave. She wondered how stupid she looked in the back of her head, knowing that only a weak baby would cry as she was crying now. She knew in her heart that she couldn't cry for Shinji now. And yet, no matter how hard she tried to hold the tears back, she refused to stop. She needed to get it all out. She knew that she needed to expose the scars that, for all her life, she had denied even existed.  
明日香感到手臂环绕在她的身体上，真嗣紧紧抱住她。她感到一股暖流涌入心间，那些被压抑了永恒的泪水，如巨大的海啸般倾泻而出。她在心底暗自思忖，自己此刻的样子一定很愚蠢，只有脆弱的婴儿才会像她现在这样哭泣。她深知，此刻不能在真嗣面前流泪。然而，无论她如何努力抑制泪水，却始终无法停止。她需要释放这一切。她明白，她必须揭开那些一生中始终否认存在的伤疤。

"You don't need to hide it, Asuka," Shinji replied, "I don't think you'll believe me, but I know exactly how you feel."  
“你不必隐藏，明日香，”真嗣回答，“我知道你可能不会相信，但我完全理解你的感受。”

"Do you?" “是吗？”

"Yes. My mother died and my father rejected me. I was left right there in the middle of the street."  
"是的。我母亲去世了，父亲又抛弃了我。我就那样被丢弃在街中央。"

"But you didn't hold in the pain like I did."  
“但你没有像我那样忍住疼痛。”

"I just let it consume me. But you resisted it, right? You're such a strong person."  
"我只是任由它吞噬我。但你抵抗了，对吧？你真是个坚强的人。"

"Stubborn." "倔强。"

"Maybe, but you didn't complain about being in pain. You endured it for years, silently. I just carried on about it."  
"或许吧，但你从未抱怨过疼痛。你默默忍受了多年。我只是继续坚持罢了。"

"I'm not strong. That memory has consumed me for years. I didn't believe it did, but it was like a cancer or a virus. I thought I was stronger than it, but I just couldn't hold it in forever. I was just in denial."  
“我并不坚强。那段记忆多年来一直吞噬着我。我曾以为自己能战胜它，但它就像癌症或病毒一样。我以为自己比它更强大，但我终究无法永远压抑它。我只是不愿承认罢了。”

"But you—" "但你——"

"It was a damn façade, you idiot! I'm not strong at all, don't you get it?" How stupid was this idiot? Was he trying to make her feel better? Maybe he understood, but how could he ever tell her that she was strong? That all these years, her inability to admit that she was crying on the inside was strength? That she wasn't just a pile of cards, fascinating at first glance, waiting to tumble down? Didn't she see that she had damned herself the moment she said, years ago, that she'd never cry again? Didn't he get that? Well, didn't he?!  
"这不过是个该死的假象，你这个白痴！我根本不坚强，你还不明白吗？" 这个白痴到底有多蠢？他是想让她感觉好点吗？也许他懂了，但他怎么能告诉她她很坚强呢？这些年来，她无法承认内心哭泣的事实，这不就是一种坚强吗？她不只是乍看之下迷人的一叠卡片，随时准备倒塌？难道她没意识到，多年前她说过再也不会哭的那一刻，就已经把自己推向了绝境吗？他难道不明白吗？好吧，他难道不明白吗？！

"You never complained." "你从未抱怨过。"

"What?" "什么？"

"You never complained. Even if it was a façade, it took strength to keep it up all the time. I've only seen you cry a couple of times, like in your sleep."  
"你从未抱怨过。即便那只是个假象，始终维持它也需要极大的毅力。我只见过你哭过几次，就像在睡梦中那样。"

"In my sleep? What do you mean?"  
"在睡梦中？你是什么意思？"

"Remember when we had that synchronized attack?"  
"记得我们那次同步攻击吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"You came into my bed."  
"你爬上了我的床。"

"Oh! That?" "哦！那个啊？"

"Yeah. I think I mentioned it—"  
"是啊。我想我提过——"

"When you tried to kiss me?"  
"当你试图吻我的时候？"

"Uh…" Shinji clearly expected Asuka to slug him across the face, but, at this point in time, Asuka felt so drained of energy she could barely more her arms except to wrap them around Shinji's waist.  
"呃…" 真嗣显然以为明日香会一拳打在他脸上，但此时此刻，明日香感到如此筋疲力尽，她几乎无法移动双臂，除了将它们环绕在真嗣的腰间。

"Don't worry. I'll beat you up later."  
"别担心。我晚点再揍你。"

"Thank God." "谢天谢地。"

"You're not off the hook."  
"你还没脱身呢。"

"Well, when you were sleeping, you started to cry and mutter 'mama'."  
"嗯，你睡觉的时候，开始哭了，还嘟囔着'妈妈'。"

So even Shinji knew something was wrong with her. Asuka sighed. Was her façade that weak and fragile?  
所以连真嗣也察觉到她有些不对劲。明日香叹了口气。难道她的伪装就那么脆弱吗？

"I thought you were just being childish at first, but I had no idea that was what had happened. I wish there was something I could do to help you."  
"起初我以为你只是在耍小孩子脾气，但我没想到事情会是那样。我希望我能做些什么来帮你。"

"There is one thing." "有一件事。"

"What's that?" "什么事？"

Shinji stared down at Asuka as she pressed her cheek against Shinji's chest, tears staining his buttoned down shirt. "Don't leave me. Please don't let me go. Don't hurt me. And don't ever, ever, end your life."  
真嗣低头看着明日香，她将脸颊贴在他的胸口，泪水浸湿了他扣好的衬衫。“不要离开我。请不要让我走。不要伤害我。永远，永远，不要结束你的生命。”

Shinji was silent for a moment before saying, "I can do that."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后说道：“我可以做到。”

"Good." “好。”

Upon returning to school, Asuka confessed to Hikari that she had told Shinji everything about her mother.  
回到学校后，明日香向光坦白，她已经把关于她母亲的一切都告诉了真嗣。

"Should I tell Toji too?" Hikari asked, stunned that she had actually confessed the matter willingly to someone else.  
"我也要告诉冬二吗？" 光问道，惊讶于自己竟然主动向他人坦白了这件事。

"You can if you want," Asuka replied, "It won't bother me at all."  
"你想的话可以，"明日香回答，"我完全不会介意。"

"But why did you tell him?" Hikari asked.  
"但你为什么告诉他？"光问道。

"Had to tell someone. I couldn't keep it in anymore."  
“得告诉某个人。我再也憋不住了。”

"I guess that makes sense," Hikari said, "But shouldn't you tell it to the psychologist too?"  
“我想这说得通，”光说，“但你不是也应该告诉心理医生吗？”

Asuka had almost forgotten all about her. She nodded her head, acknowledging Hikari's point. "I guess I should."  
明日香几乎把这事忘得一干二净。她点点头，认同了光的说法。“我想我应该去。”

That night, Misato drove her to the psychologist's office. Asuka stared at her as her eyes stared determinedly straight ahead, at the dark, nearly vacant highway. Asuka remained in silence for an extended period before Misato said, softly, "You told Shinji, didn't you?"  
"那晚，美里开车带她去心理医生的办公室。明日香盯着她，只见她的眼睛坚定地直视前方，望着那条黑暗且几乎空无一人的高速公路。明日香沉默良久，美里才轻声问道：“你告诉真嗣了，对吧？””

"Was it obvious?" “很明显吗？”

"Yes. I heard you." “是的。我听到了。”

"I thought you had left for business."  
"我以为你出差去了。"

"I did, but I also had a camera installed in the room. You won't find it. It's hidden."  
"我是去了，但我还在房间里装了个摄像头。你找不到的，它藏得很隐蔽。"

"No privacy." "一点隐私都没有。"

"I'm the only one who saw," Misato said, smiling, "Would you rather Ritsuko see it as well?"  
"只有我一个人看到了，"美里笑着说，"你希望律子也看到吗？"

"No."

"Thought so. Well, don't worry. I just need to ask you a question."  
"果然如此。好吧，别担心。我只需要问你一个问题。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Did it feel good to tell him?"  
"告诉他感觉好吗？"

Asuka nodded. "I'm not going to lie. It really did."  
明日香点点头。“我不打算撒谎。确实如此。”

"That's good. You're too young to have such a weight on your shoulders alone. You don't need to face it all alone."  
“那很好。你还太年轻，不该独自承担这么重的负担。你不需要一个人面对这一切。”

Eventually, they pulled into the psychologist's office. In a matter of minutes, Asuka was in the office of Dr. Tamako, who was smiling. "You look healthier than you did last visit."  
最终，他们驶入了心理医生的办公室。没过几分钟，明日香就坐在了田子博士的办公室里，博士正微笑着。“你看起来比上次来访时健康多了。”

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

"Well, before you say anything, I heard about your last Angel attack."  
"好吧，在你开口之前，我听说了你上次对抗天使的事。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"About the attack on your mind."  
"关于那次对你心灵的攻击。"

"That saves me time." "这倒是省了我不少时间。"

"No, it didn't. Do you want to explain what happened? Say it in your own words."  
"不，没有。你想解释一下发生了什么吗？用自己的话来说。"

Asuka repeated the same story she had told the others. At the end of it, Dr. Tamako nodded slowly. "Well, Asuka, I have to say that last part, where you repelled the Angel off of you, that was untrue."  
明日香重复了一遍她对其他人讲过的故事。到最后，环子博士缓缓点头。“嗯，明日香，我得说，你最后那部分，关于你击退使徒的情节，那是不真实的。”

"What?" Asuka stammered, her eyes wide and shocked. How the hell did she know that she had lied about the end? Was it some sort of superpower psychologists had? Or was she bluffing?  
"什么？" 明日香结巴道，眼睛瞪得大大的，震惊不已。她到底是怎么知道自己对结局撒了谎的？是某种心理学家特有的超能力吗？还是她在虚张声势？

"It's my job to see how your mind works. I can tell when you're lying. I'll tell you what. I'll play a little game with you. I'll flip a coin. Heads, you tell me another version, and tails, I believe your tale. Fair enough?"  
"我的工作就是了解你的思维方式。我能察觉到你何时撒谎。这样吧，我和你玩个小游戏。我抛硬币，正面的话，你告诉我另一个版本，反面的话，我就相信你的故事。公平吧？"

"Are you sworn to secrecy?" Asuka asked.  
"你发誓保密吗？" 明日香问道。"

"No one will ever hear what you said."  
"你所说的话，绝不会有人听到。"

"No cameras?" "没有摄像机？"

"None." "一个也没有。"

"Alright. I'll tell you the truth."  
"好吧。我会告诉你真相。"

"Good. It was a trick coin anyway."  
“好。反正那是个魔术硬币。”

"The Angel told me that he wanted to help me, and he entered my body in order to allow me to master the powers of the Eva."  
"天使告诉我，他想要帮助我，并进入了我的身体，以便让我掌握 Eva 的力量。"

"I had a feeling that was the case," Dr. Tamako said, honestly, "Why else would he appear in front of you? If he could delete your mind, why not do it from the start?"  
"我也有这种感觉，""田子博士诚实地回答，""他为何会出现在你面前？如果他能删除你的意识，为何不从一开始就这么做？"

"So what do I do?"  
"那我该怎么办？"

"I'd like to talk to this Arael," Dr. Tamako replied, "Can you summon it for me?"  
"我想和这个亚雷尔谈谈，" 塔摩博士回答，"你能召唤它吗？"

"But how do you expect me to do that?"  
"但你指望我怎么做到呢？"

"Hypnosis." "催眠术。"

"Hypnosis?" "催眠术？"

"Yeah. Maybe if we bring him out, we can find out more about these Lilim."  
"是啊。也许如果我们把他带出来，就能了解更多关于这些莉莉姆的信息。"

Asuka bit her lip. She wanted to know what Arael had talked about. But what if he took over and didn't let her reassume control? What if he tried to overtake her again? To mind rape her again? Well, then again, what if she turned into an Angel herself? Still, her curiosity outweighed her fears.  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇。她想知道亚拉尔谈了些什么。但如果他接管了身体，不让她重新掌控怎么办？如果他再次试图夺取她的意识，再次对她进行心灵强奸怎么办？不过，话说回来，如果她自己变成了使徒怎么办？尽管如此，她的好奇心还是战胜了恐惧。

"Alright. I'll do it." “好吧，我愿意试试。”

The process went along smoothly. In a matter of minutes, Dr. Tamako had sent her into a trance. It felt comfortable, as though she were asleep. The rest of the world seemed to blend into an array of colors as she slept silently, quietly, before being snapped back into reality in what felt like a minute later.  
整个过程进行得很顺利。几分钟内，玉子博士就让她进入了催眠状态。感觉很舒适，就像睡着了一样。她静静地、无声地沉睡，周围的世界似乎融入了五彩斑斓的色彩中，直到感觉像一分钟后，她突然被拉回了现实。

"What happened?" "发生了什么？"

"Well, you've been under hypnosis for about half hour."  
"嗯，你已经被催眠大约半小时了。"

"Felt faster than that." "感觉比那更快。"

"Always does." "总是这样。"

"What did you figure out?"  
"你发现了什么？"

Dr. Tamako frowned. "Precious little. He mentioned that the next Angel's arrival was immanent, and that it will try to assimilate with another pilot, much like how Arael assimilated with you, in order to ward off the threat of these Lilim. However, he's afraid this pilot might be less likely to allow assimilation."  
塔摩医生皱了皱眉。“宝贵的信息不多。他提到下一个使徒即将到来，并且会试图与其他驾驶员融合，就像阿雷尔与你融合那样，以抵御这些莉莉姆的威胁。但他担心这位驾驶员可能不太愿意接受融合。”

"Who is the target?" Asuka asked, nervously.  
"目标是谁？" 明日香紧张地问道。

"The target, he said, is Rei Ayanami."  
"他说，目标是绫波丽。"

### Chapter 13

Rei Ayanami remained on her seat, patiently awaiting something, whatever that something was. She was still reading that same light novel that Asuka had given her, which she found rather spectacular. She didn't expect Rei held gifts like that so close to her heart. Still, Asuka had more important things to talk to this girl about. Things that were a matter of life and death.  
绫波零依旧坐在座位上，耐心等待着某事，无论那是什么。她仍在读着那本明日香送给她的轻小说，觉得相当精彩。她没想到绫波会把这样的礼物如此珍视。不过，明日香有更重要的事情要和这个女孩谈。事关生死的大事。

Rei's life and death. 丽的生活与死亡。

"Listen, Rei, can I talk to you in private for a little bit?" Asuka asked, tensely.  
"听着，丽，我能私下和你谈一会儿吗？" 明日香紧张地问道。

"Certainly," Rei said, rising to her feet.  
"当然可以，" 丽回答，站起身来。

Class hadn't started yet, and wouldn't start for a little bit of time. She had enough time to at least tell Rei what she knew. After all, if Rei resisted this next Angel, it might result in her death. Asuka did not want to see Rei dead. Despite her early prejudices, the blue haired girl had actually grown on her. Very much so, as a matter of fact. Asuka would even go as far as to call her a friend.  
课程尚未开始，还有一段时间才会开始。她有足够的时间至少告诉丽她所知道的事情。毕竟，如果丽抵抗不了下一个使徒，她可能会丧命。明日香不想看到丽死去。尽管她起初有偏见，但蓝发女孩实际上已经让她产生了好感。事实上，她甚至可以称她为朋友。

They separated themselves from the rest of the crowd as Asuka said, in a hushed voice, "This is about the next Angel attack."  
她们从人群中走开，明日香压低声音说：“这是关于下一个使徒的攻击。”

"What do you know?" Rei asked.  
“你知道些什么？”丽问道。

"First of all, I want you to keep this a secret, okay?"  
"首先，我要你保密，好吗？"

"I see no reason to object yet."  
"目前我找不到反对的理由。"

"Well, here's the deal. The next Angel is going to try to assimilate with you."  
"好吧，事情是这样的。下一个使徒打算和你融合。"

"I see." “我明白了。”

"If you resist, you will die."  
"如果你反抗，你就会死。"

"Understood." "明白了。"

"You need for it to become one with you."  
"你需要让它与你融为一体。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

"How about the incentive that if you don't, you will die?"  
"那如果不行，你就会死的激励如何？"

"But what does it matter if I die?"  
"但即使我死了，又有什么关系呢？"

"What the hell does that mean?!" Didn't she value her own life at all? She had developed so much as time passed, growing up so much, and yet now she said she didn't care if she lived or died?! What about her? What about the people around her who would suffer if she died? What about herself? She would lose everything, right? She would have nothing left!  
"这到底是什么意思？！" 难道她一点也不珍惜自己的生命吗？随着时间的流逝，她已经成长了那么多，现在却说她不在乎生死？！那她自己呢？她周围那些会因她的死而痛苦的人呢？她自己呢？她会失去一切，对吧？她将一无所有！

"If this shell drops, another will replace it," Rei said, solemnly.  
"如果这个躯壳消逝，另一个会取而代之。" 丽说，语气庄重。

"What do you mean?" Asuka asked.  
"你什么意思？" 明日香问道。

Rei glanced down at her toes, anxiously. "You wouldn't understand. It's too complicated a matter to relay by words alone. You need to see it to believe it."  
绫波微微低头看着自己的脚趾，显得有些焦虑。"你不会明白的。这事儿太复杂，光靠言语是说不清楚的。你得亲眼见到才能相信。"

"Listen, Rei, you need to allow this to come to pass! You need to assimilate with the Angel!" Asuka snarled, grabbing Rei by the shoulders.  
"听着，绫波，你得让这事发生！你必须与使徒融合！" 明日香咆哮着，抓住了绫波的肩膀。

"I cannot assimilate with the Angel," Rei replied, "It is more complex a matter than you could ever imagine."  
"我无法与使徒同化，" 丽回答道，"这比你所能想象的要复杂得多。"

Asuka squeezed her friend's shoulders with a vice-like grip as she snarled, desperately, "Listen! If you don't assimilate with him, people will die. A lot of people will die! The Lilim will destroy everything!"  
明日香用近乎钳制的力道紧握着朋友的双肩，咆哮着，绝望地喊道："听着！如果你不与他同化，人们会死的。很多人会死！人类会摧毁一切！"

"The Lilim?" Rei responded, "So in order to combat these Lilim, we need to assimilate with Angels?"  
"人类？" 丽回应道，"那么为了对抗这些人类，我们需要与使徒同化吗？"

"Exactly." “正是如此。”

"What a curious conundrum," Rei mumbled.  
"真是个奇怪的谜题，"丽喃喃自语道。

"So will you help us?"  
"那么你会帮助我们吗？"

"If I assimilate with an Angel, that will only create more problems. An infinitely greater quantity of problems."  
"如果我和一个天使同化，那只会制造更多问题。无穷无尽的问题。"

"Like what?" "比如呢？"

"Once again, it is indescribable."  
"再一次，这无法形容。"

What? Did she think that Asuka couldn't understand a simple matter like this? Well, so be it. She stared into Rei's eyes, intensity filling her face, and said, softly, "Please, tell me. I don't want to lose you."  
什么？她以为明日香连这么简单的事都理解不了吗？好吧，随她去吧。她凝视着绫波的眼睛，脸上的神情愈发强烈，轻声说道：“请告诉我。我不想失去你。”

Rei glanced at her toes, and sighed, "If I told you, you'd probably reject me with all your being."  
丽瞥了一眼自己的脚趾，叹了口气，“如果我告诉你，你大概会用尽全力拒绝我。”

"No, I wouldn't." "不，我不会。"

"I'll explain after school. But if it becomes too much for you to handle, Pilot Sohryu, I want you to tell me, and I will stop my explanation."  
"放学后我会解释。但如果这对你来说太难以承受，驾驶员惣流，我希望你告诉我，我会停止解释。"

And thus Asuka waited patiently for the day to end. The moment the final bell rang, Asuka ensured that herself and Rei would be the ones to clean up. And thus they found a room to themselves, Rei and Asuka alone. The moment Asuka ensured that the hallways were vacant of eavesdroppers, she turned to Rei, and said, "Okay. Ready to explain?"  
于是，明日香耐心等待着放学时刻的到来。最后一声铃响时，明日香确保她和绫波是负责打扫的人。就这样，她们找到了一个只有她们两人的房间。明日香确认走廊上没有偷听者后，转向绫波，说道：“好了，准备听解释了吗？”

"I said I had to show you."  
"我说过我得给你展示。"

"No time. The Angel could come before you had the chance to show me."  
"没时间了。天使可能在有机会展示给我看之前就来了。"

"A very good reason, I suppose."  
"我想这是个很好的理由。"

"Can you tell me now?"  
"你现在能告诉我吗？"

"Alright," Rei said, "The truth is that I am a clone."  
"好吧，" 丽说，"事实是我是一个克隆人。"

"A clone?" "克隆人？"

Rei nodded. "My cells borrow the genetic code of Yui Ikari."  
丽点点头。"我的细胞借用了碇唯的基因代码。"

"Oh, who's…wait a second, did you say Ikari?"  
"哦，谁……等等，你说的是碇吗？"

"Yes. Ikari." "是的，碇。"

"As in Shinji?" "你是说真嗣？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"So, are you trying to tell me that you're a clone of Shinji's mom?"  
“所以，你是想告诉我，你是真嗣妈妈的克隆体？”

Rei nodded. "As I said before, Pilot Sohryu, this concept is probably extremely difficult for you to understand as it is."  
绫波点点头。“如我之前所说，惣流驾驶员，这个概念对你来说可能极其难以理解。”

Was that an understatement! Asuka's eyelid twitched as she tried to comprehend what she knew so far. Rei was Shinji's mom. Or at least her clone. What struck her the most wasn't so much that Rei was a clone. She had knew something was strange with Wonder Girl the moment she met her that wasn't human. And she wasn't even too shocked by the fact that Rei was a clone of Shinji. What bothered her most was that Asuka had kissed Shinji in front of Rei, who was really Shinji's mom? The very idea was completely morally bankrupt!  
这岂止是轻描淡写！明日香的眼皮抽搐着，试图消化她所知道的一切。绫波是真嗣的妈妈，或者至少是她的克隆体。最让她震惊的倒不是绫波是克隆体这件事。她从第一次见到那个神秘女孩时就觉得她不寻常，不像是人类。而且，得知绫波是真嗣的克隆体，她也没那么震惊。最让她困扰的是，她曾在绫波面前亲吻了真嗣，而绫波实际上是真嗣的妈妈？这个想法简直道德沦丧！

"But there is more for you to know," Rei said, "The truth is that my body also occupies the soul of Lilith."  
"但还有更多你需要了解的，"丽说，"真相是，我的身体也承载着莉莉丝的灵魂。"

"Lilith?" Asuka asked, not sure how much she wanted to know.  
"莉莉丝？"明日香问，不确定自己想知道多少。

"Lilith is the Second Angel, the mother of humanity," Rei replied, softly, "So, in a way, I am an Angel."  
"莉莉丝是第二使徒，人类的母亲，"丽轻声回答，"所以，某种程度上，我也是一位使徒。"

Asuka could only stare in shock. So Rei was a clone of Shinji's mom AND an Angel? Maybe ignorance was bliss. Maybe she should have never pressed the matter. Maybe she should have just wandered in ignorance and never questioned the nature of Rei's existence.  
明日香只能震惊地瞪大眼睛。所以丽不仅是真嗣母亲的克隆体，还是个使徒？或许无知是福。也许她根本不该深究此事。也许她应该一直懵懂无知，永远不去探究丽的真实身份。

"If Adam or any of the Angels born of Adam assimilates with me, I'll have no choice but to assimilate with Lilith herself. And if Adam and Lilith become one again, Third Impact will occur."  
如果亚当或任何由亚当诞生的天使与我融合，我将别无选择，只能与莉莉丝本身融合。而一旦亚当与莉莉丝再度合一，第三次冲击便会发生。

"Third Impact?" "第三次冲击？"

"I am the key to Third Impact. The Instrumentality of all mankind. My existence means the end of everything, and the rebirth to a world entirely unlike any you can even comprehend."  
"我是引发第三次冲击的关键。是全人类一体化的工具。我的存在意味着一切的终结，以及一个完全不同于你们所能理解的全新世界的重生。"

"A rebirth?" "一个重生？"

"Yes, but if that rebirth is to occur, all will perish. And I cannot allow that to happen."  
"是的，但如果那次重生发生，一切都将毁灭。我不能允许这种情况发生。"

"So are you saying that you can end the world if you merge with an Angel?" Asuka asked, nervously.  
"你的意思是，如果你与使徒融合，就能终结世界？" 明日香紧张地问道。"

"Exactly," Rei replied, "My death is without value. I can be replaced by an arsenal of clones and empty vessels for my soul to occupy. This carnal body does not restrain my existence from occupying a new body if this one should fall. Thus, my death would be temporary."  
"正是如此，" 绫波回答，"我的死亡毫无价值。我可以被一整套克隆体和空壳所替代，我的灵魂可以占据它们。这个肉体不会限制我的存在，如果这个身体倒下，我可以占据一个新的身体。因此，我的死亡将是暂时的。"

"Temporary?" "临时的？"

"Yes," Rei responded, "You do understand everything I have just said, Pilot Sohryu?"  
"是的，" 丽回应道，"你确实理解我刚才所说的一切，对吧，碇司令？"

"I think." "我想是的。"

"Well, all you need to understand is that I cannot merge with an Angel. I would rather die."  
"好吧，你需要明白的是，我无法与天使融合。我宁愿死。"

"So if you die, you won't be dead forever?"  
"所以如果你死了，你不会永远死去吗？"

"Exactly." “正是如此。”

"Well, maybe…" If Rei had an Angel absorbed into her body, that would cause problems. That wasn't even a doubt. The Third Impact sounded like a bigger problem than even the threats these Lilim posed. Nevertheless, these Lilim were a threat that had to be taken seriously.  
“嗯，或许……”如果丽体内吸收了使徒，那肯定会引发问题。这毋庸置疑。比起这些莉莉姆带来的威胁，第三次冲击听起来更像是个大麻烦。尽管如此，这些莉莉姆也是一个必须严肃对待的威胁。

However, Asuka did not object to Rei's concepts. Nor did she have time to. The moment Rei opened her mouth to respond to Asuka's answer, the alarm rang. Asuka stared up at the speakers overhead, relieved to find some excuse to escape this bizarre conversation. "An Angel!"  
然而，明日香并没有反对丽的概念。她也没有时间去反对。就在丽张嘴准备回应明日香的回答时，警报响了。明日香抬头盯着头顶的扬声器，庆幸找到了一个逃离这场古怪对话的借口。"使徒来袭！"

"I see," Rei sighed, "Then I have to die now?"  
"我明白了，" 丽叹息道，"那么我现在必须去死吗？"

"I guess." "我想是的。"

"I'll see you after the battle, with or without this body," Rei responded, her voice sodden with sorrow.  
"无论这具身体是否还在，战后我会与你相见，" 丽回应道，声音中充满了悲伤。

As the two of them left the building, they ran into Shinji. The moment Asuka saw Shinji, she remembered what Rei had told her. Rei was a clone of Shinji's mother. Now that she thought of it, they were physically similar. Not as far as hair went, yes, but their faces were similarly structured. Their eyes were similar, despite the numerous obvious differences. If Shinji found out about Rei, how would he react? What would he do?  
当他们两人离开大楼时，遇到了真嗣。阿斯卡一看到真嗣，就想起了丽告诉她的事情。丽是真嗣母亲的克隆体。现在想来，她们在身体特征上确实有相似之处。虽然头发不同，但脸型结构相似。尽管有许多明显的差异，但她们的眼睛却很相似。如果真嗣发现了丽的事情，他会怎么反应？他会怎么做？

Before Asuka knew it, she was pondering these same questions in her Eva as it was loaded to the surface, the other three Evas around her. The Angel before them almost looked like a DNA strand that had been twisted to create a massive donut in the air. Asuka raised an eyebrow staring at it.  
不知不觉中，明日香已经在她的 Eva 里思考着这些问题，Eva 被运送到地面上，周围是其他三台 Eva。眼前的使徒看起来几乎像是一条被扭曲成空中巨大甜甜圈的 DNA 链。明日香挑了挑眉，盯着它看。

This was the Angel? It looked more like a floating string or maybe some sort of deformed bagel. "Alright, who's going to take it on? Shinji? Why don't you handle it?"  
这就是使徒？它看起来更像是一根漂浮的绳子，或者某种畸形的百吉饼。“好吧，谁来对付它？真嗣？你为什么不处理它？”

"I'll go," Rei said. “我去，”绫波说。

"But why should I handle it?" Shinji asked.  
"但为什么该我处理呢？" 真嗣问道。

"I said I'll fight it."  
"我说了我来对付它。"

"Well, I took care of the last few, and Rei killed that other one," Asuka replied, drowning out Rei's voice.  
"嗯，我解决了最后几个，而丽干掉了另一个，" 明日香回答道，盖过了丽的声音。

"I said I'll kill it."  
"我说过我会干掉它。"

"That was a team effort!" Shinji complained.  
"那是团队的努力！" 真嗣抱怨道。"

"Are you listening?" "你在听吗？"

"But then again, Toji can fight him!" Asuka replied, gesturing at Toji.  
"但话说回来，Toji 可以跟他打！" 明日香回答道，向 Toji 比划着。

"What?" Toji stammered. "什么？" Toji 结巴道。

"I said I'll handle this."  
“我说了我来处理这事。”

"C'mon! You haven't done anything useful yet!" Asuka teased, "How are you going to brag to Hikari?"  
“快点！你还没做啥有用的事呢！”明日香打趣道，“你打算怎么跟光炫耀啊？”

"I'm fighting it." "我在努力克服它。"

"But, oh, all right!" Toji relented.  
"但是，好吧！" 冬二让步了。

"I'm going now." "我现在要走了。"

"Alright! Go Toji!" "好嘞！上吧，透司！"

"Pilot Sohryu!" "飞行员惣流！"

"What is it, Rei?" Asuka asked as Toji sprinted toward the Angel, despite Misato shouting at him that they had no idea what the Angel's powers were.  
"怎么了，丽？" 明日香问道，尽管美里大声喊着他们还不知道天使的能力，但真嗣还是向天使冲去。

"Did you just do that so I wouldn't fight the Angel?" Rei asked, intensely.  
"你刚才那样做是为了不让我与天使战斗吗？" 丽认真地问道。

"Basically," Asuka shrugged.  
"基本上，" 明日香耸了耸肩。

"I see." “我明白了。”

The Angel contorted suddenly. Asuka watched as the Angel stretched out, the double helix shape melting into itself to form a thick string of light. The string snapped, and, much like a swift worm in the air, soared straight into Toji's body! Toji screamed in agony as his body doubled over. Asuka could see the Angel infusing itself into Toji's body.  
使徒突然扭曲变形。明日香目睹着使徒伸展，双螺旋形状融为一体，形成一道粗壮的光线。光线断裂，犹如空中迅捷的蠕虫，直冲进真嗣的身体！真嗣痛苦地尖叫，身体弯曲。明日香能看到使徒正在融入真嗣的身体。

"Shinji!" Misato shrieked over the computer, "Get over there and save him!"  
"真嗣！" 美里在电脑那头尖叫，"快过去救他！"

Just as Shinji started toward Toji, Asuka fired bullets straight into his path. "Don't move, Shinji!" Asuka snarled.  
正当真嗣朝东治走去时，明日香直接朝他前方开枪。“别动，真嗣！”明日香咆哮道。

"But Toji's suffering!" Shinji stammered.  
“但东治很痛苦！”真嗣结巴道。

"Pilot Ikari, don't do anything," Rei replied.  
“碇驾驶员，别做任何事，”绫波回答道。

"Have you two lost your minds?!" Ritsuko shouted across the computer.  
"你们两个疯了吗?!" 律子对着电脑大喊。

"Just what are you planning on doing, you two lunatics!?" Misato screamed.  
"你们两个疯子到底打算干什么?!" 美里尖叫道。

"Trust me!" Asuka shouted, "I know what I'm doing."  
"相信我！" 明日香喊道，"我知道我在做什么。"

"If we don't do something, Toji will merge with the Angel!" Ritsuko shrieked.  
"如果我们不采取行动，Toji 就会与使徒融合！" 赤木律子尖叫道。

"That's exactly what we want to happen," Asuka shouted back.  
"那正是我们希望发生的事，" 明日香大声回击。

"I'm picking up traces of mental contamination in Unit-03's pilot!" Maya screamed, desperately, "Perfect integration imminent!"  
"我在三号机的驾驶员身上检测到了精神污染的痕迹！" 伊吹玛亚绝望地尖叫，"完美融合即将发生！"

"Is the pilot resisting this integration?" Ritsuko shouted.  
"飞行员在抗拒这种融合吗？" 律子大声问道。

"Negative. He's actually accepting the Angel into his being!" Maya replied.  
"不是的。他实际上正在接纳使徒进入他的体内！" 真希波回答道。

"Toji's accepting it?" Shinji repeated.  
"加持在接纳它？" 真嗣重复道。

Asuka stared in bewilderment at Unit-03. The Angel had disappeared entirely inside of the Eva's body. Massive veins bulged underneath its metallic shell as the seconds passed. Sparks flew around the Eva for a moment before it collapsed to the floor.  
明日香茫然地盯着三号机。使徒已经完全消失在 EVA 体内。随着时间的流逝，巨大的血管在其金属外壳下膨胀。火花在 EVA 周围飞溅了一会儿，随后它倒在了地板上。

"Pilot is unconscious, but his condition is stable," Maya shouted.  
“驾驶员失去意识，但状况稳定。” 真希波喊道。

"There are no traces of mental contamination," Ritsuko muttered, "How is this possible?"  
“没有发现精神污染的痕迹，” 律子喃喃自语，“这怎么可能？”

"I don't understand any of this," Misato mumbled as Asuka returned to base.  
"我完全搞不懂这些，" 美里喃喃自语，此时明日香回到了基地。

It took eleven hours for Toji to awaken from his coma. Hikari had, naturally, waited by his bedside along with the other pilots. As they waited, Rei had taken Asuka aside to talk. In a serious voice, Rei said, tensely, "I already told you that I could return from death. Why didn't you believe me and let me destroy the Angel?"  
整整十一个小时后，真嗣才从昏迷中苏醒。光自然是一直守在他的床边，其他驾驶员也在场。等待期间，丽把明日香拉到一旁谈话。丽用严肃的语气，紧张地说："我已经告诉过你，我能从死亡中归来。你为什么不相信我，让我去消灭使徒？"

"The Angels aren't evil," Asuka replied, "I know this to be true. They aren't. I didn't see any reason for you to die in this battle."  
"使徒并非邪恶，" 明日香回答，"我确信这一点。他们不是。我看不出有什么理由让你在这场战斗中牺牲。"

"This is coming from a person who has devoted her entire life to piloting and fighting Angels?"  
“这话出自一个将毕生奉献给驾驶与对抗使徒的人之口？”

"Arael changed the way I saw things," Asuka replied, flexing her fingers.  
"阿瑞尔改变了我的视角，"明日香回答道，活动着手指。

"Did he merge with you?"  
“他与你融合了吗？”

"Yes, he did." “是的，他确实这么做了。”

"I could tell," Rei observed, "You weren't even fighting, and your synch rate was massive."  
"我能看出来，" 丽观察道，"你甚至都没在战斗，同步率就已经很高了。"

"What are you two talking about?" Shinji asked, tensely.  
"你们俩在聊什么呢？" 真嗣紧张地问道。

"Nothing important," Asuka replied back.  
“没什么重要的，”明日香回答道。

Eventually, Toji awoke from his slumber. The first thing he did, was mumble, "What just happened?"  
最终，真嗣从睡梦中醒来。他做的第一件事，便是喃喃自语：“刚才发生了什么？”

"Thank God you're alright!" Hikari threw her arms around Toji's chest, tears in her eyes, "I was worried sick!"  
“谢天谢地你没事！”光子紧紧抱住真嗣的胸膛，眼中含泪，“我担心死了！”

"What happened in there, Toji?" Shinji asked, tensely.  
“里面发生了什么，冬二？”真嗣紧张地问。

"Well, at first I was in pain all over. I could barely take it. And then everything disappeared. I was at this beach, staring at myself. This other self told me it was an Angel, and asked if I wanted to become one with it. I asked why I should. He told me he'd make me powerful enough to fight the Lilim."  
“嗯，一开始我浑身疼痛。几乎无法忍受。然后一切都消失了。我来到了一片海滩，凝视着自己。另一个自己告诉我，那是一个使徒，并问我是否想与它合为一体。我问为什么要这么做。他告诉我，他会让我变得足够强大，能够与人类战斗。”

"Lilim again," Asuka mumbled.  
"“又是人类，”明日香喃喃自语。”

"He also said that Kaworu was going to return, which I told him I had heard repeatedly. I asked him who the Lilim were, but he refused to tell me."  
“他还说渚薰会回来，我告诉他我已经听过很多次了。我问他‘人类’是谁，但他拒绝告诉我。”

"That figures," Asuka mumbled, annoyed.  
“不出所料，”明日香恼怒地咕哝道。

Just who were these damn Lilim, anyway? And who was Kaworu? Well, for the moment, Asuka didn't need to worry. Right now, all she needed to do was relish in the fact that Rei hadn't died and that Toji had received the powers of the Angel. And, perhaps even greater, Third Impact hadn't happened. The world hadn't ended.  
这些该死的莉莉姆到底是谁？还有，卡罗尔又是谁？不过，眼下明日香不必担心这些。此刻，她只需享受一个事实：绫波没有死去，而真嗣获得了使徒的力量。更重要的，第三次冲击没有发生，世界并未终结。

They went home that night, only for Asuka to throw herself over a couch to watch TV. She must have fallen asleep, as she soon felt Shinji shaking her awake. It was dark out, but it had been daytime when she had fallen asleep. Shinji's eyes betrayed his shaken feelings, his inner terror, as he stammered, "You wouldn't believe what just happened to me."  
那晚他们回到家，明日香扑倒在沙发上看电视。她一定是睡着了，因为她很快感觉到真嗣在摇醒她。外面一片漆黑，但她入睡时还是白天。真嗣的眼神透露出他内心的恐惧，结结巴巴地说：“你不会相信刚才发生在我身上的事。”

"Try me." “试试看。”

"Rei is a clone." "丽是一个克隆人。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"Wait, you knew that already?"  
"等等，你早就知道了吗？"

"Yes. She told me yesterday."  
"是的。她昨天告诉我的。"

"And you didn't tell me?"  
“你没告诉我？”

"I didn't want to disturb you."  
“我不想打扰你。”

"And why did she tell you?"  
“她为什么告诉你？”

"Well…" “嗯……”

### Chapter 14

"Asuka, I just don't get this."  
“明日香，我就是搞不懂这个。”

"What's not to get?" "有什么不好理解的？"

"What is there to get? Rei's a clone of my mom, the Angels aren't trying to kill us, and now the enemy are these Lilim things?"  
"有什么好理解的？丽是我妈妈的克隆体，使徒并没有想杀我们，现在敌人变成了这些莉莉姆？"

"Well, when you put things that way…"  
"嗯，你这么一说……"

It had been a couple of days since Shinji had learned the truth about Rei. He had spent less time around Rei as of late, and this did not go unnoticed by Rei. Rei had confided in Asuka that she didn't understand this change in Shinji, and would have continued to be confused had it not been for Asuka explaining everything Shinji had seen.  
自从真嗣得知丽背后的真相已经过去几天了。最近他减少了与丽的接触，这一点丽也注意到了。丽向明日香倾诉，她不明白真嗣为何会有这样的变化，如果不是明日香解释了真嗣所见到的一切，她可能会一直困惑下去。

She had also told Rei that all of the empty shells that could have occupied her body had been destroyed by Ritsuko.  
她还告诉丽，所有本可能占据她身体的空壳都已被律子摧毁。

"Ritsuko?" Rei repeated after hearing the information, "That does not surprise me."  
“律子？”听到这个消息后，丽重复了一遍，“这并不让我意外。”

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"Ritsuko's mother killed my first shell by strangulation. Perhaps Ritsuko is simply repeating her mother's sins."  
"律子的母亲通过勒颈杀死了我的第一个替身。或许律子只是在重蹈她母亲的罪行。"

The knowledge that Ritsuko's mom was something of a nut did come as a surprise to Asuka. She had thought Ritsuko was a relatively mentally stable woman, but apparently she was wrong. She wondered how Maya would react to hearing that her crush had apparently lost her mind.  
得知律子妈妈有点不正常，这让明日香颇感意外。她本以为律子是个相对心理稳定的女人，但显然她错了。她好奇真嗣听到自己暗恋对象似乎精神失常的消息会有何反应。

The days continued for the rest of the week. Toji had returned to school, as expected, fully recovered. Hikari was relieved to see his return. However, Asuka was more interested in how he felt now than his departure from the hospital. She needed to see if Toji was feeling good after assimilating the Angel like he did. However, her concerns were nothing, as Toji informed Asuka, "I feel better than I have in ages!"  
那一周剩下的日子依旧继续。正如预期，总司已经完全康复回到了学校。光看到他的归来感到宽慰。然而，明日香更关心的是他现在的感受，而不是他离开医院这件事。她需要确认总司在融合了使徒后是否感觉良好。不过，她的担忧都是多余的，因为总司告诉明日香：“我感觉比以往任何时候都要好！”

On the whole, life had returned to normal. Still, Asuka couldn't forget there was only one Angel left. One Angel until these mysterious Lilim attacked. Asuka still couldn't figure out what the Lilim were. It had to be an army of some sort. An army of Angels, perhaps? Of spawns of this Lilith Rei mentioned before? These Lilim had to be foul, horrible things to make the Angels afraid. And just who was this Kaworu, anyway? His arrival had to be imminent, right?  
总的来说，生活已经恢复正常。然而，明日香始终无法忘记只剩下一个使徒了。一个使徒，直到这些神秘的人类发动攻击。明日香仍然搞不清楚这些人类是什么。它们一定是一支军队之类的东西。或许是天使的军队？或者是之前零提到的莉莉丝的子嗣？这些人类必定是邪恶可怕的存在，才会让天使们感到恐惧。而这个渚薰，究竟是谁呢？他的到来即将来临，对吧？

As she, Shinji, and Rei walked home on evening, the sun setting behind him, Shinji stopped in his place. Asuka and Rei stopped, staring at him with an eyebrow raised. "What's the matter?" Asuka asked, curiously.  
当她、真嗣和零在傍晚步行回家时，太阳正落在他身后，真嗣突然停下了脚步。明日香和零停下，挑起眉毛看着他。“怎么了？”明日香好奇地问。

"I thought I heard something," Shinji muttered, "Well, hear something. I can still hear it."  
“我以为我听到了什么，”真嗣低声说，“嗯，听到了什么。我现在还能听到。”

"What does it sound like?" Rei asked.  
"听起来像什么？" 丽问道。"

"Humming." "哼唱着。"

Asuka was about to badmouth him for stopping over something as small as a person humming, but then the sound reached her ears as well. She glanced around, searching for the source of this mystery sound. It was a song she had heard many times before. A famous song. The 9th Symphony by Beethoven.  
明日香正要因为他因为一个人哼唱这种小事停下来而骂他，但随后那声音也传到了她的耳中。她四处张望，寻找这个神秘声音的来源。这是一首她以前听过很多次的歌。一首著名的歌曲。贝多芬的第九交响曲。

Standing against the setting sun, growing closer now, was a boy their age. His hair was pewter, his skin as pale as Rei's. His eyes glowed red as he approached. However, despite his bizarre appearance, an aura of serenity and comfort surrounded him. Asuka almost felt calm around this stranger, this unusual humming individual. As he drew nearer, Asuka could see his mouth was drawn up into a serene smile.  
站在夕阳下，现在越来越近的是一个和他们同龄的男孩。他的头发是铅灰色的，皮肤和丽一样苍白。他的眼睛闪着红光，随着他的接近。然而，尽管他的外表怪异，一种宁静和舒适的氛围环绕着他。明日香几乎在这个陌生人，这个不寻常的哼唱者身边感到平静。当他走得更近时，明日香可以看到他的嘴角挂着宁静的微笑。

Upon reaching them, his humming stopped. "Ah, one of the crowning achievements of the Lilim culture. Your music is exceptionally magnificent, Lilim."  
一靠近他们，他的哼唱便戛然而止。“啊，这是莉莉姆文化的巅峰之作。你们的音乐真是无比壮丽，莉莉姆。”

"Lilim?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow, "Aren't the Lilim—"  
“莉莉姆？”明日香挑起眉毛，“莉莉姆不就是——”

"You Lilim are the Children of Lilith, as we are the Children of Adam," the boy said, smiling once again.  
“你们莉莉姆是莉莉丝的子嗣，正如我们是亚当的子嗣，”男孩再次微笑着说道。

"Are you Kaworu?" Shinji asked, nervously.  
"你是薰吗？" 真嗣紧张地问道。

"My name is Kaworu Nagisa, at your service," the boy said, bowing majestically with a wave of his right hand tucked under his chest.  
"我叫渚薰，很高兴见到你，" 男孩优雅地鞠躬，右手轻轻托在胸前。

"You're an Angel?" Asuka asked, "You look just like a human."  
"你是使徒吗？" 明日香问道，"你看起来就像个人类。"

"This shell does resemble your Lilim fellows, doesn't it?" Kaworu said, smiling.  
"这个躯壳确实与你的同类利利姆相似，不是吗？" 渚薰微笑着说道。

"Lilim are humans?" Rei asked, anxiety actually filling her voice.  
"利利姆就是人类吗？" 绫波零问道，声音中竟然充满了焦虑。

"That is a correct assumption, Rei Ayanami," Kaworu replied, "The Lilim that will destroy society are, in fact, your fellow man."  
"你的理解是正确的，绫波零，" 渚薰回答道，"那些将毁灭社会的利利姆，实际上就是你的同类。"

"Oh, that just figures!" Here all along Asuka had anticipated some sort of monster to destroy everything, that would devastate the world. But, in the end, the real enemy was man. It figured. Mankind was the only race on the planet that could destroy itself. Even the Angels were friendly to one another, forming alliances and such. But Humanity would ruin itself. That just sucked. Ah well, an enemy was an enemy to her, and humans couldn't defend themselves against the Evas. It would be an easy victory.  
"哦，这真是意料之中！"一直以来，明日香都预料会有某种怪物来摧毁一切，让世界陷入绝望。然而，最终真正的敌人却是人类自己。这并不意外。人类是地球上唯一能自我毁灭的种族。就连使徒们也彼此友好，结成联盟等等。但人类却会自我毁灭。这真是糟糕透顶。唉，对她来说，敌人就是敌人，而人类无法抵御 Eva 的攻击。这将是一场轻松的胜利。

"So we have to kill people now?" Shinji stammered, desperately.  
"所以我们现在必须杀人吗？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，极度绝望。

"Yes, Shinji," Kaworu said, patiently with a smile, "You must destroy the lives of your fellow man in order to salvage humanity. The fact of the matter is that Seele will launch an assault the moment they hear of my defeat."  
"是的，真嗣，" 渚薰微笑着耐心地说，"你必须毁灭同胞的生命来拯救人类。事实是，Seele 一旦得知我的失败，就会立即发动攻击。"

"Your defeat?" Shinji asked.  
"你的失败？" 真嗣问道。

"Yes," Kaworu said, "They have sent me to infiltrate your Central Dogma. However, I have no desire to do that. Originally, my comrades and myself had tried to infiltrate Dogma in order to reunite with Adam, and forcibly merge with him in order to ignite the Third Impact. However, we have learned that it was in fact Lilith that resided in Central Dogma."  
"是的，" 渚薰说，"他们派我来渗透你的中央教条。然而，我并无此意。原本，我和我的同伴们试图潜入教条，与亚当重聚，并强行与他融合以引发第三次冲击。但我们得知，实际上居住在中央教条的是莉莉丝。

"How did you find that out?" Auska asked.  
"你是怎么发现的？" 明日香问。

"A Lilim informed me of this," Kaworu said, "He found this Lilim shell of mine, and told me everything."  
"一个莉莉姆告诉了我这件事，"渚薰说，"他找到了我这个莉莉姆的外壳，并告诉了我一切。"

"Who was he?" Shinji asked.  
"他是谁？"真嗣问。"

"His name was Ryoji Kaji," Kaworu said, grinning.  
"他名叫加持良治，"渚薰笑着说。"

"Kaji?" Asuka stammered. "加持？" 明日香结巴道。

"Yes. It was in fact Kaji who informed me that Lilith, not Adam, was in Central Dogma. Well, I can assure you that after that bit of knowledge, there was no point at all in even bothering to attack. We learned that Adam was in a different place. Kaji informed me that that place was inside the Lilim Gendo Ikari's hand."  
是的。实际上是加持告诉我，在中央教条区的是莉莉丝，而非亚当。好吧，我可以向你保证，在那之后，攻击根本毫无意义。我们得知亚当在另一个地方。加持告诉我，那个地方就在人类基因组碇源堂的手中。

"My father?" Shinji stammered, mortified.  
"我父亲？" 真嗣结巴道，羞愧难当。

"In his hand?" Asuka stammered, disgusted.  
"在他手里？" 明日香结巴着，一脸厌恶。

Rei said nothing. 绫波什么也没说。

"Yes," Kaworu said, nodding, "Gendo Ikari has inserted an embryo of Adam into his palm. He plans on using it to trigger Third Impact and the Instrumentality of mankind."  
“是的，”渚薰点头说道，“碇源堂在他的手掌中植入了亚当的胚胎。他计划利用它来引发第三次冲击和人类的融合。”

"Instrumentality?" Asuka asked. She noticed Rei glancing down at her toes. Had she known about Gendo this entire time? Perhaps Gendo had threatened her to not tell a soul, forced her to remain silent. Perhaps Gendo had even blackmailed her, or even abused her! The bastard! Of course, that was all speculation. It looked as though Gendo loved Rei, and considering that she was a clone of his wife, that did make sense.  
"“融合？”明日香问道。她注意到绫波零低头看着自己的脚趾。难道她一直都知道碇源堂的计划？也许碇源堂威胁她不许透露半个字，强迫她保持沉默。也许碇源堂甚至用黑料要挟她，或者虐待她！这个混蛋！当然，这一切都只是猜测。看起来碇源堂对绫波零有感情，考虑到她是他妻子的克隆体，这确实说得通。”

"The truth is," Kaworu said, seriously, "Gendo Ikari is trying to trigger his own Third Impact before Seele can."  
"事实是，" 渚薰认真地说，"碇源堂试图在 Seele 之前触发他自己的第三次冲击。"

"What's Seele?" Shinji asked.  
"Seele 是什么？" 真嗣问道。"

"A secret society that governs over everything in your Lilim culture from the shadows," Kaworu said, "They have been working toward a certain ends for a while now, specifically the Instrumentality of Mankind."  
"一个秘密组织，从暗中统治着你们莉莉姆文化的一切，" 渚薰说，"他们一直在为某个特定目标努力，特别是人类的合而为一。"

"But what is Instrumentality?" Asuka asked.  
“但什么是人类补完计划？”明日香问道。

Kaworu smiled in amusement. "It is when the walls to your souls dissolve, and mankind integrates perfectly with itself. All man fused into one, perfect being. You'd fill the gaps within your souls and find Nirvana. At least, that's how Seele sees it. On a personal note, I don't think Lilim can live on the same planet without hurting each other. In one mass, you Lilim would be in Hell."  
渚薰带着一丝玩味地笑了。“那是当你们灵魂间的壁垒消融，人类完美地融为一体的时刻。所有的人融合成一个完美的存在。你们将填补灵魂中的空缺，达到涅槃之境。至少，这是 Seele 的看法。就我个人而言，我不认为莉莉姆能在同一个星球上共存而不互相伤害。作为一个整体，你们莉莉姆将身处地狱。”

So Seele intended on fusing all Humanity into one? That just figured. Asuka looked at Kaworu, intensely, "What do we need to do?"  
所以 Seele 打算将全人类融合为一体？这倒是说得通。明日香紧紧盯着渚薰，“我们需要做什么？”

"In the foreseeable future, you will be attacked by Seele soldiers and the Japanese government. You must allow Misato Katsuragi to form a conference with me so I can explain the situation to her personally. Inform Toji as well. Inform everyone, even Commander Ikari."  
"在可预见的未来，你将遭到 Seele 士兵和日本政府的攻击。你必须允许葛城美里与我召开会议，以便我亲自向她解释情况。同时通知东治。通知所有人，包括碇司令。"

"My Father?" Shinji stammered.  
"我的父亲？" 真嗣结巴道。

"Yes," Kaworu said, smiling still, "He is cold, but he is still your fellow Lilim, is he not? And he is your father. Despite how you both try to deny it, you have feelings of attachment to each other."  
"是的，" 渚薰依旧微笑着说，"他虽然冷漠，但他仍然是你的同类莉莉姆，不是吗？而且他是你的父亲。尽管你们都试图否认，你们之间还是有着情感的牵绊。"

"Damn him!" Shinji snarled.  
"该死的他！" 真嗣咆哮道。

"Don't damn him," Kaworu said, approaching Shinji, putting a hand on his shoulder.  
“别责怪他。”渚薰说着，走近真嗣，将手搭在他的肩上。

"You aren't gay, are you Kaworu?" Asuka asked as Kaworu put two hands on Shinji's shoulders.  
"你不是同性恋吧，薰？" 明日香问道，此时薰用双手搭在真嗣的肩上。

"Gay? Is this a Lilim term? I do not understand its concept," Kaworu explained.  
"同性恋？这是人类的概念吗？我不太理解这个概念，" 薰解释道。

"You're queer," Asuka mumbled.  
"你真是个怪人，" 明日香咕哝道。

"Asuka," Shinji muttered, off-handedly.  
"明日香," 真嗣不经意地喃喃道。

"Shinji Ikari, if only you knew the potential within your Evangelion," Kaworu said, hauntingly, "After all, within it resides a pure, full soul that you can harness. Not a fragmented soul or nothing at all, but a true, full soul. No other Eva has a full soul like yours."  
"碇真嗣，如果你知道你那台 EVA 的潜力，" 渚薰幽幽地说，"毕竟，它里面寄宿着一个纯净、完整的灵魂，你可以驾驭。不是碎片化的灵魂，也不是空无一物，而是一个真正的、完整的灵魂。没有其他 EVA 像你的那样拥有完整的灵魂。"

"Wait, what?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"等等，什么？" 明日香问道，扬起眉毛。

"I forgot to mention," Shinji said, "Ritsuko told me within every Eva is a human soul."  
"我忘了提，" 真嗣说，"律子告诉我，每一台 EVA 里都有一个灵魂。"

"Not my Eva," Rei replied.  
“不是我的零号机。”绫波回答道。

"Oh, so that's why yours sucks so badly?" Asuka asked, smirking.  
“哦，所以这就是为什么你的那么糟糕？”明日香问道，嘴角带着一丝讥笑。

"Pilot Sohryu, you shouldn't talk." Rei blushed deep red.  
“飞行员惣流，你不该这么说。”绫波脸红得深红。

"The souls inside your Evas are inconsequential to Gendo Ikari," Kaworu said, "The soul within your Eva, Shinji, is your mother's. Did you know this?"  
“你 Eva 里的灵魂对碇源堂来说无关紧要，”渚薰说道，“你的 Eva 里，真嗣，是你母亲的灵魂。你知道吗？”

"Yes," Shinji confessed, "Whenever my Eva went berserk, I could feel her presence. Right there beside me. I knew she was there, I just couldn't always see her. She was there, and I could feel her breathing right there beside me."  
“是的，”真嗣坦白道，“每当我的 Eva 失控时，我能感觉到她的存在。就在我身边。我知道她在那里，只是我不能总是看见她。她在那里，我能感觉到她的呼吸就在我身边。”

So Shinji's mother's soul was in his Eva? Then what soul was in her Eva? Did it have a soul? A fragmented soul? Well, it didn't matter. She had never felt anything in her Eva, so whatever soul was in there had to be a lousy one at that. Truth was, it didn't matter what soul they put into the Eva, in the end it was all up to the Pilot in order to integrate with the Eva.  
"那么真嗣母亲的灵魂在他的 Eva 里？那她的 Eva 里又是什么灵魂呢？它有灵魂吗？一个残缺的灵魂？嗯，这并不重要。她从未在她的 Eva 中感受到任何东西，所以无论那里有什么灵魂，肯定都不怎么样。事实上，无论他们把什么灵魂放进 Eva 里，最终都取决于驾驶员与 Eva 的融合。”

Right? 对吧？

"I will help you, Shinji," Kaworu said, "But first I will inform NERV of Seele's treachery so that they are prepared to counterattack. The final battle draws near, Children."  
"我会帮助你，真嗣，" 渚薰说道，"但首先我要通知 NERV 关于 Seele 的背叛，让他们准备好反击。最终的战斗即将来临，孩子们。"

"Kaworu, what are you going to do to help us?" Shinji asked.  
"渚薰，你打算怎么帮助我们？" 真嗣问道。"

"I will request to be locked away into Central Dogma," Kaworu said, "I cannot enter Lilith's body the way I am. We would need a medium. So you needn't worry about me triggering Third Impact even by accident."  
"我会请求被关押在中央教条区，" 渚薰说，"以我现在的状态，无法进入莉莉丝的身体。我们需要一个媒介。所以你不必担心我会意外引发第三次冲击。"

"That's one weight off our shoulders," Asuka replied.  
"这下我们肩上的担子轻了一分。" 明日香答道。

"I must warn you, pilots," Kaworu said, staring at each of the pilots in turn, "The Lilim are creating Mass Production Evangelions in order to stop yours."  
“我必须提醒你们，驾驶员们，”渚薰说道，目光逐一扫过每位驾驶员，“人类正在制造量产型福音战士，以阻止你们的行动。”

"How many?" Asuka asked. "“有多少？”明日香问道。”

"Nine of them," Kaworu said.  
"九个。"渚薰说道。

"We only have four," Shinji muttered.  
“我们只有四个。”真嗣低声嘀咕。

"But they're mass production. They can't be that strong," Asuka laughed, "Quantity and not quality, you know? We're superior to their stupid Mass Production freaks. Bring them on!"  
“但它们是量产型。不会那么强，”明日香笑着说，“数量而非质量，你知道的？我们比那些愚蠢的量产怪物优越。来吧，让他们来！”

"They are nearly impossible to kill on your own," Kaworu said, "Your combined efforts and AT Fields are the only thing that can stop them, if even that is possible. Be warned. This might be your hardest battle yet. I will aid you in your struggles, but my power might not be enough to stop the Evas myself. Can you handle the hardship?"  
"它们几乎无法独自被击败，" 渚薰说道，"只有你们的共同努力和 AT 力场才有可能阻止它们，即便如此也未必能成功。要小心。这可能是你们迄今为止最艰难的战斗。我会协助你们，但我的力量可能不足以独自阻止 Eva。你能承受这份艰难吗？"

"You make it sound like we've never fought a battle before," Asuka laughed, "Don't sweat it! It'll be a piece of cake!"  
"你说的像是我们从未打过仗似的，" 明日香笑着说，"别担心！小菜一碟！"

"I won't run away anymore," Shinji said.  
"我不会再逃避了，" 真嗣说。"

"I will try my hardest," Rei said, not meeting Kaworu's eyes.  
"我会尽全力的，"丽说道，没有直视薰的眼睛。

"Very good," Kaworu said, "Get ready. The End starts now."  
"非常好，" 渚薰说道，"准备好了。终结现在开始。"

### Chapter 15

Her heart beated against her chest, slowly at first, but as the nanoseconds passed on it picked up the pace. There was nothing between her and destiny now. She stood out on the Earth, staring out into oblivion, Toji in her left and Shinji on her right, Rei called down somewhere in the interior layers of NERV headquarters as Commander Ikari had requested.  
她的心跳起初缓慢，但随着每一纳秒的流逝，节奏逐渐加快。现在，她与命运之间已无任何阻隔。她站在地球上，凝视着虚无，左边是冬二，右边是真嗣，而绫波则在 NERV 总部的深处，应碇司令的要求待命。

As Asuka Langley Sohryu waited for what was destined to be her final battle, perhaps her swan song, the events from the previous ten days replayed themselves in her mind over and over again, until they were elementary facts that she could never forget.  
当惣流·明日香·兰格雷等待着注定成为她最后一战，或许是她的天鹅挽歌时，过去十天的事件在她脑海中一遍遍重演，直到它们成为她永远无法忘记的基本事实。

Kaworu had made quite a stir in NERV when he revealed himself to be the final Angel. Commander Ikari wasn't surprised by his arrival, and had almost been expecting it. However, even he was surprised when Kaworu actually decided to help NERV. He told them how Seele had recruited him some time ago in order to help them initiate Instrumentality. He even explained the nature of the project, much to the dismay of Commander Ikari and Commander Fuyutsuki. However, when he revealed Seele's plans of destroying NERV entirely to initiate Third Impact, even the normally stoic Commander Ikari could not hide his outrage.  
渚薰以最终使徒的身份现身时，在 NERV 引起了不小的轰动。碇司令对他的到来并不感到意外，甚至几乎有所预料。然而，当渚薰真的决定帮助 NERV 时，连他也感到惊讶。他告诉他们，Seele 早在一段时间前就招募了他，以协助启动人类补完计划。他甚至解释了该计划的本质，这让碇司令和冬月副司令大为沮丧。但当他揭露 Seele 打算彻底摧毁 NERV 以引发第三次冲击的计划时，就连一向冷静的碇司令也难掩愤怒。

And thus preparations were made at once. Tokyo-3 was evacuated at once. Asuka remembered saying good-bye to Hikari the moment the declaration of evacuation was made. She was in her class, listening to another boring lecture from their teacher. Upon hearing that the town was to be evacuated, Hikari ran to Asuka, a desperate expression on her face.  
于是，准备工作立即展开。第三新东京市迅速疏散。明日香记得在疏散令下达的那一刻与光告别。她当时正在教室里，听着老师又一次无聊的讲课。一听到城市即将疏散的消息，光便冲向明日香，脸上带着绝望的表情。

"Is there an Angel?" Hikari asked, "This doesn't sound like the usual announcement they make. It's more relaxed and laid back."  
“是有使徒吗？”光问道，“这听起来不像他们通常的通告。它更轻松随意。”

"Well, the threat is coming in a few days from now, so it isn't like you're in immediate danger," Asuka replied, tensely.  
“嗯，威胁几天后才会到来，所以你并不是立即处于危险之中，”明日香紧张地回答。

"What's going on?" “发生了什么？”

"You may hear a lot of things in the future, but this is what we know," Asuka replied, "An organization named Seele, which apparently is in charge of NERV, is planning on doing something that could cause a Third Impact."  
"你将来可能会听到很多事情，但这是我们所知的，" 明日香回答道，"一个名为 Seele 的组织，显然是 NERV 的掌控者，正计划进行某种可能导致第三次冲击的事件。"

"Third Impact? But I thought Second Impact was caused by a meteor."  
"第三次冲击？但我以为第二次冲击是由陨石引起的。"

"Not enough time to explain that. When you get back, I'll tell you about that. All you need to know is that if Third Impact happens, everything on this planet will be ruined. Humanity will merge into one unit, and Hell on Earth will reign."  
"没时间解释那个了。等你回来，我会告诉你详情。你现在需要知道的是，如果第三次冲击发生，这颗星球上的一切都将被毁灭。人类将融合为一体，地球将变成地狱。"

At this statement, Hikari's eyes widened with fear. She staggered back a few steps as she said, tensely, "So they'd destroy the planet?"  
听到这话，光的眼中闪过一丝恐惧，她踉跄地后退了几步，紧张地问道：“所以他们会毁灭这颗星球吗？”

"Exactly." “正是如此。”

"But why?" "但是为什么？"

"They believe this is the next stage in human evolution. I think that's a load of BS, but that's just me."  
“他们认为这是人类进化的下一阶段。我觉得这纯属胡扯，但那只是我的看法。”

"How are you acting so calm about it? Are you going to stop them?"  
“你怎么能这么冷静？你打算阻止他们吗？”

"All of NERV is planning a counter-attack as we speak," Asuka replied, "And all of the pilots—"  
"此刻，NERV 全体正在策划反击，" 明日香回答道，"所有的驾驶员——"

"Even Toji?" "连真嗣也去？"

"Yes, even Toji." "是的，连真嗣也去。"

Hikari ran a hand up her bangs as sweat billowed onto her forehead. "Oh God." Tears welled up in her eyes as the other students vacated the room, save for Hikari, Asuka, Shinji, Rei, and Toji. Hikari turned to face Toji, tears in her eyes. She dove against his chest, holding him close to her, as though she would never have a chance again in her lifetime to ever hold him. And Toji accepted her body, holding her close to him, as though this would be their final union.  
光用手指梳理着额前的刘海，汗水不断涌上额头。“哦，天哪。”泪水在她的眼中打转，其他学生都离开了房间，只剩下光、明日香、真嗣、丽和冬二。光转向冬二，眼中含泪。她扑进他的怀里，紧紧抱住他，仿佛这一生再无机会拥抱他。而冬二也接纳了她的身体，紧紧拥抱着她，仿佛这是他们最后的结合。

Perhaps it would. 或许真是如此。

"I'll come back for you," Toji said, "So don't worry about a thing, okay?"  
“我会回来找你的，”冬二说，“所以别担心任何事，好吗？”

"Just promise me you don't die!" Hikari cried, "Please. Promise me."  
“就答应我你不会死！”光流着泪喊道，“求你了，答应我。”

"I promise," Toji said. “我答应你，”冬二说道。

Hikari glanced back at Asuka, who was staring at her with a look of sincere sorrow. Hikari and Toji had reminded Asuka of the very real possibility of her dying. Never before had that possibility been so evident as it was now. With every Angel attack, she had put her life on the line, and yet she had never appreciated just what came with life. What existence lasted beyond death, to prove that she ever existed? Her reputation alone was not enough. She had to have something. She couldn't endure bleak oblivion after her body turned to ash. She prayed to whatever God there was that she wouldn't die, that she'd live long enough to see Hikari's face again.  
光回头看向明日香，她正带着真挚的悲伤凝视着她。光和冬二让明日香想起了自己可能死亡的现实。以前从未像现在这样明显。每次与使徒的战斗，她都冒着生命危险，然而她从未真正理解生命的意义。什么能证明她存在过，超越死亡的存在？仅凭名声是不够的。她必须拥有些什么。她无法忍受在化为灰烬后陷入空虚的虚无。她向任何可能存在的神祈祷，希望自己不会死，希望能活到再次见到光的那一天。

To see her friend smile with Toji.  
看到她的朋友与冬二一起微笑。

To see Misato laugh again.  
看到美里再次笑起来。

To see Rei reading serenely alongside Asuka.  
看到丽与明日香静静地并肩阅读。

To see Shinji in her arms.  
看到真嗣在她怀中。

Hikari was eventually escorted out of the room by officials making sure all the civilians had vacated the building. By the time Hikari had been sent out of the city, Asuka had shed more than a few tears over her friend. What if she never saw her again? What if she'd never see Hikari's face one last time? The knowledge that in a matter of days she could die was a very real, very scary, downright horrific piece of information that she wished she had never learned about. She'd rather die suddenly and unexpectedly than know that she was about to die alongside her comrades fighting a battle to save everyone. That if she died, if she fell, then the entire planet, Hikari included, risked potential annihilation.  
光最终被官员护送出房间，确保所有平民已撤离大楼。当光被送出城市时，明日香为她的朋友流下了不止一次的泪水。如果她再也见不到她怎么办？如果她再也见不到光的最后一面怎么办？几天内她可能死亡的事实，是一个非常真实、非常可怕、极其恐怖的信息，她宁愿从未知晓。她宁愿突然意外地死去，也不愿知道她将与战友们一起战斗，为了拯救所有人而面临死亡。如果她死去，如果她倒下，那么整个星球，包括光，都面临着潜在的毁灭风险。

She couldn't bare that knowledge.  
她无法承受这个事实。

"Well," Dr. Tamako said, on their final session together before the big event, "What you are dealing with right now is too great a responsibility for any one person to bare. That's my expert advice."  
"嗯，" 在大型活动前的最后一次会面中，田子博士说道，"你现在面对的责任太过重大，任何一个人都无法独自承担。这是我的专业建议。"

"That doesn't really help matters, you know."  
"这并没有真正解决问题，你知道的。"

"I suppose it wouldn't, no. However, I hope at least you do receive comfort in the knowledge that you yourself don't need to bare it alone."  
"我想确实不会，不。不过，我希望至少你能从知道你不必独自承担这一点中得到些许安慰。"

"What do you mean?" Asuka's head perked up, curiosity enticing her.  
"你什么意思？" 明日香的头抬了起来，好奇心引诱着她。

"You need to rely on your friends," Dr. Tamako said, "They're all suffering the same burden as you are. To each endure it alone is madness. If you pool your efforts together and confide in one another, maybe the pain will alleviate somewhat."  
"你需要依靠你的朋友，"田子博士说，"他们和你一样都在承受着同样的重担。各自独自忍受是疯狂的。如果你们齐心协力，相互倾诉，或许痛苦会减轻一些。"

"Thanks for the advice," Asuka replied.  
"谢谢你的建议，"明日香回答道。

"Listen, Asuka," Dr. Tamako said, slowly, "This may be the last time I talk to you."  
"听着，明日香，" 玉子博士缓缓地说，"这可能是我最后一次和你说话了。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"I just want to ask you something important. Please, respond truthfully. If Instrumentality comes to pass, I'll know whether or not you were lying."  
"我只想问你一些重要的事情。请诚实地回答。如果人类补完计划真的发生了，我会知道你是否在说谎。"

"What's the question?" “问题是什么？”

"Are you happy?" “你快乐吗？”

Asuka stared at her. Was she happy? What kind of question was that to ask when the planet faced annihilation? Was she happy? Why would Dr. Tamako ask her that at a time like this? Was she happy? What was Dr. Tamako playing at, expecting her to be able to respond to such a ridiculous question at such an inappropriate time? Was she happy? Did Dr. Tamako simply expect Asuka to answer that now, with the weight of the world on her shoulders?  
明日香盯着她。她快乐吗？在地球面临毁灭之际，这种问题算什么？她快乐吗？为什么玉子博士会在这种时候问她这个？她快乐吗？玉子博士到底在玩什么把戏，指望她在如此不合时宜的时刻回答这么荒谬的问题？她快乐吗？玉子博士是否就指望明日香现在回答这个，肩负着世界的重担？

But what she happy? 但她真的快乐吗？

Asuka considered this. Ever since the weight of her past had alleviated off of her shoulders, ever since she had accepted her faults, ever since Rei had become her friend, ever since she had let go of her arrogant pride, ever since she let Shinji become her lover, she had not felt the same misery that had permeated throughout her life up until that point. No longer did she have those horrid flashbacks of her mother and the doll hanging side-by-side from the ceiling. No longer did she hold tearful memories inside of her while internalizing all of her pain. No longer did she have to endure Hell alone while everyone around her regarded her as a demon.  
明日香思索着。自从她过去的重担从肩上卸下，自从她接受了自身的错误，自从绫波成为她的朋友，自从她放下了傲慢的自尊，自从她让真嗣成为她的恋人，她就不再感受到那种一直困扰她直到那时的生活中的痛苦。不再有那些可怕的闪回，母亲和玩偶并排挂在天花板上。不再将泪水和记忆深藏心底，不再独自承受地狱般的折磨，而周围的人却视她为恶魔。

"I think I am happy," Asuka said, slowly.  
“我想我是快乐的，”明日香缓缓说道。

"As long as you are happy, Asuka, I'm sure that you'll win. Happiness is the key that will lead you to success. I pray you see that, Asuka. I think that you're ready for whatever awaits you. May God be with you."  
"只要你能快乐，明日香，我相信你一定会赢。快乐是通往成功的钥匙。我祈祷你能明白这一点，明日香。我想你已经准备好面对即将到来的一切。愿上帝与你同在。"

It was on the final day before the battle that she met with Kaworu, to talk to the final Angel. She had not actually spoken to Kaworu since their confrontation at the start of this mess. But now more than ever, she needed to know the answer to a question that had been bothering her ever since Hikari left.  
在战斗前的最后一天，她与渚薰见面，与最后的使徒交谈。自从这场混乱开始时他们的对峙以来，她实际上一直没有和渚薰说过话。但现在比以往任何时候，她都需要知道一个自从光离开后就一直困扰她的问题的答案。

"Kaworu, what's death like?"  
"渚薰，死亡是什么样的？"

"Death?" Kaworu replied, smiling a broken smile, "Why ask me, a soul who has yet to die?"  
“死亡？”渚薰回以一个破碎的微笑，“为何问我，一个尚未逝去的灵魂？”

"You are an Angel, aren't you?" Asuka replied.  
"你是个天使，不是吗？" 明日香回答道。

"Not one of your Angels from Christianity, I'm afraid," Kaworu said with a sigh, "We are simply possible versions of what you Lilim could have appeared like. You Lilim manifest your AT fields in the form of individual bodies to house your souls. When you die, your souls will unite in a realm beyond my comprehension. I could never describe it, as I have never been there. All I can tell you, though, is that whatever shell your body occupies on the other side, it will manifest the way you wish it to manifest."  
"恐怕不是你们基督教中的天使，" 渚薰叹息道，"我们只是你们人类可能成为的另一种形态。你们人类以个体身体的形式展现 AT 力场来容纳灵魂。当你们死去时，灵魂会在我无法理解的领域中合一。我无法描述它，因为我从未去过那里。尽管如此，我能告诉你的就是，无论你在另一边占据何种躯壳，它都会以你希望的方式显现。"

"Well, that doesn't answer too many questions now, does it?" Asuka asked.  
"嗯，这并没有解答太多问题，不是吗？" 明日香问道。

Kaworu chuckled. "I suppose not. I answered your question with a conundrum."  
渚薰轻笑。"我想是的。我用一个谜题回答了你的问题。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Are you afraid of death, Asuka?" Kaworu asked, sincerely.  
"你害怕死亡吗，明日香？" 渚薰真诚地问道。

"I am." "我是。"

"Why? Don't you believe in a soul?"  
"为什么？你不相信灵魂吗？"

"Yes, I do." "是的，我相信。"

"A soul that lives on after your Lilim shell has decayed into nothingness?"  
"一个在你莉莉姆之躯腐朽成虚无后仍存活的灵魂？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Well then, you have nothing to fear now. Once you die, you will survive into the next life, whatever that next life might be."  
"那么，你现在没什么好怕的了。一旦你死去，你将在下一世中存活，无论那下一世是什么样的。"

"I guess that does give me some sort of comfort," Asuka replied, shrugging.  
“我想这确实让我感到些许安慰。”明日香回答道，耸了耸肩。

"That's good. I'd hope that you are well for tomorrow. If you are, then you should integrate well with your Eva. All the cards are in your favor. Had you not been told of this, you would have fought the MP Evas all alone, and even parried them off for some time before succumbing yourself."  
"那很好。我希望你明天能状态良好。如果确实如此，那么你应该能与你的 Eva 很好地融合。一切有利条件都在你这边。若非事先告知你这些，你本会独自对抗那些 MP Evas，甚至在一段时间内还能抵挡住它们，最终才力竭而败。"

"How do you know that?"  
"你怎么知道的？"

Kaworu grinned, "That is a secret I cannot explain. All you need to know is that, had you fought the enemy alone, while you would have put up an epic fight, you would have eventually fallen and died. Together, with three Evas—"  
渚薰笑了笑，"那是个我无法解释的秘密。你只需要知道，如果你独自对抗敌人，尽管你会进行一场史诗般的战斗，但最终你会倒下并死去。而如果三台 EVA 一起——"

"Wait, three? They're four pilots." Asuka didn't get it. Had Kaworu made a mistake counting them? Did he remember that he had met with Shinji, Asuka, and Rei, and did he simply picture those three only when he said the "three Evas" would fight?  
"等等，三台？他们有四名驾驶员。" 明日香没明白。难道是渚薰数错了吗？他是不是只记得与真嗣、明日香和绫波见过面，所以在说"三台 EVA"时只想到这三人？

"They're four pilots, but I think it would be safer if Rei remained in NERV," Kaworu said, "After all, you know just as well as I do that she is a medium that Seele can use to initiate Third Impact. It's best we didn't have a liability like that. Besides, I'm sure three Evas would be enough to ward off the Mass Production Eva assault."  
“他们是四名驾驶员，但我认为如果零留在 NERV 会更安全，”薰说道，“毕竟，你我都很清楚，她是一个媒介，Seele 可以利用她引发第三次冲击。我们最好不要有这样的隐患。此外，我相信三台 Eva 足以抵御量产 Eva 的攻击。”

So Rei wasn't even fighting? During their battles, Rei had been an invaluable asset, no matter how much Asuka had resisted the concept in the past. Rei had helped her defeat that one Angel by firing a rocket straight into its core, had tried to kill Arael as it mind raped Asuka, and was even willing to destroy herself simply to save everyone. She deserved to have a final battle for glory.  
所以零甚至没有参战？在之前的战斗中，零一直是一个不可或缺的助力，无论明日香过去多么抗拒这个概念。零曾帮助她用火箭直接击中那个使徒的核心，试图杀死对明日香进行心灵强暴的 Arael，甚至愿意牺牲自己来拯救所有人。她理应有一场光荣的最终战斗。

No, she didn't need to fear for her life.  
不，她不需要为自己的生命担忧。

"Okay, I understand," Asuka replied, nodding her head.  
“好的，我明白了。”明日香点头回答。

She searched for Rei after speaking to Kaworu, finding her eventually inside of one hallway, her nose in a book. As Asuka grew nearer, she realized Rei was reading the sequel to the book she had given Rei. She smiled as she knelt down besides the First Child, and said, "Hey."  
她与加持交谈后寻找绫波，最终在一处走廊里找到了她，绫波正埋头于一本书中。当明日香走近时，她发现绫波正在读她送给绫波的那本书的续集。她微笑着跪在第一适格者身边，说道：“嘿。”

Rei glanced up to meet her eyes. "Pilot Sohryu."  
绫波抬头与她对视。“惣流驾驶员。”

"Are you feeling okay?" "你感觉还好吗？"

"My condition is suitable at the moment."  
"我现在状态还不错。"

"Good, good." "那就好，那就好。"

Rei glanced back at her book, a weary expression on her face. "Although, I must confess, I am still anxious."  
丽瞥了一眼她的书，脸上带着疲惫的表情。“虽然，我必须承认，我仍然感到焦虑。”

"About tomorrow? You aren't fighting."  
“关于明天？你又不参战。”

"That is not the source of my distress," Rei replied, "The real source of my pain is your safety."  
“那并非我困扰的根源，”丽回答道，“我真正担忧的是你的安全。”

"My safety?" "我的安全？"

"Yes. I am afraid that something will happen to you that can never be undone," Rei replied, sadly, "I just hope you return to home base without a single scratch, triumphant."  
"是的。我担心你会遭遇无法挽回的事情。" 丽回答道，神情悲伤，"我只希望你能毫发无损地凯旋归来。"

"Don't worry. I will!" Asuka waved her off.  
"别担心。我会的！" 明日香挥手让她放心。"

Rei sighed. "Listen, Pilot Sohryu. Someone might try to initiate Third Impact with me."  
丽叹了口气。“听着，碇司令。有人可能会试图利用我来引发第三次冲击。”

"Well, don't worry," Asuka replied, "I just won't let it come to that."  
“嗯，别担心，”明日香回答道，“我绝不会让那种情况发生的。”

"But if it does come to that," Rei said, turning to face Asuka again, her eyes determined, "I want you to promise me that you will do everything you can to keep me from initiating Third Impact."  
“但如果真的到了那一步，”丽转过身再次面对明日香，眼神坚定，“我要你答应我，你会尽一切可能阻止我引发第三次冲击。”

"Sure, no problem," Asuka nodded. It wasn't like she was just going to allow the Earth to be laid to waste. Surely all Asuka needed to do was to remove the Angel from Rei's body. Couldn't be that terribly hard, right?  
"当然，没问题，" 明日香点头道。她不可能坐视地球被毁灭。显然，明日香需要做的就是将使徒从绫波体内移除。应该不会太难，对吧？

"Even if it means killing me?"  
"即使这意味着要杀了我？"

Asuka's eyes widened. Killing her? Surely it wouldn't come to that. Why would Asuka actually need to kill Rei? She couldn't think of a single reason why Rei would need to die in order to save the world. The idea was ridiculous. "Rei, I don't think it would come to that."  
明日香的双眼瞪大了。杀了她？肯定不会到那一步的。为什么明日香真的需要杀死丽呢？她想不出任何一个理由，说明为了拯救世界丽必须死。这个想法太荒谬了。“丽，我觉得不会到那一步的。”

"But if it does?" “但如果真的到了那一步呢？”

"I don't know." “我不知道。”

"I need you to promise!"  
"我需要你承诺！"

Asuka had never seen Rei this passionate before. However, Asuka soon realized that this determination was nothing more than terror. Rei's joints were shivering violently as she stared determinedly into Asuka's eyes, the seriousness and passion clear for any mortal to see.  
绫波从未像现在这样充满激情。然而，明日香很快意识到，这种决心不过是恐惧的表现。绫波的关节在剧烈颤抖，她坚定地凝视着明日香的眼睛，那份严肃和激情清晰可见。

"Alright," Asuka said, simply to humor her, "I'll do whatever it takes."  
"好吧，" 明日香说，只是为了安抚她，"我会尽一切努力。"

"Thank you, Pilot Sohryu," Rei replied, smiling a smile that Rei rarely showed.  
"谢谢你，碇司令，" 丽回答道，露出了一个丽很少展示的微笑。

"You know, you could just call me Asuka. It would probably be easier on the tongue, you know?"  
"你知道，你可以直接叫我明日香。这样可能更容易说出口，不是吗？"

Rei nodded, smiling still, "Okay, Asuka."  
丽点点头，笑容依旧，"好的，明日香。"

And so now Asuka waited, patiently inside of her Eva, staring out at the skyline, waiting for the enemy, Toji and Shinji at her side. She inhaled, slowly, as the fear consumed her. Today was the day. In a matter of minutes, she could be dead. In a matter of minutes, she could save the planet. In a matter of minutes, the world would change for the better or for the worse.  
于是，此刻的明日香在她的 EVA 里耐心等待，凝视着天际线，等待着敌人的到来，真治和薰在她身旁。她缓缓吸气，恐惧逐渐吞噬着她。今天就是那一天。几分钟之内，她可能就会死去。几分钟之内，她可能拯救这颗星球。几分钟之内，世界将变得更好或更糟。

"Asuka," Shinji said, "Listen. I'm afraid."  
“明日香，”真治说，“听着。我害怕。”

"I know," Asuka replied, "So am I."  
“我知道，”明日香回答，“我也是。”

"Don't leave me out of this," Toji snarled, "I'm about to piss my pants."  
"别把我排除在外，" 东治咆哮道，"我快吓尿了。"

"Like I really needed to hear that," Asuka chuckled, forcing a grin.  
“像我真的很需要听到那个似的，”明日香轻笑一声，强装出笑容。

"We'll make it," Shinji said, "I pray we will."  
“我们会成功的，”真嗣说，“我祈祷我们能。”

"Sometimes prayers aren't enough," Asuka sighed, "If you want a miracle, you have to make it happen yourself!"  
“有时候祈祷是不够的，”明日香叹息道，“如果你想要奇迹，就得自己动手去创造！”

"Yeah," Shinji replied, nodding.  
"嗯，" 真嗣回答，点了点头。

"Your Eva, Shinji, you said it had your mom's soul in it?" Toji asked.  
"你的 Eva，真嗣，你说过里面有你妈妈的灵魂？" 冬二问道。

"What? Where did that come from?" Asuka asked, raising an eyebrow.  
"什么？这从哪儿冒出来的？" 明日香问道，扬起了一边的眉毛。

"I need to know," Toji replied, "I just thought of something."  
"我需要知道，" 冬二回答，"我刚刚想到了一些事情。"

"You can think? Shocking."  
"你会思考？真令人震惊。"

"Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? I'm not some sort of idiot, you Demon!"  
"嘿！你这是什么意思！？我可不是什么白痴，你这个恶魔！"

"Oh, excuse me." "哦，抱歉。"

"Well," Shinji replied, "My mother's soul is within Unit-01."  
"嗯，" 真嗣回答，"我母亲的灵魂就在初号机里。"

"And Rei's Eva lacked a soul because she didn't have a mother?"  
"这么说，丽的 Eva 缺少灵魂是因为她没有母亲？"

"Yeah," Shinji replied, unsure what Toji was getting at.  
"嗯，" 真嗣回答，不太明白东治想表达什么。"

"And my mother died," Toji replied, "And Asuka, you said your mother died?"  
"而我母亲去世了，" 东治回答，"还有，明日香，你说过你母亲也去世了？"

"Yeah. She hung herself," Asuka replied, simply. She dully noticed that she didn't have a flashback to that night. She was grateful for that much.  
“是的。她上吊自杀了。”明日香简单地回答。她呆呆地注意到自己并没有回想起那个夜晚。对此她感到一丝庆幸。

"And Asuka, your mother went crazy after doing something to Unit-02?"  
“那么，明日香，你母亲在做了某件事后，对二号机发疯了？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"And Shinji, your mother disappeared doing something to Unit-01?"  
“那么，真嗣，你母亲是在对初号机进行某项操作时消失的吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"What if every Eva contains the souls of—"  
"如果每一台 Eva 都包含了灵魂——"

"What are you three yapping about?!" Misato's voice snapped Asuka out of the conversation. Her serious face appeared on her monitor, staring back at the Three Pilots with a look of anxiety on her face.  
"你们三个在嘀咕什么呢？！" 美里的话音打断了明日香，她的严肃面孔出现在屏幕上，焦虑地盯着三位驾驶员。

"Nothing serious," Toji replied.  
"没什么大事，" 真嗣回答道。

"Good. Are you all ready?"  
"很好。你们都准备好了吗？"

"What kind of a question is that?" Asuka snapped, "We're here, aren't we?"  
"这算什么问题？" 明日香厉声道，"我们不就在这儿吗？"

"She's right," Shinji said, "I mean, I'd rather that it wouldn't come to this, but I'm certainly ready."  
"她说得对，" 真嗣说，"我是说，我宁愿事情不会发展到这一步，但我确实已经准备好了。"

"I don't want to see Hikari in pain," Toji replied, "If it means suffering myself a little, I think that's a good price to pay."  
"我不想看到 Hikari 受苦，" 东治回答，"如果这意味着我得稍微承受一些痛苦，我认为这是值得付出的代价。"

"Well, reports say that the attack is imminent. Expect the army to attack first, and then they'll send in the big guns."  
"嗯，报告称攻击迫在眉睫。预计军队会先发起进攻，随后他们会派出重型武器。"

"Okay, that should be fairly—"  
"好的，那应该相对——"

"JSSDF forces detected outside city borders," Maya shouted, "Attack is imminent!"  
"JSSDF 部队在城市边界外被探测到，" 真希波喊道，"攻击迫在眉睫！"

"Okay, here we go," Asuka snarled, withdrawing a rifle from beside her, "You ready?"  
"好了，我们开始吧，" 明日香咆哮着，从她旁边抽出一支步枪，"准备好了吗？"

"Yeah!" Shinji replied, aiming his own rifle at another point to the side of the city.  
"嗯！" 真嗣回应道，将他的步枪瞄准城市另一侧的某个点。

"Right behind ya!" Toji aimed a rocket launcher at the oncoming forces.  
"就在你后面！" 冬二瞄准了迎面而来的敌军，举起火箭筒。

"Okay, go!" Misato shouted.  
“好，去吧！”美里喊道。

### Chapter 16

The JSSDF forces had formed a massive ocean around Tokyo-3. Tanks, jets, and foot soldiers raced toward the epicenter of the city, perhaps praying that they could penetrate the Geofront and infiltrate NERV. It did not matter what there intentions were, however. The moment their eyes landed on the trio of Evas standing before them, they stopped in their steps, staring up at the gargantuan monsters with mingled expressions of fear and astonishment.  
日本自衛隊已將第三新東京市團團包圍，如同一片汪洋大海。坦克、戰機與步兵疾馳向城市的中心，或許在祈禱能夠突破地底都市，滲透進 NERV 總部。然而，無論他們的意圖為何，當他們的目光落在眼前那三台 EVA 身上時，所有人都停下了腳步，仰望著這些巨型怪物，臉上混雜著恐懼與驚愕的表情。

It was time. 是時候了。

"Alright you three. Expand your AT Fields on the count of three, okay?" Misato's voice came crystal clear inside of each of their entry plugs. "One, two, THREE!"  
「好了，你們三個。數到三時展開 AT 力場，好嗎？」美里清晰的聲音在每個插入栓內響起。「一、二、三！」

Upon the "th" of three, the three pilots reacted. A gigantic field of orange energy exploded out of their bodies, flying around and between the buildings in the way, and enveloping the JSSDF. In a flash of light, the soldiers were thrown into the air, some of their bodies ripped to shreds so that their organs spiraled into the sky. In a flash of light, the tanks exploded into a brilliant nova that consumed them and the soldiers around them. In a flash of light, jets spiraled out of control, slamming into the ground, their gas engines igniting so that upon landing their shells exploded into a brilliant nimbus of orange and white.  
在三者之‘三’时刻，三位驾驶员做出了反应。巨大的橙色能量场从他们体内爆发出来，穿梭于建筑物之间，将自卫队团团包围。一瞬间，光芒闪耀，士兵们被抛向空中，有些身体被撕裂，内脏随之飞旋入天。一瞬间，坦克化为耀眼的超新星，吞噬了它们和周围的士兵。一瞬间，喷气机失控旋转，撞向地面，其燃气引擎引燃，着陆时外壳炸裂成橙白相间的光环。

Asuka exhaled slowly as the AT Field dissolved into nothingness. The entire landscape had not changed, save for the earth pot marked with miniature craters from the exploding tanks and planes. A smile spread across Asuka's lips as she laughed, "Damn! These guys are wimps!"  
随着 AT 力场消散于无形，明日香缓缓呼出一口气。除了地面因坦克和飞机爆炸而布满微型弹坑外，整个景象未有变化。明日香嘴角上扬，笑出声来，“该死！这些家伙真是弱爆了！”

"Aren't there supposed to be Evas fighting us as well?" Toji asked, tensely.  
“不是应该有 EVA 和我们战斗吗？”真嗣紧张地问道。

"Yeah." Shinji nodded in approval with Toji from his own Eva. "We aren't out of this yet."  
"嗯。" 真嗣从自己的 EVA 中点头赞同了冬二。"我们还没输呢。"

Asuka knew they were right. The real fight was still ahead of them. These JSSDF soldiers now knew who they were dealing with. It was only a mater of time until they sent the big guns to extinguish them all. And, as Asuka looked up to the sky, she could see those big guns descending from Heaven, gliding down to Earth upon angelic feathered wings.  
明日香知道他们说得对。真正的战斗还在前方。这些 JSSDF 士兵现在知道了他们的对手是谁。只是时间问题，他们会派出重武器来消灭他们。而且，当明日香抬头望向天空时，她可以看到那些重武器正从天而降，如同天使的羽翼般滑翔至地球。

"They're here!" Toji snarled.  
"他们来了！" 冬二咆哮道。"

"Alright," Asuka smirked, "You know, for a moment I thought this was going to be boring and all."  
“好吧，”明日香微微一笑，“你知道吗，有那么一会儿，我还以为这会无聊透顶呢。”

"Well, don't worry," Shinji replied, tensely, "This fight is going to be anything but boring."  
“别担心，”真嗣紧张地回答，“这场战斗绝对不会无聊的。”

The MP Evas landed on the floor, nine in total, their wings folding back into their backs. Drunkenly, they rose to their full height, and turned to face the three Evas in the center of the city. Asuka had to admit that these Evas had to be by far the ugliest things she had ever seen. Their heads were phallic, white and grotesque with huge red lips and tongues hanging from their teeth. They had no eyes, which added to their hideous nature. Their smooth shells were soft, not at all like their own Eva's hard, robotic exterior. And, on top of it all, their expression was hungry.  
"那些 MP Evas 降落在地面上，总共有九架，它们的翅膀折叠回背部。它们摇摇晃晃地站直了身子，转向城市中心的三架 Eva。明日香不得不承认，这些 Eva 绝对是有史以来她见过的最丑陋的东西。它们的头部呈生殖器状，白色且畸形，巨大的红色嘴唇和舌头从牙齿间垂下。它们没有眼睛，这更增添了它们的丑陋。它们光滑的外壳柔软，与自己 Eva 坚硬、机械化的外表截然不同。而且，最重要的是，它们的表情充满了饥饿感。”

"What the Hell?" Asuka mumbled, staring at the disgusting freaks. After all, why would Seele create such disgusting creatures? Was there a purpose to making them so grotesque? Did they just enjoy making creatures with heads that looked like huge penises with lips? Well, not enough time to think about things like that now.  
"搞什么鬼？" 明日香咕哝着，盯着那些令人作呕的怪物。毕竟，Seele 为什么要创造出这么恶心的生物呢？制造它们如此丑陋有什么目的吗？难道他们只是喜欢创造那些头部看起来像巨大阴茎带嘴唇的生物？唉，现在没时间去想这些了。

"Alright," Asuka laughed, "We'll each fight three of them, divide the work up some. Deal?"  
"好吧，" 明日香笑道，"我们每人对付三个，分摊一下工作。成交？"

"Sounds like a plan if you ask me," Toji replied.  
"听起来不错，如果你问我的话，" 东治回答道。

"I agree," Shinji nodded.  
"我同意，" 真嗣点头道。

Suddenly, from the sky, nine massive blades descended from the sky, landing at each of the MP Eva's sides. The two sided blades were wrenched from the floor as each Eva extended their grubby claws and received their gift from the skies. Asuka felt sickened. Just their movement alone was disgusting. Enough to make her puke.  
突然，天空中降下了九把巨大的刀刃，分别落在每台量产型 EVA 的两侧。这些双刃从地面被拔出，每台 EVA 伸出肮脏的爪子，接住了来自天空的馈赠。明日香感到一阵恶心。光是它们移动的样子就令人作呕。足以让她想吐。

Enough to make her want to kill them all!  
足以让她想把它们全部消灭！

Asuka sprinted toward the three dead center from her. She leapt into the air, evading one of the MP Eva's blades, as she landed on its chest, dead center. The fiend stumbled backwards as Asuka grabbed its disgusting skull, squeezing the life out of it between her massive claws. She could feel its structure in her hands, feel the bones and armor giving way to her sheer strength, before it exploded like a wet watermelon in her hands, blood splattering over her body.  
明日香朝着正前方的三台 EVA 疾驰而去。她一跃而起，躲过其中一台量产型 EVA 的刀刃，稳稳落在其胸前正中央。那怪物踉跄后退，明日香则一把抓住它那令人作呕的头颅，用巨大的爪子将其生命力挤出。她能感受到手中的结构，骨头和装甲在她的强大力量下屈服，最终像湿透的西瓜一样在她手中爆裂，鲜血四溅，染遍全身。

One of the MP Evas swung their blade down upon Asuka. She kicked off of her victim, allowing the blade to slice straight into his pewter hide. As purple blood splattered into the air, Asuka expanded her AT Field, sharply. The two MP Evas were thrown into the ground as Asuka landed, helpless to defend themselves. Asuka turned to the fallen MP Eva, and grabbed his great blade. Before the two enemies could rise again, Asuka pinned one to the floor with the blade, stabbing straight through its chest, perhaps straight through its entry plug.  
一台量产型 EVA 挥刀向明日香劈来。她从受害者身上一蹬而起，让刀刃直插入其铅灰色的皮肤。紫色的血液四溅之际，明日香猛然扩张了自己的 AT 力场。两台量产型 EVA 被抛向地面，无力自卫。明日香转身面向倒地的量产型 EVA，一把抓住它的大刀。在两个敌人再次起身之前，明日香用刀将其一钉在地上，直刺穿胸膛，或许连插入栓也一并贯穿。

She would have stabbed the other one, but that too had risen, and was now sprinting toward Asuka with its blade. It swung wildly, only to nick Asuka across the arm. Asuka felt pain surge up to her arm. At first, she shrugged it off as nothing, seeing how it was just her senses feeling exactly what the Eva felt. However, it was when she felt blood on the underside of her plug suit that she felt fear rise up her body.  
她本想刺向另一个使徒，但那家伙也站了起来，正挥舞着刀刃向明日香冲来。它疯狂地挥砍，仅在明日香的手臂上划出一道口子。明日香感到一阵剧痛涌上手臂。起初，她并未在意，毕竟这只是 EVA 感受到的痛楚传递给了她。然而，当她感觉到插入栓服下渗出的血迹时，恐惧感开始在她体内蔓延。

Was she hurt? This wasn't possible. After all, things like that didn't happen. Her senses were integrated with Eva. That was it. She didn't get hurt like the Eva did in combat, right? Right? This was absurd! Ridiculous! But then again, what if being highly integrated with Eva resulted in things like this? She had reached 99.9% integration when Areal had first integrated with her, right?  
她受伤了吗？这不可能。毕竟，这种事不应该发生。她的感官与 EVA 同步。就是这样。她不会像 EVA 在战斗中那样受伤，对吧？对吧？这太荒谬了！荒唐至极！但话说回来，如果与 EVA 的高度融合导致了这种情况呢？当 Areal 首次与她融合时，她的同步率达到了 99.9%，对吧？

This wasn't fair! 这不公平！

The MP Eva lunched at Asuka, abandoning its blade. It smashed Asuka to the ground, causing a nearby skyscraper to tumble down upon the MP Eva's back. Its AT Field reduced the building to harmless ashes. Asuka could feel the weight on her chest, constricting her breathing tremendously. The MP Eva reached up towards the sky, its fingers long and pointy, ready to plunge straight into her chest.  
MP 使徒 Eva 放弃了它的刀刃，猛地将明日香击倒在地。一座附近的大厦随之坍塌，压在了 MP 使徒 Eva 的背上。它的 AT 力场将建筑物化为无害的灰烬。明日香能感受到胸口的沉重，呼吸变得异常困难。MP 使徒 Eva 伸向天空，它的手指细长尖锐，准备直插她的胸膛。

"I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die!"  
“我不会死。我不会死。我不会死！”

Asuka extended her hand sharply, reaching the MP Eva's shoulder. With a sharp twist, the shoulder snapped off, purple blood flying in all directions as she slammed the MP Eva into a nearby building. The building tumbled down upon him, only this time no AT Field turned it to ash.  
明日香迅速伸出双手，抓住 MP 使徒 Eva 的肩膀。她用力一扭，肩膀断裂，紫色的血液四溅，同时将 MP 使徒 Eva 猛击到附近的一座建筑物上。建筑物倒塌在他身上，但这次没有 AT 力场将其化为灰烬。

"My three are down!" Asuka snarled, tossing the arm off to the side.  
"我的三个已经倒下了！" 明日香咆哮着，将那条手臂甩到一旁。

"Same here," Shinji replied.  
"我这边也一样，" 真嗣回答道。

"Mine are good too!" Toji laughed.  
"我的也都没问题！" 东治笑着说。

Asuka was disappointed. She had expected more of a fight. These pathetic lumps of metal had only caused a small cut. Despite that one close call she had with the last one, the fight had been fairly simple. Granted, she didn't want the world destroyed either, but she would have liked a more intense fight.  
明日香感到失望。她本期待一场更激烈的战斗。这些可怜的金属块只造成了一道小伤口。尽管她与最后一个差点擦肩而过，但战斗其实相当简单。当然，她也不希望世界被毁灭，但她本希望能有一场更紧张刺激的战斗。

"Asuka! Behind you!" Shinji screamed.  
“明日香！在你后面！”真嗣尖叫道。

Asuka spun around just in time to see the ruins of the skyscraper fly into the sky, only ashes remaining, as the fallen MP Eva sprinted toward her, a single arm extended behind its head. Asuka acted on sheer instinct. She ducked down, beneath the blade, and slammed her fist straight through the Eva's chest! Purple blood splattered out of his body as the fist penetrated its shell. She threw the Eva through the air, into another skyscraper, and then another, until four buildings had been leveled as the foe slammed through each consecutive building.  
明日香及时转身，正好看到摩天大楼的废墟飞向天空，只剩下灰烬，而倒下的 MP Eva 正向她冲来，一只手臂伸向脑后。明日香凭直觉行动。她蹲下身，躲过刀刃，一拳直击 Eva 的胸膛！紫色血液从其体内喷溅而出，拳头穿透了它的外壳。她将 Eva 抛向空中，撞进另一座摩天大楼，然后又一座，直到连续四座建筑被夷为平地，敌人一路撞穿每一座建筑。

Asuka turned to her comrades to see them too repelling the MP Evas. Asuka didn't get it. Did their fail to finish the job right? Did they miss something vital? Asuka turned around to see, with sinking horror, the two MP Evas she had defeated rising to heir feet, looking at her with a hungry expression. Asuka noticed that their wounds had not necessarily healed so much as their bodies worked around their injuries. For example, the Eva with the shattered skull still had a shattered skull, but was still operating without it.  
明日香转向她的同伴们，看到他们也在击退 MP 使徒。明日香不明白。是他们没有完成任务吗？他们遗漏了什么关键的东西吗？明日香转身一看，惊恐地发现她击败的两台 MP 使徒正缓缓站起，用饥饿的眼神盯着她。明日香注意到，它们的伤口并没有真正愈合，而是身体在绕过这些伤害运作。比如，那个头骨粉碎的使徒，头骨依然粉碎，但仍然在无头骨的情况下运作。

And then it all made sense.  
然后一切都变得清晰了。

"Guys! Try to dismember the Evas!" Asuka shouted.  
“大家！试着肢解这些使徒！”明日香大声喊道。

"Dismember?" Toji shrieked.  
"肢解？" 真嗣尖叫道。

"I get it!" Shinji replied, desperately.  
"我明白了！" 真嗣急切地回答。

"Do you?" "你真的知道吗？"

Asuka turned to see a figure rise up from the Earth. A small white figure glanced back at each and every Eva, be it friend or foe, as it levitated at the Eva's eye level. With an expression of surprise, Asuka stammered, "Kaworu?"  
明日香转身看到一个身影从地球上升起。一个白色的小身影悬浮在使徒们的视线高度，回头看向每一个 EVA，无论是敌是友。明日香带着惊讶的表情结巴道："渚薰？"

Just what the hell was Kaworu doing here? Sure, he was an Angel, but what good would he serve in this fight, anyway? What was his purpose here, anyhow? Assuming he even had a purpose. Had he just come to help them, or was there some other motive? Asuka couldn't deny she felt the smallest measure of distrust in her heart toward Kaworu.  
究竟，渚薰在这里做什么？当然，他是使徒，但在这场战斗中他能起到什么作用呢？无论如何，他来这里的目的又是什么？假设他真的有目的。他是来帮助他们的，还是另有动机？明日香不得不承认，她心中对渚薰有着一丝微小的不信任感。

Kaworu drifted over to Shinji. At the moment, he was being forced down to the floor by two MP Evas, one of which had his shoulder ripped to pieces along with a huge hole through his chest. With a flick of Kaworu's finger, the two enemies were blown into the air as a massive AT Field collided into their bodies. Their skulls exploded into an array of purple ink-like blood as they slammed onto the ground, limply.  
渚薰飘向真嗣。此刻，他被两名 MP EVA 压制在地，其中一架 EVA 的肩膀被撕裂，胸口还有一个巨大的洞。渚薰轻轻一弹指，两名敌人便被巨大的 AT 力场击飞到空中。他们的头颅像紫色的墨水般爆裂开来，血肉模糊地摔在地上，无力地躺着。

"I'm afraid to say, my friends," Kaworu said in a soft voice that Asuka could hear from her computer, "That the JSSDF has somehow managed to eliminate your power supply. You have only a few seconds before you run out of power."  
“恐怕我得告诉你们，”渚薰用一种明日香能从电脑中听到的柔和声音说道，“JSSDF 不知怎么地切断了你们的电源。你们只剩下几秒钟的时间了。”

"What?" "什么？"

Asuka hadn't even noticed she was running on external power. She glanced at her computer screen, praying Kaworu was mistaken. Sure enough, however, she had a mere ten seconds left before she was out of power. She felt fear envelop her. She couldn't win like this! She needed her power! She didn't have anything else! If she ran out now, she was dead!  
明日香甚至没注意到自己一直在靠外部电源运行。她瞥了一眼电脑屏幕，祈祷着渚是搞错了。然而，事实摆在眼前，她的电量仅剩十秒。恐惧感瞬间笼罩了她。这样下去她赢不了的！她需要自己的力量！她别无他法！如果现在断电，她就死定了！

"Access your Angelic powers," Kaworu shouted, "That is the only way you can remain at full power without falling."  
“动用你的天使之力，”渚大声喊道，“这是你保持全功率而不倒下的唯一方法。”

Oh, sure! That was easy! Access your Angelic powers. How the Hell would that happen? Arael had never informed Asuka how to tap into his powers. Hell, she didn't even know what to do! Did she saw a few magic words and she had Angel powers? Probably not. In fact, she seriously doubted that was the case at all.  
哦，当然！那很简单！动用你的天使之力。这他妈怎么可能？亚拉尔从未告诉过明日香如何利用他的力量。见鬼，她甚至不知道该怎么做！难道念几句咒语她就能拥有天使的力量吗？大概不会。实际上，她严重怀疑那根本不是真的。

"But what about me?" Shinji responded.  
"但那我呢？" 真嗣回应道。

Kaworu grinned, "I will become one with you, Shinji Ikari."  
渚薰微笑着说，"我将与你合为一体，碇真嗣。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Our infusion would be permanent, eliminating my very existence from this earth while empowering yours. Are you ready?"  
"我们的融合将是永久的，我的存在将从这世上消失，而你的力量将得到增强。你准备好了吗？"

"Just say yes!" Asuka snarled as an MP Eva attacked her from behind. Two seconds left. She didn't have time! She grabbed the MP Eva and threw him into a building before she felt her entire shell grow heavy and powerless.  
“快说好！”明日香咆哮着，一台量产型 EVA 从背后袭击了她。只剩两秒了。她没时间了！她抓住那台量产型 EVA，将其甩进一栋建筑，随即感到自己的整个外壳变得沉重无力。

"Alright!" Shinji screamed.  
“好！”真嗣尖叫道。

There was a flash of brilliant light as Kaworu descended onto Unit-01. His body melded into the Eva as the brilliant nimbus twisted and contorted itself into twelve translucent wings sprouting from Unit-01. Unit-01 drifted into the air, eerily, as a massive roar shattered the silence.  
一道耀眼的光芒闪过，渚薰降落在初号机上。他的身体与 EVA 融合，耀眼的光环扭曲变形，化作十二对透明的翅膀从初号机上伸展出来。初号机飘浮在空中，诡异至极，一声巨响打破了寂静。

As Unit-02's power died away, Asuka watched in horror as the MP Evas turned to face the new Unit-01, hunger filling their contorted faces, or whatever remained of them. They lunged toward Unit-01, latching onto his wings with their claws or mouths! Shinji's scream was audible even without a computer. Asuka felt her heart beat terribly. Shinji was in danger. It did not matter what happened to her, only what happened to Shinji! If Shinji was in pain, she'd never forgive herself!  
随着二号机的能量逐渐消散，明日香惊恐地看着那些 MP Evas 转向新的一号机，扭曲的脸上充满了渴望，或者说它们残存的部分还能表现出这种情感。它们向一号机扑去，用爪子或嘴巴紧紧抓住他的翅膀！即使没有电脑辅助，真嗣的尖叫声也清晰可闻。明日香感到心跳得厉害。真嗣正处于危险之中。无论她自己会发生什么，都无关紧要，重要的是真嗣的安危！如果真嗣痛苦，她永远都不会原谅自己！

"Move! Move! God damn you, just move you useless hunk of metal!" Asuka screamed, slamming her controls furiously.  
“动啊！动啊！该死的，你这没用的废铁快动啊！”明日香尖叫着，愤怒地猛击控制台。

Toji's Eva Unit-03 fell to the Earth, unceremoniously useless. How the Hell was Asuka going to access her Angel powers now? How useful were they when they didn't even work right?! Damn it! She screamed at the Heavens as she begged God just to perform a miracle. If anything in this Universe allow her to move her Eva, she'd do anything. She'd even die if it meant Shinji, and the rest of the world, was alive and well.  
三号机如无仪式般坠落地球，变得毫无用处。明日香现在怎么才能激活她的使徒力量？当这些力量根本不起作用时，它们还有什么用？！该死！她对着天空尖叫，祈求上帝施展奇迹。如果这个宇宙中有什么能让她移动 Eva，她愿意做任何事。哪怕这意味着她会死去，只要真嗣和世界其他地方能安然无恙，她都愿意。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

Asuka glanced up at the sound of her own voice. The entry plug was dark and silent. She was all alone. No one had made a sound. She felt her heartbeat quicken as she glanced around, fearfully. Was someone there with her? Someone nearby willing to help? That had been a woman's voice who had spoken. Was it Arael?  
明日香听到自己的声音，抬头望去。插入栓内一片漆黑寂静。她孤身一人。没有任何声响。她环顾四周，心中恐惧渐增。是否有人与她同在？附近是否有人愿意伸出援手？那是一个女人的声音，刚刚说话的人。会是亚拉尔吗？

"Arael?" “亚拉尔？”

"Not exactly, Asuka." “并非如此，明日香。”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"Arael's powers granted you an increased synch ratio, true. However, Kaworu had been manipulated as well. He believed that by integrating the Angels with the pilots you'd stand a better chance. The moment he integrated with Unit-01, he inadvertently created the tool that Seele wanted to use for Third Impact."  
"Arael 的力量确实提升了你的同步率，没错。但 Kaworu 也同样受到了操纵。他相信通过将使徒与驾驶员融合，你们会有更大的胜算。当他与初号机融合的那一刻，他无意中创造了 Seele 想要用来引发第三次冲击的工具。"

"Just who are you?" "你究竟是谁？"

"Don't you remember me?" "你不记得我了吗？"

Asuka felt warmth fill her body. A soothing warmth. One she had not experienced for her entire life. It was a feeling she thought had died when she was a child. One that had died with her mother.  
明日香感到一股暖流涌遍全身。一种抚慰心灵的温暖。这是她一生中未曾体验过的。她以为这种感觉在她童年时就已消逝，与母亲一同逝去。

And then she was a little child, standing in the middle of a field. Her soft frame glanced up at a woman, who was bending down on one knee, a smile on her face. A loving smile. Serenity filled Asuka as a smile spread across her face. Her eyes wavered in her sockets as a single word became evident in her mind. A single word materialized itself suddenly without warning. A single word that made all right with the world.  
然后她变成了一个小孩子，站在一片田野中央。她娇小的身躯抬头望向一位女子，那女子单膝跪地，面带微笑。一个充满爱意的微笑。明日香心中充满了宁静，脸上也绽放出笑容。她的眼睛在眼眶中微微颤动，一个词突然在她脑海中清晰起来。一个突如其来、毫无预警的词。一个让世界变得美好的词。

"Mama?" “妈妈？”

The world returned to ordinary. She was staring out of her screen at Shinji as power returned to Unit-02. She felt her body rise into the air, sharply, as she heard her mother's voice speak in her ear. "Asuka, I'm sorry I left you."  
世界回归平凡。她透过屏幕凝视着真嗣，随着零二号机重新获得动力。她感到身体猛地升空，与此同时，耳边响起了母亲的声音：“明日香，对不起，我离开了你。”

"Mama! You've been with me this entire time, haven't you?" Asuka cheered, jubilation filling her heart.  
“妈妈！你一直在我身边，对吧？”明日香欢呼雀跃，心中充满了喜悦。

"That's right." "是的。"

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Asuka laughed, as she sprinted toward Unit-01 as it rose into the air.  
“为什么你不早点告诉我？”明日香笑着，朝着升空的零一号机疾奔而去。

"I couldn't. Your feelings kept me from entering your mind."  
"我做不到。你的情感阻止了我进入你的心灵。"

"My feelings?" "我的情感？"

"Yes. Your feelings of regret and sadness rejected my presence. But now that you've let those go, now that you've healed from the hatred in your heart, I can be with you again."  
"是的。你的悔恨和悲伤排斥了我的存在。但现在你已经放下了这些，现在你已经从内心的仇恨中痊愈，我可以再次与你同在了。"

Asuka felt tears spring to her eyes as she leapt into the air, soaring into the sky as twelve massive wings sprouted from her own Eva's back. She soared into the sky, through the clouds, toward Unit-01 and the MP Evas. "I'm sorry."  
明日香感到泪水涌上眼眶，她一跃而起，飞向天空，只见她自己的 Eva 背后长出了十二对巨大的翅膀。她穿过云层，向着零一单位和 MP Evas 飞去。“对不起。”

"What should you be sorry for, Asuka?"  
“你为什么要道歉，明日香？”

"After you died, I promised I'd never cry again. I hated everything. I was just…just…" Tears sprang to Asuka's eyes again, but these tears were not tears of sadness so much as joyous, jubilant tears that filled her heart with happiness.  
“你死后，我发誓再也不哭了。我恨透了一切。我只是……只是……”泪水再次涌上明日香的眼眶，但这些泪水并非悲伤之泪，而是充满喜悦和欢欣的泪水，让她的心充满了幸福。

"I understand. But we can discuss this later. Right now, you must save the one you love."  
"我明白。但我们可以稍后再讨论。现在，你必须去救你所爱的人。"

Asuka was level with Unit-01 now. She could see Unit-01, a huge spear levitating beside him. Where that spear had come from, Asuka didn't know. Was that the Spear of Longinus that Rei had thrown at Arael? Most likely the MP Evas had summoned it or something like that. Well, regardless, it was time to let the MP Evas have it, to eliminate them once and for all.  
此刻，明日香与零一机并肩。她能看到零一机旁悬浮着一支巨大的长矛。这长矛从何而来，明日香不得而知。是丽投向亚拉尔的那支朗基努斯之矛吗？多半是 MP 使徒召唤出来的吧。无论如何，是时候让 MP 使徒们尝尝苦头了，彻底消灭他们。

And then Asuka heard a sound from behind her. She glanced around to see a massive white silhouette ascend from the clouds. Asuka felt her entire body grow cold, despite the warmth of her mother's presence all around her. The creature before her was huge. Its pupil was as large as Unit-02! It was white, whiter than anything she had ever seen before. Save for its black eyes and the red dots in the center that Asuka had labeled as pupils.  
随后，明日香听到身后传来声响。她回头一看，只见一个巨大的白色身影从云层中升起。尽管母亲的存在温暖环绕，明日香仍感到全身冰冷。眼前的生物庞大无比，其瞳孔竟与零二机一般大小！它洁白无瑕，比她见过的任何事物都要白。除了那双漆黑的眼睛和中央的红点，明日香将其标记为瞳孔。

"What the Hell…?" Asuka stammered, feeling absolute terror filling her entire body. And then realization filled her body. She knew exactly what this creature was, or, specifically, who it was.  
“这到底是怎么回事…？”明日香结巴着，感到彻骨的恐惧充斥全身。随后，她恍然大悟。她清楚地知道这个生物是什么，或者更确切地说，是谁。

"Rei?" "丽？"

It was a massive version of Rei. White. Horrific. Yes, all those things, but all were now features of this huge Rei. What the hell had happened? Had Commander Ikari used her like Kaworu had told her he'd use her? Was Rei now an instrument of Instrumentality? A harbinger for Third Impact? Was she just a mindless weapon now?  
这是巨大化的绫波。苍白。恐怖。没错，所有这些特征，但现在都集中在这个巨大的绫波身上。究竟发生了什么？难道司令碇源堂像渚薰告诉她的那样利用了她？绫波现在成了人类补完计划的工具吗？是第三次冲击的先兆吗？她现在只是一具无意识的武器吗？

Asuka could hear Shinji screaming from behind her. She felt a pain in her heart as realization dawned upon her that now, right now, Shinji was in just as much pain as she was. Surely, with the MP Evas around him and now Rei before him, his mind was taking severe stress. She wasn't certain if he'd be able to make it through this with his mind intact.  
明日香能听到身后的真嗣在尖叫。她感到心痛，意识到此刻，真嗣和她一样痛苦。毫无疑问，面对周围的量产 EVA 和眼前的绫波，他的精神正承受着巨大的压力。她不确定他能否在这一切中保持心智健全。

Unless she did something first!  
除非她先采取行动！

Asuka grabbed the massive spear from midair. She pulled it out of whatever reach there was, feeling an invisible tug on the spear against her own grip. Naturally, her grip was stronger. She plunged the spear into the nearest MP Eva, plunging it straight through its body. There was a flash of light, and, to Asuka's immense shock, she watched as the MP Eva's hide grew dark, leaden, and petrified. With a kick straight to the chest, the Eva crumbled to pieces, nothing left.  
明日香从半空中抓住了那把巨大的长矛。她将其从任何可能的触及范围中抽出，感受到一股无形的力量在矛上与她的握力对抗。当然，她的握力更强。她将长矛刺入最近的量产型 EVA，直接贯穿其身体。一道光芒闪过，令明日香极度震惊的是，她看到量产型 EVA 的外皮变得暗淡、沉重且石化。她一脚踢向其胸口，EVA 随即碎裂成片，不复存在。

"Asuka?" Shinji stammered, in shock.  
“明日香？”真嗣结结巴巴地说，震惊不已。

Asuka threw the Spear straight at another of the MP Evas. It slammed straight through its body, tearing it apart into ashes. The Spear flew into space before changing direction, and flying directly at Shinji! Shinji turned abruptly, and grabbed the Spear by the stalk. Surely, now with two MP Evas destroyed, the grip on his body had been slackened, but not completely free. More of them needed to be destroyed first.  
明日香将长矛直直投向另一台量产型 EVA。长矛贯穿其身躯，将其撕裂成灰烬。长矛飞入太空后改变方向，直奔真嗣而来！真嗣猛然转身，一把抓住矛柄。确实，随着两台量产型 EVA 被摧毁，束缚他身体的力道有所松懈，但并未完全解脱。还需摧毁更多。

Shinji's wings twitched abruptly. One MP Eva was thrown into the sky, flying deeper into space. Asuka watched in amazement as the Eva was reduced to cinders upon flying through the atmosphere, disappearing entirely as it became a comet in the sky.  
真嗣的翅膀突然抽动。一台量产型 EVA 被抛向天空，飞向更深的太空。明日香惊愕地看着那台 EVA 在穿越大气层时化为灰烬，彻底消失，化作天际的一颗彗星。

Three down, six to go!  
已摧毁三台，还剩六台！

Shinji struggled with the Spear, trying to keep it from plunging straight into his core. Asuka was about to fly off to help him when she felt a force drag her backwards, back toward Rei. She glanced over her shoulder to see Rei staring at her before all when cold and dark.  
真嗣奋力与长矛抗争，试图阻止它直刺自己的核心。明日香正要飞去帮他，却感到一股力量将她向后拖拽，拉向丽。她回头瞥了一眼，看到丽正凝视着她，随后一切变得冰冷而黑暗。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Rei Ayanami materialized in her vision, staring back at her with a sad expression on her face. Asuka noticed that she looked as she normally did, save for the fact that she was completely naked. Asuka didn't care how much clothing she was wearing, so much as she wasn't that gigantic, grotesque version of herself.  
丽·绫波出现在她的视线中，面带悲伤地回望着她。明日香注意到她看起来和平常无异，除了全身赤裸这一点。明日香并不在乎她穿了多少衣服，只要她不是那个巨大而丑陋的自己。

"Where are we?" Asuka asked.  
“我们在哪儿？”明日香问道。

"This is the link you and I share," Rei replied, "A bond that cannot be broken no matter how hard one tries."  
"这就是你我之间的纽带，"丽回答道，"无论多么努力，都无法打破的羁绊。"

"What?" "什么？"

"I need to ask you, Asuka, to do me a favor."  
"我需要你帮我一个忙，明日香。"

"What?" "什么？"

"I want you to send the Spear of Longinus straight through my chest."  
"我希望你将朗基努斯之枪直接刺穿我的胸膛。"

"What?" Asuka remembered the MP Eva that had been hit by the Spear. It had turned to ash. Wouldn't the same happen to Rei? She couldn't kill Rei! She couldn't stand by and watch Rei die! It was impossible! She just couldn't, wouldn't, kill Rei like that!  
“什么？” 明日香记得那台被长矛击中的 MP Eva，它化为了灰烬。丽也会遭遇同样的命运吗？她不能杀死丽！她不能眼睁睁看着丽死去！这不可能！她就是不能，也不会，那样杀死丽！

"I must be destroyed, Asuka," Rei said, "You know it. I know it. If I survive, I will be able to initiate Third Impact."  
“我必须被毁灭，明日香，” 丽说道，“你知道的。我也知道。如果我存活下来，我就能引发第三次冲击。”

"But you won't! You're too kind! I know that isn't what you want!"  
“但你不会的！你太善良了！我知道那不是你想要的！”

"What I want?" “我想要什么？”

"Yes! You don't want this?"  
“是的！你不想要这个吗？”

"I don't know what I want," Rei replied, honestly, "Except that I want this world to be happy with you in it. I don't want anyone to suffer. I was created as a way to initiate Third Impact. If my death means life for everything I hold dear in my heart, then I can end my life with a smile on my lips."  
“我不知道我想要什么，”丽诚实地回答，“除了希望有你在的世界能幸福。我不希望任何人受苦。我被创造出来是为了引发第三次冲击。如果我的死意味着我所珍爱的一切能得以生存，那么我可以带着微笑结束我的生命。”

"But I want you to live!" Asuka snarled, tears filling her eyes.  
"但我希望你活着！" 明日香咆哮道，泪水盈满了她的眼眶。

"Yes, but wouldn't I be immortal in the minds of those who remember me?"  
"是的，但那些记得我的人心中，我不就永生了吗？"

"But I want…I want…" "但我想……我想要……"

"They are more important things than what we want in cases like this," Rei replied.  
“在这种时候，有比我们想要的更重要的东西。”丽回答道。

The world returned to ordinary. Asuka stared at Rei's massive form, at her red pupils, vacant of emotion. She didn't deserve this. Rei didn't deserve to die like this! She was dying a hero, performing a heroic act that was superior to any Asuka had performed! She was willingly going to kill herself just to save the world. And she was facing death so bravely!  
世界恢复了平常。明日香凝视着丽庞大的身躯，她红色的瞳孔空洞无神。她不该承受这些。丽也不该这样死去！她正作为一个英雄死去，她的英勇行为超越了明日香所做的一切！她甘愿牺牲自己来拯救世界。她面对死亡如此勇敢！

Shinji stabbed the Spear through the final MP Eva, turning it to cinders, as Asuka shouted, "Give me the Spear!"  
真嗣将长矛刺入最后一台 MP 使徒机体，将其化为灰烬，明日香大喊：“把长矛给我！”

"What?" "什么？"

"Give it to me!" "给我！"

Shinji threw the spear at Asuka, who grabbed it in her hands. She turned to Shinji, and said, slowly, "I'm sorry, Shinji."  
真嗣将长矛扔向明日香，她双手接住。她转向真嗣，缓缓说道：“对不起，真嗣。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Good-bye, Rei." "再见了，丽。"

With a sharp throw, the spear flew straight into Rei's bosom. There was a brilliant nova of light that consumed all, Unit-01 and 02 included, before all disappeared within the brilliance.  
随着一记凌厉的投掷，长矛直插入丽的心口。一道耀眼的光芒爆发，吞噬了一切，包括初号机和二号机，随后所有的一切都在这光辉中消逝。

### Chapter 17

The world was pulsating, slowly, as Asuka Langley Sohryu drifted slowly through oblivion, unable to determine which way was up and which way was down. All she could feel, however, was the air as its heart rumbled around her, as its slimy, sweaty skin smeared its essence over her smooth clean flesh, and as her hair danced in the air as though levitating in water.  
世界在脉动，缓慢地，明日香·兰格雷缓缓漂浮在虚无之中，无法分辨哪边是上哪边是下。然而，她唯一能感受到的，是空气，它的心跳在她周围隆隆作响，它黏腻、汗湿的皮肤将它的本质涂抹在她光滑洁净的肌肤上，而她的头发在空中舞动，仿佛在水中悬浮。

"Pilot Sohryu." “惣流驾驶员。”

Asuka's eyes opened, slowly. Staring down at her, completely and utterly naked, was Rei Ayanami, her scarlet eyes stared down at her. Her azure hair remained stationary, unmoved as liquid, perhaps LCL, drifted around her as though they were at the bottom of a bottomless dark sea of blood red liquid. And yet never once did Asuka wonder why Rei was not drowning in the crimson liquid.  
明日香的双眼缓缓睁开。完全赤裸的绫波零正俯视着她，那双猩红的眼睛凝视着她。她那湛蓝的头发静止不动，仿佛液体，或许是 LCL，在她周围漂浮，就像她们身处一个无底的黑暗血红液体海洋的底部。然而，明日香从未想过为什么绫波没有在这片猩红液体中溺水。

"What are you doing?" Asuka mumbled, not curious as to why she was perfectly able to speak despite the liquid surrounding her body.  
“你在做什么？”明日香喃喃自语，并不好奇为什么她能在液体环绕身体的情况下完美地说话。

"This is the World of Instrumentality," Rei replied, slowly, "A world where the borders of the human soul are nonexistent, where it is impossible to determine where one soul begins and another ends."  
"这就是补完的世界，" 绫波零缓缓回答，"一个灵魂边界不复存在的世界，在那里，无法确定一个灵魂从何处开始，另一个灵魂又从何处结束。"

"So we failed?" The words rang from Asuka's mouth, but the meaning was lost to Asuka. Or, in any event, the meaning seemed to make less of a blow than Asuka would have imagined. She would have expected the destruction of the human race to cause a stronger reaction in her heart, but she felt empty and vacant inside.  
"所以我们失败了？" 明日香的话语脱口而出，但其中的意义对她而言却已模糊不清。或者说，无论如何，这意义似乎并未如她所预想的那般沉重打击她。她本以为人类毁灭的消息会在她心中激起更强烈的反应，然而她只感到内心空洞而虚无。

"No, you succeeded," Rei replied, "Save for you, Shinji, and myself, the sea is empty and vacant."  
"不，你们成功了，" 绫波零回答，"除了你、真嗣和我之外，这片海洋空无一物。"

"So we were destroyed?" “所以我们被毁灭了吗？”

"You can say that, Pilot Sohryu."  
“你可以这么说，碇ソーレウ。”

So they had died in the attempt? They had destroyed themselves in order to save the world? Well, that's fine. So long as Hikari was safe, so long as the world was safe, she could get used to being dead. After all, it wasn't much different than living, was it? This limbo, this Instrumentality, was rather tame and mundane. She had expected something Hellish, something nightmarish, but this wasn't so bad.  
那么他们是在尝试中死去吗？他们为了拯救世界而自我毁灭了吗？好吧，这没关系。只要光安全，只要世界安全，她可以习惯于死亡。毕竟，这与活着并没有太大差别，不是吗？这个炼狱，这个人类补完计划，相当温和而平凡。她曾预料到会是地狱般的景象，噩梦般的场景，但这并不算太糟。

"Because the sea consists of a few souls, Pilot Sohryu, this world isn't painful to live in," Rei replied, "Add more souls into the mix, and this sea would turn into Hell."  
"因为海洋由少数灵魂构成，苏里约号飞行员，这个世界并不痛苦，"丽回答道，"再多些灵魂掺杂其中，这片海洋便会化为地狱。"

"Then let me reside in peace. I don't mind."  
"那就让我平静地居住吧。我不介意。"

"Yes, you do," Rei replied, "In this world you're alone."  
“是的，你确实如此，”丽回答道，“在这个世界上，你是孤独一人。”

"I'm used to being alone."  
"我习惯了独自一人。"

"Are you?" “是吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

"I doubt it." “我怀疑。”

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because if you were used to being alone, you wouldn't have fought for Shinji like you did. To save his life."  
"因为如果你习惯于孤独，你就不会像那样为真嗣而战。为了拯救他的生命。"

Asuka looked up in amazement as Rei drifted higher into the air, a smile on her lips. "Asuka Langley Sohryu, this dominion is my world. Not yours. I can't allow you to remain here, separate from the world, from your friends."  
明日香抬头惊讶地看着绫波飘得更高，嘴角带着微笑。“惣流·明日香·兰格雷，这片领域是我的世界。不是你的。我不能让你留在这里，与世界，与你的朋友们隔绝。”

"Then kick me out." “那就把我踢出去。”

"I can't," Rei replied, "Only you and your heart can bring yourself back to existence, back into your human shell. But if you do that, you will be hurt. You will endure suffering and stress. Are you willing to accept that?"  
“我做不到，”丽回答，“只有你和你内心的力量才能让你重返人间，回到你的肉身。但如果你这么做，你会受伤。你会经历痛苦和压力。你愿意接受这些吗？”

For the first time since Asuka awoke, the thoughts in her head gained gravity and power. If Asuka returned to the land of the living, people would hurt her. People would wound her. She'd see horrible things. She'd have to suffer solitude, rejection, pain, and horror. But if she remained here, alone and safe, she'd miss hope, excitement, triumph, and love. Especially love. In this loveless abyss, there was much to be desired. So what if she had to suffer a little? Without love and interest, what was this life but a useless, meaningless oblivion?  
这是自明日香醒来后，她脑海中的思绪首次变得沉重而有力。如果明日香回到活人的世界，人们会伤害她。人们会伤害她。她会看到可怕的事物。她将不得不忍受孤独、排斥、痛苦和恐怖。但如果她留在这里，独自一人且安全，她会错过希望、兴奋、胜利和爱。尤其是爱。在这个没有爱的深渊中，有许多东西是渴望而不可得的。那么，如果她必须承受一点痛苦呢？没有爱和兴趣，这样的生活不过是无用的、无意义的虚无？

Very slowly, Asuka felt her body sink deeper into the floor, drifting slowly away from Rei Ayanami. Asuka reached out for Rei, her eyes wide as Rei herself drifted higher into the sea, the gap between her and Asuka growing larger and larger with each passing second. "Grab my hand, Rei!" Asuka shouted.  
非常缓慢地，明日香感觉到自己的身体更深地沉入地板，慢慢地远离了绫波零。明日香伸出手去抓绫波，她的眼睛睁得大大的，而绫波自己则飘向海面更高处，她与明日香之间的距离随着每一秒的流逝变得越来越远。“抓住我的手，绫波！”明日香喊道。

"I told you. This is my world," Rei replied, "If I return, then I can be used as a tool of Instrumentality. Now, both Adam and Lilith have been destroyed entirely. Now that they're integrated, the planet is safe from Third Impact."  
“我告诉过你。这是我的世界，”绫波回答，“如果我回去，那么我就会被用作工具化的一部分。现在，亚当和莉莉丝都已经被完全摧毁。既然他们已经融合，地球就安全了，不会再有第三次冲击。”

"But I don't want to leave you!"  
“但我不想离开你！”

"Pilot Sohryu, in order to endure love, you must feel loss too. Without loss, then what is the point of being happy?"  
"飞行员草薙，为了承受爱情，你也必须感受失去。没有失去，那么幸福的意义何在？"

"Rei!" “丽！”

"Farewell, Pilot Sohryu," Rei replied, smiling a soft smile before dissolving into the red liquid around her, disappearing forever more.  
"再见了，飞行员草薙，" 丽回答道，带着柔和的微笑在周围的红色液体中消融，永远地消失了。

And then all became dark once again.  
然后一切再次陷入黑暗。

Asuka was awakened by the feeling of salty water rushing up her nose. She coughed before she was able to open her eyes. Once her eyes did flutter open, she was amazed to find herself on a beach. The water around her was tinted red, although the majority of the water, stretching out onto the horizon, was crystal clear and blue. As Asuka pushed herself up onto trembling limbs, she saw Shinji lying face first in the sand at her side, the water around him also tinted scarlet. Asuka approached the poor Third Child, and pulled him to his feet. His eyes slowly fluttered open.  
明日香被咸涩的海水呛入鼻腔的感觉唤醒。她咳嗽了几声，才得以睁开眼睛。当她的眼睑终于颤动着打开时，她惊讶地发现自己躺在一片海滩上。她周围的海水染成了红色，但远处延伸至地平线的海水却是清澈透明的蓝色。明日香用颤抖的四肢撑起身体，看到真嗣正面朝下躺在她身旁的沙地上，他周围的海水同样染成了猩红色。明日香走向这位可怜的第三适格者，将他扶起。他的眼睛缓缓地睁开。

"What's going on?" “发生了什么？”

"My guess is as good as yours," Asuka replied as Shinji slowly grew aware.  
“我猜的和你一样好，”明日香回答道，随着真嗣慢慢恢复意识。

"Are we dead?" Shinji asked.  
"我们死了吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Doubt it," Asuka replied as the red tint in the water disbursed, vanishing forever.  
"不太可能，" 明日香回答，随着水中的红色逐渐散去，永远消失。

"I thought I saw Rei and Kaworu for a moment," Shinji replied, "They're together now, those two."  
"我以为我看到了丽和薰一会儿，" 真嗣回答，"他们现在在一起了，那两个人。

"At least Rei isn't alone," Asuka said, tears in her eyes.  
“至少丽不再孤单，”明日香说道，眼中含着泪。

Rei. Where was she? Had she gone forever, never to return? Was she truly dead? Had she transcended to an existence far above their own? Had she become a God? An Angel? Well, whatever it was that she had become, it no longer mattered to Asuka. All that did matter is that she was gone forever more. Now, Asuka would no longer see Rei's emotionless face, but she'd forever more remember those few smiles that she demonstrated when the moment called for it.  
丽。她在哪里？她是否已经永远离去，再也不会回来？她真的死了吗？她是否已经超越到了一个远超他们存在的境界？她成了神吗？天使吗？无论她变成了什么，对明日香来说都不再重要了。唯一重要的是，她已经永远离开了。现在，明日香再也看不到丽那无表情的脸，但她会永远记住那些在需要时展现的微笑。

"What do you think we should do?" Shinji asked, nervously.  
“你觉得我们应该怎么办？”真嗣紧张地问道。

"What I think we should do is find a way back to Tokyo-3," Asuka said, turning around to look for a phone booth of some sort, "I mean, they're probably terrified now that we aren't there."  
"我认为我们应该设法回到第三新东京市，" 明日香说着，转身寻找着某种电话亭，"我是说，我们现在不在那里，他们可能已经吓坏了。"

"They might think we're dead," Shinji conceded.  
"他们可能会以为我们死了，" 真嗣承认道。"

As Asuka and Shinji approached the opposite end of the beach, a single question emerged in Asuka's mind: the Evas. What had happened to them? Had they simply disappeared off the face of the Earth? Had they been swallowed up in Instrumentality? If so, then what happened to her mother? Had she died at long last? Was she still with Asuka?  
当明日香和真嗣走向海滩的另一端时，明日香心中浮现出一个问题：EVA 们。它们发生了什么？它们就这样从地球上消失了吗？是被融入到人类补完计划中了吗？如果是这样，那么她的母亲呢？她最终去世了吗？她还在明日香身边吗？

Eventually, they found a phone. Asuka dove at the phone, rapidly punching numbers before waiting on a busy server for what had to be ten minutes. Finally, a voice answered after an eternity of anxiety. "Hello?"  
最终，他们找到了一部电话。明日香猛地扑向电话，迅速拨号，然后在繁忙的服务器前等待了足有十分钟。终于，在漫长的焦虑之后，一个声音回应了。“喂？”

"Misato?" “美里？”

"Asuka! What happened to you? We thought you were dead!"  
"明日香！你怎么了？我们还以为你已经死了！"

"No, we're alive." “不，我们还活着。”

"Where have you been for the last week?"  
"过去这一周你都去哪儿了？"

"Week? We were gone for a week?!" Asuka had expected maybe a few hours, at the very most. A day would have been unrealistic. But seven days? A full week? It was beyond comprehension. How long had she been asleep, anyway?  
"一周？我们离开了一周？！" 明日香原本预计最多也就几个小时，最不济也就一天。但七天？整整一周？这超出了她的理解范围。她到底睡了多久？

"Thank God you're alive!"  
"谢天谢地，你还活着！"

"What happened?" Asuka asked.  
"发生了什么？" 明日香问道。

"We don't exactly know. All we do know is that there was a big explosion, and Units-01 and 02 were found empty. Even your plugsuits were taken. We thought you had either assimilated with the Evas or had been vaporized. We had been working around the clock to try extracting you from the Eva. Wait 'till I tell Maya it was all a waste."  
"我们并不完全清楚。我们所知道的是发生了一次大爆炸，01 和 02 号机被发现是空的。甚至连你们的插入栓服也被拿走了。我们以为你们要么与 Eva 同化，要么被蒸发掉了。我们一直在昼夜不停地尝试从 Eva 中提取你们。等我告诉玛雅这一切都是徒劳的。

"What about Ritsuko?" Asuka asked, "Wouldn't she be in charge of that?"  
"那律子呢？" 明日香问，"她不是负责这个的吗？

"Ritsuko's dead." "律子死了。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Commander Ikari killed her, apparently."  
"伊卡洛斯指挥官杀了她，显然。"

What? That didn't make sense. Why would Commander Ikari kill Ritsuko? Was this because of Ritsuko trying to hurt the stupid Commander's plans for a Third Impact? Well, he would have succeeded had it not been for Asuka destroying the giant Rei creature.  
什么？这说不通。伊卡洛斯指挥官为什么要杀律子？是因为律子试图破坏那个愚蠢指挥官的第三次冲击计划吗？要不是明日香摧毁了巨大的丽生物，他本可以成功的。

We fond him with his arm ripped off in Central Dogma. We don't know why he was there, as he won't tell us. What we do know is that Rei is missing too. Do you know what happened to her?"  
我们在中央 dogma 发现他手臂被撕裂。我们不知道他为什么在那里，因为他不肯告诉我们。我们所知道的是，丽也失踪了。你知道她发生了什么事吗？

"Rei's…gone." 丽……消失了。

"Gone?" 消失？

"I can't describe it. She sacrificed herself to stop Third Impact and Instrumentality, but she had to disappear herself. She isn't dead, but she doesn't have a body either."  
"我无法形容。她牺牲自己阻止了第三次冲击和人类补完计划，但她自己也必须消失。她没有死，但也没有身体。"

"That's horrible. Oh my God, Asuka, I'm sorry you had to endure that."  
"那太可怕了。哦，天哪，明日香，我很抱歉你不得不经历这些。"

"It's okay. Really, it's fine. How's Toji?"  
"没事的。真的，一切都好。阿薰怎么样了？"

"Toji's alive and well. He's been worried sick too. Hikari came here not long after the fight. Actually, all of the evacuees are back. Hikari's been breaking down in tears for the last week. She thought you were dead."  
"冬二还活着，而且很好。他也担心得要命。美里在战斗结束后不久就来到了这里。实际上，所有的避难者都已经回来了。美里这一周一直在哭，她以为你死了。"

"Tell her I'm okay, alright?"  
"告诉她我没事，好吗？"

"Sure. Where are you?" "当然。你现在在哪里？"

"We're on this beach. Don't know where," Asuka replied.  
"我们在一片海滩上。不知道具体位置，" 明日香回答道。

"Any landmarks?" "有什么地标吗？"

"No."

"We'll find you, okay?" "我们会找到你的，好吗？"

It took them an hour until NERV cars came to pick them up. Misato herself, along with Hikari and Toji, had come to retrieve Shinji and Asuka. For that one hour between the phone call and their arrival, the two children had been silent, unable to speak. Naturally, the full gravity of the situation had to settle down into their nerves in that short time period.  
他们等了一个小时，NERV 的车辆才来接他们。美里亲自带着光和总司来接真嗣和明日香。在电话通知和他们的到来之间这一个小时里，两个孩子一直沉默不语，无法开口。自然，在这短暂的时间内，情况的全部严重性必须沉淀进他们的神经。

Their journey was over. Third Impact had been avoided. The world was safe, thanks to them. Humanity would remain separate, in sentient bodies with sentient minds that were not melded together like lumps of clay smashed together. She had thought that, by the end of her journey, she would feel empty and vacant. That she would feel dead without a purpose to live for. But now, at this moment, for the first time in a long time, she felt free. She felt saved from all the stress and all the pain she had to have endured all her life. For the first time, she felt truly and sincerely happy.  
他们的旅程结束了。第三次冲击得以避免。世界因他们而安全。人类将继续保持独立，拥有有感知能力的身体和心灵，不会像泥块一样被融合在一起。她曾以为，旅程结束时，她会感到空虚和茫然。她会感到没有生活目标的死亡感。但此刻，久违的，她第一次感到自由。她从一生所承受的所有压力和痛苦中解脱出来。第一次，她真正地、由衷地感到快乐。

### Chapter 18

"Hey, did you hear, Asuka?"  
嘿，你听说了吗，明日香？

"Hear what?" “听什么？”

"That group that Kaworu mentioned, Seele?"  
“那个卡罗尔提到的组织，Seele？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"They found the last member, Keel. He'd been hiding in some ditch in the Middle East, but they found him."  
他们找到了最后一名成员，基尔。他一直躲在中东某个沟渠里，但他们还是找到了他。

It had been several months since the Third Impact incident. Life had returned to normal in Tokyo-3. The Evas had been put in cryostasis, perhaps never to be used again in warfare, like the atomic bomb. The Angels, all seventeen of them, no longer existed. They had all either been utterly eradicated or assimilated during Instrumentality. Even Arael had left Asuka's heart. She could feel that. The same with Toji, even if he hadn't been caught in the explosion. Somehow or other, the Angels were no more.  
第三次冲击事件已经过去了几个月。东京-3 的生活已经恢复正常。EVA 被置于低温休眠状态，或许再也不会用于战争，就像原子弹一样。十七位使徒已不复存在。他们在人类补完计划中要么被彻底消灭，要么被同化。就连阿拉尔也离开了明日香的心。她能感觉到。同样的情况也发生在真治身上，尽管他没有被爆炸卷入。不知怎么的，使徒们已经不复存在了。

Hikari slumped down next to Asuka, a smile on her face. "It's over now, isn't it? All over now. Seele's gone, the Angels are gone…"  
光坐在明日香旁边，脸上带着微笑。“现在一切都结束了，不是吗？Seele 消失了，使徒们也不在了……”

"Rei's gone, too," Asuka added, on a melancholy note.  
“丽也走了，”明日香补充道，语气中带着一丝忧郁。

"Hey, don't say that," Hikari replied, frowning, "Misato's still looking for her."  
“嘿，别这么说，”光皱着眉头回答，“美里还在找她呢。”

"She'll never find Rei," sighed Asuka, miserably, "But that's okay, right? I mean, losing Rei was horrible, but she wanted me to be happy. She sacrificed herself for me, so I guess this is what she wanted."  
“她永远找不到丽，”明日香叹息道，心情沉重，“但那没关系，对吧？我是说，失去丽很糟糕，但她希望我快乐。她为了我牺牲了自己，所以我想这就是她想要的。”

"That's right," Hikari replied with a nod, "She wanted you to be happy."  
“没错，”光子点头回应，“她希望你快乐。”

"That just figures," sighed Asuka, "Figured Wonder Girl would want something strange like this."  
"真是意料之中，"明日香叹了口气，"我就知道神奇女孩会想要这种奇怪的东西。"

Hikari smiled, slightly. 光微微一笑。

The bell rang, signaling the end of the school day. Asuka pushed herself up, stretching her arms into the air. She felt the tightness that had filled her body all day leave her as she watched Hikari sprint over to Toji. She watched her friend wrap her arms around Toji's neck, kissing him right on the cheek, unashamed what the other people around her might think, what they might insinuate. And, naturally, Toji returned the kiss with the same unabashed nature.  
放学铃声响起，标志着一天的结束。明日香站起身来，伸展双臂。她感到一整天充斥在体内的紧张感随着她看着光向东治跑去而消散。她看着好友紧紧抱住东治的脖子，毫不顾忌周围人的看法，亲吻他的脸颊。而东治也自然地以同样坦率的态度回吻了她。

They had been dating solid for all this time, which Asuka found amazing. Hikari had been, at first, more than a little timid about the entire dating ordeal, but Toji's confidence, or at least acts of confidence, had developed Hikari's self-esteem to the level that she could kiss her boyfriend out in public without caring what her critics had to say about her actions and her style.  
他们已经稳定交往了这么久，这让明日香感到惊讶。起初，光对整个约会的事情还有些胆怯，但真嗣的自信，或者说至少是自信的表现，让光的自尊心提升到了她可以在公共场合亲吻男友而不在乎批评者对她行为和风格的看法的程度。

Asuka approached Shinji Ikari, the Third Child, as he heaved his heavy bag onto one shoulder. She glanced up to Asuka, a smile on his face. "Oh, Asuka! I'm almost ready."  
明日香走向碇真嗣，第三适格者，他正费力地将沉重的背包甩到一边肩膀上。他抬头看向明日香，脸上带着微笑。"哦，明日香！我快准备好了。"

"Almost? What else do you need, anyway? That bag looks like it weighs more than I do!"  
快准备好了？你还需要什么？那个包看起来比我还重！

"Well, I still need to just get my other arm through the—"  
"好吧，我还需要把另一只胳膊穿过去——"

"Don't feel like waiting. Come on, you idiot!"  
"不想等了。快点，你这个笨蛋！"

Asuka grabbed Shinji by the arm, dragging his protesting body out of the room, out of the school, and onto the street. Turning to her comrade, she said, in a laughing tone, "You can just put your arm through that thingy out here while you're walking, okay?"  
明日香抓住了真嗣的手臂，拖着他那抗议的身体走出房间，走出学校，来到街上。她转向同伴，笑着说："你可以在走路的时候把胳膊伸进那东西里，好吗？"

"Fine, but did you really need to pull me?"  
"好吧，但你真的有必要拉我吗？"

"Yup. I don't want to wait. Besides, there's a really cool show on TV I wanna watch that'll start the moment we get home. If you delayed any longer, I might've missed it."  
"是的。我不想等了。而且，有一档非常精彩的电视节目我想要看，它在我们到家那一刻就开始了。如果你再耽搁，我可能就错过了。"

"Okay…" "好吧……"

The two of them walked home. It was strange. Even though it had been so long since Instrumentality, she couldn't get used to the lack of a third person walking with them. The loss of Rei was monumental to their little group, by far. She frowned, sadly, wondering just where in the world the blue haired girl could have gone? Perhaps she was simply disbursed over the planet like oxygen, or maybe she was so small that even atoms dwarfed her.  
两人一起走回家。这感觉很奇怪。尽管距离人类补完计划已经过去很久，她还是无法习惯没有第三个人同行的状态。对他们这个小团体来说，丽的离去无疑是巨大的损失，这一点毋庸置疑。她皱起眉头，悲伤地思索着，那个蓝发女孩究竟去了哪里？也许她就像氧气一样散布在地球上，或者她变得如此微小，连原子都比她庞大。

"So when does this show of yours start?" Shinji asked, curiously.  
"那你的节目什么时候开始？" 真嗣好奇地问道。

"Soon enough," Asuka replied, "Sooner than later, so you better get your butt in gear."  
“很快就会了，”明日香回答，“比预想的还要快，所以你最好赶紧行动起来。”

"I see," Shinji replied, approaching Asuka, slowly, tentatively reaching out for her hand.  
“我明白了，”真嗣回应道，缓缓走向明日香，试探性地伸出手去触碰她的手。

Asuka glanced down at Shinji's hand, and, very slowly, extended her own. Slowly, the two palms embraced one another, the fingers interlocking slowly around the other's knuckles, until they were combined like a single unit, separated only by the other's skin. Asuka felt a fluttering feeling that, by this point in time, she had grown very used to. She felt her lips curl at the ends, blush filling her face entirely.  
明日香低头看向真嗣的手，然后非常缓慢地伸出自己的手。慢慢地，两人的手掌相贴，手指缓缓缠绕在对方的指节上，直到它们像一个整体一样结合在一起，仅由彼此的皮肤隔开。明日香感到一种悸动的感觉，到了这个时候，她已经非常习惯了。她感到嘴角上扬，脸颊完全被红晕填满。

The truth was that they had, by this point in time, been dating for some time. Not truly dating, and Asuka was too pigheaded to actually admit that she was dating an idiot like Shini. They simply held hands on walks, hung out together, maybe even exchanged a couple of kisses here and there. Nothing serious, she supposed. It wasn't like Shinji was the man she was going to marry or anything. That was in the future, so far away. Who knew what would happen? Maybe she'd meet another man.  
事实是，到这个时候，他们已经交往了一段时间。并非真正的约会，而明日香又太过固执，不愿承认自己在和一个像真嗣这样的傻瓜交往。他们只是在散步时牵手，一起闲逛，偶尔还会交换几个吻。她觉得这没什么大不了的。又不是说真嗣就是她要嫁的那个人。那还远在未来，遥不可及。谁知道会发生什么呢？也许她会遇到另一个男人。

"Asuka," Shinji replied, "My father testified against Keel today."  
"明日香，" 真嗣回答道，"我父亲今天出庭指证基尔了。"

"I heard Keel was captured, but your father actually testified? Now that's something."  
"我听说基尔被捕了，但你父亲真的出庭作证了？这可真是出乎意料。"

Commander Ikari had been put on trial for crimes against humanity, but had been found innocent due to a lack of evidence. They could not prove that he had killed Ritsuko Akagi, nor could they prove that he had anything to do with the Giant Rei creature. If anything, because NERV protected Tokyo-3 with the Evas, he had used that to his advantage, claiming that he had actually been protecting the human race from Seele. Naturally, after that claim, he had lead a group to capture the Seele members, all of them, and today his mission had been completed.  
碇司令因反人类罪被审判，但由于证据不足被判无罪。他们无法证明他杀害了赤木律子，也无法证明他与巨型绫波生物有任何关联。相反，由于 NERV 使用 EVA 保护了第三新东京市，他利用这一点为自己辩护，声称他实际上是在保护人类免受 Seele 的威胁。自然，在那番声明之后，他领导了一支队伍去抓捕所有 Seele 成员，而今天，他的任务已经完成。

However, as recommended by Commander Fuyutski, Commander Ikari actually stepped down from the head of NERV, allowing Fuyutski to take control. Since Fuyutski's ascension, Asuka felt NERV's rather intense, serious atmosphere to lighten up, almost relax under the new command. It was almost fun to take a visit into NERV headquarters now, especially without Ritsuko there.  
然而，正如冬月司令所建议的，碇司令实际上从 NERV 的领导位置上退了下来，让冬月接管。自从冬月上任以来，明日香感觉到 NERV 原本紧张严肃的氛围有所缓和，在新指挥下几乎变得轻松起来。现在去 NERV 总部参观几乎变得有趣了，尤其是没有律子在的时候。

"Now it's over, Asuka," Shinji replied, frowning, "I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's all over. Seele, the Angels, even the Evas. So now what do we do?"  
“现在一切都结束了，明日香，”真嗣皱着眉头回答，“我简直不敢相信我会这么说，但一切都结束了。Seele、使徒，甚至是 Eva。那么我们现在该怎么办？”

"What is that supposed to mean? We've been living our lives since then. What are you, stupid?"  
“那是什么意思？我们自那以后一直在过自己的生活。你是不是傻？”

"No, I know that, but I always thought that you wouldn't be able to handle life without Eva," Shinji said, a smile on his face.  
"不，我知道，但我一直以为你离开绫波就无法生活，" 真嗣说道，脸上带着微笑。

"Well, truthfully, neither did I," Asuka admitted.  
"嗯，说实话，我也是这么想的，" 明日香承认道。

In fact, there had been times when severe depression had overtaken Asuka, separation anxiety even. However, thanks to Dr. Tamako, she had managed to overcome many of those horrible spells of suffering. And, thanks to Misato and even Maya, she had been given the treat every so often, to just walk into her Eva's entryplug, just to feel at home inside the Eva.  
事实上，曾有几次，严重的抑郁情绪笼罩了明日香，甚至伴有分离焦虑。然而，多亏了田子医生，她设法克服了许多痛苦的折磨。而且，得益于美里甚至真希，她偶尔会被允许走进 EVA 的插入栓，只是为了在 EVA 中找到家的感觉。

In actuality, every time she walked into the Eva, she tried to find her mother. Tried to find even the slightest trace of her fallen mother. However, only on one occasion had she actually succeeded in feeling an ephemeral flame of love that reminded her of her mother. That time had been fairly recent, too, only a few weeks ago. Asuka was hoping that Misato could allow her to go in again very soon so she could try to communicate again with her Mother, praying that, maybe eventually, she'd talk to her once again.  
实际上，每次她走进 EVA，她都试图寻找她的母亲。试图找到她已故母亲哪怕最微小的痕迹。然而，只有一次，她真的成功感受到了一丝转瞬即逝的爱意，让她想起了母亲。那次就在不久前，仅仅几周前。明日香希望美里能允许她很快再次进入，这样她就可以再次尝试与母亲沟通，祈祷着，也许最终，她能再次与母亲对话。

"You know, Asuka, I'm just glad it's all done," Shinji replied, "I never did enjoy piloting the Eva."  
“你知道，明日香，我只是很高兴这一切都结束了，”真嗣回答道，“我从来不喜欢驾驶 EVA。”

"I could tell, you big baby."  
"我看得出来，你这个大宝宝。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Oh, I know that if I wasn't there to help save your butt on the line, you probably would have been crying and making a scene about how you didn't want to pilot, blah, blah, blah! Whiner!"  
"哦，我知道如果我没在场帮你救场，你大概早就哭哭啼啼，闹着不想驾驶，blah, blah, blah！抱怨鬼！"

"What? Whiner? I'm not a whiner!"  
"什么？抱怨鬼？我才不是抱怨鬼！"

"Oh, yes you are and you know it, idiot!"  
"哦，你就是，你自己也知道，傻瓜！"

Asuka smiled as Shinji struggled to find some sort of comeback. He never really did, so Asuka wasn't so worried about that. Rather, she glanced up at the sky, seeing the clouds filter over the sun, the light from the star high above them shimmering down over her face and cheeks.  
明日香看着真嗣挣扎着寻找反击的话语，他从未真正成功过，所以明日香对此并不太担心。相反，她抬头望向天空，看到云层遮住了太阳，高悬于他们上方的恒星光芒洒落在她的脸颊上。

"Nice weather, right?" "天气不错，对吧？"

"Yeah," Shinji replied, "To think that it's almost October, though."  
“是啊，”真嗣回答，“没想到转眼就快到十月了。”

"Been a little less than a year now, hasn't it?" Asuka remarked, "We're almost in high school, too. Next year, Shinji. Next year."  
“到现在差不多快一年了吧？”明日香说道，“我们马上也要上高中了。明年，真嗣。明年。”

Those words had a nice ring to it. It made her feel more adult, something she had always wanted but never truly sought out. Adulthood. Such a mature feeling. Now, only a few months away from her fifteenth birthday, she felt so mature, so womanly. Already her body had started to mature. She had measured each change with growing excitement. Even though her body was already rather womanly to begin with at even such a young age, she valued each and every development to her body, even the bad, like the stray pimple or extra pound that would occasionally find its way onto her body.  
这些话听起来很悦耳。让她感觉自己更成熟了，这是她一直渴望却从未真正追求过的。成年。多么成熟的感受。现在，离她十五岁生日只有几个月了，她觉得自己如此成熟，如此有女人味。她的身体已经开始发育。她兴奋地记录着每一个变化。尽管她的身体在如此年幼时就已经相当有女人味，但她珍视身体的每一次发展，哪怕是那些不好的，比如偶尔冒出的痘痘或额外的一磅体重。

It was only then that Asuka noticed something on the ground. She glanced down at the floor, her eyebrow raised. She bent down, and picked up a fallen leaf. She stared at it, perplexed. It was brown, dead looking. "Hey, Shinji, did you ever see a leaf like this?"  
直到那时，明日香才注意到地上有东西。她低头看向地板，眉头一挑。她弯下腰，捡起一片落叶。她盯着它，感到困惑。它是棕色的，看起来已经枯萎。“嘿，真嗣，你见过这样的叶子吗？”

Shinji glanced at it, an eyebrow raised. "Only in textbooks."  
真嗣瞥了一眼，眉头一挑。“只在教科书上见过。”

"Hmm, strange," Asuka tossed the leaf aside before looking up at the tree above. Her eyes widened with surprise. All the leaves on the tree had turned into a fiery red and yellow shade. It was magnificently beautiful. Her mouth hung open as she took in the sheer beauty of it. Never before had she seen a tree quite like this, with the leaves that intense and full of colors quite like that. Never had she known of a tree that could become that beautiful, except, Asuka noted, in textbooks about the world preceding Second Impact, where seasons used to exist.  
“嗯，真奇怪，”明日香把叶子扔到一边，然后抬头看向头顶的树。她的眼睛因惊讶而睁大。树上所有的叶子都变成了火红和金黄的色调。它美得令人惊叹。她张着嘴，被这纯粹的美景所震撼。她从未见过如此绚丽多彩的树，叶子如此浓烈。她从未听说过一棵树能变得如此美丽，除了在关于第二次冲击前世界的教科书中，那里曾经有四季的存在。

"I think this is called Autumn," Shinji noted.  
“我想这叫秋分，”真嗣指出。

"Pretty name," Asuka replied, noting that the air was a bit too chilly for her skirt. Her bare legs started to grow cold, to the point where she tugged on her socks to try to cover her bare calves.  
“真是个好听的名字。”明日香答道，同时注意到空气对她那条裙子来说过于寒冷。她裸露的双腿开始感到冷意，以至于她拉扯着袜子，试图遮住裸露的小腿。

"Well, maybe we should head home," Shinji suggested, "It's too cold for this."  
“嗯，也许我们该回家了，”真嗣提议道，“这里太冷了。”

"Agreed 100%!" Asuka snapped letting go of Shinji's hand as the two of them started running back to Misato's apartment, their home. Their warm paradise.  
"完全同意！" 明日香松开真嗣的手，两人开始跑回美里公寓，那是他们的家，温馨的乐园。

However, naturally, Shinji stumbled onto the ground, skidding his elbow against the concrete. Asuka stopped, glancing around with a smile. "Well, it looks like the great Shinji can't even run one hundred meters without falling flat on his face. How spectacular."  
然而，自然而然地，真嗣绊倒在地，手肘在混凝土上滑了一下。明日香停下脚步，微笑着环顾四周。“看来伟大的真嗣连一百米都跑不了就摔了个狗啃泥。真是壮观。”

"Just help me up, please," Shinji pleaded, which Asuka obliged and pulled him to his feet.  
“请扶我起来，”真嗣恳求道，明日香答应了，将他拉起身。

The two of them stared into each other's eyes, transfixed in seconds. Asuka stared at Shinji, that fluttering desire soaring through her chest. Very slowly, she drew nearer, Shinji obliging slowly. Very delicately, she placed her lips upon Shinji's, only for her, in ecstasy, to feel his hands wrapping around her sides. She obliged by curling her arms around his neck, holding him closer as the fire burned into each of them. Her eyes were squeezed tightly shut in her glory, in her joy, as the kiss filled her, as the passion and love enveloped her.  
两人凝视着对方的眼睛，瞬间被吸引住了。明日香凝视着真嗣，心中那股悸动的感觉涌上心头。她缓缓地靠近，真嗣也慢慢地回应。她非常轻柔地将嘴唇贴在真嗣的唇上，只觉得他的双手环绕在她的腰间。她顺从地用双臂环住他的脖子，将他拉得更近，火焰在他们之间燃烧。她的眼睛紧闭着，沉浸在她的荣耀和喜悦中，随着吻的充实，激情和爱意包围了她。

Slowly, her lips still locked, she opened her eyes. There was a flock of birds that flew into the air, pigeons she thought, the sound of their feathers beating against the wind almost soothing. But Asuka could see passed them, see the two figures staring at them, simply, in the middle of the road behind them.  
慢慢地，她的唇依旧紧贴着，她睁开了眼睛。一群鸟儿飞向天空，她以为是鸽子，它们拍打翅膀的声音几乎抚慰人心。但明日香能透过它们，看到那两个站在他们身后路中间的人影，只是静静地注视着他们。

Standing there, simply dressed in school uniforms, was Kaworu, who was holding hands with Rei Ayanami. Asuka was transfixed, her lips locked with Shinji, and her eyes locked with Rei's own scarlet eyes. Rei's lips were curled into an innocent, happy smile. And then, Asuka blinked, and the two had disappeared, gone, as though into thin air.  
站在那里，简单地穿着校服的，是渚薰，他正牵着绫波丽的手。明日香被定住了，她的唇与真嗣相贴，她的眼睛与绫波丽的猩红眼眸对视。绫波丽的嘴角勾起一个纯真、快乐的微笑。然后，明日香眨了眨眼，那两人就消失了，仿佛凭空消失了一般。

Asuka wished they would return, but knew, sadly, that was not to be. Rei was happy, and that was what matters. She was with Kaworu, and apparently they were getting along quite smoothly from the look of things.  
明日香希望他们能回来，但悲伤地知道那是不可能的。丽很幸福，这才是最重要的。她和薰在一起，从外表看来，他们相处得相当融洽。

Slowly, Shinji and Asuka parted, Shinji staring into Asuka's eyes, a look of innocent joy in his eyes. "Let's head home, Asuka."  
渐渐地，真嗣和明日香分开了，真嗣凝视着明日香的眼睛，眼中流露出纯真的喜悦。“我们回家吧，明日香。”

"Sure." "当然可以。"

Home. Back to where she knew she could do whatever she wanted and still be loved. A warm, welcoming place that she had longed for her entire life. A place where she could be herself and not have to worry about being judged. A place where she learned just who she was in the world, not just judging herself by solitary things in her life that would eventually go away. A place where you didn't have to be perfect to belong. A place where warm, joyous people welcomed you home.  
家。回到那个她知道自己可以随心所欲仍被爱着的地方。一个温暖、欢迎她的地方，她一生都在渴望。一个她可以做自己，不必担心被评判的地方。一个让她明白自己在世界上的位置，不仅仅通过生活中最终会消失的孤立事物来评判自己的地方。一个不需要完美就能归属的地方。一个温暖、快乐的人们欢迎你回家的地方。

A place where angels really lived.  
一个天使真正居住的地方。
