Will she live? Or will she die? That decision rests in Shinji's hands...but there is one more thing that does not.
她会活下来吗？还是会死去？这个决定掌握在真嗣的手中……但还有一件事，是真嗣无法掌控的。

Angst 悲剧

Stupidly, I forgot to add a disclaimer here when I posted this fic yesterday. Here it is:  
愚蠢的是，昨天发布这篇同人文时我忘了加上免责声明。现在补上：

Disclaimer: I don't own Evangelion, but I do think that baby Shinji is very cute!  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，但我确实认为小真嗣非常可爱！

### Chapter 1: diagnosis

_She paid close attention to the panels, each focused on a live image of a certain Eva pilot, labeled with their respective names and units.

_Disbelief. 难以置信。_

Misato woke in a cold sweat, tossing her blankets off of her carelessly. As if it wasn't bad enough to have lived through that horror once. She put her feet to the floor and gingerly stood up, grumbling at the pain in her joints.  
美里从冷汗中惊醒，随意地掀开了身上的毯子。仿佛经历过那场恐怖还不够糟糕。她将脚放在地板上，小心翼翼地站起身，抱怨着关节的疼痛。

_Damn, I'm not THAT old yet!  
该死，我还没那么老吧！_

Misato swayed and grabbed the table to secure her balance, then went to go get a beer. She sat alone in the kitchen with the room only half-lit, her head drooping on her shoulders and occasionally rising to take another sip of beer. The beverage did little to liven her up; if anything, it seemed to be doing the opposite. Misato groaned and rested her head and arms on the wooden table. Something soft brushed against her legs.  
美里摇晃着，抓住桌子以稳住平衡，然后去拿了一瓶啤酒。她独自坐在半明半暗的厨房里，头低垂在肩上，偶尔抬起头来再喝一口啤酒。这饮料并没有让她振作起来；相反，似乎起了反效果。美里呻吟着，将头和手臂靠在木桌上。有什么柔软的东西轻拂过她的腿。

"Hi, Pen-pen," she mumbled, her eyes closed, as she reached down to stroke the bird.  
“嗨，Pen-pen，”她咕哝着，眼睛闭着，伸手下去抚摸那只鸟。

"Wark," he replied by way of greeting, nibbling gently on her index finger.  
“哇克，”他用这种方式回应问候，轻轻地咬了咬她的食指。

It took the purple-haired woman much more effort than usual to raise her head the necessary number of degrees so that she could view the clock over her never-used oven. It was 3:15.  
紫发女子费了比平时多得多的力气，才将头抬高到足以看到她那从未用过的烤箱上方的时钟。时间是 3 点 15 分。

"I should really go back to bed," she mumbled, "be awake tomorrow."  
"我真该回去睡觉，"她咕哝着，"明天才能清醒。"

Nevertheless, she did not move until Pen-pen pecked her thigh lightly.  
然而，她一动不动，直到企鹅 Pen-pen 轻轻啄了她的腿。

Misato tiptoed past Shinji and Asuka's rooms, listening carefully to make sure that neither had been disturbed by her midnight escapade. Then she crept into bed and closed the door behind her.  
美里蹑手蹑脚地经过真嗣和明日香的房间，仔细聆听，确保她的午夜冒险没有打扰到他们。然后她悄悄爬上床，关上了身后的门。

It was much too hot to sleep with the blanket covering her. Misato kicked them to the floor and fell fast asleep.  
被子盖在身上实在太热，根本睡不着。美里一脚把它们踢到地上，很快就沉沉睡去。

"Good morning, Asuka." "早上好，明日香。"

"Guten Morgen." The redhead yawned. "Where's Misato?"  
"早上好。" 红发少女打着哈欠。"美里呢？"

Shinji turned slightly from the breakfast he was cooking. "Still asleep, I think," he said quietly.  
真嗣从正在做的早餐中微微转过身来。“我想还在睡吧，”他轻声说道。

"I see." Asuka slid into her usual seat at the table and stared in distaste at the opened beer can. When Shinji reappeared a moment later with two plates of steaming food, the redhead was wearing a smug grin.  
“我明白了。”明日香滑入她常坐的餐桌座位，厌恶地盯着那罐打开的啤酒。当真嗣片刻后带着两盘冒着热气的食物再次出现时，红发女孩脸上挂着得意的笑容。

"Digging into Misato's beer stores, have you?" she chided roughly, as he slid her plate to her across the smooth wooden surface. "Ouch, that's hot—_don't_ do that, baka!"  
“你这是在挖美里小姐的啤酒存货吗？”她粗鲁地责备道，同时他从光滑的木质桌面上将她的盘子滑给她。“哎呀，好烫——别这样，笨蛋！”

"Sorry," Shinji apologized quickly, lowering his head. Unfortunately his gaze landed on the beer can.  
“对不起，”真嗣迅速道歉，低下头。不幸的是，他的目光落在了啤酒罐上。

_Since when does Asuka drink beer?  
从什么时候起，明日香开始喝啤酒了？_

Deciding that it would be wisest not to question her about it, Shinji picked up the can and made to throw it away.  
真嗣决定最好不要问她这件事，于是他拿起罐子，准备扔掉。

"Unbelievable." Shinji turned, the can still in his hand. The German was leaning back in her chair, eyes closed, a piece of vegetable omelette speared on the tip of her fork. "Even _I_ wouldn't have expected this from you, Third Child."  
"难以置信。" 真嗣转过身，手中的罐子依旧未放。德国少女靠坐在椅子上，双眼紧闭，叉尖上插着一片蔬菜欧姆蛋。"连你我都没料到会这样，第三适格者。"

Shinji's stomach did a flop as he recalled her earlier words—words he had not taken into consideration since the girl had been yelling at him for burning her hand.  
真嗣的胃一阵翻腾，他回想起她早先的话语——那些自女孩因他烫伤她的手而对他大吼大叫后，他便未曾考虑过的话。

"I—I haven't done anything!" he protested, in futile defense.  
"我——我什么都没做！" 他无力地辩解道。"

"You were the first one up this morning," Asuka pointed out, "and I _know_ the table was clean after dinner last night." She placed the morsel in her mouth and chewed slowly, savoring the taste.  
"你今早是第一个起床的，" 明日香指出，"而且我知道昨晚饭后桌子是干净的。" 她将那小块食物放入口中，慢慢地咀嚼，细细品味着味道。

Knowing it was useless, Shinji made no argument but instead sat down to his own breakfast. The door slid open behind them and Misato appeared, looking haggard and worn—and she was most certainly not appropriately dressed.  
明知无济于事，真嗣没有争辩，而是坐下来享用自己的早餐。门在他们身后滑开，美里出现了，看起来疲惫不堪，衣着也绝对不合时宜。

"Ohayoo." She stumbled to the stove and stabbed a fork into the remaining omelette, not noticing the shocked stares of the Second and Third Children.  
"早上好。" 她踉跄地走向炉子，用叉子戳进剩下的煎蛋卷，没有注意到二号和三号适格者震惊的目光。

"Misato," Asuka asked, no longer able to contain her curiosity, "what happened to your legs?!"  
"美里," 明日香忍不住好奇心问道, "你的腿怎么了?!"

Confused, Misato glanced down.  
困惑中, 美里低头看去。

_When did it get this bad!?  
什么时候变得这么严重了!?_

She'd first noticed the bruise on her left hip several weeks ago, but couldn't remember when she had gotten it. She had shrugged it off; bruises had come and gone without her knowledge in the past. But this one hadn't healed itself; if anything, it had worsened. It had spread.  
几周前，她第一次注意到左臀上的淤青，但记不清是什么时候弄的。她耸耸肩没当回事；过去淤青来去无踪，她从未留意。但这次不同，它没有自愈；反而恶化了。它扩散了。

And now it was halfway down her thigh. Both thighs, actually.  
如今，淤青已蔓延至大腿中部。实际上，两条腿都有。

"Kaji didn't...?" Asuka prompted, letting the question hang in the air.  
“加持他……？”明日香试探性地问，让问题悬在空中。

Misato stiffened. "If you're asking if he hit me, the answer is no," she responded crossly. Shinji glanced worriedly at his guardian as she sat down and began to eat rather forcedly. He had the impression that she had no appetite whatsoever.  
"美里僵住了。“如果你问的是他有没有打我，答案是没有，”她不悦地回答。真嗣担忧地看着他的监护人，她坐下来开始有些勉强地吃东西。他觉得她根本就没有胃口。”

_I'll ask Ritsuko about it later_, she thought. _I need a beer._  
她想，稍后我会问律子。我需要一杯啤酒。

Misato dropped her fork limply, letting it clatter on her plate. "Asuka... get me a beer, will you?"  
美里无力地放下叉子，让它在盘子上发出声响。“明日香……给我拿杯啤酒，好吗？”

Asuka took great pleasure in refusing. Without a word Shinji got up and fetched it for her.  
明日香非常享受拒绝的过程。真嗣一言不发地站起来，为她取来了东西。

"Thanks, Shin-chan..." “谢谢，真嗣君……”

"Always acting the hero," Asuka snorted. "_Whatever_ would we do without the valiant Third Child?"  
“总是扮演英雄，”明日香嗤之以鼻，“没有勇敢的第三适格者，我们该怎么办呢？”

Misato popped open the beer and downed half of it in one gulp.  
美里啪的一声打开啤酒，一口气喝掉了半罐。

"All right." She slammed the empty can on the wooden table with as much force as she could muster, emitting a deeply satisfied sigh. "Ready to go?"  
"好了。" 她用尽全力将空罐子猛地拍在木桌上，发出一声心满意足的叹息。"准备出发了吗？"

"Been up and waiting," Asuka announced.  
"早就起来了，一直在等你。" 明日香宣布道。

"Misato-san," Shinji began hesitantly, "shouldn't you put on some clothes first?"  
"美里小姐，" 真嗣犹豫地开口，"你是不是应该先穿上衣服？"

Misato glanced down and was met with the angry glare of her bruises. _I'll have to wear long pants, if I don't want everyone demanding to know what happened to me._ She glanced uncomfortably at the window. The thermometer informed her that it was no less than ninety-seven degrees outside.  
美里低头瞥了一眼，迎上了自己淤青的愤怒目光。如果不想让每个人都追问发生了什么，我得穿长裤。她不安地瞥向窗户。温度计显示外面至少有九十七度。

"Right," she replied in a strained voice, "go get in the car, and I'll be out in a minute."  
"好的，" 她用压抑的声音回答，"去车上等我，我马上就来。"

Sorhyu Asuka Langley was not happy. It did not please the Second Child to be stuck within twelve feet of the Third, unless her fist was making contact with his face. She sighed and crossed her arms again, this time placing her left arm on top of her right. This new arrangement kept her temporarily pacified. If Misato didn't show up soon, she might just go home and refuse to go to Nerv for the day.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷并不开心。第二适格者不喜欢被困在离第三适格者十二英尺以内的地方，除非她的拳头正打在他的脸上。她叹了口气，再次交叉双臂，这次将左臂放在右臂之上。这种新的排列暂时让她平静下来。如果美里不快点出现，她可能会直接回家，拒绝今天去 NERV。

_Why the hell does Ritsuko need a new synchronization test every other day?_ she fumed. _Unbelievable._  
为什么赤木律子每隔一天就需要一个新的同步测试？她愤怒地想。难以置信。

Behind her, Shinji murmured quietly, "I wonder what's taking her so long..."  
在她身后，真嗣轻声嘀咕道：“不知道她怎么这么慢……”

Asuka closed her eyes in annoyance. "Then why don't you go find out, Third Child?"  
明日香不悦地闭上了眼睛。“那你为什么不自己去查清楚，第三适格者？”

To her surprise, he obeyed.  
令她惊讶的是，他居然照做了。

The door slammed behind him, leaving the redhead alone in Misato's old blue car. Asuka was cramped; there wasn't exactly much legroom. She had always had long legs—and she was proud of them, except on occasions such as these. The heat only added to her discomfort. Frustrated, Asuka rolled it down manually—if Tokyo-3 was so technologically advanced, why didn't they have those electricity-controlled car windows where all you had to do was press a button?  
门在他身后砰地一声关上，留下红发的少女独自坐在美里旧蓝车里。明日香感到局促不安；这里实在没有多少腿部空间。她一直有着修长的双腿——对此她颇为自豪，除了像这样的时刻。炎热更增添了她的不适。明日香烦躁地手动摇下车窗——如果东京-3 的科技如此先进，为什么他们没有那种只需按个按钮就能控制的电动车窗呢？

"Summer," she muttered. "It was never this hot in Germany... damn!"  
"夏天，" 她喃喃道，"德国从没这么热过……该死！"

The Second Child leaned out the window with a bored expression on her face, balancing her chin on the edge of the glass.  
第二适格者懒洋洋地探出窗外，脸上挂着无聊的表情，下巴抵在玻璃边缘。

"He probably got lost on his way up, that baka," she muttered.  
"他可能在来的路上迷路了，那个笨蛋，" 她咕哝道。"

Shinji, however, was anything but lost. He had made his way up to the apartment quickly, basking in the cool air of the apartment building. In fact, perhaps it was a good thing that he had been sent to fetch Misato after all.  
然而，真嗣并没有迷失方向。他迅速地来到了公寓，享受着公寓楼里的凉爽空气。事实上，或许他被派来接美里终究是件好事。

That happy mood quickly dissipated when no one answered, regardless of how much damage he did to the door.  
这种愉快的心情很快消失了，因为无论他怎么敲门，都没有人应答。

"Misato-san!" he yelled. “美里小姐！”他大声喊道。

After the fifteenth shout, Shinji had lifted his fist to land yet another thump on the door when it suddenly slid open, forcing him to grab the doorframe to keep from falling over.  
在第十五次喊叫后，真嗣举起拳头准备再次敲门，门却突然滑开了，迫使他抓住门框以防摔倒。

"Sorry," Misato muttered. "Come on, let's go."  
“抱歉，”美里咕哝道，“走吧，我们进去。”

Shinji watched his guardian and commanding officer carefully as they stepped into the elevator. She looked exhausted, more than he had ever seen before. Her hair hung limply around her shoulders, not bouncy as it usually was. She wore the usual red jacket—and long jeans. A hot breeze enveloped them as they stepped out onto the marble tiles of the first floor.  
真嗣仔细观察着他的监护人和指挥官，他们走进电梯。她看起来疲惫不堪，比以往任何时候都要憔悴。她的头发无力地垂在肩上，不再像平时那样有弹性。她穿着那件标志性的红色夹克——还有长牛仔裤。当他们踏出电梯，踏上大理石铺就的一楼地面时，一阵热风迎面扑来。

"Damn, where did that girl go?"  
"该死，那女孩去哪儿了？"

Shinji followed her gaze to her car and noticed that it was indeed empty. One glance at Misato told him that she'd better sit down, so he offered to look for Asuka while she got the car started up. The Major quickly agreed. It didn't take the Third Child long to locate the Second.  
真嗣顺着她的目光看向她的车，注意到车里确实空无一人。他瞥了一眼美里，知道她最好坐下来，于是提议去找明日香，而她则去发动车子。美里少校迅速同意了。第三适格者没花多长时间就找到了第二适格者。

Asuka was standing only a short distance away. Her fingers were outstretched, their tips barely brushing the silky petals of the cherry blossoms.  
明日香站在不远处。她的手指伸展开来，指尖轻轻触碰着樱花柔软的花瓣。

"Deutschland..." she whispered, remember. "Mama..."  
"德国..."她低语，回忆着。"妈妈..."

_There was a tree like this in Germany, outside our house, and every spring it would bloom... Kaji told me it was from Japan. The one connection I had with Mama after she died.  
在德国，我们家外面也有一棵这样的树，每年春天都会开花...加持告诉我它来自日本。妈妈去世后，这是我与她唯一的联系。_

A twig cracked behind her, followed by the last voice she wanted to hear.  
她身后传来树枝断裂的声音，紧接着是她最不想听到的声音。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The redhead whirled around, her soft musings dissolving in an instant. "Third Child! Don't spy on me!"  
红发少女猛地转身，她温柔的沉思瞬间消散。“三号孩子！别偷看我！”

The Third tried frantically—futilely—to defend himself against her accusations, but all was to no avail; five minutes later, a fiery Asuka and a rather bruised Shinji (though it was nothing compared to what his commander bore) made their way back to the car.  
三号孩子拼命——徒劳地——试图为自己辩护，但一切都是徒劳；五分钟后，愤怒的明日香和相当青肿的 Shinji（尽管与他的指挥官所承受的相比微不足道）回到了车上。

"Took you long enough," Asuka snapped at the driver, as she got into the passenger's seat.  
“你花了这么长时间，”明日香一上车就对司机厉声说道，坐进了副驾驶座。

Misato made no reply. 美里没有回答。

Several miles down the road Asuka asked, "Can't you turn on the air conditioner?"  
几英里后，明日香问道：“你不能开空调吗？”

"There isn't one in this car." Misato's reply was clipped and curt.  
“这辆车没有空调。”美里的回答简短而干脆。

"Unbelievable." Asuka shook her head. "You work for the most technologically advanced organization in the world—and your car doesn't have _air conditioning_."  
“难以置信。”明日香摇了摇头。“你为世界上最尖端的组织工作——而你的车居然没有空调。”

Misato did not reply. 美里没有回答。

Her hopes of being able to speak to Ritsuko alone were quickly dashed as Maya ran outside to meet her, clipboard in hand. "Major, Sempai is waiting to start the test."  
她原本希望能单独和律子谈话的希望很快就破灭了，因为玛雅拿着夹板跑出来迎接她。“少校，前辈正在等您开始测试。”

"I see," Misato replied dryly.  
"我明白了，"美里冷淡地回答。

Asuka thrust open the door, almost knocking Maya over. "Hurry up, baka! You're so slow!"  
明日香猛地推开门，差点把真希波撞倒。"快点，笨蛋！你太慢了！"

"Yes..." Shinji followed. Misato stretched, then slammed her door and slowly made her way around the car. Maya led the two children inside, Asuka striding in the lead.  
"是的..."真嗣跟在后面。美里伸了个懒腰，然后用力关上车门，缓缓绕过车子。真希波领着两个孩子进去，明日香大步走在前面。

"I'm here." “我来了。”

Ritsuko glanced up over the screen of her laptop. "You're late."  
律子从笔记本电脑屏幕上抬起头来。“你迟到了。”

Asuka growled. "It's all Misato's fault! That—"  
明日香咆哮道：“都是美里那家伙的错！那个——”

"Maya," Ritsuko interrupted, not looking up, "where _is_ the Major?"  
"真嗣," 律子打断道，没有抬头，"美里少校在哪里？"

Misato answered that for her, pushing open the heavy wooden door with obvious effort. She welcomed the cool air and stepped willingly into the dark facilities of Nerv, away from the blistering heat.  
美里替她回答了，费力地推开那扇沉重的木门。她欢迎这股凉爽的空气，并自愿步入 NERV 昏暗的设施中，远离那灼人的热浪。

Ritsuko nodded and directed the pilots to the changing rooms.  
律子点点头，指示驾驶员们前往更衣室。

Misato sank into a chair beside her old college friend, not caring that it belonged to Makoto. Surely he wouldn't mind. Ritsuko cast a side glance at her, then found her appearance so curious that she had to fully turn around.  
美里一屁股坐在她大学老友旁边的椅子上，毫不在意那其实是真嗣的座位。他肯定不会介意的。律子侧目瞥了她一眼，随即被她的装扮勾起了好奇心，不得不完全转过身来。

"Why are you wearing long jeans? It's 97.385 degrees outside."  
“你为什么穿长牛仔裤？外面可是 97.385 度。”

"I'll tell you later," the Major mumbled, well aware that Shigeru and Maya were paying close attention. She wondered where Makoto had gone.  
“我晚点再告诉你，”少校咕哝道，她很清楚四郎和玛雅正密切关注着。她纳闷真嗣去了哪里。

The blonde shrugged and focused her gaze on the pane displaying the three pilots. She did, however, continue to throw concerned glances in Misato's direction. Several minutes passed before the Major drew herself to an upright position, gazing alertly at the screen.  
金发女子耸了耸肩，将目光集中在显示三位驾驶员的屏幕上。然而，她仍不时担忧地瞥向美里那边。几分钟后，美里少校才挺直身子，警觉地盯着屏幕。

Ritsuko was wearing the expression she usually wore only when engaged in deep thought about how to defeat the next angel when the three pilots emerged from the dressing room again. At least for now, they were safe; all three Magi supercomputers were operating properly and reporting neither errors nor blue patterns. All tests had recorded superb results; under other circumstances she might have worn an excited grin. The technicians had no data transfers to do, and were sitting idly awaiting further instructions. She was concerned only for the woman sitting next to her.  
当三位驾驶员再次从更衣室出来时，律子脸上挂着她通常只有在深思如何击败下一个使徒时才会露出的表情。至少目前，他们安全了；三台 MAGI 超级计算机运行正常，没有报告错误或蓝色图案。所有测试结果都极为出色；在其他情况下，她可能会露出兴奋的笑容。技术人员们无事可做，正闲坐着等待进一步指示。她只担心坐在她旁边的那个女人。

At some point she became aware that the three children were awaiting orders as well. Ritsuko turned to her favorite technician.  
不知何时，她意识到那三个孩子也在等待命令。律子转向她最喜欢的技术人员。

"Yes, Sempai?" “是的，前辈？”

"I'm giving you one hour off," Ritsuko instructed, and Maya's brown eyes widened in surprise. "I want you to take Shinji, Asuka, and Rei to their respective homes, then report back to duty."  
“我给你一个小时休息，”律子命令道，真嗣的棕色眼睛惊讶地睁大了。“我要你带真嗣、明日香和丽各自回家，然后回来报到。”

Maya's eyes were as wide as saucers, mirroring Shinji's. "What if... an angel attacks...?"  
真嗣的眼睛睁得像盘子一样大，与真嗣如出一辙。“如果……使徒来袭……怎么办？”

"Shigeru and Makoto can take over until you get here," Ritsuko insisted smoothly, skillfully keeping the confusion and worry out of her voice. "I know how to reach you in case of an emergency. Should anything happen, Maya, I shall expect you here before even the pilots themselves arrive."  
"Shigeru 和 Makoto 可以接手直到你到达，" Ritsuko 坚定而流畅地说道，巧妙地隐藏了声音中的困惑和担忧。"我知道如何在紧急情况下联系你。如果发生任何事情，Maya，我希望你能在飞行员们到达之前就赶到这里。"

"Yes, Sempai." "是的，前辈。"

Ritsuko nodded. Of the three pilots, Shinji was most hesitant to leave; Asuka simply strode out without a backwards glance and Rei followed in her wake. The pilot of Evangelion Unit 01 hung back and cast a preoccupied glance at his guardian.  
Ritsuko 点了点头。在三位驾驶员中，Shinji 最不愿意离开；Asuka 毫不犹豫地大步走出，没有回头看一眼，Rei 紧随其后。Evangelion 初号机的驾驶员犹豫不决，心事重重地看向他的监护人。

"Will she be all right?"  
"她会没事吗？"

"Yes," the doctor replied, without hesitation.  
"会的，" 医生毫不犹豫地回答道。

When the boy had finally been ushered out the door, Ritsuko stood up and led Misato into a private room. She didn't want to take any chance of the conversation being recorded, as she wasn't sure what her old college friend would tell her. The doctor situated the purple-haired lady onto the bed of the small examining room and studied her. Her chin was drooping.  
当男孩终于被送出门外后，律子站起身来，领着美里进了一间私人房间。她不想冒任何谈话被录音的风险，因为她不确定这位老校友会告诉她什么。医生让紫发的女士坐在小检查室的床上，仔细观察她。她的下巴低垂着。

"Something you want to tell me, Misato?"  
"有什么想告诉我的吗，美里？"

The purple-haired woman yawned. "I'm tired. I wish I had a beer..."  
紫发的女子打了个哈欠。“我累了。真想喝杯啤酒……”

Ritsuko sighed. She strode to the closet and produced an oversized paper robe. "Change into this."  
律子叹了口气。她大步走向衣柜，拿出一件 oversized 的纸袍。“换上这个。”

"What? No!" “什么？不！”

The blonde glared. "You know I'm a certified doctor. And besides, you really shouldn't be embarrassed to change in front of me, given the way you dress at home with Shinji around."  
金发女子瞪了一眼。“你知道我是持证医生。而且，考虑到你在家里和真嗣在一起时的穿着，你真的不应该在我面前换衣服感到尴尬。”

Misato flushed and gave in.  
美里脸一红，只好妥协。

Ritsuko watched her move, eyeing the bruises with growing alarm. They were a mottled purple and red and spread generously across both thighs. Misato herself admitted that they were on her hips, too. The doctor pressed down gently in the center with two fingertips and watched the Major's face carefully for any signs of discomfort.  
律子注视着她的动作，目光落在那些淤青上，心中越发警觉。淤青斑驳，紫红交错，慷慨地分布在两条大腿上。美里自己也承认，她的臀部也有。医生用两根手指轻轻按压中心部位，仔细观察着少校的脸，留意是否有不适的迹象。

"Does it hurt?" “疼吗？”

She considered. "Not really."  
她思索了一下。“并不怎么疼。”

That was the sort of comment Ritsuko hated; they didn't tell her much of anything. "You can't remember how you got it?"  
这种话最让律子讨厌；它们几乎没透露什么信息。“你不记得是怎么弄到的吗？”

"No."

Ritsuko weighed her options. There wasn't much more she could do, besides run a blood test and check for abnormalities, and order her patient to bed. Then she remembered that the Major shared an apartment with the Second Child and realized that the chances of Misato getting much extra sleep were slim.  
律子权衡了一下选择。除了做血液检测和检查异常，以及让病人卧床休息，她能做的并不多。然后她想起了少校和二号适格者同住一个公寓，意识到美里能多睡一会儿的可能性微乎其微。

She decided to draw two samples of blood—Misato was much more complacent with having blood drawn than undressing, surprisingly—and ordered her home to sleep.  
她决定抽取两份血样——出乎意料的是，美里对抽血比脱衣服要顺从得多——然后让她回家睡觉。

"Do you want a ride home?"  
"要我载你回家吗？"

The purple-haired Major paused at the door. "Damn it, Ritsuko, it's not like I've suddenly become an invalid or anything."  
紫色头发的少校在门口停下。“该死，律子，我又不是突然变成了残废什么的。”

She waited for a retort, but it didn't come. Dr. Akagi held the vial up to the light and gave it a tiny shake. Misato snorted, slammed the door, and disappeared out of the depths of Nerv's many hallways.  
她等着反驳，但没有等到。赤城博士将试管举到灯光下，轻轻摇了摇。美里哼了一声，砰地关上门，消失在 NERV 深邃的走廊尽头。

Ritsuko watched her leave and prayed that she wouldn't drink too many beers. She lowered the vial, listening carefully for any telltale beeping from the Magi, and heard none. Nevertheless, she stored the vials away safely and returned to her post.  
律子看着她离开，祈祷她不要喝太多啤酒。她放下试管，仔细聆听是否有 MAGI 发出的任何警示蜂鸣，但什么也没听到。尽管如此，她还是将试管安全存放好，回到了自己的岗位。

"So, what did she want you for?"  
“那么，她找你有什么事？”

"To tell me to sleep." Misato was no more pleased than Ritsuko or Asuka, and it showed. "I _hate_ the heat..."  
“让我去睡觉。”美里并不比律子或明日香更高兴，这一点显而易见。“我讨厌这热天……”

Asuka tossed her hair. "That would be _your_ fault for the long jeans."  
明日香甩了甩头发。“那得怪你，谁让你穿长牛仔裤。”

Misato briefly considered slapping her, imagined the scolding she would get from the Commander for lowering the girl's synchronization ratio, and instead went into her room. Much to her chagrin, Asuka followed.  
美里短暂地考虑过扇她一巴掌，想象了一下因为降低女孩同步率而受到司令责骂的情景，转而走进了自己的房间。令她懊恼的是，明日香紧随其后。

"So, what's wrong with you?"  
“那么，你有什么问题？”

Misato spread herself out on the bed and stretched. Her hands pressed flat against the wall and her toes gripped the foot of her bed. Several moments passed before she could be certain of speaking in a cool voice.  
美里展开身体躺在床上，伸了个懒腰。她的双手平贴在墙上，脚趾紧紧抓住床尾。过了好一会儿，她才能确定自己能用冷静的声音说话。

"I'm tired, Asuka. Will you please leave?"  
“我累了，明日香。请你离开好吗？”

"Leave?" The Second Child did just the opposite and sat down on the edge of Misato's bed, crossing her arms and legs. "So what deadly disease have you got? Or is it something you're embarrassed to tell? Or—"  
“离开？”第二适格者非但没有离开，反而坐在美里床边，交叉着双臂和双腿。“你得了什么致命的病吗？还是有什么不好意思说的？或者——”

"_Asuka_," Misato groaned, dragging out both a's.  
"明日香," 美里呻吟着，把两个 a 音拖得老长。

"Or—" Asuka gave the bed just a bit of a naughty bounce, "you caught an STD from Kaji!"  
"或者——" 明日香在床上轻轻地弹了一下，带着几分调皮，"你从加持那里染上了性病！"

"DAMN YOU!" "该死！"

The Katsuragi apartment exploded. Misato was on her feet in a flash, so threateningly that Asuka actually jumped backwards. The Major was infuriated, sputtering incomprehensible words, too angry to form proper sentences.  
葛城公寓爆炸了。美里瞬间站起身来，气势汹汹到让明日香真的后退了一步。少校怒不可遏，语无伦次，气得连完整句子都说不出来。

"I—have—NOT—gotten—an STD—from—Kaji," she ground out furiously. It took Asuka a moment to regain her composure.  
"我——绝——对——没——从——加持——那里——染上——性病，"她愤怒地咬牙切齿。明日香花了片刻才恢复镇定。

"Whatever." She shrugged and left, sliding the door shut behind her. It promptly hit the other wall and slid open again. Since the redhead was long gone, Misato made her way slowly to the door and shut it properly, locking it for good measure.  
"随你怎么说。"她耸耸肩离开，顺手拉上了门。门立刻撞到另一面墙上又滑开了。由于红发少女早已远去，美里缓缓走向门口，将其关好并顺手上了锁。

_Damn you, Asuka_. 该死的，明日香。

No more thoughts fluttered through her head as she sank like a stone into the soft blankets and fell fast asleep.  
她的脑海中不再有思绪飘过，随着她如石头般沉入柔软的被褥，她很快陷入了沉睡。

Shinji poured the beer for Pen-pen.  
真嗣为企鹅 Pen-pen 倒上了啤酒。

After all those years the penguin still had to wrestle with the aluminum can for several minutes (generally involving the loss of many feathers, which he disliked greatly) before he could get it open, and some of it would usually spill on what feathers he had left. Pen-pen didn't mind the taste of beer, but alcohol-stiffened feathers did not bode well with him. Life had improved greatly since Shinji had moved in.  
毕竟这么多年过去了，企鹅还是得和铝罐搏斗好几分钟（通常会损失很多羽毛，这是他非常不喜欢的）才能打开它，而且通常会有一些洒在他剩下的羽毛上。Pen-pen 并不介意啤酒的味道，但酒精硬化了的羽毛对他来说并不好。自从真嗣搬进来后，生活有了很大的改善。

The door slid open to reveal Asuka, dressed neatly in her school uniform. Had Shinji not known her, his first impression would have been of a sweet little schoolgirl—until her expression changed to a scowl. He served her breakfast quickly and escaped without injury back to the kitchen, where he finished up her lunch.  
门滑开了，露出穿着整齐校服的明日香。如果不是认识她，真嗣的第一印象会是一个甜美的小女生——直到她的表情变成皱眉。他迅速为她端上早餐，毫发无伤地逃回厨房，在那里他完成了她的午餐。

"Where's Misato?" he asked cautiously.  
“美里在哪里？”他小心翼翼地问道。

"Not up yet, probably still asleep, dreaming of Kaji." She accented the last three words with an angry twist that clearly showed her jealousy. Wisely, Shinji chose not to comment. They finished up their breakfast in silence, interrupted periodically by Pen-pen slurping up his beer.  
“还没起床呢，估计还在睡，梦见加持吧。”她加重了最后三个字的语气，明显流露出嫉妒之情。明智地，真嗣选择不发表评论。他们默默地吃完早餐，期间不时被喝啤酒的企鹅潘-潘打断。

Asuka picked up her schoolbag and slung it over her shoulder, then bent down to put on her shoes. Shinji glanced awkwardly at Misato's room. The door was still shut. His hesitation earned him another insult from the redhead.  
明日香拿起书包甩在肩上，然后弯腰穿鞋。真嗣尴尬地瞥了一眼美里房间的门，依然紧闭着。他的犹豫换来了红发少女的又一次嘲讽。

"Baka, are you coming or not?" Asuka shouted. Her voice reverberated around the hallway.  
“笨蛋，你到底走不走？”明日香大喊道。她的声音在走廊里回荡。

"In just one minute." Shinji seized a sheet of paper and scribbled:  
"只需一分钟。" 真嗣抓起一张纸，匆匆写下：

_Misato: 美里：_

_Gone to school, will be back at usual time to make dinner  
上学去了，会按平时时间回来做饭_

_Shinji 真嗣_

He threw on his shoes and locked the door, running to catch up with Asuka. She was already in the elevator, exasperatedly holding the door open. Funny, his shoes felt unusually tight today...  
他匆匆穿上鞋子，锁上门，跑去追上明日香。她已经在电梯里，不耐烦地撑着门。奇怪，今天鞋子感觉特别紧……

"Your shoes are on backwards," Asuka glared at him, as he placed both hands on his knees and breathed heavily. Shinji looked down and colored. Indeed, his left shoe was on his right foot, and the right shoe on his left. He only managed to retie one shoe in the time it took for them to reach the first floor and had to hop out on one foot while tying the other, feeling like an idiot.  
“你的鞋子穿反了，”明日香瞪着他，他双手撑在膝盖上，喘着粗气。真嗣低头一看，脸红了。确实，左鞋穿在了右脚上，右鞋穿在了左脚上。他们到达一楼的时间里，他只来得及重新系好一只鞋，不得不单脚跳着出去系另一只，感觉自己像个傻瓜。

He walked behind her all the way to school, not wanting to rouse anymore shouting, especially not now that she thought he was a drunkard who didn't even know which shoe went on which foot.  
他一路跟在她身后走到学校，不想再引起任何争吵，尤其是现在她认为他是个连左右脚鞋子都分不清的醉鬼。

Rei was already there when they arrived, as she usually was. Her schoolbag rested in the center of her desk, where there was no danger of it falling off. Her gaze was directed out the window. Asuka stormed past and slammed her bag down, then turned to Hikari and directed a dirty look at Shinji.  
他们到达时，丽已经在了，她通常都是如此。她的书包稳稳地放在课桌中央，那里不会掉下去。她的目光投向窗外。明日香怒气冲冲地走过，猛地甩下书包，然后转向光，对真嗣投去一个厌恶的眼神。

"Hello, Ayanami," he said softly.  
“你好，绫波。”他轻声说道。

She didn't turn her head, but for a fleeting moment she glanced in his direction.  
她没有转头，但有那么一瞬，她朝他的方向瞥了一眼。

"Hey SHINJI!" “嘿，真嗣！”

Kensuke and Toji were waving at him eagerly from the doorway. Shinji smiled and hurried toward them, but tripped over the strap of Hikari's bag and fell flat on his face.  
剑介和东治在门口热切地向他挥手。真嗣微笑着快步走向他们，却不小心绊到了光子的书包带，脸朝下摔了个结实。

"Sorry..." he quickly offered, while Kensuke and Toji burst into laughter. Asuka glowered at him. Hikari, however, simply picked up the bag and moved it out of his way.  
"对不起..."他迅速说道，而真希波和东治则爆发出笑声。明日香瞪着他。光却只是拿起袋子，挪开了他的位置。

"Don't worry about it, Ikari-kun." And rather fiercely to Toji and Kensuke, "Don't laugh at him!"  
"别在意，碇君。"她对东治和真希波严厉地说道，"别笑他！"

"Sorry, Class Rep..." Toji offered politely, but Shinji thought he detected the faintest hint of pink on his cheeks. Then he noticed that Hikari wore the same expression when informing him cordially that it didn't matter. The other thing he heard was Asuka informing her that "that baka" wasn't worth her apologies.  
"抱歉，班长..."东治礼貌地道歉，但真嗣觉得他脸上泛起了一丝微红。接着他注意到光在告诉他没关系时，脸上也带着同样的表情。他还听到明日香告诉光，"那个笨蛋"不值得她的道歉。

"We thought we'd go climb up on the roof before class for fun," Kensuke told Shinji. "Or maybe we'll stay there all class, I'm sure the teacher won't notice. Right, Toji? Ne? Hey, wake up!"  
"我们打算上课前爬到屋顶上去玩，" 真希告诉真嗣。"或者干脆整节课都待在那儿，老师肯定不会发现的。对吧，东治？呐？嘿，醒醒！"

Toji, who had been wearing a rather dreamy expression, quickly came back to earth at Kensuke's sharp jab. Shinji wasn't speaking either, but his mind was on Misato.  
东治原本带着些许梦幻的表情，在真希的猛戳下迅速回到了现实。真嗣虽然没有说话，但他的心思却在美里身上。

Kensuke glanced from one to the other, and started grumbling. "Man, Toji is all smitten with the _Class Rep_, and Shinji is—well, _Shinji_—"  
真希从一个人看到另一个人，开始嘟囔起来。"伙计，东治完全被班长迷住了，而真嗣嘛——唉，真嗣就是真嗣——"

"I'm worried about Misato," he admitted. This immediately drew both of the boys' attention.  
"我很担心美里," 他坦白道。这立刻吸引了两个男孩的注意。

"What's wrong with her?" "她怎么了？"

"Well, she doesn't eat...she just wants to sleep... and she has these huge bruises all over her legs."  
"嗯，她不吃东西...只想睡觉...而且她腿上到处都是大片淤青。"

The boys glanced at each other, alarmed.  
男孩们互相对视，显得有些惊慌。

"I'll kill the man who did that," Toji growled, punching his right fist into his left hand.  
"我会杀了那个家伙，" 冬二咬牙切齿地说，用右拳猛击左掌。

"Showing an obvious interest in Misato now—what about the Class Rep?"  
"现在明显对美里感兴趣了——那班长怎么办？"

Toji's hands dropped to his sides and he quickly assumed a neutral expression. Shinji rolled his eyes and spoke over their voices. "We've already ruled that out. Misato says no one hurt her."  
冬二双手垂在身侧，迅速换上一副中立的表情。真嗣翻了个白眼，压过他们的声音说道：“我们已经排除这个可能了。美里说没人伤害她。”

The bell rang. 铃声响起。

Another usual school day began.  
又一个寻常的学校生活开始了。

Gendo did not look happy, and this fact weighed heavily upon the doctor's mind as she smoothly instructed Maya what to do next. She knew the reason well—Misato's absence. She had been due for duty over an hour ago.  
源渡看起来并不高兴，这个事实沉重地压在医生心头，她熟练地指示真希波下一步该做什么。她很清楚原因——美里缺席了。她本应在一个多小时前就到岗的。

_Perhaps I should speak with him, tell him that the Major needs to rest—or she might not prove such an efficient Major_, Ritsuko thought, but that idea seemed no more feasible than wading through a swamp filled with hungry crocodiles. _Then again, Misato didn't want anyone to know what was going on..._  
也许我应该和他谈谈，告诉他美里少校需要休息——否则她可能无法表现得如此高效，律子想，但这个想法似乎和穿越满是饥饿鳄鱼的沼泽一样不切实际。不过，美里也不想让任何人知道发生了什么...

"Shall I transfer the data again, Sempai?"  
“需要我再次传输数据吗，前辈？”

"Hmm? No, that won't be necessary."  
“嗯？不，那没必要。”

Gendo moved, and all of Nerv stopped to watch with baited breath. Nobody could remember the last time Gendo had smiled, so his usual expressionless frown was widely accepted as the ordinary—but now he had moved after sitting for only an hour. This was very bad.  
源堂一动，整个 NERV 都屏息凝视。没人记得上次源堂笑是什么时候，所以他那惯常的无表情皱眉被广泛认为是常态——但现在他只坐了一个小时就动了。这非常不妙。

_I'll have to talk to him_, Ritsuko thought grimly, _but not in front of the technicians...in the meantime, maybe Misato will show up and save me some trouble._  
我得和他谈谈，律子阴沉地想，但不能在技术人员面前……与此同时，也许美里会出现，省去我一些麻烦。

She didn't, however. 然而，她并没有。

Eleven-thirty came and Maya took her lunch break while Shigeru and Makoto stayed on duty; at eleven-forty-five they would rotate. Gendo, too, retreated to his office, with Fuyutsuki following. Ritsuko hung behind, wanting to give Gendo some time to settle down. She had never interrupted him during his lunch break before, and she didn't think it would bode well. Ten minutes passed before she found herself standing in front of his door.  
十一点半到了，真希波去吃午饭，而四郎和真琴则继续值班；十一点四十五分他们会轮换。源堂也回到了自己的办公室，冬月跟随其后。律子留在了后面，想给源堂一些时间安顿下来。她以前从未在他午休时打扰过他，她觉得这样做不太合适。十分钟过去了，她发现自己站在了他的门前。

She knocked sharply, twice.  
她用力敲了两下门。

"Come in." "进来吧。"

She obeyed, and the darkness of Gendo's office swallowed what little light came in with her. Ritsuko shut the door behind her and waited, thankful for the vast distance that separated her from the Commander of Nerv.  
她顺从地走进去，源堂办公室的昏暗吞噬了她带来的微弱光线。律子关上门，站在远处等待，庆幸自己与 NERV 指挥官之间有着宽阔的距离。

"Well, Dr. Akagi?" "那么，赤木博士？"

He had reassumed the hide-face-behind-gloved-hands position, as Ritsuko thought of it. She cleared her throat.  
他又恢复了那种用戴手套的双手遮脸的姿势，正如律子所想的那样。她清了清嗓子。

"It came to my attention yesterday that Major Katsuragi was not well," she began, and when she detected no trace of any expression, continued. "Therefore, I gave her a routine checkup and ran some tests, suggesting that she rest as well."  
“昨天我注意到葛城少校身体不适，”她开始说道，发现对方脸上毫无表情，便继续说，“因此，我给她做了常规检查并进行了一些测试，建议她好好休息。”

The last line had not come out as well as she had wanted. She could only hope now that Gendo understood she had not meant for Misato to sleep through duty.  
最后一句话并没有她希望的那么妥帖。她现在只能寄希望于碇能明白，她并非要让美里睡过头耽误任务。

A long pause followed. 随后是一阵漫长的沉默。

"I see." “我明白了。”

Ritsuko nodded. She had nothing else to say. Another long pause ensued.  
律子点点头，无话可说。又是一阵漫长的沉默。

"Inform Major Katsuragi that she will rest herself as she needs," Gendo said at last, in a chilling tone. "However, should her presence be necessary, she will be required to arrive at Nerv immediately and present herself for duty."  
"通知葛城少校，她可以按需休息，" 碇源堂终于开口，语气冰冷，"但若需要她到场，她必须立即前往 Nerv 报到，履行职责。"

"Yes, sir," Ritsuko replied, feeling shocked.  
"是，长官，" 律子回答，心中震惊。

"Send me an official report of the test results."  
"给我一份测试结果的正式报告。"

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

The door closed behind her.  
她身后，门关上了。

"Hurry up, BAKA!" "快点，笨蛋！"

"S-sorry..." As quietly as he could, Shinji turned the creaky doorknob and opened the door to the Katsuragi apartment. Asuka made her way in first, stepping on his toes as she did so. Shinji knew better than to say anything. She settled herself in her room to do homework while Shinji cooked dinner. His own work would have to wait until later.  
"对-对不起..." 尽可能轻声地，真嗣转动着吱吱作响的门把手，打开了葛城公寓的门。明日香率先走了进去，顺便踩了他的脚趾。真嗣知道最好不要说什么。她安顿在自己的房间里做作业，而真嗣则开始准备晚餐。他自己的工作只能等到晚些时候再做了。

The pilot of Evangelion Unit 01 left his bag by the door and found himself an apron in the kitchen, wondering what to make for dinner. Soup was good, he thought, remembering that Misato had not been feeling well and still wasn't, given her closed door. Weren't you supposed to give a patient lots of fluids? He pulled out a large pot and filled it with water.  
福音战士 01 号的驾驶员把包放在门口，在厨房里找了件围裙，思考着晚餐该做什么。他想，汤不错，记得美里身体不适，而且现在还没好，从她紧闭的房门就能看出来。不是应该给病人多补充水分吗？他拿出一个大锅，装满了水。

By moving around several dozen cans of beer, Shinji managed to find some tomatoes—a little squishy, but they would do—and some eggs. A small bunch of leafy vegetables appeared a moment later, as he moved yet another stack of cans. It was past time to go grocery shopping. Fortunately, a quick inspection of the cupboards yielded packaged noodles, more than enough for all of them. Noodles and soup seemed to make a somewhat redundant meal, but it was the best he could manage under the circumstances. Shinji chopped up the vegetables and tomatoes, beat the eggs, and tossed everything into a large pot with the noodles and plenty of water.  
通过挪动几十罐啤酒，真嗣设法找到了一些西红柿——虽然有点软，但还能用——和一些鸡蛋。当他再次移动一摞罐头时，一小束绿叶蔬菜出现了。是时候去采购食品了。幸运的是，快速检查橱柜后发现有包装好的面条，足够他们所有人吃。面条和汤似乎是一种有些重复的餐食，但这是他在这种情况下能做的最好的了。真嗣切好蔬菜和西红柿，打散鸡蛋，然后把所有东西都扔进一个大锅里，加入面条和足够的水。

Asuka poked her head into the kitchen. "Third Child, where's the dictionary?"  
明日香探头进厨房。"第三适格者，字典在哪儿？"

"On the bookshelf in my room, on the third or second shelf."  
在我房间的书架上，第三层或第二层。

"Return things when you're done with them, will you?" Asuka snapped, then stormed off. Shinji didn't remind her that his bookshelf was the only one in the apartment, and where the dictionary usually resided. A moment later he heard an angry shriek from the direction of his room.  
"用完了记得还回来，行不行？" 明日香厉声说道，随即气冲冲地离开了。真嗣没有提醒她，他的书架是公寓里唯一的一个，而且通常字典就放在那里。片刻后，他听到自己房间方向传来一声愤怒的尖叫。

"BAKA! I meant the German-Japanese dictionary, not the English-Japanese dictionary!"  
"笨蛋！我说的是德日字典，不是英日字典！"

"Oh... well... that I don't know..."  
"哦... 那个... 我就不知道了..."

The unwanted dictionary bounced off of the back of Shinji's head and came to a rest at his feet.  
那本不受欢迎的字典从真嗣的后脑勺弹开，落在了他的脚边。

"Now how will I write my report?" Asuka seethed.  
“现在我怎么写报告？”明日香气愤地说。

"You could tell me the words, and I could show you how to write them."  
“你可以告诉我那些词，我可以教你如何写。”

Instead of calming her, this had the opposite effect. The Second Child insisted loudly that she did not—and would never—need his help, and followed it up with lots of insults before disappearing off to her room.  
这非但没有让她平静下来，反而产生了相反的效果。二号机驾驶员大声坚持说她不需要——也永远不会需要——他的帮助，随后还伴随着一连串的侮辱，然后消失在自己的房间里。

She reappeared in plenty of time for dinner, but Misato didn't. Her door remained closed and silent all the way through the meal. Shinji knocked repeatedly and even tried to pull it open, but found it locked. Several days passed in this way.  
她及时出现在晚餐时间，但美里没有。她的房门一直紧闭且无声，直到用餐结束。真嗣多次敲门，甚至试图强行拉开，却发现门被锁住了。这种情况持续了几天。

Nothing could have prepared him for Friday morning, however. He awoke to the persistent beeping of his clock, as usual, but upon opening the door heard sounds of running water. Perhaps Misato or Asuka had gotten up to use the restroom—usually neither was awake at this time—but it was Misato in the kitchen, heartily draining a can of beer and playing with Pen-pen, occasionally giving him a sip or two.  
然而，没有什么能让他为周五早晨做好准备。他像往常一样被持续的闹钟声吵醒，但打开门后听到了流水声。也许是美里或明日香起床去洗手间了——通常这个时候她们都还没醒——但却是美里在厨房里，痛快地喝着一罐啤酒，逗弄着 Pen-pen，偶尔还给它喝一两口。

"Good morning, Shinji," she said brightly, and he was relieved to see some color back in her face.  
“早上好，真嗣，”她明快地说道，他欣慰地看到她脸上恢复了些许血色。

"Good morning," he responded, popping two pieces of bread into the toaster. "I'm glad you're feeling better."  
“早上好，”他回应道，将两片面包塞进烤面包机。“很高兴你感觉好些了。”

Misato grinned. "Ritsuko was right. A good night's sleep does work wonders. Hey, Pen-pen! Leave me some beer!"  
美里咧嘴一笑。“律子说得对。好好睡一觉确实有奇效。嘿，Pen-pen！给我留点啤酒！”

The penguin made an angry sound, and Shinji quickly fetched (and opened) another can of Yebisu. He caught a glimpse of her legs as he placed the can in front of Pen-pen, however, and noticed that the bruises were just as unmistakable as before. Perhaps it was just him, but they seemed to have grown even larger...  
企鹅发出一声愤怒的叫声，真嗣迅速拿来（并打开）了另一罐 Yebisu 啤酒。他在将罐子放在 Pen-pen 面前时，瞥见了她的腿，注意到那些瘀伤和之前一样明显。或许是他的错觉，但它们似乎变得更大了...

A loud slam announced the arrival of Sohryu Asuka Langley. Shinji quickly stacked the toast on a plate and placed it at her spot. She said nothing, looking unusually pale, and sat down to eat. Misato noticed her unusual behavior as well and offered to drive them to school, since it was on the way to Nerv anyway. Asuka acknowledged this with barely a nod.  
一声巨响宣告了惣流·明日香·兰格雷的到来。真嗣迅速将吐司叠放在盘子里，摆放在她的位置上。她一言不发，脸色异常苍白，坐下来开始用餐。美里也注意到了她的异常行为，提出顺路开车送他们去学校，毕竟也顺路去 NERV。明日香几乎只是点了点头表示同意。

Ritsuko was delighted to see the color back in Misato's face, and even the alarming sight of those bruises couldn't lower her spirits. Maya cheered and Makoto grinned widely as she took her usual place behind the three technicians. Nerv was complete again.  
看到美里脸上恢复了血色，律子感到非常高兴，即便那些瘀伤的景象令人担忧，也无法降低她的兴致。摩耶欢呼，青叶则咧嘴大笑，她站在三位技术员身后，NERV 再次完整无缺。

"I see you took my advice," the blonde doctor said.  
"看来你采纳了我的建议，"金发医生说道。

"Yeah, even Asuka couldn't wake me, although I did dream about her screaming at Shinji over a dictionary..."  
"是啊，就连明日香也没能叫醒我，不过我倒是梦到她在字典上对真嗣大喊大叫……"

Ritsuko chuckled. Something beeped, and Maya called for her. The doctor examined the results and grinned widely. "Misato, come and look at this, will you? No errors at all! It looks all of the units are in perfect shape!"  
律子轻声笑了。这时，某个仪器发出哔哔声，摩耶呼唤她过去。医生检查了结果，露出灿烂的笑容。"美里，过来看看这个，好吗？完全没有错误！看来所有单元都处于完美状态！"

"Really?" That's wonderful news!" Misato had gone only a few steps before she tripped over the leg of Makoto's chair. Her knee scraped against a broken piece of plastic on the seat and began to bleed. He blushed and quickly helped her up.  
"真的吗？" 这真是太好了！" 美里刚走了几步就绊倒在真琴椅子的腿上。她的膝盖擦过椅子上的一块碎塑料，开始流血。他脸红了，迅速扶她起来。

"Damn..." "该死..."

Ritsuko peered at it. "That shouldn't be hard to fix." She found a bandage and applied it tightly, changing the subject. "Which dress are you going to wear tomorrow?"  
律子仔细看了看。"这应该不难修。" 她找到一个绷带并紧紧地包扎好，转移了话题。"你明天打算穿哪件衣服？"

"Oh, the wedding party...well, I just wore that suit to Kiyomi's party," Misato said thoughtfully, watching Ritsuko wipe off the blood with a paper towel. "And I wore the navy-blue dress to Kotoko's." She shifted in her chair and jerked as a spasm of pain shot through her leg. Makoto glanced at her in fear. She smiled at him, assuring him she was fine, and turned back to Ritsuko. "Maybe I should buy a new one on the way home today, but that'll cost a lot... damn, everyone is so eager to marry before they turn thirty years old nowadays!"  
"哦，那些婚礼派对啊...我那次只是为了清美的派对才穿了那套西装，"美里若有所思地说道，看着律子用纸巾擦去血迹。"而那件深蓝色礼服则是为了小子的派对穿的。"她挪了挪椅子，突然一阵疼痛袭来，让她不由自主地抽搐了一下。真琴担忧地看了她一眼。她朝他微笑，示意自己没事，然后又转向律子。"也许今天回家路上我该买件新的，但这可不便宜...该死，现在大家都在三十岁前急着结婚！"

Ritsuko chuckled. "We don't want to be the last ones remaining single." She scribbled a note on her clipboard and called out to the pilots.  
律子轻笑道："我们可不想成为最后剩下的单身汉。"她在剪贴板上草草记下一笔，然后向驾驶员们喊话。

"All right, you're done for the day. Good job."  
"好了，今天的工作结束了。干得不错。"

Misato watched the image of Asuka toss its red hair. "Always tests, tests! These stupid tests!"  
美里看着屏幕上明日香甩动她那头红发的影像。“总是测试，测试！这些愚蠢的测试！”

Hours later, when all tests were done and the pilots had gone home, Ritsuko asked, "Are you interested in shopping today?"  
几个小时后，当所有测试都已完成，驾驶员们也各自回家，律子问道：“你今天有兴趣去购物吗？”

"Not particularly," the Major considered. "But I'll have to find something to wear. In any case, I want to get a good night's sleep for tomorrow night."  
“并不特别感兴趣，”美里少校思索道，“但我得找些衣服穿。无论如何，我想为明晚好好睡一觉。”

"Suit yourself." "随你便。"

Misato lifted herself out of the chair, pushing down hard on both armrests. When she stood up, however, the muscle tensed and a fresh stream of blood spurted down her leg.  
美里从椅子上起身，用力按住两侧的扶手。然而，当她站起来时，肌肉紧绷，一股新鲜的血液顺着她的腿流了下来。

"Damn it... hey Ritsuko, do you mind fixing this up for me?"  
"该死……嘿，律子，你能帮我处理一下吗？"

"It hasn't clotted yet?" Ritsuko asked, in a voice tinged with the faintest hint of panic. "Maya, get me a bandage?"  
"还没凝固吗？" 律子问道，声音中带着一丝几乎察觉不到的慌乱。"玛雅，帮我拿个绷带好吗？"

"Yes, Sempai." "好的，前辈。"

Ritsuko tore off the old bandage ("Ouch, be careful!") and carefully reapplied the new one after cleaning up the wound as best as she could. The cut wasn't deep and didn't require stitches, but it showed no signs of ceasing to bleed anytime soon. Ritsuko fastened the bandage and stood back. "Do you want me to help you to the car?"  
律子撕下旧绷带（"哎哟，小心点！"），在尽可能清理好伤口后，小心翼翼地重新包扎上新的绷带。伤口不深，不需要缝合，但似乎一时半会儿也不会停止流血。律子固定好绷带，退后一步。"需要我扶你去车上吗？"

"Nope. See you tomorrow."  
"不，明天见。"

Ritsuko watched uncomfortably as Misato limped slowly to the door and exited. She had a faint idea of what was wrong, but knew from experience not to jump the gun. Somehow she became aware that Misato's blood was still on her hand, and made to clean it off. Under the bright lights the doctor noticed a slightly whitish tinge to the fluid.  
律子不安地看着美里一瘸一拐地慢慢走向门口并离开。她隐约知道问题所在，但根据经验，她知道不要急于下结论。不知怎么的，她意识到美里的血还在她手上，于是开始清洗。在明亮的灯光下，医生注意到液体略带白色。

She blinked several times, thinking of the laboratory tests she had run with Misato's blood samples. The Full Blood Count and Hematocrit Assay she had completed on her own, and both supported—but did not confirm—her suspicions. Yet this—Ritsuko glanced at her hand again before rinsing the blood off—this worried her. It was time to contact a specialist.  
她眨了几次眼，回想起自己对美里血液样本进行的实验室测试。她亲自完成了全血细胞计数和血细胞比容测定，这两项都支持——但并未证实——她的怀疑。然而这个——律子再次瞥了一眼自己的手，然后冲洗掉血液——这个让她担忧。是时候联系一位专家了。

"I'm back." "我回来了。"

"Hi," Asuka said, without looking at her.  
"嗨，" 明日香说道，没有看她一眼。

"Go to bed right now, because you have a date tomorrow," Misato ordered. The redhead was spread out in the living room, reading a magazine. The TV was on but she paid not the least bit of attention. Asuka flipped a page.  
"现在就去睡觉，因为你明天有个约会，" 美里命令道。红发的女孩摊在客厅里，读着一本杂志。电视开着，但她一点也没在意。明日香翻了一页。

"Yeah... hey, can I use your lavender perfume?"  
"是啊...嘿，我能用你的薰衣草香水吗？"

"Nope, that's not for you. You're still a child. Is Shinji-kun in his room?"  
"不行，那不是给你的。你还是个孩子。真嗣君在他房间里吗？"

"You're so stingy," Asuka complained. "And he's been shutting himself inside for awhile; it seems that he doesn't want to see his father. Japanese people are such a..."  
"你真小气，"明日香抱怨道。"他已经把自己关在里面好一阵子了；看来他不想见他父亲。日本人真是..."

_It's not that he really hates it,_ Misato thought to herself, tuning out Asuka's voice as she closed the door. He was lying on the bed, the SDAT player in his hand, although the tiny mechanisms were still. The lights were off.  
并非他真的讨厌，美里暗自思忖，关上门时忽略了明日香的声音。他躺在床上，手中握着 SDAT 播放器，尽管那微小的机械装置已静止不动。房间里灯光已熄。

"You're not afraid of being with your father alone, are you?" she said quietly, into the darkness. "You can't always run away; you have to go one step further; otherwise, nothing will change."  
“你并不害怕单独与你父亲相处，对吧？”她轻声说道，融入黑暗中。“你不能总是逃避；你必须再向前迈进一步；否则，一切都不会改变。”

She half expected a violent outburst, but he replied with only a sigh and two words: "I know."  
她半是期待着一场激烈的爆发，但他只回以一声叹息和两个字：“我知道。”

"You'll have to go beyond the first step, and keep going," she told him softly. Shinji didn't move. "Anyhow, you'd better prepare yourself mentally, since tomorrow you'll see your mother."  
"你得跨出第一步，然后继续前进，"她温柔地对他说。真嗣没有动。"无论如何，你最好在心理上做好准备，因为明天你会见到你的母亲。"

He said nothing. The boy wasn't even facing her, although she was seated on the edge of his bed. Misato knew he wasn't asleep but understood his need for solitude, and she let him have it. She stayed silent, pondering Ritsuko's words of not wanting to be the only single woman remaining.  
他什么也没说。男孩甚至没有面对她，尽管她坐在他的床边。美里知道他没睡着，但理解他需要独处的时刻，于是她让他拥有这份宁静。她保持沉默，思索着律子不想成为唯一单身女性的那些话。

"Hey, you bought a dress for tomorrow? Let me see!"  
"嘿，你明天买了新裙子吗？让我看看！"

Asuka had finally lost interest in the magazine. She laughed a little, remembering, and left Shinji's side. "You want to see? It was quite expensive."  
明日香终于对那本杂志失去了兴趣。她轻笑一声，回忆着往事，离开了真嗣的身边。“你想看吗？这东西可不便宜。”

"Red, blue, and yellow..."  
“红色、蓝色和黄色……”

Ritsuko tapped her fingers on the table and propped her head up with the other hand. "He's late."  
律子用手指敲打着桌面，另一只手撑着头。“他迟到了。”

"That idiot's never showed up on time." Misato drank deeply.  
"那个白痴从来没准时过。" 美里深深地喝了一口。

"Only when he's on a date," Ritsuko contradicted. "He was quite punctual when it came to work hours."  
"只有约会时才会，" 律子反驳道。"工作时间他倒是相当守时。"

Kaji slid in beside the Major, making her uncomfortably nervous.  
加持滑到律子旁边坐下，让她感到一阵不自在的紧张。

"You two look quite beautiful today," he said, and Misato glared at him again. "Unfortunately I couldn't leave work on time."  
"你们俩今天看起来真漂亮，"他说道，美里再次瞪了他一眼。"可惜我没能准时下班。"

"That's because you're always wasting time," Misato grumbled. "And why don't you shave that sloppy beard? Besides, your tie is a mess." She reached over and fixed it, nearly strangling him in the process. Kaji pasted an apologetic look on his face.  
"那是因为你总是浪费时间，"美里嘟囔着。"还有，你为什么不刮掉那邋遢的胡子？再说了，你的领带也乱七八糟的。"她伸手帮他整理，差点把他勒得喘不过气来。加持脸上露出了歉意的表情。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Ritsuko was having trouble trying not to laugh. "You two look like wife and husband!"  
律子努力忍住不笑出声来。"你们俩看起来真像一对夫妻！"

Misato blanched, and Kaji affirmed the doctor's point. The purple-haired woman snorted, drank from her glass, and set it down with a noisy _clunk_. "Who would marry this sort of guy?" She pushed her chair back and stood up, a bit unsteadily. "I'm going to fix my hair."  
美里脸色苍白，加持肯定了医生的观点。紫发女子哼了一声，从杯中饮了一口，然后重重地放下杯子。“谁会嫁给这种家伙？”她推开椅子，有些不稳地站了起来。“我去整理一下头发。”

"Need an arm?" Kaji asked, rising to the occasion in a gentlemanly fashion. Misato glared at him and began moving away as quickly as she could, but stumbled. Both Ritsuko and Kaji made their way to her side, but she slapped the man away.  
“需要帮忙吗？”加持绅士般地起身问道。美里瞪了他一眼，迅速离开，却不小心绊了一下。赤木律子和加持都向她走去，但她却挥手拒绝了加持的帮助。

"Is it still your leg?" Ritsuko muttered urgently, under her breath.  
“还是腿的问题吗？”赤木律子急切地低声说道。

"At least...it's not bleed...bleeding anymore," Misato whispered, her sentence torn into fragments by her ragged breathing. She remained on her knees, coughing and gasping for air. People began to crowd around her, murmuring feverishly. Misato covered her mouth with one hand as she coughed violently, and waved the other desperately, muttering something that sounded to Ritsuko like "I'm fine. I'm fine."  
“至少……不再流血了。”美里低声说道，话语被急促的呼吸撕裂成碎片。她仍跪在地上，咳嗽着，喘不过气来。人们开始围拢过来，热切地低语。美里用一只手捂住嘴剧烈咳嗽，另一只手则拼命挥动，喃喃自语，听起来像是“我没事，我没事。”

Kaji kept one hand on her shoulder after it became clear that she wouldn't push him away, his mind clouded with fear and worry. _She seemed fine just a minute ago. What did she say to Ritsuko—something not bleeding anymore_?  
当确定她不会推开他时，加持一直把手放在她的肩膀上，心中充满了恐惧和担忧。她刚才看起来还好好的。她对律子说了什么——不再流血了？

When her face developed a tint of blue, he picked her up and swung her into his arms as if she weighed nothing more than a feather. The crowd automatically parted for him as he hurried towards the door.  
当她的脸色泛起一抹蓝色时，他抱起她，仿佛她轻如鸿毛，快步向门口走去，人群自动为他让出一条路。

Ritsuko remained in the throng of people. She knew of Kaji's true feelings for Misato and trusted him with her. That man would get her medical help if it would cost him his life.  
律子依旧混在人群中。她知道加持对美里真挚的情感，并信任他将她托付给他。那个男人会不惜一切代价，甚至生命，为她寻求医疗救助。

Her cell phone rang then, and she pulled it out of her pocket to see who had called. The glowing panel read quite simply, "Namika."  
这时，她的手机响了，她从口袋里掏出来看是谁打来的。发光的屏幕上简单地显示着：“美香”。

Ritsuko put the phone to her ear and hurried away from the crowd.  
律子将手机贴近耳边，匆匆离开人群。

It was near midnight when the building that contained the Katsuragi apartment came into view. Both of them were exhausted, but Misato was fast asleep and nestled in Kaji's strong arms, while he walked on toward her home. He hoped Asuka was asleep; it would be much easier to explain the situation to Shinji-kun.  
接近午夜时分，那座包含着葛城公寓的建筑映入眼帘。两人都已筋疲力尽，但美里已沉沉睡去，依偎在加持那强壮的臂弯中，而他则继续向她的家走去。他希望明日香已经入睡；这样向真嗣解释情况会容易得多。

Her coughing attack had calmed down substantially by the time he got her to the emergency room, and the paramedics there hadn't been able to do much of anything at the moment, except produce some sedatives to calm the distraught young woman. They had taken x-rays of her lungs and scolded them about the amount of alcohol she had downed (Kaji was the only one awake to take the blame, however), before telling them that there was nothing else they could do for her and he'd better get her home. She slept the whole way and barely moved, but even Kaji's muscular arms were becoming tired after the long walk home. It would have been far easier to sling her over his shoulder, but he didn't think that would be very comfortable for her, so he continued to cradle her in his arms.  
当他们到达急诊室时，她的咳嗽已经明显缓解，医护人员除了给她注射镇静剂以安抚这位情绪失控的年轻女子外，几乎无能为力。他们为她拍了肺部 X 光片，并责备她喝下的酒精量（尽管只有加持清醒着承担了责任），然后告诉他们，除了让她回家休息外，别无他法。她一路上都在睡，几乎没动，但即便加持强健的手臂，在漫长的归途中也渐感疲惫。本可以将她扛在肩上，但他觉得那样对她来说并不舒适，因此他继续抱着她。

He came to the door labeled "M. Katsuragi", but had to think a moment about how to get one of the two present inhabitants to come answer the door. With his hands full, knocking on the door was out of the question. He finally managed to balance on one leg, flamingo-style, with the other leg replacing his arm under her knees. Kaji rapped on the door twice and quickly reshifted his position.  
他来到标有“M. 葛城”的门前，却不得不思考片刻如何让其中一位在场的居民来应门。双手都占满了，敲门是不可能的。他最终设法单腿站立，像火烈鸟一样，用另一条腿代替手臂托住她的膝盖。加持敲了两下门，迅速调整了姿势。

Much to his dismay, it was Asuka who answered the door with a loud "KAJI-SAN!" and Shinji-kun who poked his head out shyly from his door, earphones trailing behind him.  
令他沮丧的是，开门的是明日香，她大声喊着“加持先生！”而真嗣则从自己的门后羞涩地探出头来，耳机线拖在身后。

"Be quiet," he motioned urgently, and proceeded to make his way to her room. He knew the apartment well enough. Both Asuka and Shinji followed him to the door. Kaji would have liked for a moment alone with Misato, but knew that it wouldn't happen with the two pilots watching him.  
“安静点，”他急切地示意，然后继续向她的房间走去。他对这间公寓很熟悉。明日香和真嗣都跟着他到了门口。加持本想和美里独处一会儿，但知道有两位驾驶员在旁，这是不可能的。

"Okay, I'm leaving." "好吧，我要走了。"

"Why don't you stay here tonight?" Asuka wheedled. She hurried to him and clung to his sleeve as he walked out.  
"今晚为什么不留下呢？" 明日香央求道。她急忙跑到他身边，抓住他的袖子，不让他离开。

"Because people will laugh at me if I go to the office tomorrow in this same suit," he said nonchalantly, smoothing over the worry he felt. _How much sleep will Katsuragi be able to get with_ her _around?_ Even now she was continuing her tirade.  
"因为如果我明天穿着同样的西装去办公室，人们会笑话我的，" 他若无其事地说道，掩饰着自己的担忧。有她在，葛城能睡多少觉呢？即使现在，她还在继续她的长篇大论。

"That doesn't matter! It's fine! HEY!" KAJI-SAN..." Kaji slid deftly out the door, just in time to hear Asuka lament, "...he smells of lavender..."  
“那不重要！没事的！嘿！” 加治先生……” 加治灵巧地滑出门外，正好听到明日香叹息，“……他身上有薰衣草的香味……”

He poked his head back in and was relieved to see that Shinji was still there. Directing his gaze at the pilot of Unit 01, he ordered, "Take care of Katsuragi," waved, and disappeared. Shinji nodded faintly, and Kaji closed the door behind him.  
他探头回来看了看，松了口气发现真嗣还在。他目光转向初号机驾驶员，命令道：“照顾好葛城，”挥了挥手，随即消失。真嗣微微点头，加治随后关上了门。

For him, the night was over. For Ritsuko, it had just begun.  
对他来说，夜晚已经结束。而对律子来说，一切才刚刚开始。

Dr. Ishiyama patted the familiar machine and waited patiently, not minding the late hour. She didn't see Ritsuko too much these days; the blonde doctor was always fussing over MAGI and she worked as a top specialist within the Nerv hospital. She and Misato had sat together in class, oftentimes passing notes and giggling during lectures, while Ritsuko sat up front attentively and took notes for all three of them. Once in awhile she would still see the purple-haired lady at the bedside of the Third Child. But it now was her, not the Third Child, that they was concerned for.  
石山博士轻拍着熟悉的机器，耐心等待，并不介意深夜时分。她最近很少见到赤城丽子；那位金发医生总是忙于 MAGI 系统，并在 Nerv 医院担任顶尖专家。她和美里曾在课堂上坐在一起，经常传纸条并咯咯笑，而丽子则坐在前排专心听讲，为她们三人做笔记。偶尔，她仍会在第三适格者的病床边见到那位紫发女士。但现在，他们关心的对象是她，而非第三适格者。

Ritsuko appeared just then with two vials and a clipboard in hand. "I've already run the Full Blood Count and Hematocrit Assay twice," she explained. Ritsuko had long held the suspicion that something was wrong with the blood coursing through Misato's body. The Full Blood Count was designed to determine the numbers of leukocytes (white blood cells), erythrocytes (red blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets) while the Hematocrit Assay determined the percentage of blood that consisted solely of erythrocytes.  
就在这时，赤城丽子带着两支试管和一个夹板出现了。“我已经进行了两次全血细胞计数和血细胞比容测定，”她解释道。丽子一直怀疑流经美里体内的血液有问题。全血细胞计数旨在确定白细胞、红细胞和血小板的数量，而血细胞比容测定则确定血液中仅由红细胞组成的百分比。

Dr. Ishiyama took the results from her and turned on the light. A violent storm was brewing outside, adding to the night darkness. Ritsuko took her place beside her old friend and watched as her brow furrowed.  
石山博士从她手中接过结果，打开了灯。外面正酝酿着一场猛烈的风暴，加剧了夜的黑暗。律子走到老朋友身边，看着她的眉头紧锁。

"Thanks, Namika," she said quietly. "I'm sorry it's so late."  
“谢谢你，Namika，”她轻声说道，“抱歉这么晚了。”

"No problem. I wouldn't want to wait either, after tonight. What would we do without Major Katsuragi?" She paused for a moment, moving only her eyeballs to scan the page. "FBC results tend to tell the most, but I'd like to look at the Hematocrit Assay first. 26.8% is quite low, within dangerous waters."  
“没关系。今晚之后我也不想等了。没有葛城少校我们该怎么办呢？”她停顿了一下，只转动眼珠扫视着页面，“FBC 结果往往最能说明问题，但我还是想先看看血细胞比容测定。26.8%相当低，处于危险区域。”

"Yes, since the normal woman averages 40.9% and anywhere between 34.9 to 46.9 is reasonable," Ritsuko said quietly. It all made sense. A low Hematocrit Assay reading meant that there were not enough erythrocytes in the bloodstream. Erythrocytes carried oxygen, and less red blood cells meant less oxygen. That would explain Misato's gasping for breath.  
“是的，因为正常女性平均值为 40.9%，而 34.9 至 46.9 之间都算合理，”律子轻声说道。这一切都说得通了。低血细胞比容读数意味着血液中红细胞不足。红细胞携带氧气，红细胞减少意味着氧气减少。这解释了美里为何会气喘吁吁。

"Very good," Namika acknowledged with a smile. "You remember a lot from those few days you worked in the medical field."  
“很好，”奈美香微笑着表示认可，“你还记得不少在医疗领域工作的那几天学到的知识。”

Ritsuko shrugged and didn't tell the other doctor that nearly a minute had passed before she realized that FBC was simply an abbreviation for Full Blood Count. Namika placed the Hematocrit Assay results to the side, revealing the FBC report.  
律子耸了耸肩，没有告诉另一位医生，她几乎花了一分钟才意识到 FBC 只是全血细胞计数的缩写。奈美香将血细胞比容结果放到一边，露出了 FBC 报告。

The report consisted of two halves which were nearly identical, save for some miniscule fluctuation of numbers. The doctor hardly blinked as she studied it, her face darkening. "High numbers of leukocytes and too few erythrocytes and platelets. Alarmingly few, in fact."  
报告由两部分组成，几乎完全相同，除了一些微小的数字波动。医生仔细研究着报告，几乎没有眨眼，脸色逐渐阴沉。“白细胞数量高，红细胞和血小板数量过少。实际上，少得令人担忧。”

Ritsuko only nodded. Namika placed that sheet aside as well, divulging the last.  
律子只是点了点头。美香子也将那张纸放在一旁，露出了最后一张。

This sheet was handwritten on a simple lined page bearing the NERV icon. Namika didn't recognize her handwriting, but she knew the note-taking style that the blonde doctor used.  
这张纸是手写在带有 NERV 标志的简单横线纸上的。美香子不认得自己的笔迹，但她熟悉那位金发医生的笔记风格。

"I recorded every symptom I noticed, along with the date." Ritsuko shrugged. It was one of the things they'd been required to do in training; nowadays, it was just an old habit that she rarely exercised.  
“我记录了每一个注意到的症状，以及日期。” 赤木律子耸耸肩。这是他们在训练中被要求做的事情之一；如今，这只是她很少实践的一个旧习惯。

"The first one you noticed was nearly a week ago," Namika commented as she picked out the major parts, "and they all follow in a rapid sequence. May 10 – extreme fatigue, excessive bruising on hips and thighs, very typical — May 14, small cut from chair leg continues to bleed despite better spirits – tonight, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing..." She laid down the paper.  
“你注意到的第一个症状是在大约一周前，” 南香评论道，她挑出了重点部分，“然后它们迅速接连出现。5 月 10 日——极度疲劳，臀部和大腿出现过多瘀伤，非常典型——5 月 14 日，椅子腿上的小伤口持续出血，尽管精神有所好转——今晚，行走困难，呼吸困难……” 她放下了纸张。

Ritsuko was nodding along almost rhythmically, having read and reread the paper thousands of times in a futile attempt to convince herself that the truth was not the truth. Her eyes were sad and not focused on anything in particular.  
赤木律子几乎是有节奏地点着头，她已经无数次地阅读和重读这张纸，徒劳地试图说服自己真相并非真相。她的眼神悲伤，没有特别聚焦在任何东西上。

"I'm really glad you ran those tests when you did," Namika said quietly, placing her hand on the woman's shoulder. "The first thing a severe bruise like that calls for is a blood test, and I'm not surprised about the bleeding. A severe lack of platelets will do that to you."  
"我很高兴你当时就做了那些检查，" 奈美香轻声说道，把手放在女子的肩上。"像那样严重的淤伤首先需要验血，出血的情况我并不惊讶。严重的血小板缺乏会导致这种结果。"

The blonde only nodded. 金发女子只是点了点头。

Namika read the last page again. "Nothing happened between May 10 and May 14?"  
奈美香再次阅读了最后一页。"5 月 10 日到 5 月 14 日之间什么都没发生吗？"

"I didn't see her. I ordered her to bed rest. She didn't come to work, so I assume she complied, although I can't be sure of that."  
"我没看到她。我让她卧床休息。她没来上班，所以我猜她照做了，尽管我不敢完全肯定。"

Namika made a soft sound of understanding and hesitated a little. "Given the symptoms you've described, Ritsuko, and these test results, I'm sure only a few more tests will have to be run to determine the exact form of the disease."  
娜美卡发出一声理解的轻叹，稍稍犹豫了一下。“根据你描述的症状，律子，以及这些检测结果，我相信只需再做几项测试就能确定疾病的具体形式。”

Her shoulders sagged and her head drooped. Namika enveloped her friend in a bear hug. "You've done what you can, Ritsuko. If you hadn't done this when you did, her chances might be between slim and none."  
她的肩膀下垂，头也低了下来。娜美卡紧紧地拥抱着她的朋友。“你已经尽力了，律子。如果不是你及时采取行动，她的生存几率可能就微乎其微了。”

"I kept hoping it wasn't true, damn it," the blonde muttered.  
"我一直希望这不是真的，该死，"金发女子喃喃自语。

Namika glanced over her shoulder at the clock. It was nearly two-thirty, and they would both be due for duty in less than five hours. "Rit-chan, you need your sleep," she insisted gently, using her nickname. Ritsuko pulled back and made a face.  
美香回头看了一眼时钟。快两点半了，她们俩再过不到五小时就要值班了。"律子，你需要睡觉，"她温柔地坚持着，用她的昵称称呼她。律子退后一步，做了个鬼脸。

"You too, _Miki_." "你也是，美纪。"

It was Namika's turn to blush. "Ritsuko," she called suddenly, before the doctor had gone out the door, "don't speak to Misato about this yet. Make sure that she gets enough rest and doesn't overstrain herself for now. I'll tell you when I have the final results."  
轮到 Namika 脸红了。“Ritsuko，”她突然喊道，在医生出门前，“先别和 Misato 谈这件事。确保她有足够的休息，不要让她现在过度劳累。我会在有最终结果时告诉你的。”

"I will." "我会的。"

Ritsuko unfolded her umbrella and walked into the heart of the storm. The wind tore it out of her hands and sent it hurtling out of sight. She paused for a moment, angrily trying to decide whether or not to go after it, and gave up. Within a few minutes she, too, had disappeared into the darkness of the night.  
Ritsuko 展开她的伞，走进了暴风雨的中心。风将伞从她手中夺走，让它消失在视线之外。她停顿了一下，愤怒地试图决定是否去追回它，最终放弃了。几分钟后，她也消失在夜的黑暗中。

_"Baka! You burned it! It's all hard and black now!"  
“笨蛋！你把它烧焦了！现在全都是硬邦邦的黑色了！”_

"S-sorry..." "对-对不起..."

"_The Great Shinji Ikari can't even make toast properly! Jeez!"_  
"伟大的碇真嗣连吐司都做不好！天哪！"

"_Keep your voice down,_ please _Asuka... you'll wake Misato up."_  
"请小声点，明日香...你会吵醒美里。"

"_Who gives a damn about her? SHE'S the one who was out with Kaji-san all night!"_  
“谁在乎她啊？和加持先生整晚在一起的可是她！”

Misato smiled groggily, hearing her name creep into the conversation. She stretched and turned around so that her feet were resting on the floor. In the process she hit her leg on the metal frame, and the cut began to bleed again.  
听到自己的名字被提及，美里昏昏沉沉地笑了。她伸了个懒腰，转过身让脚落在地板上。过程中她的腿撞到了金属框架，伤口又开始流血。

She stood on one leg, holding on to the edge of her desk for stability, trying to remember the events of last night.  
她单脚站立，抓住桌边保持平衡，努力回忆昨晚发生的事情。

_Kaji! He must've carried me home.  
加持先生！他一定是把我背回家的。_

Misato made her way slowly into the kitchen, where Shinji was rather skillfully ducking the pieces of blackened crust flying his way.  
美里缓缓走进厨房，只见真嗣相当熟练地躲避着向他飞来的焦黑碎屑。

"Good morning, Misato-san," Shinji whispered.  
“早上好，美里小姐。”真嗣轻声说道。

"Morning." She ate her slices without complaint. Someone knocked on the door and Shinji hurried to get it. A moment later Toji and Kensuke poked their heads into the kitchen.  
“早上好。”她毫无怨言地吃着吐司。这时有人敲门，真嗣急忙去开门。不一会儿，剑介和渡志探头探脑地进了厨房。

"Can't we have some peace around here?" Asuka demanded. "First Misato getting drunk, then Shinji burning the toast, then you idiots—"  
“我们就不能有点安宁吗？”明日香质问道，“先是美里喝得烂醉，然后是真嗣把吐司烤焦，再然后是你们这两个笨蛋——”

Kensuke grabbed Shinji's sleeve and Toji his bag, neither minding that he hadn't yet gotten to eat a bite of breakfast, and dragged him out the door. "See you later, Misato-san!"  
剑介抓住真嗣的袖子，渡志则拽着他的书包，两人都不介意他还没吃上一口早餐，就这样把他拖出了门。“回头见，美里小姐！”

"Such idiots." Asuka grumbled, as Pen-pen _wark_ed and went back to his breakfast. Then her gaze settled on Misato's legs. "What happened there?"  
"真是群蠢货。" 明日香咕哝着，企鹅潘-潘叫了一声，又回去吃它的早餐了。随后，她的目光落在了美里腿上。"那里怎么了？"

"I scraped my knee. Damn thing won't stop bleeding."  
"我膝盖擦伤了。该死，血一直止不住。"

Had Misato been watching Asuka's face at that moment, she would have noticed the girl doing some quick thinking. The redhead was quick to put two and two together, remembering the bruises. A stunned expression glazed her features.  
如果美里当时留意了明日香的脸色，她就会注意到女孩正在迅速思考。红发少女很快将两件事联系起来，想起了那些淤青。她脸上露出了震惊的表情。

"Don't you have to go to school? I recall Shinji mentioning that you have a literature test today."  
"你今天不是要去学校吗？我记得真嗣提到过你今天有个文学考试。"

Asuka blinked to regain her composure. "Yeah, yeah, I don't need _you_ to remind me," she muttered, grabbing her bag and leaving her unfinished toast on the table. The door slammed behind her; outside, she took off at a run.  
明日香眨了眨眼，恢复镇定。“是啊，是啊，我不需要你提醒，”她嘟囔着，抓起书包，把未吃完的吐司留在桌上，摔门而去；到了外面，她便开始奔跑。

Sorhyu Asuka Langley was no doctor, but she'd taken enough biology and anatomy classes to give her a general gist of what was going on. She remembered reading a German article about a sixteen-year-old who had exhibited the same symptoms. The girl had struggled for a little less than a year before succumbing. _Damn Shinji for losing the dictionary_, she thought angrily. She knew the name of the malady in German, but had no idea what it translated to in Japanese.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷并非医生，但她上过足够的生物学和解剖学课程，对正在发生的事情有个大致的了解。她记得读过一篇关于一个十六岁女孩表现出相同症状的德文文章。那个女孩挣扎了不到一年就去世了。该死的真嗣，把字典弄丢了，她气愤地想。她知道这种疾病的德文名称，但不知道它在日文中是什么意思。

"Asuka!" Hikari came up behind her with a bubbly smile. "Are you ready for the literature test?"  
"明日香！" 光里带着活泼的笑容从她身后走来，"你准备好文学考试了吗？"

"Of course I am." "当然准备好了。"

Ritsuko had hardly slept all night, but Namika had. She knew there were limits to the amount of strain the human body could take, and she didn't want to risk making any testing errors. As of now, no pilots were injured and she had finished bandaging the hand of the worker who'd cut himself. The time was 10:55 AM. Ritsuko was busy in the Geofront.  
律子几乎整夜未眠，但美香却睡得很好。她知道人体承受压力的极限，不想冒险造成任何测试错误。截至目前，没有飞行员受伤，她已经为那位割伤手的工人包扎完毕。时间是上午 10 点 55 分。律子正忙于地底都市。

She found her cell phone and called Misato, telling her that the doctors wanted some blood work done. The Major resisted initially, explaining how her presence was needed at the Geofront, but eventually gave in. Namika knew she was confused—Ritsuko hadn't told her anything, and the name of Dr. Ishiyama had not initially been involved.  
她找到手机，拨通了美里，告诉她医生需要做一些血液检查。美里起初抗拒，解释说她需要在 Geofront 那里，但最终还是妥协了。娜美卡知道她很困惑——律子什么都没告诉她，而且石山博士的名字一开始也没有被提及。

Twenty minutes later Misato arrived at her office, looking haggard and worn. Namika greeted her and asked her to change into a paper rope while she prepared the equipment.  
二十分钟后，美里到达办公室，看起来疲惫不堪。娜美卡迎接她，并让她换上纸袍，同时准备设备。

"What equipment?" Misato asked. "Isn't it just a needle to draw some blood?"  
“什么设备？”美里问，“不就是用针抽点血吗？”

Namika nodded, but added, "It's a bit more complicated, and it might take awhile, so I'd like to give you some general anesthesia. You'll be asleep for about two hours and you won't feel anything at all. Hopefully we'll have the results by the time you wake up." She turned around to give the Major some privacy while she changed.  
娜美卡点点头，但又补充道：“这有点复杂，可能需要一段时间，所以我希望给你一些全身麻醉。你会睡上大约两个小时，完全不会感到任何不适。希望你醒来时我们已经有结果了。”她转过身去，给真嗣一些隐私，同时她自己也在更换衣物。

"Has the Commander been notified of this?" Misato demanded. The paper robe was too big. She wound it around herself twice.  
“指挥官已经知道这件事了吗？”美里质问道。那件纸质长袍太大了，她将其裹在身上绕了两圈。

"Yes." "是的。"

"All right then." Misato lay down, and the doctor began attaching nodules to her skin. Each was connected to a machine by a long, slender wire, and Namika explained that they were to monitor her major bodily functions. Nothing to worry about.  
“好吧。”美里躺下，医生开始在她皮肤上贴上节点。每个节点都通过一根细长的电线连接到一台机器上，娜美卡解释说这些是用来监测她的主要身体功能的。没什么好担心的。

"Miki," Misato pressed, clearly not satisfied, "Ritsuko never went to all this trouble for a simple blood sample, and she took two from me last week. What's going on?"  
"美里," 美里追问道，显然并不满意，"律子博士从未为了一个简单的血样费这么多周折，上周她还从我这里抽了两管血。到底怎么回事？"

Namika paused, then positioned the last nodule. "There are some tests that couldn't be run with the samples she drew," she explained smoothly. "For that reason, we need to take a bone marrow sample by drawing it out of your hipbone. You'll probably be sore for a week or so afterwards."  
娜美卡停顿了一下，然后放置好最后一个节点。"有些测试无法用她抽取的样本进行，"她流畅地解释道，"因此，我们需要通过从你的髋骨中抽取骨髓样本。之后你可能会酸痛一周左右。"

"I see," Misato said gravely. But Namika sensed that she didn't.  
"我明白了，"美里严肃地说道。但娜美卡感觉到她其实并不明白。

She held up the sterilized needle between her thumb and index finger. "Relax, Misato. Don't look down. This thing will be delivering the anesthesia into your veins and you'll be out in a few seconds." She inserted the needle, relieved that there was an obvious bluish vein on the inside of her elbow.  
她用拇指和食指夹起消毒过的针头。“放松，美里。别往下看。这东西会给你静脉注射麻醉剂，几秒钟你就失去知觉了。”她插入针头，庆幸在她的肘内侧有一条明显的蓝色静脉。

"It can't be that fast," Misato tried to say. But her words slurred, the ceiling tiles seemed to rearrange themselves, and before she knew it, she was out.  
“不可能这么快吧，”美里试图说。但她的声音变得含糊，天花板瓷砖似乎在重新排列，还没等她反应过来，她就已经失去了意识。

Namika was skilled, and this was a process she had performed hundreds of times. She unwrapped the sterilized needle and within minutes had it filled with the dark red marrow of Misato's hipbone, proceeding alone. The purple-haired woman did not stir. She stored the marrow away and taped some gauze over the puncture for the time being. The doctor stepped back and glanced at the multitude of machines that surrounded them. All of Misato's organs were functioning normally. Namika let out a breath of relief and began removing all the nodules.  
纳米卡技术娴熟，这个过程她已经进行了数百次。她解开消毒针头的包装，几分钟内就装满了美里髋骨的深红色骨髓，独自进行。紫发的女子没有动弹。她将骨髓储存好，暂时用胶带固定了一些纱布在穿刺处。医生退后一步，扫视着围绕她们的众多机器。美里的所有器官功能都正常。纳米卡松了一口气，开始移除所有的结节。

With the help of an assistant, she moved the unconscious young woman into a wheelchair and wheeled her to a smaller room, then replaced her onto the bed. She would sleep here until the anesthesia wore off. A small camera, hung in the top corner of the room, focused on the patient and delivered live images to Namika's laboratory. The familiar beeping system would inform her when Misato was awake.  
在助手的帮助下，她将失去意识的年轻女子移到轮椅上，推着她进入一间较小的房间，然后将她安置在床上。她将在这里睡到麻醉效果消退。房间角落上方悬挂的小型摄像头聚焦在病人身上，将实时图像传输到 Namika 的实验室。熟悉的哔哔声系统会在 Misato 醒来时通知她。

"B-type Harmonics test, all green."  
“B 型谐波测试，全部绿灯。”

"Clear all course adjusting values."  
“清除所有航线调整值。”

"Sempai, you look exhausted," Maya remarked. "Is something wrong?"  
"前辈，你看起来很疲惫，"真希波说。"有什么不对劲吗？"

"Not really." Ritsuko sat down, glancing at her watch. It was 11:25—thirty minutes since Namika had called Misato away. Fortunately she had taken care of explaining the issue with Gendo, and somehow, surprisingly, he had given in. Ritsuko supposed he knew that a good Major would be exceedingly hard to replace, should he lose her, but Gendo was a man who didn't care about personal concerns—sickness included—as long as all went well at Nerv. Hell, she could think of up numerous instances where he had ordered her to duty despite her illness. So why was he being so lenient towards Misato? She wondered if Namika had told him of the seriousness of her illness.  
"没什么。"律子坐下来，瞥了一眼手表。现在是 11 点 25 分——自美里接到波美的电话离开已经过去了三十分钟。幸运的是，她已经处理了关于源堂的问题，而且出乎意料地，他让步了。律子猜想他知道，如果失去了她，要找到一个称职的大校将会非常困难，但源堂是一个不在乎个人事务——包括疾病——只要一切顺利在 NERV 中的人。见鬼，她能想到无数次他命令她带病工作的例子。那么为什么他对美里如此宽容呢？她想知道波美是否告诉了他她病情的严重性。

The blonde knew how fast her friend worked and figured that the operation had to be over by now, but when they would have the results, she didn't know. She noticed that Maya was staring at her, the keyboard abandoned. Ritsuko slid it towards her and finished the program for her, typing with one hand. Maya snapped to attention and flushed. "I'm sorry, Sempai..."  
金发女子知道她的朋友工作效率有多快，估计手术现在已经结束了，但她不知道他们何时会有结果。她注意到真希波正盯着她看，键盘被遗弃在一旁。律子将键盘滑向她，用一只手为她完成了程序。真希波回过神来，脸红了。"对不起，前辈..."

"Don't worry about it." "别担心。"

_It's not for Maya to know what's going on_, Ritsuko reminded herself, _at least not yet_. She was frustrated that there was no one in the vicinity whom she could speak to about her worries.  
至少现在还不需要让真希知道发生了什么，律子提醒自己。她感到沮丧，因为附近没有人可以倾诉她的担忧。

On another floor, Namika bent over the microscope again, ignoring the fatigued complaints of her neck muscles, and adjusted the eyepiece. Small blotches of blue became visible, scattered across a yellow structure of irregular shape. She moved the slide slightly, focusing on another cell. The second cell was the same earthen color as the first, but had a much different shape, and was much smaller. Neither was simply round or square. The slide was covered with these oddly shaped white blood cells; both B and T cells were present. Namika turned back to the textbook, spread open beside the microscope, and turned a page.  
在另一层楼，奈美香再次俯身于显微镜前，无视颈部肌肉的疲惫抱怨，调整了目镜。微小的蓝色斑点变得可见，散布在一个形状不规则的黄色结构上。她轻轻移动载玻片，聚焦于另一个细胞。第二个细胞与第一个细胞一样呈土色，但形状大不相同，且小得多。它们既非简单的圆形也非方形。载玻片上覆盖着这些形状奇特的白细胞；B 细胞和 T 细胞都有。奈美香转回旁边的教科书，翻开一页。

_ALL is caused by abnormal growth and development of early nongranular white blood cells, or lymphocytes.  
ALL 是由早期非颗粒性白血球，即淋巴细胞的异常生长和发展引起的。_

But shape and size weren't enough to convince the doctor that Misato really had ALL, and she pulled out a chart from the nearest drawer and taped it to the wall. This comprised of diagrams and information on certain antibodies. Each antibody had a small section of the chart dedicated to itself, and every piece of information relating to it was written in one color. There were no repeats.  
但仅凭形状和大小不足以让医生确信美里真的患有 ALL，她从最近的抽屉里拿出一张图表，贴在墙上。这张图表包含了关于某些抗体的图解和信息。每个抗体在图表上都有一小部分专属区域，与之相关的每条信息都用一种颜色书写。没有重复。

Namika pulled out another slide and slid it into a larger machine, which immediately whirred to life. She reached for her computer screen and pressed the "on" button. An expanded image of the slide's contents flashed onto her screen. It showed one cell at a time, magnified to the size of her hand. The cell itself remained the same dingy yellow, but small objects of all shapes and colors were attached to it at certain places.  
纳米卡又取出另一张载玻片，插入一个更大的机器中，机器立刻嗡嗡作响。她伸手去按电脑屏幕的“开”按钮。载玻片内容的放大图像瞬间闪现在她的屏幕上。图像一次显示一个细胞，放大到手掌大小。细胞本身仍然是暗淡的黄色，但在某些位置附着着各种形状和颜色的小物体。

Those were the antibodies.  
那些是抗体。

Namika had run an immunocytochemistry test as soon as the sample had been taken from Misato's hipbone. The advantage of this test was that instead of spouting out numbers of cells, it generated a color picture, from which a direct diagnosis could be made. Each type of antibody was dyed a different color and then allowed to attach to the binding sites of bone marrow cells. Some did and some didn't, depending on the bone marrow cell (which exhibited features of the disease it carried in its binding sites, thus allowing certain antibodies and not others to bind). Since each type of diseased bone marrow cell permitted different antibodies to attach, one could match up the attached antibodies with the appropriate disease.  
从美里的大腿骨取样后，纳米卡立即进行了免疫细胞化学检测。这项检测的优势在于，它不是输出细胞数量的数据，而是生成一张彩色图片，可以直接从中做出诊断。每种抗体都被染成不同的颜色，然后允许它们附着在骨髓细胞的结合位点上。有些抗体能够附着，有些则不能，这取决于骨髓细胞（其结合位点展示了所携带疾病的特征，从而允许某些抗体而不允许其他抗体附着）。由于每种类型的病变骨髓细胞允许不同抗体附着，因此可以将附着的抗体与相应的疾病匹配起来。

Besides, it was easier to look at a color picture than black and white pages of data.  
此外，看彩色图片比看黑白数据页要容易得多。

Namika pulled up a chair and a clipboard and began taking notes, glancing towards the chart every now and then for reference. Hours later she was still not finished when the familiar beeping went off. Namika got up and shut off the noise, then went to visit Misato.  
纳美卡拉过一把椅子和一个剪贴板，开始做笔记，时不时瞥向图表以供参考。几个小时过去了，她仍未完成，这时熟悉的哔哔声响起。纳美卡起身关闭了噪音，然后去探望美里。

She was still groggy and her eyes were barely open when Namika plunked down in a chair beside her bed. "How're you feeling?"  
当纳美卡扑通一声坐在她床边的椅子上时，她仍然昏昏沉沉，眼睛几乎睁不开。“感觉怎么样？”

"Tired." “累。”

Namika reached for the blanket that had been partially kicked off and draped it back over Misato's bruised body. "You need to sleep, Misato. Don't worry about anything."  
娜美卡伸手去拿被部分踢开的毯子，重新盖在美里受伤的身体上。“你需要睡觉，美里。别担心任何事。”

"What's... wrong with me?"  
“我……怎么了？”

Her words were slurred as she drifted off into a peaceful sleep.  
她的话语含糊不清，渐渐沉入平静的梦乡。

Namika was grateful that she didn't have to answer the question. She lingered only a few moments later to make sure that Misato was safely asleep, then returned to her lab. Another hour passed before she was interrupted by someone knocking on the door. She opened the door and almost walked into Ritsuko.  
美香庆幸自己不必回答那个问题。她稍作停留，确保美里已安然入睡，随后返回实验室。又过了一个小时，她被一阵敲门声打断。她打开门，差点撞上律子。

"Is it?" the blonde asked without preamble.  
“是吗？”金发女子开门见山地问道。

Without hesitation, Namika nodded.  
美香毫不犹豫地点了点头。

_Sore_ was an understatement, Misato thought, as she propped herself up on her elbows. _Miki had better have the results by now. How long have I slept?_  
酸痛都算轻描淡写了，美里心想，她用胳膊肘撑起自己。三木最好现在已经有结果了。我睡了多久？

Misato studied her surroundings. The room was tiny—her bed occupied precisely half of it, and she could touch the opposite wall with her hand from were she lay. The bed, too, was simple, with a clean white pillow and several sheets. All the walls were stark white.  
美里打量着四周。房间很小——她的床占据了整整一半，她躺着就能用手触到对面的墙。床也很简朴，只有一个干净的白色枕头和几张床单。四面墙都是纯白色的。

The doorknob clicked, and she turned to see Namika step in. Ritsuko followed a step behind. Misato smiled feebly. "So, what is it?"  
门把手咔嗒一声，她转头看见美香走了进来。律子紧随其后。美里无力地笑了笑。"那么，是什么情况？"

"Do you want something to drink?" Ritsuko asked. "You must be thirsty."  
"你想喝点什么吗？" 律子问道。"你一定渴了吧。"

Misato sensed the evasiveness in her voice, and it annoyed her. "No, I don't. Hurry up—you know Gendo won't like us being away for so long."  
美里察觉到她语气中的回避，这让她感到恼火。"不，我不渴。快点——你知道源堂不会喜欢我们离开这么久的。"

Ritsuko opened her mouth to speak, but it was Namika who stepped forward, clipboard in hand. Her distinctly Japanese features were set in a determined expression. Misato felt a twinge of apprehension.  
律子张嘴想要说话，但上前的是手持写字板的奈美香。她那明显的日本面孔上带着坚定的表情。美里感到一阵不安。

"Misato, you have Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia."  
"美里，你患有急性淋巴细胞白血病。"

Author's Note: This is a story that I've been writing in my head for a long, long time, and it's a completely different approach from anything I've tried before. Any mistakes in the biology/symptoms are completely mine.  
作者的话：这是一个我脑海中酝酿已久的故事，与我之前尝试过的任何题材都截然不同。生物学/症状方面的任何错误均由我个人负责。

Originally I had planned to post all chapters of this fic at once, but now I really have no idea when it will actually be finished. Here's the first chapter; I hope you like it and I would appreciate any reviews you leave. Thanks!  
原本我计划一次性发布所有章节，但现在我真的不确定何时能完成。这是第一章；希望你喜欢，也非常感谢你留下的任何评论。谢谢！

### Chapter 2: adjusting i  
第二章：适应中  

Misato blinked. 美里眨了眨眼。

"I what?" “我什么？”

"You have Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia," Ritsuko enunciated, not quite sure exactly how much clearer she could make it. She glanced to her colleague for support. Namika hadn't moved. Her eyes were focused intently on Misato's face.  
"你患有急性淋巴细胞白血病，" 赤木律子清晰地发音，不太确定自己还能说得再清楚多少。她瞥向同事寻求支持。南香没有动，她的眼睛专注地凝视着美里。

_They're not kidding_, Misato thought.  
他们不是在开玩笑，美里心想。

"Okay," she said, mustering the strength to speak calmly, "what do I do now?"  
"好吧，" 她说，努力聚集力量保持平静，"我现在该怎么做？"

The doctor in Namika took over. "We start you on chemotherapy immediately, preferably by the end of this week," she said, "and we put you on a strict regimen of what you can eat and what you can't. You'll still need to limit what you do for the next two weeks, don't forget. I also want to start interferon therapy, which will slow the reproduction of leukemic cells. If all else fails, we'll try a bone marrow transplant."  
南美佳医生接手了。“我们立即开始给你进行化疗，最好在这周末之前，”她说，“我们会为你制定严格的饮食规定，哪些能吃哪些不能。接下来的两周内你仍需限制活动，别忘了。我还想开始干扰素治疗，这将减缓白血病细胞的增殖。如果一切方法都失败，我们会尝试骨髓移植。”

Misato looked so stunned that Ritsuko reached out and put a hand on her shoulder. "Remember that you're in good hands, Misato. Namika's not going to let anything happen to you. She's not going to let you die."  
美里看起来震惊不已，律子伸出手放在她的肩膀上。“记住，美里，你正被妥善照顾着。南美佳不会让你有事的。她不会让你死去。”

The Major smiled then. "Yeah, _Miki,_ who tripped over the power cord and broke all of Professor Nakamura's test tubes in the dark."  
少校那时笑了。“是啊，美纪，那个在黑暗中绊到电源线，打碎了中村教授所有试管的人。”

Namika blushed, remembering the scolding she had earned herself that unfortunate day.  
那美卡脸红了，回想起那个不幸的日子里自己挨的那顿训斥。

"I'll find you a pair of crutches for the next few days," she said, changing the topic hastily. I'll arrange with Gendo to work out a compromise so that you can still work at NERV."  
"接下来几天我会给你找副拐杖，"她急忙换了个话题说，"我会和源渡商量出一个折中方案，让你还能在 NERV 工作。"

"Why is it that he gives into everything you ask for?" Ritsuko muttered.  
"为什么他对你提出的要求总是让步呢？" 律子低声嘀咕道。

Namika shrugged. "He likes his employees alive. Misato, I expect you want to speak with Commander Ikari—I'll see you back here in about an hour?"  
娜美卡耸了耸肩。“他喜欢他的员工活着。美里，我想你要和碇司令谈话——大约一小时后我们在这里见？”

"Yes." "是的。"

Misato hardly noticed where she was going as she strode out of the hospital, scattering patients and staff alike. The twin doors slid open just in time; had they done so a moment later, she would have slammed into them. She marched back toward the Geofront and came a stop just before the last door. Fear and anger mingled inside her troubled mind, as she paused with one hand on the doorknob. Her hips throbbed with pain.  
美里几乎没注意到自己走到了哪里，她大步走出医院，病人和工作人员都被她冲散了。双层门恰好在她到达时滑开；如果再晚一秒，她就会撞上去。她快步返回地底都市，在最后一扇门前停下。恐惧和愤怒在她纷乱的脑海中交织，她一手握住门把手，停了下来。她的臀部隐隐作痛。

_Miki's made a mistake. I feel perfectly fine_.  
米基搞错了。我感觉好得很。

But even as she mulled over the furious thoughts, the coughing began. Misato hung onto the doorknob with one hand and clamped the other over her mouth. _Where are those crutches Miki promised?_ When the spasms finally subsided, she remained bent over, clinging to the door for balance. Misato felt a strange creeping sensation down her spine. Someone was watching her.  
但即便她心中怒火中烧，咳嗽却开始了。Misato 一手抓着门把手，另一只手紧紧捂住嘴。Miki 承诺的拐杖在哪里？当痉挛终于平息时，她依旧弯着腰，紧抓着门以保持平衡。Misato 感到脊背一阵莫名的寒意。有人在盯着她。

She whirled around to find Rei, standing quietly a short distance away. Her expressionless face betrayed nothing, but Misato easily guessed her mission from the crutches she held.  
她猛地转身，发现 Rei 静静地站在不远处。她那毫无表情的脸庞没有透露任何信息，但 Misato 从她手中的拐杖轻易猜出了她的任务。

"Mi—Dr. Ishiyama asked you to bring those, Rei?"  
“Mi—石山博士让你带来的，Rei？”

"Yes." She held them out. Misato took them from her hands.  
"是的。" 她将它们递出。美里从她手中接过。

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

She nodded, just a simple gesture of acceptance. Misato didn't notice, however; she was busy adjusting the crutches to fit her height. Rei watched quietly, as she had not yet been given permission to leave. The Major leaned against the door, her knuckles already white from gripping the wooden handles.  
她点点头，只是一个简单的接受姿态。然而美里并未注意到；她正忙着调整拐杖以适应自己的身高。丽静静地看着，因为她还未被允许离开。少校倚靠在门边，她的指节因紧握木制把手而变得苍白。

"Surely all hell will break loose after I tell Asuka and Shinji..."  
“一旦我告诉明日香和真嗣……肯定天下大乱。”

Rei contemplated this comment. Unlike what most people who knew her might expect, she liked Misato. The Major had never treated her like an object, nor harbored feelings of loathing towards her. She simply didn't know very much about the First, and Rei liked it that way.  
绫波思考着这句话。与大多数认识她的人可能预期的不同，她喜欢美里少校。少校从未将她视为物品，也没有对她怀有厌恶之情。她对绫波一无所知，而绫波喜欢这样。

Once, in the earlier days of Nerv, before Shinji and Asuka had come, Rei had been roughly ushered into the changing rooms for an urgent sync test. She jumped into her plug suit and hurried out, wondering about the persistent clanking sound that followed her. The young Rei had stood facing Dr. Akagi, with The Commander facing her left side. She chanced a glance at him and saw that his lips had formed an unpleasant line. Had she displeased him, somehow?  
有一次，在 NERV 早期，真嗣和明日香到来之前，绫波被匆忙带进更衣室进行紧急同步测试。她迅速穿上插入栓服，急忙出去，对一直跟随她的叮当声感到疑惑。年轻的绫波站在赤木博士面前，指挥官则站在她的左侧。她偷偷瞥了他一眼，发现他的嘴唇形成了一条不悦的线条。难道她无意中惹恼了他？

"Rei," Dr. Akagi had gestured, rather frostily, "your plug suit."  
"丽," 赤城博士冷冷地示意道, "你的插入栓服。"

To her dismay, the girl realized that in her rush, she had failed to zip up her suit properly. The zipper was not pulled up all the way and caused the metal-lined sides to gnash against each other. Rei had reached behind her to fix the mistake—Dr. Akagi was in a rush—but the zipper got caught in her hair, and she could not see it since it was in the back—  
令她沮丧的是，女孩意识到自己在匆忙中未能将衣服拉链拉好。拉链没有完全拉上，导致金属衬里的两侧相互摩擦。丽伸手到背后试图纠正错误——赤城博士很着急——但拉链卡在了她的头发里，而她又看不见背后——

"Let me help you with that." Misato had stepped forward smartly and freed the zipper. She zipped it up and, away from Ritsuko and Gendo's glances, patted Rei gently on the back. Rei had barely nodded and hurried away. It was not her place to stay, after all.  
"让我帮你。" 美里迅速上前解开了拉链。她将其拉好，并避开律子和源堂的目光，轻轻拍了拍丽的后背。丽只是微微点头，匆匆离开。毕竟，她没有理由留下来。

Hastily, Rei drew herself out of one of the few memories she treasured.  
急忙间，丽从她珍视的少数记忆中抽身而出。

She had already heard the diagnosis from Dr. Akagi and Dr. Ishiyama earlier, but did not know exactly what it meant. Rei made a mental note to look it up, perhaps the next time her class was shuffled to the school library. However, there were things to take care of here, and Rei made a decision.  
她已经从赤木博士和石山博士那里听到了诊断结果，但并不完全明白这意味着什么。丽在心里记下要查一查，也许下次班级轮到去学校图书馆时可以看看。然而，这里还有事情要处理，丽做出了一个决定。

"Major Katsuragi?" Her voice was soft and delicate, and for a moment she suspected the Major had not heard. When Misato slowly looked up at her, Rei suddenly reconsidered, and finally decided to stay with her initial choice. "I will tell Pilot Ikari and Pilot Sorhyu."  
“葛城少校？”她的声音轻柔细腻，一时间她怀疑少校是否听见了。当美里缓缓抬头看向她时，丽突然重新考虑，最终还是决定坚持最初的选项。“我会告诉碇司令和惣流驾驶员。”

_Have I gone too far? Will Major Katsuragi let me?  
我是否走得太远了？葛城美里少校会允许我吗？_

To her relief, Misato smiled gratefully. "I would appreciate that, Rei." She repositioned the crutches and gingerly made her way off towards her place behind Makoto's chair. "Thank you."  
令她宽慰的是，美里感激地笑了。“我很感激，绫波。”她重新调整了拐杖，小心翼翼地走向自己的位置，在真嗣的椅子后面。“谢谢你。”

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

She took the train for a short distance, and walked a bit afterwards to reach the building containing the Katsuragi apartment. While she knew that The Commander probably wouldn't mind her actions—he never cared what went on in Misato's apartment, as long as all three pilots could still pilot—Rei could not shake off the feeling of uneasiness. She was a bit concerned; after all, this was the first time she had extended such an offer, much less carried it out. But Misato had looked so thankful that the First Child almost smiled.  
她乘坐了一段短途火车，随后步行了一会儿才到达那栋包含葛城公寓的大楼。虽然她知道指挥官大概不会介意她的行为——他从不关心美里公寓里发生的事，只要三位驾驶员还能驾驶——但绫波仍无法摆脱不安的感觉。她有些担心；毕竟，这是她第一次提出这样的邀请，更不用说付诸行动了。但美里看起来如此感激，以至于第一适格者几乎要微笑了。

She rang the doorbell. 她按响了门铃。

"Can you get it, Asuka?"  
“你能去开门吗，明日香？”

"Get it yourself!" "自己拿！"

"I'm in the bathroom!" "我在洗手间！"

"THEN HURRY UP!" "那就快点！"

Rei waited patiently for Shinji to come to the door.  
丽耐心地等待真嗣来到门口。

"Oh, Ayanami." He quickly stepped aside. "Come on in. Sorry... I was in the bathroom."  
“哦，绫波。”他迅速让开。“进来吧。抱歉……我刚才在洗手间。”

"I heard," she replied flatly. Shinji blushed.  
“我听到了，”她平淡地回答。真嗣脸红了。

Asuka marched out a moment later, dressed in a rather revealing blue dress that clashed horribly with her hair. "Where's my dinner, Third Child?"  
不一会儿，明日香大步走了出来，身着一件颇为暴露的蓝色连衣裙，与她的发色形成了可怕的对比。“我的晚餐呢，第三适格者？”

"Erm... I... haven't made it... yet..."  
“呃……我……还没做……”

"BAKA! I told you that I was going shopping with Hikari at six! Now I'll have to call her and cancel! And what is Wondergirl doing here?"  
“笨蛋！我告诉过你我要和光子六点去购物的！现在我得打电话取消！还有，那个奇迹少女在这里干什么？”

"I came to speak to you and Pilot Ikari."  
“我来和你们谈谈，伊卡里少尉。”

Asuka blinked, picking up the subtle difference. "'I came to speak'? Not 'I was ordered to speak'? That's quite an achievement, Wondergirl, but whatever it is, it'll have to wait until this BAKA gets my dinner done. Now, I'm off to call Hikari."  
明日香眨了眨眼，察觉到了细微的差别。“‘我来谈谈’？不是‘我被命令来谈谈’？真是个了不起的成就啊，奇迹女孩，但不管是什么事，都得等这个笨蛋把我的晚饭做好再说。现在，我要去给光打电话了。”

Shinji winced at the death glare he received and hurried to the kitchen. "Why don't you stay for dinner, Ayanami?"  
真嗣被她那凶狠的目光瞪得一缩，急忙跑向厨房。“为什么不留下吃晚饭呢，绫波？”

"Would it not be awkward for you and Pilot Sorhyu?"  
"对你和驾驶员素吕和来说，不会觉得尴尬吗？"

"No, no it wouldn't," Shinji insisted, as he took out pots and pans. Rei watched interestedly as he removed some celery and carrots from the refrigerator and began to peel them. He needed neither cookbook nor measuring instruments—the skills were embedded in his hands and the recipes in his head. "You said you had something to tell us, Ayanami?"  
"不，不会的，" 真嗣坚持道，同时拿出锅碗瓢盆。丽好奇地看着他从冰箱里取出一些芹菜和胡萝卜，开始削皮。他既不需要食谱也不需要测量工具——这些技能已经融入了他的双手，而食谱则铭记在他的脑海中。"你说过有事要告诉我们，绫波？"

"It would better for Pilot Sorhyu to be present as well," Rei replied smoothly. Shinji nodded acceptingly and turned back to the food. Asuka's angry shouts were clearly audible from her bedroom, and neither wanted to rouse her any further. The Third Child set some water to boil and dropped the sliced vegetables into the pot when bubbles began breaking on the surface.  
""最好也让驾驶员素吕和在场，" 丽平静地回答。真嗣点头表示同意，转身继续处理食物。明日香卧室里愤怒的喊声清晰可闻，两人都不想再激怒她。第三适格者将一些水烧开，当水面开始冒泡时，他将切好的蔬菜放入锅中。

"Erm... do you want something to do?" Shinji asked awkwardly. "You look kind of bored standing there."  
“呃...你想做点什么吗？”真嗣尴尬地问道，“你站在那里看起来有点无聊。”

"I would be happy to help, but I am afraid that you must show me what to do."  
“我很乐意帮忙，但我恐怕需要你告诉我该怎么做。”

Under his directions, Rei washed her hands and found herself a large bowl and mixing spoon while he got out the cornmeal and flour. Shinji added those two ingredients along with salt and sugar and other powdered things she didn't recognize, followed by milk. Her job was to stir, and she did so emphatically. Shinji glanced at his watch and decided that there was time for another corn-related recipe, and began blending similar ingredients beside the quiet girl. That silence was interrupted when the Second came in.  
在他的指导下，绫波洗了手，找到一个大碗和搅拌勺，而他则拿出玉米面和面粉。真嗣将这两种原料连同盐、糖和其他她不认识的粉状物一起加入，随后倒入牛奶。她的任务是搅拌，她便用力地搅动着。真嗣看了看手表，决定还有时间再做一个与玉米相关的食谱，便在安静的女孩旁边开始混合类似的原料。这份沉默被二号机驾驶员的到来打破了。

"What are YOU doing in the kitchen, Wondergirl?!" she screeched. "I don't intend to eat anything that's been touched by your hands! They're probably sticky with LCL!"  
"你在这厨房里干什么，奇迹少女？！"她尖叫道。"我可不想吃任何被你碰过的东西！你的手可能还沾着 LCL 呢！"

Shinji blanched, but Rei was calm. She slowly set the spoon on the table, and held up both hands with their palms facing out, so that Asuka could see that there was no LCL. Asuka snorted, and Rei retracted her arms, heading for the sink. "If it will please you, Pilot Sorhyu, I will wash my hands again."  
真嗣脸色发白，但丽依然平静。她慢慢地将勺子放在桌上，举起双手掌心朝外，让明日香能看到手上没有 LCL。明日香哼了一声，丽收回手臂，走向水槽。"如果能让您满意，驾驶员惣流，我会再次洗手。"

Asuka had temporarily run out of insults. It was rather hard to win an argument with someone who did not argue, so she instead turned to Shinji.  
明日香暂时找不到新的侮辱之词。和一个不争辩的人争论很难取胜，于是她转而向真嗣发难。

"Hikari is coming at seven to pick me up, so you'd better have dinner ready at six-thirty. That gives you... forty minutes." Asuka turned and flounced out of the kitchen.  
"光莉七点会来接我，所以你最好六点半就把晚饭准备好。这样你还有……四十分钟。" 明日香转过身，气呼呼地离开了厨房。

"Sorry," Shinji mumbled. "对不起，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"It does not matter." Rei gave the batter a final stir. "What should I do next?"  
"没关系。" 绫波最后搅拌了一下面糊。"接下来我该做什么？"

He found her a metal tray and spread some baking sheets across the surface. Rei brushed them with butter as Shinji spooned out the batter, forming small round circles. When those had been inserted into the oven, he poured his bowl of batter into two identical bread pans and set them to bake.  
他给她找来一个金属托盘，铺上几张烘焙纸。丽在上面刷了一层黄油，而真嗣则用勺子舀出面糊，做成一个个小圆圈。待这些放入烤箱后，他又将面糊倒入两个相同的面包模具中，设定好烘烤时间。

Rei set the table. Never did she go to such lengths for a meal when she ate alone at home. There was no one to share it with, no one to see her eat. She ate whatever was available wherever she wished to eat, usually on her bed or sitting on the floor. When Asuka strode in for the third time since Rei had arrived, the table was neatly set and Shinji was bringing over steaming bowls of food.  
丽摆好了餐桌。她独自在家时，从未如此精心准备过一顿饭。没有人和她分享，也没有人看她用餐。她总是随手拿些可吃的东西，随便找个地方吃，通常是在床上或坐在地板上。当明日香第三次走进来时，桌子已经整齐地摆好，真嗣正端着热腾腾的碗过来。

Asuka chose her customary seat and Shinji chose one as far away as possible, leaving Rei to sit between them. Without preamble they ate.  
明日香选择了她惯常的座位，真嗣则选了一个尽可能远的位置，留下丽坐在他们中间。没有多余的寒暄，他们开始用餐。

She had learned to observe people quietly without attracting their attention, and Rei exercised this skill now as she waited for the correct moment to break her news. It would be better done before Major Katsuragi came home, and she didn't quite know when that would be. Rei glanced at Shinji, who was timidly taking small bites of his cornbread. She looked in the other direction. Asuka was wolfing down bites of vegetable, probably in a rush so that she could ready herself for shopping.  
她已经学会了在不引起注意的情况下静静地观察人们，丽现在正运用这一技巧，等待合适的时机来宣布她的消息。最好在葛城美里少校回家之前完成，而她并不完全知道那会是什么时候。丽瞥了一眼真嗣，他正胆怯地小口吃着玉米面包。她又看向另一边。明日香正在狼吞虎咽地吃着蔬菜，可能是为了赶时间，以便准备好去购物。

Rei turned back to her own plate and took a bite of the corn cookies she had helped to make. They were buttery and crispy, and melted in her mouth. She reached for another one, and her hand collided with Asuka's.  
丽转回自己的盘子，咬了一口她帮忙做的玉米饼干。它们酥脆可口，入口即化。她伸手去拿另一块，手却和明日香的碰到了一起。

"Move it, Wondergirl," she snapped, and Rei obeyed.  
“让开，奇迹少女，”她厉声说道，丽顺从地移开了手。

Her copper hair flashed in the light as she tossed it back and bit into the cookie. "Didn't you have something to say?"  
她的铜红色头发在灯光下闪耀，她甩了甩头，咬了一口饼干。“你不是有话要说吗？”

"Yes," Rei agreed “是的，”丽同意道

"Well then, get it over with."  
“那就快说吧。”

Rei hesitated a moment, trying to decide on the best way to word what she had to say. She was concerned mainly for the Third Child, who after all was much closer to Misato than Asuka. She had promised to protect him, and she knew that this news would wound him.  
丽犹豫了一会儿，试图找到最合适的表达方式。她主要担心的是第三适格者，毕竟他和美里比明日香更亲近。她曾承诺要保护他，她知道这个消息会让他受伤。

"Well?" “那么？”

The Second was getting impatient. Rei decided to be direct.  
第二适格者开始不耐烦了。丽决定直接了当。

"Major Katsuragi has Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia."  
葛城美里少校患有急性淋巴细胞白血病。

Shinji dropped his bread, and dove under the table to get it. When he reappeared, his face was white as paper. "How—what—how can that be possible? She's not going to...to..."  
真嗣手中的面包掉落，他钻到桌子下去捡。当他再次出现时，脸色苍白如纸。“怎么会——怎么可能？她不会……不会……”

His gaze settled on Asuka, who looked perfectly calm and composed... and as Rei noted, her face bore not a hint of surprise.  
他的目光落在明日香身上，她看起来异常平静和镇定……正如绫波所注意到的，她的脸上没有一丝惊讶的痕迹。

"You _knew?!_" Shinji exclaimed.  
"你知道了？！" 真嗣惊呼道。

"Well, wasn't it obvious?" Asuka retorted, but her voice quivered slightly.  
"这不是很明显吗？" 明日香反驳道，但她的声音微微颤抖。

"Why didn't you say something?"  
"你为什么不早点说？"

"What was I supposed to say? 'Hey Misato, you know, it's kind of obvious that you've got leukemia'?"  
"我该说什么呢？‘嘿，美里，你知道吗，很明显你得了白血病’？"

There was an uncomfortable pause. He knew what leukemia was. They all did. It was cancer of the blood marrow.  
出现了一阵令人不安的沉默。他知道白血病是什么。他们都知道。那是骨髓的癌症。

"So what comes next?" Shinji asked fearfully.  
"接下来会发生什么？" 真嗣害怕地问道。

"I do not know," Rei replied truthfully. But Asuka had some sort of an idea.  
"我不知道，" 丽诚实地回答。但明日香似乎有些想法。

"Chemotherapy, perhaps a bone marrow transplant, but surgery's not really an option," she recited, holding up a finger for each treatment. She dropped her hands in exasperation at the incomprehensive expressions on Shinji and Rei's faces. "Oh come on. Don't tell me you don't know _anything_ about how leukemia is treated."  
"化疗，或许还有骨髓移植，但手术确实不是一个选项，" 她逐一列举，每说一种治疗就竖起一根手指。看到真嗣和丽脸上茫然的表情，她无奈地放下双手。"拜托，别告诉我你们对白血病的治疗一无所知。"

"Is she coming home tonight?" Shinji asked.  
"她今晚回家吗？" 真嗣问道。

"I don't think so." “我不这么认为。”

Shinji surveyed the table and wondered if his cooking was suitable for a person with leukemia to eat on a daily basis. If she was going to be hospitalized for a long time, perhaps he could bring her some food. He knew from experience that hospital food was not exactly fine cuisine.  
真嗣审视着餐桌，思索自己的烹饪是否适合白血病患者每日食用。如果她要长期住院，或许他可以给她带些食物。他凭经验知道，医院餐食绝非佳肴。

The doorbell rang. 门铃响了。

Namika wanted her hospitalized for the night.  
纳美卡希望她住院一晚。

What joy. She had not stayed overnight in a hospital since—well, since they found her after the Second Impact.  
真是令人愉悦。自从——嗯，自从第二次冲击后找到她以来，她就没有在医院过夜过。

Only this time they were showered her constantly with well-meaning advice: she needed to be careful of what she ate and make sure that she got enough nutrition—she was not to eat any of her own cooking, Ritsuko had advised—oh, and regular sleep became a necessity. Namika was eager to start chemotherapy immediately, and Misato was not looking forward to the side effects. She fingered her long purple hair wistfully. It would be hard to lose it, but Namika could not guarantee her that that wouldn't happen.  
只是这次他们不断向她灌输善意的建议：她需要注意饮食，确保摄入足够的营养——律子告诫她，不能吃自己做的食物——哦，还有规律的睡眠变得至关重要。纳美卡急切地想立即开始化疗，而美里并不期待副作用。她忧郁地抚摸着自己长长的紫色头发。失去它们会很艰难，但纳美卡无法保证这不会发生。

She was feeling calmer about her diagnosis now. Miki and Ritsuko had fairly high hopes—after all, who could tell before the treatments began? Miki had brought her a wheelchair, which annoyed Misato: surely the doctor could see that she was getting along fine on crutches. Ritsuko pointed out that the soreness would peak in the next few days, and she would not want to have to walk her way down to the bathroom, which was halfway down the hallway.  
她现在对自己的诊断感到平静多了。美纪和律子抱有相当高的希望——毕竟，治疗开始前谁能说得准呢？美纪给她带来了一辆轮椅，这让美里感到恼火：医生肯定看得出她用拐杖走得很好。律子指出，酸痛将在接下来的几天达到顶峰，她不会想拄着拐杖走到半条走廊外的浴室的。

They wheeled her to a much larger room containing only one bed and a large window that covered most of the far wall. Everything was white, and so brightly clean that it hurt her eyes. Misato got into bed and stared wistfully outside at the blooming gardens while Miki set up a flat-paneled television screen, hanging from the corner of the ceiling.  
他们把她推到一个更大的房间，里面只有一张床和一扇占据了大部分远墙的大窗户。一切都是白色的，干净得刺眼，让她眼睛疼。美里上了床，渴望地望着窗外盛开的花园，而美纪则在天花板的一角挂起了一台平板电视屏幕。

"There's already a TV in here," Misato pointed out.  
“这里已经有电视了，”美里指出。

"This one's only got one channel," Ritsuko explained, "and you'll be able to see exactly what's going on in the Geofront. Besides, should an angel attack while you're being hospitalized, we'll be able to hear everything you're saying, much like the way we can hear the pilots during a mission. That way you can direct the operation from bed." Ritsuko picked up a small remote on Misato's bedside table and pressed a button. The screen flashed to life. "Maya? Can you hear us?"  
"这台只有一个频道，" 律子解释道，"你可以实时看到地表前线的情况。而且，万一你在住院期间有使徒来袭，我们也能听到你说的每一句话，就像任务中能听到驾驶员们的对话一样。这样你就能在床上指挥作战了。" 律子拿起美里床头柜上的一个小遥控器，按下按钮。屏幕随即亮起。"摩耶？能听到我们吗？"

"Yes, Sempai," came Maya's voice, slightly altered by the machine. She turned around to face them and waved. "How is Major Katsuragi doing?"  
"是的，前辈，" 摩耶的声音传来，经过机器稍作改变。她转过身面对他们，挥了挥手。"葛城美里少校怎么样了？"

"She's fine. Just testing the system." Ritsuko shut it off. "You can just keep it off at all times unless we call you to turn it in."  
"她很好。只是测试一下系统。" 律子关掉了它。"平时可以一直关着，除非我们叫你打开。"

Misato was beginning to get suspicious at all the accommodations. "Just how long do you think I'll be in here?"  
美里开始对所有的照顾感到怀疑。“你觉得我还要在这里待多久？”

Ritsuko and Miki exchanged a nervous glance. Misato got annoyed and temporarily lost it. "_Damn it,_ I'm tired of being lied to. Am I going to die or not?"  
律子和美纪交换了一个紧张的眼神。美里感到烦躁，暂时失控了。“该死，我受够了被欺骗。我会不会死？”

"_No_," Miki said emphatically, "and I mean that, Misato. But we don't want you going home tonight partly because we don't want you bothered by the Second Child and more importantly, we don't want you eating any of your own cooking."  
“不会，”美纪坚定地说，“我是认真的，美里。但我们今晚不想让你回家，部分原因是怕你被二号少年打扰，更重要的是，我们不想让你吃你自己做的饭。”

"All right." She mulled over the situation. "Can I call Shinji?"  
"好吧。" 她仔细考虑了一下情况。"我能给真嗣打电话吗？"

Miki went to fetch her cell phone, which was still sitting in the recovering room with the rest of Misato's belongings. Ritsuko took the opportunity to sit down by her side.  
美纪去取她的手机，手机还放在恢复室里，和美里其他的物品在一起。律子趁机坐在她旁边。

"Shinji and Asuka don't know yet, huh?" she asked quietly.  
"真嗣和明日香还不知道，是吗？" 她轻声问道。

Misato looked away. "I sent Rei to tell them."  
美里别过头去。“我让丽去告诉他们。”

_That wasn't right_, she thought, as Ritsuko nodded. _I didn't send her. Rei offered. It wouldn't make a difference with anyone else, but Rei..._  
她心想，这样不对，看着律子点头。我没有派她去。是丽主动提出的。对其他人来说可能没什么区别，但丽……

"I wonder how they'll fare tonight without you being there," Ritsuko remarked, a smile creeping onto her face. "I imagine Shinji will be cooking... Asuka will be displeased with whatever it is he makes...and Rei will just sit there in the middle and not comment. Oh, and Pen-pen will finish up your share of beer."  
“不知道今晚没有你在，他们会怎么样，”律子说道，脸上渐渐浮现出笑容。“我想真嗣会负责做饭……明日香会对他的厨艺不满……而丽则会坐在中间一言不发。哦，还有，Pen-pen 会把你的那份啤酒喝掉。”

"You know us too well," Misato muttered, cracking a smile. Miki reappeared with the cell phone, and Ritsuko backed out of the room to give her some privacy.  
"你真是太了解我们了，" 美里咕哝着，嘴角露出一丝微笑。Miki 拿着手机再次出现，而律子则退出了房间，给她一些私人空间。

"Hello?" “喂？”

"Shin-chan?" "真嗣君？"

"Misato-san!" Shinji's voice broke with relief as he sank into the squashy couch, relieved that Asuka was not here to witness his "unmanly" behavior. Her voice was strained and did not hide the tension and exhaustion she was feeling, despite her best efforts.  
"美里小姐！" 真嗣的声音因解脱而哽咽，他陷进柔软的沙发里，庆幸明日香不在这里看到他"不像男人"的行为。她的声音紧张而疲惫，尽管她尽力掩饰，但那份紧张和疲惫并未被隐藏。

On the other end, Misato smiled wanly. She fingered the folded edge of her blanket, holding it in place with her thumb and middle finger while running the side of her index finger over, back and forth. "How're you faring alone with Asuka?" She smiled to herself, wishing she could be there to see his blush.  
"在另一端，美里淡淡地笑了。她用拇指和中指捏住毯子的折叠边缘，同时用食指侧面来回摩挲。“你一个人和明日香相处得怎么样？”她暗自微笑，希望能在那里看到他的脸红。”

"I-i-its not just Asuka! Ayanami was here earlier. She stayed for dinner."  
“我-我-不只是明日香！绫波刚才也在。她留下来吃了晚饭。”

_Very Rei-like to be punctual,_ Misato thought. "She told you?"  
非常绫波式的准时，美里想。“她告诉你了？”

"Yes." "是的。"

There was a short pause.  
有一阵短暂的停顿。

"But Asuka knew already."  
“但明日香已经知道了。”

"How?" Misato exclaimed, surprised. _How could Asuka have known? And why... why hadn't she said anything?_  
“怎么知道的？”美里惊呼，感到意外。明日香是怎么知道的？而且为什么……为什么她没有说出来？

"I don't know," Shinji replied, sounding terribly depressed. Misato hated that tone of voice, and tried to cheer him up.  
"我不知道，" 真嗣回答道，听起来非常沮丧。美里讨厌他这种语气，试图让他振作起来。

"Hey," she pressed urgently, "I don't know how you survived all those hospital visits on the stuff they serve here. Can you bring me some of your cooking?"  
"嘿，" 她急切地追问，"我不知道你是怎么靠医院提供的那些食物熬过所有探访的。你能给我带些你做的菜吗？"

He brightened then. "Of course."  
他随即精神一振。"当然可以。"

"How's Asuka?" “明日香怎么样了？”

"She went out shopping with Hikari."  
“她和光一起出去购物了。”

"And Rei?" “那丽呢？”

"Ayanami went home shortly after dinner."  
"绫波吃完晚饭后不久就回家了。"

Pause. 停顿。

"Misato-san?" "美里小姐？"

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

"When will you be coming home?"  
"你什么时候回家？"

"I'll be back by tomorrow. Don't worry about me, just don't get yourself killed by Asuka, all right?"  
"我明天就回来。别担心我，只要别被明日香干掉就行，好吗？"

"...all right..." "...好吧..."

_He didn't sound very convinced_, Misato thought, a frown settling on her face. She slid down farther in bed until her toes touched the smooth wooden bedpost and sent a faint sensation of pain through her body.  
他听起来不太相信，美里想，眉头紧锁。她又往床下滑了滑，直到脚趾触到光滑的木质床柱，一阵轻微的疼痛感传遍全身。

_I wish they'd paint the walls a different color_, she thought, before drifting off to sleep.  
她想，要是他们能把墙漆成别的颜色就好了，随后便渐渐进入了梦乡。

_Nozomi would love that bento,_ Hikari thought, bending close to admire it through the windowpane. The box was shaped like a bird and divided into small sections—the head for rice, and the others for fish and vegetables and other Japanese delicacies. Hikari checked her purse. It would be a wonderful birthday present for her sister; after all, her old box was getting old and worn.  
希卡里心想，诺佐美一定会喜欢这个便当的。她贴近窗玻璃仔细欣赏，便当盒被设计成鸟的形状，分成几个小格——头部放米饭，其他部分则分别装着鱼、蔬菜和其他日本美食。希卡里检查了一下钱包，这将是送给妹妹的一份美妙的生日礼物；毕竟，她那个旧便当盒已经老旧磨损了。

"Asuka, I'm going in here for a minute," she called. The redhead was facing away from her, hands clasped behind her back, her weight balanced on one foot while she tapped the other impatiently on the concrete sidewalk. "Hey, Asuka?"  
“明日香，我要进去一会儿，”她喊道。红发的明日香背对着她，双手交叉在背后，身体重心放在一只脚上，另一只脚不耐烦地在水泥人行道上轻敲。“嘿，明日香？”

"Yeah, yeah, go ahead, I'm listening."  
"是是，说吧，我在听。"

Hikari shook her head and didn't question further. If Asuka wanted to tell her about it, she would. She looked through the store's supply of bentos and chose a blue one.  
光摇了摇头，没有再追问。如果明日香想告诉她，自然会说。她浏览着店里供应的便当，选了一个蓝色的。

"Thank you," she said to the storekeeper, and came out. Asuka was waiting for her, and seemed eager to keep moving. Hikari looked down at her purchases. So far she had bought a pair of twin ribbons for her hair, a pair of chopsticks for Kodama, and the bento for Nozomi.  
"谢谢，"她对店主说道，然后走了出来。明日香在等她，看起来急切地想继续前进。光低头看了看她的购物袋。到目前为止，她买了一对双色发带，一双给小玉的筷子，还有给望的便当。

Asuka's hands were still empty.  
明日香的手中依旧空空如也。

"It isn't like you to windowshop so much," Hikari commented. Asuka was not at all a frugal shopper, and Hikari had spent long hours poring over clothes, debating whether or not Kaji would find it attractive.  
“你可不是那种会逛这么久橱窗的人，” 光子瑠吐槽道。明日香绝非节俭的购物者，而光子瑠则花了好几个小时仔细挑选衣服，纠结着加持会不会觉得她穿起来有魅力。

The redhead blushed slightly, lowering her head, and Hikari decided to joke a bit with her. "It's not about Ikari-kun, is it?"  
红发少女微微脸红，低下头去，光子瑠便决定逗逗她。“不是为了碇君吧？”

Asuka whirled around, her empty hands clenching into fists. "NO! It has NOTHING to do with that—that—_baka—_it's just..."  
明日香猛地转过身，空空如也的双手紧握成拳。“不！这跟那个——那个——笨蛋——一点关系都没有——只是……”

Hikari backed away, having never seen such anger directed at her—and especially not from Asuka. Her face was furrowed in anger—anger and frustration, Hikari thought, a quick apology dangling off the tip of her tongue, until Asuka's brows smoothed out and her livid expression slowly faded. Her hands unclenched and went limp as she closed her eyes, and a moment passed before Hikari recognized the look as one of hopelessness.  
光从未见过如此愤怒的目光直指自己——尤其是来自明日香。她的脸上满是愤怒——愤怒和沮丧，光心想，一句快速的道歉挂在嘴边，直到明日香的眉头舒展开来，她那怒气冲冲的表情慢慢消退。她的手松开，无力地垂下，闭上眼睛，片刻之后，光才意识到那是一种绝望的神情。

"Hikari..." Asuka whispered, "Misato has leukemia."  
“光……”明日香低声说道，“美里得了白血病。”

Instinctively Hikari gasped, pressing her hands to her mouth before realizing that that was not the reaction Asuka would have liked to see. "Oh, Asuka... but she'll be all right, won't she?"  
本能地，光惊呼一声，双手捂住嘴巴，随即意识到这不是明日香希望看到的反应。“哦，明日香……但她会没事的，对吧？”

Asuka glanced down the street.  
明日香瞥了一眼街道。

Nobody noticed the two schoolgirls standing on the sidewalk. There were huge crowds of businessmen dressed in fancy suits, recently freed from their offices, heading out for a drink with their friends. A young mother led her child out of a shop while the boy cried and flailed his arms angrily, apparently disappointed that his mother wouldn't buy him the toy he wanted. Asuka drew in her skirt as they passed.  
没有人注意到站在人行道上的两个女学生。街道上挤满了穿着考究西装的商务人士，刚从办公室解脱出来，正与朋友们外出小酌。一位年轻的母亲牵着她的孩子走出商店，男孩哭闹着，愤怒地挥舞手臂，显然是因为母亲没有给他买想要的玩具而失望。他们经过时，明日香收紧了裙摆。

"Sorry," she apologized. “对不起，”她道歉道。

Asuka nodded and looked back up. The clouds were darkening. It was time for a summer storm.  
明日香点点头，再次抬头望去。云层正在变暗。夏日风暴即将来临。

"I don't know..." "我不知道……"

It was unlike Asuka to be so indecisive and vulnerable, Hikari thought. She took the lead, looping her arm firmly around Asuka's. They walked down the street and avoided crowded areas. Perhaps she was being selfish, Hikari thought, but she didn't know this Asuka, and the new girl scared her. _I want the old Asuka back!_  
像明日香这样犹豫不决、脆弱不堪的样子，对美里来说是陌生的。她主动引领，紧紧挽住明日香的胳膊。她们避开拥挤的区域，沿着街道前行。也许她有些自私，美里心想，但她不认识这个新的明日香，这个新形象让她感到害怕。我想要以前的明日香回来！

She noticed a dress that Asuka was sure to like and dragged her inside.  
她注意到一件亚丝娜肯定会喜欢的裙子，便拉着她走了进去。

"Try it on!" she urged. The skirt was pleated and the top half consisted of a v-shaped neckline and long sleeves. The entire garment was dyed a passionate shade of maroon.  
“试试看！”她催促道。这条裙子是百褶裙，上半部分是 V 形领口和长袖。整件衣服染成了热情的栗色。

Asuka was reluctant. "It's summer... and this thing has long sleeves."  
亚丝娜有些不情愿。“现在是夏天……而且这衣服还有长袖。”

"Oh, that would look just lovely on you!" the salesperson gushed, swooping down on them. "You certainly can't make a decision until you've tried it on! Go on, the fitting room is just over there." She placed an arm around the redhead's shoulder and led her over, showed her in, and pulled the curtain shut behind her.  
"哦，那穿在你身上一定美极了！" 售货员热情洋溢地说道，迅速向她们走来。"你当然得试穿一下才能决定！去吧，试衣间就在那边。" 她用一只手臂搂住红发女孩的肩膀，领她过去，示意她进去，然后在她身后拉上了帘子。

"And what can I help you with?" she asked Hikari.  
"我能帮你什么吗？" 她问光。

"Nothing," Hikari replied quickly. "I'll just wait for her." She gestured toward the curtain.  
"不用了，" 光迅速回答。"我就在这儿等她。" 她指了指帘子。

_I don't need a dress right now_, Asuka thought. She tugged on the zipper of her school uniform. It was stuck in her hair and refused to move either up or down. Asuka ripped out the offending strands and tried again. The back of her dress split neatly into two sides.  
我现在不需要穿裙子，明日香心想。她拉了拉校服的拉链。拉链卡在了她的头发里，无论向上还是向下都纹丝不动。明日香扯掉那些碍事的头发，再次尝试。裙子的后背整齐地裂成了两半。

_This is more like something Misato would wear_.  
这更像是美里会穿的东西。

The thought made her anxious again. For all the indifference she showed toward her commander, Asuka had grown to care. All the shields and barriers she had set up against the Japanese world—she was _German_, for goodness's sake—Misato had gently broken through all of them. Her drunkenness, her lack of appropriate clothing... _what would we do without Misato?_ Asuka slid into the dress and tied the straps at her shoulders.  
这个想法让她再次感到焦虑。尽管她对指挥官表现出冷漠，但明日香已经逐渐在意起来。她为了抵御日本世界所建立的所有盾牌和障碍——她可是德国人，天哪——美里却温柔地打破了所有这些。她的醉酒，她的不合时宜的衣着……没有美里我们该怎么办？明日香穿上裙子，将肩带系好。

"Are you done?" Hikari called.  
"你好了吗？" 光喊道。

"Yeah, give me a minute."  
"嗯，再等我一会儿。"

Asuka stepped out and obligingly twirled. The skirt fluttered about like butterfly wings and came back to a rest around her legs.  
明日香走出来，顺从地转了个圈。裙子像蝴蝶翅膀一样飘扬，然后又轻轻地落回她的腿边。

"Oh, it's just lovely," the saleslady gasped, clutching her hands together. "Do come over here and look in the mirror."  
"哦，真是太美了，"女售货员惊叹道，双手紧握。"请过来这边，照照镜子吧。"

"It does look very nice, Asuka," Hikari added.  
"确实很好看，明日香，"光也附和道。"

_It'd look nicer on Misato.  
穿在美里身上会更好看。_

"It's a little big," she commented, pinching in the sides.  
"有点大了，"她捏了捏两侧说道。

_Maybe I should get it as a Christmas present for her.  
也许我应该把它作为圣诞礼物送给她。_

"I can fix that," Hikari pressed.  
"我可以改一下，"光坚定地说。

_If she's still alive then.  
如果她还活着的话。_

"No," Asuka ground out, "no, I don't want it." She tuned out all the protests and closed her eyes. _I don't want to be reminded of Misato every time I wear it. Damn it, why do I EVEN CARE?!_  
"不，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说，"不，我不想要它。" 她无视所有的抗议，闭上了眼睛。我不想每次戴上它都想起美里。该死，我为什么还要在乎？！

"Shame," she heard someone say, "it looks rather nice on you."  
"真可惜，" 她听到有人说，"它在你身上看起来相当不错。"

The voice was masculine... and familiar...  
那声音是男性的...而且很熟悉...

... "Mr. Kaji!" Hikari exclaimed.  
...“加治先生！”光惊呼道。

She opened her eyes to see him directly behind her in the mirror. Asuka knew immediately from his easy, nonchalant smile that he didn't yet know about Misato. She smiled too, not wanting him to see how upset she was.  
她睁开眼睛，从镜子里看到他就站在她身后。从他轻松随意的笑容中，明日香立刻明白他还不知道美里的事。她也笑了笑，不想让他看出自己有多难过。

Kaji swept Hikari up into a big bear hug before putting her down again. "You really should get it," he assured Asuka. "It brings out the color of your hair even more than it usually does."  
加持将光抱了个满怀，然后又把她放下。“你真的应该买下它，”他向明日香保证道，“它能让你的发色更显眼，比平时还要亮丽。”

She loved compliments from Kaji more than anyone else. Compliments from boys her age were a waste of her time. But then again...he couldn't know about Misato, or he wouldn't be making that sort of comment.  
她比任何人都喜欢加持的赞美。同龄男孩的恭维对她来说纯属浪费时间。但话说回来...他不可能知道美里的事，否则他不会说出那种话。

"No," she heard herself say, "I really don't think I'm going to get it."  
“不，”她听到自己说，“我真的不觉得我会买它。”

They went for ice cream afterwards in a small outdoor café, shielded from the pouring rain by a large tri-colored umbrella. Asuka had strawberry and Hikari chose vanilla, while Kaji ordered a large chocolate cone for himself. Kaji pulled over another chair and wiped it dry, and the three seated themselves around the round table.  
事后，他们去了那家小户外咖啡馆吃冰淇淋，大雨被一把巨大的三色伞挡在外面。明日香点了草莓味，光选择了香草味，而加持则为自己点了一个大巧克力蛋筒。加持又拉来一把椅子，擦干后，三人围坐在圆桌旁。

"You remember the time we brought ice cream on a summer boat ride in Germany?" Kaji reminded her, biting into his ice cream. He studied the dent for some time, while Asuka looked confused. "When you decided to take some out at noon and all that was left was chocolate syrup?"  
“你还记得我们在德国夏天乘船时带冰淇淋的事吗？”加持提醒她，咬了一口冰淇淋。他盯着那个牙印看了好一会儿，而明日香则显得有些困惑。“当你决定中午拿出来时，只剩下巧克力糖浆了？”

"And I got it all over my hands," Asuka remembered then, cracking a small smile.  
“然后我手上沾满了糖浆，”明日香回忆道，随即露出一丝微笑。

"Now, you're not getting out of telling the rest of the story," Kaji grinned. "Go on, tell Hikari what you did next."  
"现在，你别想逃过讲完剩下的故事，" 加持笑着说，"继续，告诉光你接下来做了什么。"

"Kaji!" Asuka shouted, blushing, but Kaji simply laughed and managed to lean out of her reach while she attempted to cover his mouth.  
"加持！" 明日香喊道，脸红了起来，但加持只是笑着，设法躲开了她试图捂住他嘴巴的手。

"What happened?" Hikari asked, rather enjoying herself.  
"发生了什么？" 光问道，相当自得其乐。

"She tried to get a napkin to wipe her hands off, and in getting up f—mmph!—ell over onto me, got choc—ouch!—chocolate handprints all over my shirt, and tipped the boat over."  
"她试图拿张餐巾纸擦手，结果起身时——唔嗯！——摔倒在我身上，巧克力手印全印在了我的衬衫上，还把船给弄翻了。"

Hikari giggled. 光咯咯笑了起来。

"Okay, okay, you can get off of me now... people are beginning to stare."  
"好了好了，你现在可以起来了...大家都在看呢。"

Asuka noted (with satisfaction) two pink handprints on the front of his shirt. She had rather liked doing that.  
明日香满意地注意到他衬衫前有两个粉红色的手印。她挺喜欢那样做的。

The table fell back into silence. Kaji finished his ice cream first, despite having eaten more than both of the girls put together. Hikari finished next and let her spoon fall to the ceramic bowl with a soft _clang_.  
桌子周围再次陷入沉默。尽管吃掉的冰淇淋比两个女孩加起来还多，但加持最先吃完。光第二个吃完，勺子轻轻地落在陶瓷碗里，发出一声脆响。

"Hey, this isn't like you," Kaji commented, watching Asuka stab her remaining ice cream with a spoon and flip it over. "Haven't you beat up any guys in school recently, or broken another swimming record, the last six of which were set by none other than the famous Sorhyu Asuka Langley?"  
“嘿，这可不像你，”加持看着明日香用勺子戳着剩下的冰淇淋并翻了个面，评论道，“最近在学校没揍过哪个男生，或者打破另一项游泳纪录吗？要知道，最近的六项纪录可都是由著名的惣流·明日香·兰格雷保持的。”

"Seven," she corrected him.  
"是七次，" 她纠正他。

"All right, seven then." He watched, waiting for a response.  
"好吧，那就七次。" 他注视着，等待她的回应。

On any occasion Asuka would probably have laughed and thrown her arms around him, but today she only flipped the ice cream one last time and sighed. It was almost all melted. "Hey, Kaji... you haven't heard about Misato yet, have you?"  
在任何其他场合，明日香可能会笑出声并拥抱他，但今天她只是最后一次翻动冰淇淋，叹了口气。几乎都融化了。"嘿，加持... 你还没听说美里的事吧？"

"Drunk again?" "又喝醉了？"

"No." She held her voice steady. "She has leukemia."  
"没有。" 她努力保持声音平稳。"她得了白血病。"

Hikari watched dreadfully as Kaji froze.  
光眼睁睁地看着克己僵住了。

"You can't be serious," he insisted, but a moment later shook his head. "No, it all makes sense. The bruising, the collapsing, the not being able to breathe..."  
"你不是认真的吧，"他坚持道，但片刻后又摇了摇头。"不，这一切都说得通了。瘀伤，崩溃，无法呼吸……"

Asuka watched him, hating every moment of it. This was not the Kaji she knew, the one who liked to joke around and annoy Misato by occasionally hinting of Ritsuko. Kaji was not smiling. He had temporarily hidden his face in his hands, but a moment later he was looking up again.  
明日香看着他，每一刻都让她心生厌恶。这不是她所认识的加持，那个喜欢开玩笑、偶尔暗示律子来惹美里生气的加持。加持没有笑。他暂时用手捂住了脸，但很快又抬起了头。

"Mr. Kaji?" Hikari ventured tentatively. He looked at her and smiled.  
"加持先生？"光小心翼翼地试探道。他看着她，露出了微笑。

"She'll be fine," he reassured them. "Come on, think about the things Katsuragi has survived. Second Impact," he began, counting on his fingers. "Numerous Angel attacks. Enough alcohol to kill anyone several times over. Her own cooking.  
"她会没事的，" 他安慰他们。"来吧，想想葛城美里经历过的那些事。第二次冲击，" 他开始掰着手指头数。"无数使徒的攻击。足以杀死任何人好几次的酒精量。还有她自己的厨艺。

"And living with you, of course," he teased, elbowing Asuka. "A bit of cancer is nothing compared to that."  
"当然，还有和你一起生活，" 他打趣道，用胳膊肘碰了碰明日香。"一点癌症跟这比起来根本不算什么。

"HEY!" "嘿！"

Hikari had to laugh despite the seriousness of the situation. "Do you think there's anything we can do for her?"  
尽管情况严重，光还是忍不住笑了。“你觉得我们能为她做些什么吗？”

Kaji grinned. "Bring her a meal once in awhile. I've heard from Shinji that hospital food is the only thing that can rival Katsuragi's cooking."  
加持咧嘴一笑。“偶尔给她带顿饭吧。我从真嗣那里听说，医院的伙食是唯一能与葛城小姐的厨艺相媲美的。”

She woke sometime in the night after a series of fitful dreams, ranging from Second Impact to the dirty laundry at home. At least Shinji would take care of the latter.  
她在夜里某个时刻醒来，之前做了一系列纷乱的梦，从第二次冲击到家里的脏衣服。至少真嗣会处理后者。

Misato looked around her, disliking the unfamiliar room. _Just one night_, she told herself. _Then I can go home_. The room was dark and silent, save for the humming machines and their eerie green lights. _Green is good,_ Misato thought humorlessly to herself. _Don't turn red on me_.  
美里环顾四周，对这个陌生的房间感到不快。她对自己说，就一晚。然后我就可以回家了。房间里昏暗而寂静，除了嗡嗡作响的机器和它们那诡异的绿色灯光。绿色是好的，美里自嘲地想。别在我面前变红。

There was a bit of light streaming in from the hallway, and she used it to look for a clock.  
走廊里透进一丝光线，她利用它寻找时钟。

_They put two TV's in here, but no clock!?  
他们在这里放了两台电视，却没有时钟！？_

Her cell phone should have the time.  
她的手机应该有时间显示。

Misato felt around blindly on the table for it. The tiny machine slipped through her fingers and smashed on the tiled floor with a loud _clatter_.  
美里在桌上盲目地摸索着。那小巧的机器从她指间滑落，砰的一声摔在瓷砖地上，发出刺耳的声响。

"Damn it..." “该死……”

There were voices outside her door now. At least one belonged to a female. Although she didn't know why, Misato felt as if she had broken some invisible rule by being awake, and drew the blankets up to her nose.  
门外传来了说话声，至少有一个是女性的声音。尽管她不知道为什么，Misato 感觉自己好像打破了某种无形的规则，因为她醒着，于是她把毯子拉到了鼻子下面。

_It's cold_, she thought, as the voices died away, followed by a set of clicking noises that could only be high heels. _Ritsuko, or maybe Miki?_ Her doorknob creaked, sending shivers of fear down her spine. She could have cried out in relief as the dark shadow opened her door, looked outside, and quickly shut it behind him. She recognized him instantly.  
好冷，她想着，当那些声音消失后，紧接着是一串只有高跟鞋才能发出的咔嗒声。是 Ritsuko，还是 Miki？她的门把手吱嘎作响，恐惧的寒意顺着她的脊背而下。当那个黑影打开她的门，向外张望，并迅速关上门后，她几乎要哭出来表示松了一口气。她立刻认出了他。

"What are you doing here?" she whispered.  
“你在这里做什么？”她低声问道。

"I wanted to come see you, but Rit-chan had to be all bossy and not let me in. And then _Namika_ shows up and—"  
"我想来看你，但理子酱非要那么霸道，不让我进来。然后奈美香出现了，然后——"

Misato put a finger to his lips to silence him. "It's way past visitor's hours, you know," she whispered. "But I'm glad you came."  
美里用手指按住他的嘴唇让他安静。“访客时间早就过了，你知道的。”她低声说，“但我很高兴你来了。”

"It's only two in the morning." She could tell by his silhouette that he was grinning. Kaji leaned over and kissed her on the forehead.  
"现在才凌晨两点。"她从他的轮廓就能看出他在笑。加持俯身亲吻了她的额头。

"How'd you find out?" "你怎么知道的？"

"Asuka. Ran into her while shopping."  
"绫波。购物时碰到了她。"

"I can't really see you and Asuka shopping in the same store," she replied dryly.  
"我真想象不出你和绫波会在同一家店购物，"她干巴巴地回答。"

Kaji snickered. 加持轻声笑了出来。

"Is there anything you want me to do for you?"  
“有什么需要我为你做的吗？”

"Shinji and Asuka will be fine," she said thoughtfully, "they've survived the night without me before—and Shinji will tend to Pen-pen."  
“真嗣和明日香会没事的，”她若有所思地说，“他们以前也曾在没有我的情况下度过夜晚——而且真嗣会照顾好企鹅 Pen-pen 的。”

"I'm talking about you, not them."  
"我说的是你，不是他们。"

"Then no." "那就不行。"

The door opened and Misato shaded her eyes from the sudden flow of light. Namika stepped in and in angry shouts, demanded that Kaji leave at once.  
门开了，美里用手遮住突然涌入的光线。娜美卡走了进来，愤怒地大喊，要求加持立刻离开。

"All right, all right, I'm going. Stop yelling—you don't want to wake up the rest of your patients, do you?" He held up his hands in a mock don't-shoot-me pose, and at the doorway gave Misato a salute. Fuming, Namika pushed him out.  
"好了好了，我这就走。别喊了——你不想吵醒其他病人吧？" 他举起双手，摆出不要开枪的姿势，走到门口时向美里敬了个礼。怒气冲冲的奈美香把他推了出去。

Misato smiled happily. The next thing she saw was the sunrise.  
美里开心地笑了。接下来她看到的是日出。

"Good morning, Asuka." "早上好，明日香。"

"Hey," she muttered, which was a nice improvement from "BAKA, where's my breakfast!?", and went into the bathroom. Shinji shrugged and continued making pancakes, setting aside a large batch to bring to the hospital for Misato.  
"嘿，"她嘟囔道，这比之前的"笨蛋，我的早餐呢！？"要好多了，然后走进了浴室。真嗣耸耸肩，继续做着煎饼，留出一大份准备带到医院给美里。

_She's coming home today_, Shinji thought, flipping the last of Asuka's pancakes onto her plate. He found the butter and cut three perfect slices to match the golden stack. _I should ask Ritsuko what I should cook for her._  
她今天回家了，真嗣心想，将最后一张明日香的面饼翻面放到她的盘子里。他找到了黄油，切了三片完美的切片，与金黄的叠层相匹配。我应该问问律子该为她做什么菜。

In another room of the Katsuragi apartment, Asuka found her favorite comb—a present from Kaji, when she had first been selected as an Eva pilot—and drew it slowly through the long copper locks, watching herself in the mirror. How proud she was of that hair, that lustrous color...  
在葛城公寓的另一个房间里，明日香找到了她最喜欢的梳子——这是她第一次被选为 EVA 驾驶员时，加持送给她的礼物——她慢慢地梳理着那长长的铜色发丝，看着镜中的自己。她对那头秀发，那光泽的颜色是多么自豪啊...

"Asuka," Shinji called, "your breakfast's ready."  
“明日香，”真嗣喊道，“你的早餐准备好了。”

"Coming!" "来了！"

She didn't show up until fifteen minutes later, however; by then her pancakes were cold and Shinji was already done with his. Misato's were tied up in a large cloth napkin. Asuka sighed.  
然而，她直到十五分钟后才出现；那时她的煎饼已经凉了，而真嗣已经吃完了他的。美里的是用一个大布餐巾包着的。明日香叹了口气。

"Couldn't you have reheated them?!"  
"你就不能重新加热一下吗？！"

"S-sorry..." "对-对不起..."

Shinji managed to escape Asuka's frustration for the time being by slipping into Misato's room and sliding the door shut behind him. He could at least neaten up her room and make it semi-suitable for living when she came home.  
暂时躲开了明日香的怒火，真嗣溜进了美里小姐的房间，并悄悄关上了门。至少他可以整理一下她的房间，让它在她回家时变得稍微适合居住。

Her bed was unmade, the blanket lying halfway across the room and her pillow at the other end. Dirty laundry—or maybe it was clean, he really couldn't tell—covered the floor. Shinji had taken only one step when something sharp and metallic found its way into the sole of his foot. He bent down to see that it was an earring; the back piece was nowhere to be found. Slowly, his eyes came back to the bed, or what was left of it.  
她的床铺凌乱不堪，毯子一半拖到了房间的另一头，枕头则在床的另一端。地上散落着脏衣服——或者可能是干净的，他真的分不清——真嗣只迈了一步，就感觉有什么尖锐的金属物刺进了脚底。他弯腰一看，发现是一只耳环；耳背的部分却不见踪影。慢慢地，他的目光又回到了床上，或者说那残余的部分。

_That's a place to begin_, Shinji thought, and folded her blanket into a neat pile before stacking the pillow on top. _As for the clothes_...Shinji picked up a wad of material and quickly dropped it upon realizing what a revealing, translucent piece it was. He glanced cautiously toward the closed door, shuddering at the thought of what Asuka would do to him if she found that in his hands. The Third Child glanced back at it. Surely he had time to take just a tiny glimpse... it wouldn't take more than a second... no, he'd better not get caught with that. Shinji tossed it into the overflowing laundry basket beside the door. When the floor was once again visible, he returned his attention to the earring.  
这是一个开始的地方，真嗣心想，然后将她的毯子叠成整齐的一堆，再把枕头放在上面。至于衣服...真嗣拿起一团布料，迅速又放下，意识到这是一件透明且暴露的衣物。他小心翼翼地瞥向紧闭的门，一想到明日香如果发现他在手里拿着这个会对他做什么，就不寒而栗。第三适格者再次看向它。他肯定有时间只看一眼...不会超过一秒钟...不，他最好不要被抓到。真嗣把它扔进了门旁已经装满的洗衣篮里。当地板再次清晰可见时，他重新将注意力转回到耳环上。

He'd never paid any attention to earrings before. They were just... well, they were those little dangling things that hung from girls' ears. Shinji ran his finger over the smooth white pearl. He couldn't imagine having two holes in his ears. Despite all the physical damage he had sustained over the months from piloting Eva—holes in his ears did not sound like fun. Shinji dropped the earring onto the dresser top and instinctively covered his ears.  
他以前从未注意过耳环。它们只是...嗯，就是那些挂在女孩耳朵上的小吊坠。真嗣用手指抚过光滑的白色珍珠。他无法想象自己耳朵上有两个洞。尽管这几个月来他驾驶 EVA 遭受了各种身体伤害——耳朵上有洞听起来并不好玩。真嗣将耳环放在梳妆台上，本能地捂住了自己的耳朵。

The door slid open behind him.  
门在他身后滑开了。

"What _now_, baka? And—"Asuka's face developed a funny expression when he turned around. "Did you just stab yourself in both ears?"  
"现在怎么办，笨蛋？而且——"当真嗣转过身时，明日香的脸露出了滑稽的表情。"你刚刚是把自己两边耳朵都刺了吗？"

"No," protested Shinji, feeling rather foolish as he lowered his hands.  
"没有，"真嗣抗议道，觉得自己相当愚蠢地放下了手。

Asuka blinked. 明日香眨了眨眼。

"Well then, hurry up," she snapped, and slammed the door. It bounced open again upon hitting the wall, and Shinji followed quietly.  
"那好，快点儿，" 她厉声说道，砰地一声关上了门。门撞到墙后又弹开了，真嗣默默地跟在后面。

They argued all the way to Nerv. Asuka told Shinji he ought to walk with his back straight, and Shinji muttered a comment about Asuka's back being so woodenly straight that he could iron clothes on it. This drew the fury of the Second Child, who immediately smacked him in the back of the head and complained in a loud voice about the repulsive feeling that his hair left on her hand. Shinji, who was temporarily at a loss for things to say, called a truce until they boarded the train. The old man on his left side snored loudly and shifted position so that he was nearly leaning on the Third Child, who leaned toward Asuka in a domino-like fashion.  
他们一路争吵到了 NERV。明日香告诉真嗣他应该挺直腰板走路，真嗣小声嘀咕说明日香的背挺得那么直，他都可以在上面熨衣服了。这话激怒了二号机驾驶员，她立刻拍了下他的后脑勺，大声抱怨他头发留在手上的那种讨厌感觉。真嗣一时语塞，只好提议在登上列车前休战。他左边的老头大声打鼾，还挪了挪位置，几乎靠在了三号机驾驶员身上，后者则像多米诺骨牌一样倒向了明日香。

"ECCHI! GET AWAY FROM ME!"  
"色狼！离我远点！""

She pushed Shinji away with all the strength she had. That force not only knocked Shinji back where he belonged, it knocked him off his chair—along with the old man who had been peacefully sleeping.  
她用尽全力将真嗣推开。那股力量不仅将真嗣推回到了他该在的位置，还把他连同那位正安详入睡的老人一起从椅子上掀了下来。

"S-s-sorry..." Shinji groaned, awkwardly climbing off of the old man and clutching Misato's pancakes to his chest with one hand.  
“对-对-对不起……”真嗣呻吟着，尴尬地从老人身上爬起，一手紧抱着美里做的煎饼。

"Damn kids," the man grumbled. A moment later he was asleep again.  
“该死的小鬼。”老人嘟囔着。不一会儿他又睡着了。

"You're staining your shirt," Asuka pointed out.  
"你把衬衫弄脏了，" 明日香指出。

Shinji let out a groan as he lifted up Misato's pancakes and noticed that the grease had indeed left a large oily stain on his shirt. A young child who had watched the whole escapade pointed at him and laughed. The Third Child shrank inwardly into his seat.  
真嗣发出一声呻吟，他提起美里做的煎饼，注意到油脂确实在他衬衫上留下了一大块油渍。一个目睹了整个过程的小孩指着他大笑。第三适格者内心退缩，蜷缩在座位上。

"She probably wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for us," Asuka muttered out of the corner of her mouth. Shinji looked up, surprised at the unexpected support.  
"如果不是我们，她可能早就没命了，" 明日香从嘴角低声嘀咕。真嗣抬头，对这突如其来的支持感到惊讶。

Fifteen minutes later they tumbled out of the train and made their way to the Geofront, where Ritsuko was waiting. Her eyes came to rest on the dark spot on Shinji's shirt; Shinji, feeling compelled to say something, quickly asked, "Shall we go change into our plugsuits?"  
十五分钟后，他们从火车上跌跌撞撞地下来，前往地底都市 Geofront，那里丽津子已经在等候。她的目光停留在真嗣衬衫上的深色污渍上；真嗣感到有必要说些什么，便迅速问道：“我们是不是该去换上插入栓服了？”

"Not yet," Ritsuko said, and Maya gently shifted her sitting position.  
“还不行，”丽津子说，而玛雅轻轻调整了自己的坐姿。

"Where's Misato?" Asuka asked. "Isn't she coming home today?"  
“美里呢？”明日香问道，“她今天不回家吗？”

Ritsuko hesitated for a moment. "No, she's not."  
律子犹豫了一下。“不，她不在。”

Shinji's heart sank. 真嗣的心沉了下去。

"As a matter of fact, that's what I need to speak to you about. Major Katsuragi may not be 'coming home' for quite a while," Ritsuko explained, and waited for a moment to gauge the expression of the pilots. Shinji simply looked heartbroken, while Asuka appeared shocked. "Therefore... we need to place the two of you with a temporary guardian until she is healthy enough to return."  
“事实上，这就是我需要和你谈的事情。葛城少校可能‘回家’还需要一段时间，”律子解释道，并等待片刻观察驾驶员们的表情。真嗣显得心碎，而明日香则震惊不已。“因此……我们需要为你们俩安排一个临时监护人，直到她身体恢复到能够回来为止。”

_Until_, Shinji's brain reminded him. _Not If. That means she'll be okay_.  
直到，真嗣的大脑提醒他。不是如果。这意味着她会没事的。

Asuka mulled over this for a while. "Who?"  
明日香沉思了一会儿。“谁？”

Ritsuko made a jabbing gesture over her shoulder. "Maya."  
律子用手指戳了戳自己的肩膀。“真耶。”

"What do you mean I can't go home today?!"  
"你什么意思，我今天不能回家了？！"

Namika sighed and drew the blanket back over her indignant patient. "Really, Misato, you're worse than some of the children I've had to treat. Look—the sooner you get better, the sooner you can go home."  
奈美香叹了口气，又将毯子盖回她那愤愤不平的病人身上。“真的，美里，你比一些我治疗过的孩子还要难缠。听着——你越快好起来，就能越早回家。”

"What about Shinji and Asuka?"  
"那真嗣和明日香呢？"

"They're being relocated."  
"他们正在被迁移。"

"_Relocated?!_" "迁移？！"

"Calm down!" Namika studied the panel of jagged green lines, a definite frown settling in on her face. "I promise you, Ritsuko won't put them anywhere that you wouldn't approve of. And you three can go back to living on beer and instant food as soon as you're up to it."  
"冷静点！" 纳米卡仔细研究着那块布满参差不齐绿线的面板，脸上明显露出了忧虑的表情。"我向你保证，律子不会把他们安置在你不同意的地方。而且你们三个很快就能恢复到喝啤酒吃速食的生活了。"

"Relocated... like Eva units," Misato growled. Namika ignored the comment and handed her a pill. "What's that?"  
"像 EVA 机体一样被调动了，" 美里低吼道。七美无视了这句话，递给她一颗药丸。"这是什么？"

"Chemotherapy." "化疗药物。"

"Oh."

She took it with a glass of water while Namika watched.  
她用水吞下了药丸，而七美在一旁看着。

"Do you want the Geofront TV on?" she asked quietly, trying to be as understanding as she could. "At least you'll be able to see them."  
"你想打开地底都市的电视吗？" 她轻声问道，尽力表现出理解。"至少你能看到他们。"

"And have them see me in this condition? Hell no." Misato sighed and almost choked back a tear. "This is so frustrating. I want to be home with Shinji and Asuka and Pen-pen. I'm sorry I spent so much time drunk and neglecting them when I had the time."  
"让他们看到我这副样子？绝对不行。" 美里叹了口气，差点哽咽。"这太让人沮丧了。我想回家和真嗣、明日香还有企鹅 Pen-pen 在一起。对不起，我之前浪费了那么多时间酗酒，忽视了他们。"

Shigeru poked his head in at that moment, breaking the spell. "Dr. Ishiyama? Shinji sent these down for Misato. He said that they were for breakfast, and that he was sorry they were a bit late, and that he was also sorry they were rather squashed."  
这时，四郎探头进来，打破了沉默。"石山博士？真嗣让送这些给美里。他说这是早餐，抱歉送得有点晚，而且也抱歉它们有点压扁了。"

Misato had to smile at Shinji's thoughtfulness. Namika, however, looked thoughtful. "Shigeru, may I see that?"  
"美里不得不对真嗣的体贴报以微笑。然而，娜美卡却显得若有所思。“茂，我能看看那个吗？””

He handed her the greasy napkin with a bow. The doctor untied the simple knot and the soft fragrance of buttered pancakes drifted out. Misato inhaled deeply and closed her eyes, almost imagining that she was back home. She was snapped back into reality when Namika stood up—with the pancakes—and made no effort to give them to her.  
"他鞠了一躬，将那张油腻的餐巾递给她。医生解开简单的结，一股黄油煎饼的柔和香气飘散开来。美里深吸一口气，闭上眼睛，几乎以为自己回到了家乡。当娜美卡站起来——带着煎饼——并没有打算把它们给她的意图时，她被拉回了现实。”

"Sorry, Misato, but this really isn't the sort of thing you should be eating now," Namika told her quietly. The look of disappointment on the Major's face was almost too much for her to bear and she turned away. "I'll bring you something to read in a few minutes...to...take away some of the boredom."  
"“对不起，美里，但这真的不是你现在应该吃的东西，”娜美卡平静地告诉她。少校脸上的失望表情几乎让她难以承受，她转过身去。“我一会儿给你带些书来……以……驱散一些无聊。””

But Misato was already facing the opposite wall, not meeting her gaze.  
但美里已经转向了对面墙壁，没有与她对视。

"Yes, with Maya," Ritsuko said sternly, since Maya's cheeks were beginning to color after Asuka loudly voiced her disagreements.  
“是的，和玛雅一起，”律子严肃地说道，因为玛雅的脸颊在明日香大声表达反对后开始泛红。

"That's ridiculous! Shinji and I have gotten along fine plenty of times in the past without Misato! Right, Shinji?"  
“这太荒谬了！我和真嗣过去很多次没有美里也相处得很好！对吧，真嗣？”

Shinji thought of what had happened that morning. "Well—"  
真嗣回想起那天早上的事情。“嗯——”

Asuka kicked him. "Point is, we don't need a guardian to look after us! Besides, why hasn't Wondergirl been assigned one all this time?"  
明日香踢了他一脚。“关键是，我们不需要监护人来照顾我们！再说了，为什么绫波这么久都没有被分配一个监护人？”

"Go ask The Commander about that," Ritsuko returned coldly. Maya's cheeks were nearly flaming by now, and she looked as if she would like nothing better than to run and hide under the desk. "We'll only be running one sync test today. After that, you'll be heading back to Misato's apartment to pack up whatever you need for an unlimited stay at Maya's house."  
“去问司令吧，”律子冷冷地回道。此时，美里的脸颊几乎要烧起来了，她看起来恨不得立刻钻到桌子底下躲起来。“今天我们只进行一次同步测试。之后，你们要回美里公寓收拾好需要的东西，无限期住在美里家里。”

"This is ridiculous," Asuka growled.  
"这太荒唐了," 明日香咆哮道。

But it didn't really sink in until she came out of the LCL-filled plug and saw two large trucks waiting outside of the Geofront, each with the NERV logo splashed across their sides.  
但直到她从充满 LCL 的插入栓中出来，看到地表外停着两辆大卡车，每辆车的侧面都醒目地印着 NERV 的标志，她才真正意识到这一点。

"Does it look like enough to bring all your things?" Ritsuko came up behind her with a cup of coffee. "Go on, get in, they'll drive you over back to Misato's and over to Maya's after you load them up."  
"看起来足够搬走你所有的东西了吗？" 律子拿着一杯咖啡走到她身后。"快点，上车吧，他们会先送你回美里那里，然后再去真希波那儿，等你把东西装好。"

"Fine. But I'm not sitting next to that baka." Asuka surveyed the two trucks and chose the one to her right. "You take that one." She jabbed a finger to the left.  
“好吧。但我不会坐在那个笨蛋旁边。”明日香环视了两辆卡车，选择了右边的那个。“你坐那辆。”她用手指向左边。

Shinji sighed resignedly and climbed into the passenger's seat.  
真嗣无奈地叹了口气，爬上了副驾驶座。

Maya came to Ritsuko's side. "Do you really think it will work out, Sempai?"  
玛雅走到律子身边。“前辈，你真的认为这会成功吗？”

"Oh, I expect so." "哦，我想是的。"

"NERV has provided extra beds and furniture," Ritsuko informed them. Her voice came blaring out of the speakerphone, occasionally resulting in a high-pitched squeal. "So all you need are your clothes and any personal items."  
"NERV 已经提供了额外的床铺和家具，" 律子通过扬声器告诉他们。她的声音从扬声器中轰鸣而出，偶尔会产生高音尖叫。"所以你们只需要带上衣服和个人物品。"

Shinji surveyed his room and couldn't imagine what he needed to bring. His entire wardrobe filled up only one cardboard box—and that was with his SDAT and school materials added. _I wonder what Maya's home looks like_? The Third Child picked up his box and exited his room.  
真嗣环视了一下自己的房间，无法想象还需要带些什么。他的整个衣橱只装满了一个纸箱——而且这还是加上了他的 SDAT 和学校用品的情况下。我想知道玛雅的家是什么样子的？第三适格者拿起他的箱子，走出了房间。

It was his turn to be shocked.  
轮到他震惊了。

He couldn't quite make it out of his room. Several dozen large cardboard boxes had been stacked between his room and the apartment door. From behind them he heard Asuka's voice, no doubt directing the agents to carry her boxes out to the truck.  
他几乎无法走出房间。几十个巨大的纸板箱堆放在他的房间和公寓门之间。从箱子后面，他听到了明日香的声音，毫无疑问是在指挥特工们把她的箱子搬到卡车上。

"Asuka?" he called. “明日香？”他喊道。

"What do you want?" One of the boxes shifted slightly, just enough so that Asuka's angry face peeped out at him.  
"你想要什么？" 其中一个箱子微微移动，刚好让明日香愤怒的脸从缝隙中窥视着他。

"_What_ is all this stuff?!"  
"这都是些什么东西？！"

"Oh, my clothes, my hair things, my books, my school materials, my photo albums from Germany..." Asuka counted them on her fingers. Shinji shifted uncomfortably. "Just sit and wait until they finish loading! It won't take _that_ long!"  
"哦，我的衣服，我的发饰，我的书，我的学习资料，我在德国的相册……" 明日香用手指一一数着。真嗣不安地挪动了一下。"就坐着等他们装完吧！不会太久的！"

Fifteen minutes later, Asuka's wall had finally disappeared and Shinji crossed the threshold out of Misato's apartment. No agents came to help him, so he carried his box downstairs alone, only to see that the backs of both trucks were shut and secured.  
十五分钟后，Asuka 的墙终于消失了，Shinji 跨出了 Misato 的公寓门槛。没有特工来帮他，他只好独自抱着箱子下楼，却看到两辆卡车的后门都已关闭并锁好。

"B-but..." he stuttered. “但……”他结巴道。

"Sorry, kid," the driver shrugged. "We ran out of room."  
“抱歉，孩子，”司机耸耸肩，“我们没地方了。”

He climbed into the front seat, followed by Pen-pen.  
他爬进前座，企鹅 Pen-pen 紧随其后。

Having no choices left, Shinji sat in the passenger seat with his box on his lap. Being one of those large cardboard boxes originally used to hold a well-sized microwave oven, it blocked most of his view. Consequently the Third Child, who had quite been looking forward to the ride, was unable to see anything and had no idea where they were when the trucks stopped.  
别无选择之下，真嗣坐在副驾驶座上，膝盖上放着他的箱子。这个原本用来装大型微波炉的硬纸板箱挡住了他的大部分视线。因此，一直期待着这次行程的第三适格者无法看到任何东西，当卡车停下来时，他完全不知道他们身处何地。

Maya lived alone in a second-story apartment not far from the Geofront. It was small but cozy, and she liked it that way. The apartment contained five rooms in total—two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a sitting room. She used the spare bedroom only when Ritsuko happened to be working late and stayed overnight at her home (her own house was much farther away) but now that would be Shinji's temporary room. She and Asuka, being the two females, would share her bedroom. NERV had taken care of all expenses for her, and now there were two identical beds squeezed into Maya's tiny bedroom.  
摩耶独自居住在离地表不远的一套二层公寓里。虽然小巧但温馨，她很喜欢这样的环境。公寓共有五个房间——两间卧室、一间浴室、一间厨房和一个起居室。她通常只在律子偶尔加班太晚并留宿时使用备用卧室（她自己的房子要远得多），但现在那里将成为真嗣的临时房间。她和明日香作为两位女性，将共用她的卧室。NERV 已经承担了她所有的费用，现在她的狭小卧室里挤进了两张相同的床。

She had hurried home to tidy things up while the pilots packed, and was now sitting on a faded green couch, sipping tea to calm herself. Her gaze fell on the family heirloom, a china vase her mother had passed down to her only a few weeks before her untimely death. Maya felt a twinge of loneliness and looked away. It would be nice to be living with other human beings again.  
她匆匆赶回家整理一切，而飞行员们则在打包行李，现在正坐在一张褪色的绿色沙发上，啜饮着茶以平复心情。她的目光落在家族传家宝——一个瓷器花瓶上，那是母亲仅在几周前意外去世前传给她的。真嗣感到一阵孤独，移开了视线。再次与人类同住会是一件美好的事。

She heard a faint humming that grew louder and louder before stopping outside her window, followed by the loud demands of the Second Child. Maya opened the door to her balcony and exited, slowly making her way down the stairs.  
她听到一阵微弱的哼唱声越来越响，直到停在她的窗外，紧接着是二号机驾驶员的响亮要求。真嗣打开阳台门走出去，缓缓走下楼梯。

_Please, don't let me have made a mistake in bringing them here_.  
请不要让我在带他们来这里这件事上犯错。

"Hello, Asuka," she smiled. "Can I help you with that?"  
"你好，明日香，" 她微笑着说，"需要我帮忙吗？"

"Nope, I'm fine...where's my room?"  
"不用，我没事...我的房间在哪儿？"

Maya showed her into their room. "Do you mind sharing with me?" she asked tentatively. Asuka let the box fall to the ground with a thud and stated that she didn't mind. But where could she put all her clothes? The remaining space in Maya's closet wouldn't hold twenty percent of her clothing.  
真希波带她进了她们的房间。"你介意和我合住吗？"她试探性地问。明日香让箱子砰的一声落在地上，表示她不介意。但她所有的衣服该放哪儿呢？真希波衣柜里剩下的空间连她衣服的百分之二十都装不下。

Shinji's room, it turned out, was the next best place to put Asuka's things. The remainder of her clothes went into his closet, her hair things in a cabinet under the sink, and her memories of Germany remained in the box beside her pillow. Maya had already tripped over it twice.  
事实证明，真嗣的房间是放置明日香物品的第二佳选择。她剩下的衣服放进了他的衣柜，她的发饰放在洗手台下的柜子里，而她对德国的记忆则留在了枕头旁的盒子里。玛雅已经两次被它绊倒了。

She made tea for the pilots, hoping that it would help them settle in. Asuka sat opposing her, and Shinji sat between them. Pen-pen seated himself comfortably on the floor. Maya searched for a topic.  
她为驾驶员们泡了茶，希望这能帮助他们安定下来。明日香坐在她对面，真嗣坐在她们之间。企鹅 Pen-pen 舒适地坐在地板上。玛雅寻找着话题。

"Do... do you like my home?" she asked.  
“你……你喜欢我的家吗？”她问道。

"It's very nice," Shinji commented, as if he were forced to say so.  
"非常不错，" 真嗣评论道，仿佛是被迫这么说似的。

Asuka considered the question. "It's not as big or as homelike as Misato's apartment," she said thoughtfully, and took a deep sip of tea. "But it's very cozy...and I like the color of the walls. Especially the blue of our room."  
明日香思考了一下这个问题。"没有美里小姐的公寓那么大，也没有那么温馨，"她若有所思地说，并深深地喝了一口茶。"但是非常舒适……而且我喜欢墙的颜色。特别是我们房间的蓝色。"

Maya smiled, relieved. She'd especially liked the fact that Asuka had commented on her walls. Unknown to her comrades at NERV, she loved color and had each room done in a different shade. Her own room was blue, while Shinji's was green. The bathroom curtains, towels, and rug came in varying shades of pink and red.  
玛雅笑了，松了一口气。她特别高兴明日香提到了她的墙。她的战友们不知道，她非常喜欢色彩，每个房间都涂成了不同的色调。她自己的房间是蓝色的，而真嗣的房间是绿色的。浴室的窗帘、毛巾和地毯则是各种深浅不一的粉色和红色。

She smiled all through the evening, exceptionally happy that things had worked out nicely. Shinji helped her cook, and she was delighted to learn of several new techniques and recipes from him. Asuka remained in her room studying, explaining that she had to earn a one hundred on her next science test. Conversations were civil all through dinner. Ritsuko called around ten and Maya, beaming with excitement, told her the good news and invited her over the next day. The doctor readily agreed, since they were not expected at NERV tomorrow—it was Saturday.  
她整个晚上都笑意盈盈，特别高兴事情能顺利解决。真嗣帮她做饭，她欣喜地从他那里学到了几种新技巧和食谱。明日香则留在房间里学习，解释说她必须在下次科学考试中得满分。晚餐期间的对话一直都很和谐。律子大约十点打来电话，摩耶兴奋地告诉她这个好消息，并邀请她明天过来。博士欣然同意，因为他们明天不需要去 NERV——今天是星期六。

Unfortunately, all was due to change the next morning.  
不幸的是，一切将在第二天早上发生变化。

Maya slept late, something she hardly ever did, and was awakened by a heavy textbook landing on her face. The impact instantly started a nosebleed; by the time her eyes were fully open, blood was streaming down her face.  
摩耶睡得很晚，这是她很少有的情况，结果被一本厚重的教科书砸在脸上惊醒。撞击立刻引发了鼻血；当她的眼睛完全睁开时，鲜血已经顺着脸颊流了下来。

"Damn it! Where _is it?_!"  
"该死！在哪儿？！"

Maya looked to her left and saw Asuka bending over a box with her legs slightly apart and throwing things over her shoulder. She ducked from a calculator and crawled over to the side for cover. The clock read 10:43. _Ritsuko will be here any minute,_ Maya thought frantically. Another notebook came sailing her way and she ducked just in time.  
玛雅向左看去，只见明日香双腿微张，弯腰在一个箱子里翻找，随手将东西扔向身后。她躲开一个计算器，爬到一旁躲避。时钟显示 10:43，律子博士随时会到，玛雅焦急地想。又一个笔记本朝她飞来，她及时低头躲过。

"_Ashuka-_!_"_ "明日香——！"

Asuka made a strange movement that consisted of pivoting around the waist but not shifting her legs, so that she could see Maya. The poor girl's shirt was nearly soaked and she looked as if she had been drinking blood. The Second Child's eyes popped wide open before she ran out of the room, muttering something about towels.  
明日香做了一个奇怪的动作，只转动腰部而不移动双腿，以便能看到真希。可怜的女孩衬衫几乎湿透，看起来像是刚喝过血。第二适格者的眼睛瞪得大大的，然后跑出房间，嘴里嘟囔着关于毛巾的事情。

The Third had gotten up before either of the females and seeing that neither was awake (or so he thought), had begun making breakfast. _Surely Maya won't mind if I do a little cooking here; she didn't mind last night, and she actually has a refrigerator complete with vegetables and fruit..._  
第三适格者比两位女性都早起，看到她们似乎都还没醒（至少他是这么认为的），便开始做早餐。真希应该不会介意我在这里做点饭；她昨晚就不介意，而且她这里居然还有冰箱，装满了蔬菜和水果……

Shinji flipped the second omelette onto a plate and began carrying the first two breakfasts toward the coffee table, stepping around the couch where Pen-pen lay fast asleep. At that moment Asuka came racing out of Maya's bedroom, and Shinji had a brief vision of red hair before he was knocked to the floor. Both plates smashed and one sizzling hot omelette landed on Pen-pen's stomach. The penguin let out a shriek and jumped up.  
真嗣将第二份煎蛋卷翻到盘子上，开始端着前两份早餐走向咖啡桌，绕过沙发上熟睡的企鹅潘-潘。就在这时，明日香从真希的卧室冲了出来，真嗣眼前一闪而过红色头发，随即被撞倒在地。两个盘子都摔碎了，一份热腾腾的煎蛋卷落在了潘-潘的肚子上。企鹅发出一声尖叫，跳了起来。

Maya managed to make her way out of her room just in time to see Pen-pen collide with the wooden shelf. Her precious china vase wobbled and fell, shattering on the floor.  
玛雅好不容易从房间里逃出来，正好看到企鹅 Pen-pen 撞上了木架。她珍爱的瓷器花瓶摇摇欲坠，最终摔落在地，碎片四溅。

And that was when Ritsuko strolled in, carrying a sack of oranges.  
就在这时，律子悠闲地走了进来，手里提着一袋橙子。

It occurred to Shinji that he had never seen Maya cry. Worried, angry, and panicked he had witnessed, but not tears. Yet here she sat, salty tears of hurt mingling with the blood, which continued to flow unchecked.  
真嗣突然意识到，他从未见过玛雅哭泣。担心、愤怒、慌张他都目睹过，但泪水从未出现。然而此刻，她坐在那里，受伤的泪水与不断流淌的鲜血混合在一起，无助地流淌。

Ritsuko helped her to her feet and got her to the bathroom, closing the door behind her and leaving Asuka, Shinji, and Pen-pen outside. The penguin found some comfort in eating up the remains of the omelettes and Shinji busied himself with sweeping up the broken pieces of the vase. He hadn't known how much sentimental value it held for Maya, but now that it was gone he felt dreadfully guilty for his part in breaking it. Shinji sneaked a glance at Asuka. She had been watching him, but quickly looked away.  
律子扶她起身，带她到浴室，关上门，留下明日香、真嗣和企鹅在外面。企鹅找到了些安慰，吃掉了剩下的煎蛋，而真嗣则忙着清扫花瓶的碎片。他不知道这对摩耶有多大的情感价值，但现在它碎了，他感到非常内疚。真嗣偷偷瞥了明日香一眼。她一直在看着他，但很快移开了视线。

_At least you have something to do_, Asuka thought. Her hands were fumbling with each other, itching to find something with which to occupy themselves. Right now she was unneeded, and she couldn't see Maya ever wanting them inside her home again. The redhead crossed her legs, an uneasy expression coming over her face as she thought that Maya would certainly kick them out.  
至少你有事可做，明日香心想。她的手在互相摸索，渴望找到点什么来打发时间。现在她无所事事，也看不出摩耶还会再让他们进她家。红发女孩交叉双腿，脸上露出不安的表情，想着摩耶肯定会把他们赶出去。

In the next room, Ritsuko kept the water running while Maya mopped unenthusiastically at her face.  
在隔壁房间，律子让水一直流着，而摩耶无精打采地擦着脸。

"Do you think you can deal with them until we find another temporary home?" she asked.  
"你觉得你能应付他们直到我们找到另一个临时住所吗？" 她问道。

"Y-you're going to move them?"  
"你-你要搬走他们？"

"Well, it doesn't particularly look like this is the best place for them ... or you, for that matter. Imagine if this happened during an Angel attack. We can't take such risks," Ritsuko told her quietly. Maya nodded imperceptibly and whispered an apology.  
"嗯，这里看起来并不特别适合他们...或者你，就此而言。想象一下如果这种情况发生在使徒攻击期间。我们不能冒这种险，" 律子平静地告诉她。玛雅微微点头，低声道歉。

"Don't apologize," Ritsuko told her firmly. "And we'll keep this incident from the Major, all right?"  
"别道歉，" 律子坚定地对她说。"我们不会让真希波知道这件事的，好吗？"

Maya nodded again. Ritsuko hugged her and stepped outside. Maya looked up in the mirror, hating the blotchiness of her face. As nice as it would be to live in peace, she would miss the one day of company she had spent with the pilots. The thought of the vase crept into her mind, and she strangled a sob in the towel. What was worse that she had failed in two of her most important duties: respecting the wishes of her long-gone mother, and protecting the interests of NERV.  
玛雅再次点头。律子拥抱了她，然后走了出去。玛雅对着镜子抬头，厌恶自己脸上的红斑。尽管平静地生活很美好，但她会怀念与驾驶员们共度的那一天。想到那个花瓶，她的思绪涌入脑海，她在毛巾中压抑住一声呜咽。更糟糕的是，她未能履行两项最重要的职责：尊重已故母亲的意愿，以及保护 NERV 的利益。

Makoto offered to take them—a little too eagerly, Ritsuko thought, as she put down the phone. She had thought she'd heard a side comment from Shigeru about impressing Misato, but wasn't sure. Two teenagers and a penguin—no problem, Makoto had insisted. Bring them over anytime.  
真琴主动提出带他们去——有点过于热情了，律子放下电话时想道。她记得似乎听到过四郎对美里印象的侧面评论，但不太确定。两个青少年和一只企鹅——没问题，真琴坚持说。随时带他们过来。

She went to visit Misato, whose spirits were quite low.  
她去拜访了美里，她的情绪相当低落。

The Major was flipping through channels, alternating between live news and pre-Second-Impact movies. A yellowing copy of Daphne duMaurier's _Rebecca_ lay on her bedside table, next to her cell phone. Ritsuko noted from the positioning of her bookmark that she had read through a good part of it.  
少校正在切换频道，交替观看实时新闻和第二次冲击前的老电影。一本泛黄的达芙妮·杜穆里埃的《蝴蝶梦》躺在她的床头柜上，旁边是她的手机。从书签的位置来看，律子注意到她已经读了不少。

"The world never changes, does it?" Misato sighed, turning off the news and lying back across her bed. "Robbery, murder, corruption the like. How depressing."  
“世界从未改变，是吧？”美里叹了口气，关掉新闻，躺回床上。“抢劫、谋杀、腐败，诸如此类。真令人沮丧。”

She looked away from Ritsuko's face and glanced out the window, where sunlight was streaming in—but didn't quite reach her bedside.  
她从律子的脸上移开视线，望向窗外，阳光正倾泻而入——却未能触及她的床边。

"How're Shinji and Asuka?" she asked.  
“真嗣和明日香怎么样了？”她问道。

"They're fine. They're moving in with Hyuga tomorrow."  
“他们很好。明天就要搬去和日向一起住了。”

"Really? I thought the plan was Maya."  
真的吗？我以为计划是让真希波来。

Ritsuko hesitated. "It changed...without reason."  
律子犹豫了一下。“计划变了……没有理由。”

Misato chuckled. "That's just like Commander Ikari. I'm not surprised."  
"美里轻笑道：“那很像碇司令的风格。我并不意外。”

Ritsuko was relieved that Misato hadn't guessed the actual reason, and did not bother to defend The Commander. "How's Miki treating you?"  
律子松了一口气，因为美里没有猜到真正的原因，也没有费心为指挥官辩护。“美里，米基对你怎么样？”

"She took away my pancakes," Misato grumbled, suddenly grumpy again, "and replaced it with this damn thing." She picked morosely at the IV running into her left arm.  
“她拿走了我的煎饼，”美里咕哝着，突然又变得暴躁起来，“还用这该死的东西替换了。”她忧郁地拨弄着插进左臂的静脉注射管。

"I'm sorry about that." “对此我感到抱歉。”

There was a pause in which both attempted to find something to say.  
两人都试图找些话来说，一时间陷入了沉默。

"Have you talked to Kaji recently?"  
“你最近和加持谈过吗？”

Ritsuko scowled. "Not since Namika and I had to kick him out of your room."  
律子皱了皱眉。“自从我和美里不得不把他从你房间赶出去后，就没再联系了。”

"He has a NERV card, so he can get in here pretty much anytime he wants. The only things between him and me are you and Miki."  
"他有 NERV 的通行证，所以基本上他想什么时候进来都可以。唯一挡在他和我之间的，就只有你和美纪。"

"And we're stronger than any locked door," Ritsuko proclaimed, drawing a small smile from Misato.  
""而我们比任何上锁的门都要强大，""律子宣称，这让美里露出了淡淡的微笑。

Pause. 停顿。

"Hey Ritsuko?" "嘿，律子？"

"Mmhmm?" "嗯哼？"

"When do you think I can go home?"  
"你觉得我什么时候能回家？"

Ritsuko hesitated. Technically, Misato could go home anytime now—for only a short period—and she'd have to inject herself everyday with interferon, which would get rid of her leukemic symptoms and replace them with flu-like effects ("Wonderful tradeoff, isn't it," Misato had replied sardonically). The trouble was that there was no one at home to take care of her. Shinji would be busy with school and NERV duties, and neither of the doctors favored leaving her with the Second. The best place, Namika kept arguing, was where she was now, where the doctors could keep a constant eye on her. Miki took care of all the shots herself.  
律子犹豫了一下。从技术上讲，美里现在就可以回家——只是短暂的时间——并且她需要每天给自己注射干扰素，这会消除她的白血病症状，取而代之的是类似流感的副作用（“真是美妙的交换，不是吗？”美里讽刺地回答）。问题在于家里没有人能照顾她。真嗣要忙于学校和 NERV 的职责，而且两位医生都不赞成把她交给二号。直子一直主张，最好的地方就是她现在所在的地方，医生们可以随时关注她。美纪亲自负责所有的注射。

"I don't know," she replied finally. "But I'll arrange for Asuka and Shinji and Rei to stop by after they finish testing once in awhile."  
"我不知道，"她最终回答道，"但我会安排明日香、真嗣和绫波偶尔在测试结束后过来看看。"

"All right." "好的。"

Misato picked up her copy of _Rebecca_ and read for some time while Ritsuko perused the latest data in a chair beside her. Less than fifteen minutes had passed before Misato drifted calmly off to sleep. Gently, Ritsuko removed the book from her hands, replaced the bookmark, and left the room.  
美里拿起她的《丽贝卡》读了一会儿，而律子则坐在她旁边的椅子上浏览最新数据。不到十五分钟，美里就平静地睡着了。轻轻地，律子从她手中取走书，放回书签，然后离开了房间。

When Misato woke hours later, there was a large glass vase of brilliantly colored flowers beside her and a card pressed under it, with her name machine-printed on the envelope. She wondered who would have bothered to hide his or her identity so carefully. The yellow lilies wafted their sweet scent toward her, and she took the time to bend one down to her nose before fumbling for the card. The envelope was unsealed.  
当美里几小时后醒来时，她身边有一个装满绚丽花朵的大花瓶，还有一张卡片压在下面，信封上用机器打印着她的名字。她好奇谁会如此费心地隐藏自己的身份。黄色的百合花散发着甜香，她花时间弯下一朵凑近鼻子闻了闻，然后摸索着找那张卡片。信封没有封口。

_Missed you— 想你了——_

Followed by a scribbled signature that was imprinted in Misato's mind.  
紧接着是潦草的签名，深深印在美里心中。

The Major slid down in bed and pressed the letter against her chest, tears leaking out of the corners of her eyes.  
少校滑进被窝，将信紧贴胸口，泪水从眼角渗出。

She wondered how he'd managed to evade Ritsuko and Namika yet again.  
她好奇他是如何再次避开理津子和波美香的。

"Is all that stuff really hers, or does some of it belong to the penguin?" Makoto asked, staring wide-eyed at the two truckloads. "There's no way all of this is going to fit in my apartment."  
“那些东西真的都是她的吗，还是有些属于企鹅？”真看着两卡车的物品，瞪大了眼睛问道，“我公寓里可放不下这么多东西。”

His place was even smaller than Maya's, and he'd made a credible effort to clean up what seemed like years' worth of laundry and food stains on the carpet. Ritsuko had surveyed the apartment ahead of time and decided that his bedroom—the _only_ bedroom—would belong to Asuka. He and Shinji could share the main room. She drove the extra bed over from Maya's herself.  
他的住处比摩耶的还要小，他费了很大劲才清理掉地毯上看似积年累月的衣物和食物污渍。理津子事先检查了公寓，决定把唯一的卧室给明日香住。他和真嗣可以共用主房间。她亲自从摩耶那里把多余的床搬了过来。

"It's...all...hers..." Shigeru ground out as he climbed the last few steps, balancing a large box between his hands.  
"这...全是...她的..." 斯格鲁一边说着，一边攀上最后几级台阶，双手之间稳稳地托着一个大箱子。

Ritsuko left the two men in the apartment and stepped onto the balcony. Looking down from twenty-one stories up, the Second Child simply resembled a large ball of fire.  
律子离开了公寓里的两个男人，走到阳台上。从二十一层楼向下望去，第二适格者简直就像一团巨大的火焰。

"Asuka," she called loudly. The girl tipped her head back to look up. "You can't bring all that stuff up here!"  
"明日香，"她大声喊道。女孩抬起头来向上看。"你不能把这些东西都搬上来！"

"Why not? I—" "为什么不呢？我——"

The rest of her words were carried away by the wind, which blew shut the balcony door behind her. Ritsuko waited for it to die down before shouting, "There isn't enough room!"  
她的话语被风带走，风还顺手关上了阳台的门。赤木律子等风势减弱后才喊道：“空间不够！”

The wind started up again. The doctor sighed and whirled around, banging on the door. Makoto opened it for her. Some time later she arrived at the bottom of the building and ordered the agents to put down their boxes where they lay.  
风再次刮起。医生叹了口气，转身用力敲门。真希波为她开了门。不久后，她到达楼底，命令特工们将箱子就地放下。

"Asuka, there's barely enough room up there for three people, let alone all your boxes. Ninety percent of this is going to have to go. You can travel back to Misato's to get whatever you want anytime, but all of this stuff is ridiculous."  
"明日香，那里几乎连三个人的空间都不够，更别提你所有的箱子了。这些东西百分之九十都得留下。你可以随时回美里那里取你想要的东西，但这些玩意儿实在是太多了。"

Asuka growled and considered. The German souvenirs ended up going back, as did three quarters of her wardrobe. Still, that left seven hefty boxes to be carried up. Shinji, who had to carry only his box and Pen-pen's belongings (which consisted of his food bowl and a few cans of beer), was already on his way up. Ritsuko had agreed to bring over Pen-pen's refrigerator, since he had not liked the night on Maya's couch.  
明日香咆哮了一声，考虑了一下。那些德国纪念品最终还是被放回了原处，她的衣橱也减少了四分之三。即便如此，还是有七个大箱子需要搬上去。真嗣只带着自己的箱子和企鹅 Pen-pen 的物品（包括它的食盆和几罐啤酒），已经先行上楼了。律子同意把 Pen-pen 的冰箱也搬过来，因为它不喜欢在摩耶的沙发上过夜。

"Hi, Hyuga-san," Shinji ventured nervously.  
"你好，日向先生，" 真嗣有些紧张地开口道。

"Hey, welcome to my home." Makoto spread his arms wide in a beckoning gesture. "Just clothes and stuff in there?"  
“嘿，欢迎来到我家。”真琴张开双臂，做出邀请的手势。“就只是衣服和东西在那边吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

Clothing became an issue again. As usual, Asuka's wardrobe (even trimmed down as it was) took up Makoto's entire closet. He and Shinji, finally deciding that they really didn't care if their clothes were wrinkled, decided to use cardboard boxes for the time being. Besides, it would save Shinji from having to unpack. They chose to place Pen-pen's food bowl in the kitchen.  
衣物问题再次浮现。一如既往，明日香的衣服（即便已经精简过）占据了真琴整个衣柜。他和真嗣最终决定，他们真的不在乎衣服是否皱巴巴，于是暂时用纸箱来存放。此外，这还能让真嗣免于拆包。他们选择将 Pen-pen 的食盆放在厨房。

It was dark by the time they were all fed and settled in. Shigeru and Ritsuko had stayed for dinner, and were getting ready to head back to their respective homes.  
等到大家都吃饱安顿下来时，天已经黑了。四郎和律子留下来吃了晚饭，正准备各自回家。

"Watch out for yourself," the doctor cautioned Makoto as she slipped her shoes on. "We don't want a reoccurrence of what happened to Maya."  
"小心点，"医生提醒真琴穿鞋时说，"我们不想再发生像摩耶那样的事。"

"Hai!" Makoto saluted proudly. "We will be fine."  
"是！"真琴自豪地敬了个礼，"我们会没事的。"

Ritsuko smiled and followed Shigeru out.  
律子微笑着跟着茂出去了。

Shinji took the bed at Makoto's insistence, and the technician took the couch. Within moments he was fast asleep, but the Third Child lay wide awake with his hands folded behind his head.  
在真琴的坚持下，真嗣睡在了床上，而技术员则睡在了沙发上。不一会儿，技术员就沉沉睡去，但第三适格者却双手枕在脑后，睁大眼睛毫无睡意。

_Another unfamiliar ceiling_, he thought gloomily. He flipped over onto his side and another thought occurred to him.  
又是陌生的天花板，他忧郁地想。他翻了个身，又冒出一个念头。

_This bed smells like Asuka's shampoo.  
这床闻起来有明日香洗发水的味道。_

"Do you really think he's all right?" Maya asked.  
"你真的觉得他没事吗？" 玛雅问道。

"Well, no one's heard from him since Saturday..." Ritsuko bent over to look at the screen and frowned at what she saw. "Although I'm sure Shinji would have called if something happened."  
"嗯，从上周六起就没人联系上他了……" 律子弯下腰查看屏幕，皱着眉头看着所见的内容。"不过我相信如果有什么事，真嗣会打电话来的。"

"He's quite late." "他迟到很久了。"

"I know." _I should've called him this morning to check that he was still alive,_ Ritsuko thought.  
"我知道。" 我今早本该打电话给他确认他还活着，律子想。

Several minutes passed before Makoto Hyuga pushed open the door and sank heavily into his chair. Ritsuko noticed deep, dark circles under both eyes. There was a "hmph" from behind her, and she turned to see that the Second and Third Children were glaring daggers at each other.  
几分钟后，碇真嗣推开门，重重地坐进椅子里。律子注意到他双眼下有着深深的黑眼圈。她身后传来一声"哼"，转身一看，发现第二和第三适格者正互相怒目而视。

"Are you getting along all right?" Ritsuko asked the technician.  
"你们相处得还好吗？" 律子问技术员。

"Yeah, yeah, yeah we're fine, we're—we're good."  
“是是是，我们没事，我们——我们很好。”

Ritsuko raised her eyebrows.  
律子挑了挑眉。

Makoto blushed and quickly looked away, focusing on his computer panel. _Ah damn it... what does this mean again?_ He rubbed his eyes and stared harder.  
真琴脸红了，迅速移开视线，专注于他的电脑面板。啊该死……这又是什么意思？他揉了揉眼睛，更加用力地盯着看。

"Having trouble playing the Major's part?" Shigeru reached over and tapped the appropriate keys. The red screen disappeared.  
"扮演司令的角色有困难吗？" 斯格鲁走到一旁，敲击了相应的按键。红色的屏幕消失了。

"... no...well...you could say that..."  
"...不...嗯...可以这么说..."

Ritsuko frowned and looked at The Commander's seat, today occupied by Fuyutsuki.  
律子皱了皱眉，看向指挥官的座位，今天由副司令官服部坐在那里。

_Something is wrong_, she thought. _Something's going to happen._  
她心想，有些不对劲。要发生什么事了。

"You _are_ sure it's here, right?"  
“你确定是在这里，对吧？”

"Well... I've never come here while being fully conscious..."  
“嗯……我从未在完全清醒的状态下来过这里……”

"Baka!" Asuka punched him. Shinji went flying into a door, which promptly rattled under his weight and set off a blaring alarm.  
"笨蛋！" 明日香一拳打向他。真嗣飞向一扇门，门在他重压下立刻颤动起来，并触发了刺耳的警报声。

"Damn..." "该死..."

Shinji sighed. He and Asuka continued making their way through the complicated hallways, the former rubbing the back of his head painfully. They rounded a corner and spotted a young brunette striding down the hallway. Her high heels clicked sharply over the sound of the alarm and the bottom of her white lab coat swished over her legs.  
真嗣叹了口气。他和明日香继续穿过复杂的走廊，前者痛苦地揉着后脑勺。他们转过一个拐角，看到一位年轻的棕发女子大步走在走廊上。她的高跟鞋在警报声中发出清脆的响声，白色实验服的下摆在她腿上飘动。

"Excuse me," Shinji whimpered, "where's the entrance to the hospital?"  
"打扰一下，" 真嗣颤声问道，"医院入口在哪里？"

She blinked. "This way." 她眨了眨眼。"这边。"

They followed her for some distance before Asuka unplugged her ears long enough to ask the woman to shut off the alarm. She explained that that couldn't be done until the source of infiltration had been discovered, and Shinji quickly volunteered that information. Several minutes later all was silent, save for her heels.  
他们跟着她走了一段距离，直到明日香拔下耳机，足够长时间地询问那位女士关闭警报。她解释说，必须先找到入侵源头才能关闭警报，于是真嗣迅速提供了这一信息。几分钟后，除了她的高跟鞋声，一切都安静了下来。

"Who is she?" Asuka whispered to Shinji.  
“她是谁？”明日香低声问真嗣。

"I don't know..." The doors slid open to admit them.  
"我不知道..." 门滑开了，让他们进入。

There was no reception desk. After all, people did not call in to arrange an appointment here. Asuka looked around curiously, but Shinji kept following the brunette lady, not quite sure how she knew where they were headed—or if she did at all.  
这里没有接待台。毕竟，人们不会打电话来预约这里。明日香好奇地四处张望，但真嗣一直跟着那位棕发女士，不太确定她怎么知道他们要去哪里——或者她是否真的知道。

"She's in here." She held the door wide open, and Shinji heard someone cough.  
"她在这儿。" 她把门大大地打开，真嗣听到有人咳嗽。

"What is it, Miki?" “怎么了，美纪？”

Asuka hesitated. Shinji placed a hand on her shoulder (this was the one time he wouldn't be killed for doing so) and gently steered her into the room.  
明日香犹豫了一下。真嗣把手放在她的肩膀上（这是唯一一次他这么做不会被杀），温柔地引导她进入房间。

Author's Notes: Hm... I really have nothing to say. Drop me and review and tell me how I'm doing.  
作者笔记：嗯……我真的没什么可说的。给我留言，告诉我做得怎么样。

### Chapter 3: adjusting ii  
第三章：适应篇 二  

Author's Note: Hi guys – since it's been so long; I decided to add a short note in here as a reminder of what happened at the end of Chapter 2 – Asuka and Shinji are on their way to visit Misato in the hospital. After a series of small mishaps, they've finally arrived at her room.  
作者的话：大家好——因为已经过去很久了；我决定在这里加一个简短的说明，提醒一下第二章结尾发生了什么——明日香和真嗣正在前往医院探望美里。经过一系列小插曲，他们终于到达了她的病房。

Edit: I didn't find out until today that quickedit had deleted all of my original dividers, so the story must have been really confusing - hopefully this clears it up!  
编辑：直到今天我才发现，快速编辑删除了我所有的原始分隔符，所以故事一定非常混乱——希望这能澄清！

---

She was crying. _Perhaps out of frustration,_ Shinji thought. He sincerely hoped it wasn't out of pain. But she put on a genuine smile when Asuka and Shinji stepped into her room.  
她在哭泣。也许是因为沮丧，真嗣这样想。他真诚地希望不是因为疼痛。但当明日香和真嗣走进她的房间时，她露出了一个真心的微笑。

"Hey, Misato," Shinji took the first step, selecting the chair Ritsuko had sat on a few days ago. Asuka took a seat next to him and managed to keep her face impassive.  
“嘿，美里，”真嗣率先迈出一步，选择了几天前律子坐过的那把椅子。明日香坐在他旁边，努力保持面无表情。

"Hey guys." Misato smiled wanly and sat up, but it was obvious that she was blinking back tears that had been threatening to spill down her cheeks. Her hair was a mess.  
“嘿，大家。”美里虚弱地笑了笑，坐起身来，但很明显她在眨眼试图忍住即将滑落脸颊的泪水。她的头发凌乱不堪。

_She doesn't look so good_, Asuka thought miserably.  
她看起来不太好，明日香痛苦地想。

"So...so how do you guys like living with Hyuga-san?"  
“那么……你们和日向先生一起住得怎么样？”

"It's pretty nice," Shinji remarked. "Although a lot more crowded."  
“挺不错的，”真嗣评论道，“虽然拥挤了不少。”

"He has a nice view of Tokyo-3 from his window," Asuka commented. Misato chuckled, surprising them all.  
"从他的窗户可以看到东京-3 的美景，" 明日香评论道。美里轻声笑了出来，让大家都感到意外。

"Is he still living on the 22nd floor?" she asked. The pilots nodded. "Last year we threw a surprise birthday party for Maya at his house. I got awfully drunk and almost fell off the balcony," she recalled with a crooked grin. "Haven't been back there since. I expect he's afraid to invite me over now."  
"他还住在 22 楼吗？" 她问道。驾驶员们点了点头。"去年我们在他家为摩耶办了个惊喜生日派对。我喝得烂醉，差点从阳台上摔下去，" 她带着歪斜的笑容回忆道。"从那以后就没再去过。我想他现在都不敢邀请我去了。"

The conversation died abruptly. She fingered her hair slowly, as if she were afraid to touch it. Shinji watched, perplexed, until a long strand suddenly gave way and fell onto the white covers.  
对话突然中断了。她慢慢地拨弄着头发，仿佛害怕触碰它们。真嗣困惑地看着，直到一根长长的发丝突然断裂，落在了白色的被单上。

Asuka gasped involuntarily and immediately regretted it. Misato's eyes welled up with tears and they spilled unchecked down her cheeks. She folded her legs and hugged her knees to her chest, burying her face in her blanket. Asuka and Shinji exchanged a concerned glance as their guardian wept helplessly, more strands of hair falling out from her movement.  
明日香不由自主地倒吸了一口气，随即后悔了。美里眼中涌出泪水，顺着脸颊肆意流淌。她蜷起双腿，紧紧抱住膝盖，将脸埋进毯子里。明日香和真嗣交换了一个关切的眼神，看着他们的监护人无助地哭泣，更多的发丝随着她的动作脱落。

"I haven't been able to brush it in a long time," he heard her say, her voice muffled in the blanket. "It just all keeps falling out..."  
“我已经很久没梳过头发了，”他听到她闷在毯子里的声音说，“它就一直不停地掉……”

They let her cry herself out.  
他们让她哭了个够。

"So, how's school—"Misato tipped her head to the side and coughed. "—going?"  
"那么，学校——"美里歪着头咳嗽了一声。"——怎么样？"

"I got a one hundred on my literature test," Asuka said promptly, pleased at the change of topic.  
"我的文学测试得了满分，"明日香立刻回答，对话题的转变感到高兴。"

"Excellent – and you, Shinji?"  
"太好了——你呢，真嗣？"

"I got..." Shinji sighed. "I got an eighty-nine..."  
"我得了..." 真嗣叹了口气。"我得了八十九分..."

Misato waited for the blow to come, almost wanting it—it would be like being home again with her two charges arguing as usual—but it didn't come. Asuka was watching her and made no response to Shinji's low grade.  
美里等待着打击的到来，几乎渴望着——那会像回到家里，和她的两个孩子像往常一样争吵——但打击并未到来。明日香看着她，对真嗣的低分没有任何反应。

She smiled bracingly. "That's still a good score."  
她鼓励地笑了笑。"那还是个不错的分数。"

Silence again. 再次陷入沉默。

Misato hated it. No one knew what to say, and worst of all, they were all avoiding her eyes. She hated that Asuka hated to see her like this, with her hair falling out and her arm purpled from the damn IV line, even if it wasn't her fault. She hated that Shinji was hovering over her, looking so damn helpless, even if he had sent her that damned stack of pancakes which Namika had thrown away, damn it. She hated her body for betraying her when NERV needed her. When she needed herself.  
美里讨厌这种氛围。没人知道该说什么，更糟糕的是，他们都避开了她的目光。她讨厌明日香看到她这副模样时的厌恶，头发脱落，手臂因那该死的静脉注射而发紫，即便这不是她的错。她讨厌真嗣在她身边徘徊，显得如此无助，尽管他送来的那叠该死的煎饼被南美扔掉了，该死。她讨厌自己的身体在 NERV 需要她时背叛了她。在她需要自己的时候。

She shifted position, and another clump of purple hair gave way.  
她换了姿势，又有一簇紫色的头发脱落了。

Shinji started towards her. "Maybe you should try—"  
真嗣朝她走去。“也许你应该试试——”

"I don't need your help," she muttered coldly. Shinji retreated as if she had slapped him. "I'm not going to die, damn it! So quit treating me LIKE I AM!"  
“我不需要你的帮助，”她冷冷地嘟囔着。真嗣退缩了，仿佛被她扇了一巴掌。“我不会死的，该死！所以别再把我当成那样对待了！”

Shinji backed away as Misato, having finally lost it, grasped the lamp by its slender metal stem and hurled it with considerable strength. Asuka ducked into the squashy couch as stained glass smashed at her feet. The cell phone went flying next and barely missed Shinji's left ear.  
真嗣后退着，美里终于失控了，她抓住那细长的金属灯柱，用力扔了出去。明日香躲进了软绵绵的沙发里，彩绘玻璃在她脚边碎裂。手机紧接着飞了出去，险些擦过真嗣的左耳。

"I'm _not_ going to die, damn it—!"  
"我不会死的，该死——！"

When finally every item within her reach lay in pieces on the floor, Misato stilled, still breathing deeply, her face flushed. She could not bear to face her young charges, wondering what they must think of her now. A baby cried in another room and she briefly regretted waking it up, though she couldn't imagine why there was a baby in NERV's hospital.  
当她终于将手边所有东西都砸得粉碎，碎片散落一地时，美里才停了下来，依旧喘着粗气，脸颊通红。她无法面对她的年轻孩子们，不知道他们现在会怎么想她。另一个房间里传来婴儿的哭声，她短暂地后悔吵醒了那孩子，尽管她想不通为什么 NERV 的医院里会有婴儿。

Asuka remained sitting on the couch, her legs pulled up beneath her as to avoid being hit by anything. She had unfolded some now, her arms resting down by her side. She stared not at Misato's face, but at her collarbone. It was too uncomfortable to even consider looking at her guardian's face. She chanced a glance at Shinji.  
明日香依旧坐在沙发上，双腿蜷缩在身下以避免被任何东西击中。她的手臂现在放了下来，垂在身体两侧。她没有盯着美里的脸，而是盯着她的锁骨。连看一眼监护人的脸都让她感到太不舒服了。她瞥了一眼真嗣。

_Should I start cleaning up?_ Shinji thought. He had never seen Misato in such a state and didn't know how she would react.  
我应该开始清理吗？真嗣心想。他从未见过美里如此状态，不知道她会有何反应。

The silence held for some time.  
沉默持续了一段时间。

"I'm sorry," Misato whispered at last, not looking at them.  
“对不起，”美里最终低声说道，没有看向他们。

Neither responded initially. But when Misato raised her head to face them, Shinji was already on his knees, cleaning up the broken glass. A moment later Asuka joined him, plucking up the pieces of the cell phone and refitting them together. Misato watched guiltily, wishing she could get down and help them. She said nothing, and they did the same.  
两人起初都没有回应。但当美里抬起头面对他们时，真嗣已经跪在地上清理碎玻璃了。片刻后，明日香也加入了他的行列，捡起手机碎片并试图拼凑起来。美里内疚地看着，希望自己也能下去帮忙。她什么也没说，他们也一样。

Shinji winced and rocked back on his heels, and both females leaned over to see what was going on. The Third had sliced his finger on a piece of glass and squeezed the cut tightly with his free hand.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，向后退了一步，两位女性都俯身查看发生了什么。第三适格者被一片玻璃划伤了手指，用另一只手紧紧捏住伤口。

"Here... I'll get a bandage," Asuka offered genuinely, and hurried out of the room.  
“这里……我去拿个绷带。”明日香真诚地提议，并匆匆离开了房间。

When Asuka was gone, Misato tried again. "I'm sorry, Shinji."  
当明日香离开后，美里再次尝试。“对不起，真嗣。”

He smiled at her, a simple gesture that meant the world to her. "It's all right. Don't be sorry... we all need to vent at times. There have been times when I was angry at you too."  
他向她微笑，一个简单的举动对她来说意义重大。“没关系。别道歉……我们有时都需要发泄。我也曾对你生气过。”

_But you were justified—most of the time, anyway,_ Misato thought, but she was touched that he had not added anything of the sort to his last sentence. She reached out to touch his shoulder as he continued to clean despite the bleeding. "Don't do that, Shinji, you'll get dust into your cut. And—"  
但你大多时候是有道理的，美里心想，但她感动于他没有在最后一句话中加上这样的内容。她伸出手触碰他的肩膀，尽管他在流血，仍在继续打扫。“别这样，真嗣，灰尘会进到你的伤口里。而且——”

He waited for her to finish as she swallowed.  
他等她吞咽完毕。

"Thanks," she said quietly, "for everything you've done for me. You—and Asuka."  
“谢谢，”她轻声说道，“感谢你为我所做的一切。你——还有明日香。”

Both were smiling again when Asuka reappeared in the room. Shinji took it from her with a soft "thank you" and attempted to apply it himself, but had trouble managing both sides of the adhesive strip. Asuka did it for him and quickly turned back to her task while Shinji swept the pieces into the trash.  
当明日香再次出现在房间里时，两人都重新露出了笑容。真嗣从她手中接过东西，轻声说了句“谢谢”，并试图自己贴上，但很难同时处理好胶带的两边。明日香帮他贴好，然后迅速转回去做自己的事，而真嗣则将碎片扫进垃圾桶。

"I think it's working now," she remarked thoughtfully, concentrating intensely on the illuminated screen of Misato's cell phone. A moment later it gave off its trademark start-up ring and all three cheered.  
"我想现在应该修好了，"她若有所思地说道，全神贯注地盯着美里手机上发光的屏幕。片刻后，手机响起了标志性的启动铃声，三人都欢呼起来。

"Thanks, Asuka," Misato said gratefully. "I'm sure Miki will be just _completely_ delighted to see what I've done to this room..."  
"谢谢你，明日香，"美里感激地说。"我相信三上看到我对这个房间的改造会非常高兴的……"

"I'm sure NERV can afford another table lamp," Asuka assured her unconcernedly, absentmindedly giving her hair a classic little shrug over the shoulder. Misato watched her longingly and Asuka turned away, feeling her face flush. _That was a stupid thing to do_. "Or we could always bring you one from home, since no one's living there right now."  
"我敢肯定 NERV 能再买一个台灯，"明日香不以为意地安慰道，心不在焉地用经典的动作将头发甩到肩后。美里深情地看着她，明日香转过身去，感到脸颊发烫。那样做真傻。"或者我们可以从家里给你带一个过来，反正现在没人住。"

"Oh, I don't think it'll come to that," Misato said hopefully. Then she glanced over their shoulders and smiled. "Hey, Rei."  
"哦，我觉得不至于到那一步，" 美里满怀希望地说道。随后她瞥了一眼他们的身后，微笑着打招呼："嘿，绫波。"

Shinji and Asuka both jumped, wondering how long she had been watching them. The First Child stood casually in the doorway, her hands hanging at her sides, but her eyes were alert.  
真嗣和明日香都吓了一跳，不知道她已经观察他们多久了。第一适格者随意地站在门口，双手垂在身侧，但她的眼神却十分警觉。

"Hello, Major Katsuragi," she greeted, nodding slightly before turning her attention to the pilots. "Dr. Akagi requests that Pilots Ikari and Sorhyu return to the Geofront."  
"您好，葛城少校，" 她微微点头致意，随后将注意力转向两位驾驶员。"赤木博士要求碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷两位驾驶员返回地底都市。"

"See you," Misato waved morosely, as they hurried out the door. Rei remained standing, no doubt waiting for permission to leave. But Misato didn't feel like giving her any.  
"再见," 美里无精打采地挥了挥手，他们匆匆离开了门口。丽依旧站在那里，无疑是在等待离开的许可。但美里此刻并不想给她任何指示。

"Did Ritsuko say she wanted you back in the Geofront too, Rei?"  
"赤木博士有说让你也回地底都市吗，丽？"

"No," Rei admitted. "没有，" 丽承认道。

"Well then, do you want to sit down and talk to me for awhile?" Misato asked, summoning what she hoped was her cheeriest voice. She gestured toward the sofa that Asuka had previously occupied. "Don't worry, if Ritsuko gets angry I'll clear it up for you."  
"那么，你想坐下来和我聊一会儿吗？" 美里问道，尽力用她希望是最欢快的声音。她指向阿斯卡之前坐过的沙发。"别担心，如果律子生气了，我会帮你解释清楚的。"

"I will stay," Rei agreed, then hesitated. "...if you would like me to."  
"我会留下，" 丽同意道，然后犹豫了一下。"...如果你希望我留下的话。"

"Well, I do," Misato insisted, so Rei sat down. "I still haven't gotten around to thanking for telling Shinji and Asuka the news."  
"嗯，我确实希望，" 美里坚持说，于是丽坐了下来。"我还没来得及感谢你告诉真嗣和阿斯卡这个消息。"

"It was my duty," she replied simply. Rei sat with her hands folded in her lap and her legs together, both feet resting on the floor. Misato apologized for the lack of lighting and asked if she would mind pulling the curtains aside. Rei simply nodded and did as she was asked. Not wanting the conversation to die out, Misato asked another question.  
"这是我的职责，"她简单地回答。丽坐在那里，双手叠放在膝上，双腿并拢，双脚平放在地板上。美里为光线不足道歉，并询问她是否介意拉开窗帘。丽只是点点头，照做了。不想让对话中断，美里又问了一个问题。

"How's school? How are you doing in your classes?"  
"学校怎么样？你的课程进展如何？"

"I am doing fine; I have 99s or 98s in all my classes," Rei said calmly. Then a flush crept into her cheeks and she looked away quickly as she said it. "But I prefer gym class the most."  
"我一切都好；我的所有课程都拿到了 99 分或 98 分，"丽平静地说道。随后，她的脸颊泛起红晕，迅速移开视线补充道，"但我最喜欢体育课。"

"You do, huh? Asuka's told me you're quite a swimmer."  
"你确实会游泳，是吧？明日香跟我说过，你游泳很厉害。"

"Does she really think so?" Rei asked, before she could stop herself. Her eyes widened as if she expected Misato to slap her. _It was not my place to say that_. Instinctively she turned away.  
"她真的这么认为吗？" 绫波脱口而出，随即意识到自己的失言。她的眼睛睁大了，仿佛预料到美里会给她一巴掌。这不是我该说的话。她本能地转过身去。"

"Of course she does," Misato told her fiercely.  
"当然是的，" 美里坚定地告诉她。"

The First Child thought this over. "I... I have never been complimented by Pilot Sorhyu," she said at last, a pink blush blooming over her white cheeks. "I did not know..." Her voice trailed off. She looked as if she had caught herself saying too much, and Misato gently corrected her.  
第一适格者沉思片刻。“我……我从未被索尔修飞行员称赞过，”她终于说道，白皙的脸颊上泛起一抹粉红。“我不知道……”她的声音渐渐低了下去。她看起来像是意识到自己说得太多了，而美里温柔地纠正了她。

"Don't be embarrassed in front of me, Rei... I know we've hardly ever talked in the past, but still... if you ever want to talk about something, I'm here. And I would really appreciate it if you stopped in from time to time, when you're not busy or anything, if you don't mind talking to me..."  
“在我面前别害羞，绫波……我知道我们过去几乎没有交谈过，但即便如此……如果你有什么想聊的，我随时都在。如果你不介意的话，希望你能在不忙的时候偶尔来坐坐，和我聊聊……”

_I'm babbling,_ Misato thought.  
我在胡言乱语，美里心想。

"I would like that very much."  
"我非常愿意。"

"Sorry, what was that?" "抱歉，你说什么？"

"I would like that very much," Rei repeated, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.  
"我非常愿意，" 丽重复道，嘴角微微上扬，露出一丝淡淡的微笑。"

Misato opened her mouth to reply, but at that minute the room darkened substantially—to the point where she could barely to see Rei's face. She sat up quickly and looked out the open window. She could see nothing.  
美里张口欲答，但就在那一刻，房间突然变得异常昏暗——以至于她几乎看不清绫波的脸。她迅速坐起身，望向敞开的窗户。外面一片漆黑，什么也看不见。

_That can't be a raincloud_, she thought.  
那不可能是乌云，她心想。

Rei was already on her feet, hurrying to the window, but Namika blocked her path by throwing open the door.  
绫波已经站起身，快步走向窗户，但娜美卡却抢先一步，猛地推开门挡住了她的去路。

"Rei—Ritsuko wants you down there now."  
"丽——律子让你现在就下去。"

Rei nodded and dashed off. Since Misato had smashed the remote control (although Namika didn't quite know that yet), the doctor was forced to turn on the TV by using the buttons positioned at the base of the screen. It flashed to life, providing a live picture of what was going on at NERV. Misato caught a glimpse of a large sphere suspended in the sky, embellished with black and white strips.  
丽点点头，匆匆离开。由于美里已经把遥控器砸坏了（虽然奈美还不完全知道这一点），医生不得不使用屏幕底部的按钮来打开电视。屏幕亮起，实时显示了 NERV 内部的情况。美里瞥见一个巨大的球体悬浮在空中，装饰着黑白条纹。

"It'll take five minutes to evacuate the West Quarter," someone announced. Namika turned the volume up, pumping the button emphatically for maximum effect. "Target advancing slowly... at 2.5 km an hour."  
"疏散西区需要五分钟，""有人宣布。奈美调高音量，用力按下按钮以达到最大效果。""目标缓慢前进……以每小时 2.5 公里的速度。""

"TURN IT DOWN!" Misato yelled, covering her ears. Everyone in the Geofront turned to look at her. "Erm... sorry...what's going on? The observation center of Mt. Fuji...?"  
"调小声点！" 美里喊道，捂住耳朵。地底都市的每个人都转头看向她。"呃...抱歉...发生什么事了？富士山观测中心...？"

"It didn't detect anything," Shigeru reported. "It suddenly reported right above."  
"那里没有检测到任何东西，" 四郎报告说，"它突然出现在正上方。"

"Pattern orange. AT field not detected," Makoto added.  
"橙色模式。未检测到 AT 力场，" 诚补充道。"

"Orange? What does that mean?" Misato asked, just as Ritsuko voiced the same thought—"Is this a new type of Angel?"  
“橙色？这是什么意思？”美里问道，与此同时，律子也表达了同样的疑问——“这是新型的使徒吗？”

"MAGI is withholding its decision," Maya said quietly.  
“MAGI 尚未作出决定，”玛雅轻声说道。

Misato was not liking this viewpoint. She could see Maya clearly, part of Shigeru, and only the back of Makoto's chair. Ritsuko was clearly visible, standing behind the technicians' chairs. But she could not see any of the MAGI's many panels and screens.  
美里对这个视角并不满意。她能清楚地看到玛雅，她是与四郎的一部分，还有真希波椅子的背面。律子则清晰可见，站在技术人员的椅子后面。但她却看不到 MAGI 众多面板和屏幕中的任何一个。

"Great, what a wonderful time for Commander Ikari to be absent," she muttered sarcastically. "Shinji? Asuka? Rei? Can you hear me?"  
"真是太好了，在这个时候碇司令居然不在，" 她讽刺地嘀咕着。"真嗣？明日香？丽？能听到我说话吗？"

Static, then three matched replies.  
一阵静电声后，三人的回应同时传来。

"Yes ma'am." "是的，女士。"

Misato continued to direct the operation as if she were in the Geofront herself. Her own location made no difference now; however, her first words were to Ritsuko, asking her to move the camera so that she could have a better view.  
美里继续像亲临地底都市一样指挥着行动。她所在的位置现在已无关紧要；然而，她的第一句话是对律子说的，让她调整摄像头以便自己能看得更清楚。

"Target data is being sent to you," Misato told the pilots, examining Maya's work on the screen. "As of now, that's all we know. Approach carefully and watch how it reacts—and if you can, lure it away from the city."  
“目标数据正在发送给你们，”美里对驾驶员们说，同时审视着屏幕上真希的工作。“目前我们只知道这些。谨慎接近，观察它的反应——如果可能的话，把它引离城市。”

"Shinji, you'll be going first?"  
“真嗣，你先上吗？”

"What?!" "什么？！"

"Well, in any case, it's a job for a man of good record, daring, and the one with the highest sync ratio. Or do you have no confidence, Shin-chan?"  
"无论如何，这是一份需要良好记录、勇敢且同步率最高的人来完成的任务。还是说，你没信心，真嗣君？"

"I'm ready!" Shinji yelled indignantly. "I'll—I'll set a good example!"  
"我准备好了！"" 真嗣愤愤地喊道，""我会——我会树立一个好榜样！"

"Hey guys..." Misato muttered, not wanting to hear an argument. But Shinji was already on his way. Asuka announced that Unit 02 would backup. Rei followed with a similar statement.  
“嘿，伙计们……”美里喃喃道，不想听到争吵。但真嗣已经动身了。明日香宣布零二号机将进行支援。绫波也做出了类似的声明。

There was a long pause in which everyone held their breath, watching the Evas snake their way silently through the maze of Tokyo-3's buildings. Eva 01 clutched its gun closely, flattening itself as best as possible against a building. The power cord dragged behind while the sphere continued to loom ominously in the sky.  
长时间的沉默中，每个人都屏住呼吸，注视着 EVA 们悄无声息地穿过东京-3 错综复杂的建筑群。零一号机紧握着枪，尽可能地紧贴着一栋建筑。电源线拖在后面，而那个球体继续在天空中阴森地逼近。

Misato heard Shinji's voice, low and urgent. "Ayanami, Asuka, are you in position?"  
美里听到真嗣低沉而急切的声音。“绫波，明日香，你们到位了吗？”

"Not yet," Rei muttered, darting across a street to a safer spot.  
“还没呢，”丽低声嘟囔着，疾步穿过街道，躲到一个更安全的地方。

"I can't move that fast," Asuka groaned, and moved a few steps further. Her power cord got caught around a building and promptly snapped. "Damn..."  
“我可没那么快，”明日香呻吟道，又挪了几步。她的电源线缠在了建筑物上，随即啪的一声断了。“该死……”

The massive hands of Eva 02 plucked up the spare cord and plugged it into its back. With that done, Asuka looked up and saw the striped sphere moving slowly.  
Eva 02 那巨大的手掌拾起备用电源线，插入了自己的背部。完成这一切后，明日香抬头望去，只见那个条纹球体正缓缓移动。

_It's not doing anything... yet...  
它还没开始行动...但..._

From her room, Misato watched worriedly. She did not hear Shinji speaking to himself, but every NERV employee jumped when Evangelion Unit 01 unexpectedly leaped in front of the buildings and fired at the sphere, which instantly faded from sight.  
在房间里，美里忧心忡忡地看着。她没有听到真嗣自言自语，但当零号机意外地跃到建筑物前并向球体开火时，所有 NERV 的员工都吓了一跳，那球体瞬间消失不见了。

"It vanished!" Ritsuko shouted.  
“它消失了！”律子大喊道。

"Pattern blue!" Makoto reported. "It's an angel—and it's right below Unit 01!"  
“蓝色模式！”真嗣报告道，“是个天使——就在初号机正下方！”

---

It took a moment for Makoto's words to register in Shinji's mind. He had hesitated temporarily when the sphere disappeared, lowering his gun.  
真嗣的话过了一会儿才在真治的脑海中回响起来。当球体消失时，他短暂地犹豫了一下，放低了枪。

Then he saw the shadow, a black void ready to swallow him.  
接着他看到了那个影子，一个准备吞噬他的黑色虚空。

"A shadow?! Hey—HEY! What's this?!"  
"影子？！嘿——嘿！这是什么？！"

Eva 01 stepped backwards and fired into the shadow.  
Eva 01 向后退了一步，向影子开火。

Shinji was screaming, terrified as his bullets disappeared into the dark abyss. His own voice drowned out Misato's "Run, Shinji-kun, get out of there!" even as Asuka's "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" reverberated around the inside of the plug.  
真嗣尖叫着，子弹消失在黑暗深渊中，他的恐惧让他的声音盖过了美里"快跑，真嗣君，离开那里！"的呼喊，而明日香"你在干什么？！"的回声在插入栓内回荡。

"MISATO!" Shinji screamed. "WHAT'S HAPPENING? MISATO! ASUKA—ASUKA! AYANAMI! HELP ME! MISATO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?! MISATO!"  
"美里！" 真嗣尖叫道。"发生了什么？美里！明日香——明日香！绫波！救救我！美里，你能听到我吗？！美里！"

Despite knowing it was useless, Shinji continued to fire out of fright, watching helplessly as the blackness enveloped him.  
尽管知道这是徒劳的，真嗣还是因为恐惧而继续开火，无助地看着黑暗吞噬了他。

---

"Eject the plug!" Misato shouted. Shinji's screaming of her name had left her shivering in dread of what the next few minutes would bring. Each scream cut into her like a sharp blade and she drew the blanket tighter around her shoulders, resisting the urge to plug her ears.  
"弹出插入栓！" 美里大喊。真嗣呼喊她的名字让她因即将到来的几分钟而颤抖不已。每一声尖叫都像锋利的刀刃刺入她的心，她将毯子紧紧裹在肩上，强忍着堵住耳朵的冲动。

"No use! It's not responding!" Maya cried.  
“没用的！它没反应！”真嗣喊道。

Shinji's screams continued to fill her hospital room—and then all was silent.  
真嗣的尖叫声继续充斥着她的病房——然后一切归于寂静。

He was gone. 他走了。

"ASUKA! REI! Rescue Unit 01!" Misato shouted. "And hurry!"  
“明日香！丽！救援 01 号机！”美里大喊。“快点！”

---

Asuka had watched in shock as Shinji disappeared into the angel, temporarily in a daze. Now she recovered quickly, feeling both angry and terrified.  
明日香震惊地看着真嗣消失在使徒体内，一时失神。现在她迅速恢复过来，既愤怒又恐惧。

"It's not particularly useful if you only get perfects on synchro tests, now is it?" she vented angrily. But in her mind, quietly, she added, _please, Shinji, don't be hurt._  
“同步测试得满分也没什么大用，不是吗？”她生气地发泄道。但在内心深处，她默默祈祷，真嗣，请不要受伤。

Meanwhile, Rei made the mistake of firing at the sphere in the sky.  
与此同时，丽犯了个错误，向天空中的球体开火。

"It vanished again!" Maya exclaimed.  
“它又消失了！”玛雅惊呼道。

"Asuka, be careful!" Ritsuko admonished. "Watch for the shadow!"  
“明日香，小心！”律子告诫道，“注意那影子！”

Eva 02 looked down just in time and managed to mount a building before the darkness swallowed it as well. Asuka dug her weapon into the wall and used it to pull herself up. The blackness continued to spread even as Tokyo-3's buildings took refuge underground.  
Eva 02 及时低头，成功攀上一座建筑，避免了被黑暗吞噬。明日香将武器插入墙中，利用它将自己拉起。黑暗继续蔓延，而第三新东京市的建筑纷纷躲入地下。

"Asuka!" She perked up at the sound of her name, spoken with a mechanically modified voice. "Rei! Withdraw."  
"明日香！" 她听到自己名字被机械改造过的声音叫出，立刻振作起来。"绫波！撤退。"

"Wait—" Asuka had barely begun when Rei made the protest for her.  
"等等——" 明日香刚开口，绫波就替她提出了抗议。

"But Unit 01 and Ikari-kun are still inside," the blue-haired pilot quietly reminded.  
"但零号机和碇君还在里面，"蓝发驾驶员轻声提醒道。

Asuka watched Misato struggle with her decision on a small illuminated panel of the entry plug wall. The Major's hands were balled into fists and they were quivering visibly, though her voice held just the slightest tremor.  
明日香看着美里在插入栓墙壁的小型照明面板前艰难抉择。少校的双手紧握成拳，明显颤抖着，尽管她的声音只带着一丝颤音。

"You're ordered to withdraw."  
"你被命令撤退。"

The girls obeyed. 女孩们服从了。

---

As much as she disliked having the technicians stare curiously at her, Misato convinced Namika to let her go to the Geofront—just for a few hours, she insisted. Ritsuko was exploring the aspects of a possible rescue mission, frequently dashing to the dry-erase board to scribble a few more arrows, and Misato didn't like having to look at it through her TV. Namika wheeled her reluctantly to the Geofront, where she sat behind all the technicians.  
尽管不喜欢技术人员好奇地盯着她看，Misato 还是说服了 Namika 让她去地底城——她坚持只去几个小时。Ritsuko 正在探索可能的救援任务的各个方面，频繁地冲到白板前画上几笔箭头，而 Misato 不喜欢通过电视屏幕看这些。Namika 不情愿地推着她去了地底城，她在那里坐在所有技术人员后面。

"The power cord was disconnected when we pulled it up," Ritsuko explained, "and there is little internal battery power left, but if Shinji doesn't randomly move Eva around—that is, if he remains in life-support mode—he can survive for sixteen hours."  
“我们拔掉电源线时，它被断开了，”Ritsuko 解释道，“而且内部电池电量所剩无几，但如果 Shinji 不随意移动 Eva——也就是说，如果他保持在生命维持模式——他可以存活十六个小时。”

_Sixteen hours_, Misato thought. _What a tiny window of time. And most of that has passed already._  
十六个小时，美里想。多么短暂的时间窗口。而且大部分已经过去了。

She leaned as far forward as she could so that she could speak privately to Maya without disturbing the presentation. "Did the radar pick up anything? Sonar?"  
她尽可能地向前倾身，以便在不打扰演示的情况下私下与真嗣交谈。“雷达有发现什么吗？声纳呢？”

"No, nothing," Maya whispered. Misato leaned back, feeling defeated.  
“没有，什么都没有，”真嗣低声说。美里靠回椅背，感到一阵挫败。

"In other words," Ritsuko continued, and Misato snapped back to attention. "The shadow that swallowed Evangelion Unit 01 is the main part of the angel; it can reach approximately 680 meters in diameter and has a thickness of only 3 nanometers." She sketched for emphasis as she talked. "It sustains that super-thin space with an inverted AT field, with the inside being an imaginary space called 'Dirac's Sea'."  
"换句话说，" 律子继续说道，美里猛地回过神来。"吞噬了初号机的阴影是使徒的主要部分；它的直径大约有 680 米，厚度却仅有 3 纳米。" 她边说边用笔强调着。"它用一个反转的 AT 力场维持着这片超薄空间，内部则是一个被称为'狄拉克之海'的虚数空间。"

"Then what's that sphere in the sky?" Misato asked.  
"那么天上的那个球体是什么？" 美里问道。

"Nothing but a shadow," she replied calmly. "That should disappear when the main body is destroyed."  
"只不过是个影子，" 她平静地回答。"当主体被摧毁时，那个应该就会消失。"

"We have to fight that black shadow?" Asuka wondered aloud, although in an undertone. She and Rei were still wearing their plugsuits, positioned at the very rear of the audience. "How can we target that thing?"  
"我们得对付那个黑色影子吗？" 明日香轻声自语，她和绫波仍穿着插入栓服，站在观众席的最末端。"我们怎么瞄准那东西？"

Ritsuko nodded and laid down her marker with a soft click as it hit the metal stand. The technicians, quickly realizing that the presentation was over, hurried back to their posts.  
律子点点头，轻轻放下手中的标记笔，笔尖触碰金属支架发出细微的咔嗒声。技术人员们迅速意识到演示已经结束，急忙返回各自的岗位。

"The UN has decided to assemble a ground siege," Ritsuko said quietly, coming to sit beside Misato in Maya's now empty chair. "At least the shadow hasn't moved; it's stayed still ever since it reached a diameter of 600 meters." She gazed out the open door where several UN trucks were parked in a row. "I wonder if the ground forces will do any good?"  
"联合国决定集结地面围攻部队，" 律子轻声说道，走到美里身边，坐在真希波空出的椅子上。"至少那影子没有移动；自从它达到 600 米的直径后就一直静止不动。" 她望向门外，几辆联合国卡车整齐地停成一排。"我在想地面部队能起到什么作用？"

Misato didn't reply, tipping her head to the side, so that she could think without facing Ritsuko. Namika took advantage of this to suggest that Misato return to bed.  
美里没有回答，只是将头偏向一侧，这样她就可以在不面对律子的情况下思考。奈美香趁机建议美里回到床上。

"No, no, I'm fine," Misato protested. "I _need_ to be here, Miki... you don't understand."  
“不，不，我没事，”美里抗议道，“我需要在这里，美纪...你不明白。”

Namika was ready to argue, but Ritsuko stood up.  
奈美香正准备争辩，但律子站了起来。

"I'll look after her, Miki," she said, in an authoritative tone that clearly implied the end of the discussion. Namika opened her mouth and closed it reluctantly. Ritsuko was, after all, her superior. She looked at Misato hesitantly.  
"我会照顾她的，美纪，"她用一种不容置疑的语气说道，显然意味着讨论到此为止。美香张了张嘴，又无奈地闭上了。毕竟，律子是她的上司。她犹豫地看向美里。

"Please, Miki," Misato begged, as if she were a child asking to stay up just one more hour. "I'll be fine."  
"求你了，美纪，"美里恳求道，仿佛是个孩子请求再多玩一个小时。"我会没事的。"

Namika gave in. "But," she insisted, directing her comment toward Ritsuko, "I want her back in bed...as soon as this operation is over."  
美香妥协了。"但是，"她坚持道，目光转向律子，"我希望她手术一结束就回床上休息。

Ritsuko met her gaze squarely. "She will be."  
律子直视着她的目光。“她会的。”

She nodded. There was nothing else to be said, although she was still not satisfied. Namika turned and walked away.  
她点了点头。已经无话可说，尽管她仍未感到满意。美香转身离去。

---

Asuka watched the helicopters warily circle the sphere with sinking feelings that ranged from "it's not going to work to "what will happen to Shinji?" She moved aside to clear the path for a UN truck and asked a technician for the time. Eight twenty-six PM. It was already dark outside. _And Shinji... Shinji will..._  
明日香警惕地看着直升机围绕球体盘旋，心中涌起从“这不会成功的”到“真嗣会怎么样？”的种种不安。她退到一旁为联合国卡车让路，并向一名技术人员询问时间。晚上八点二十六分。外面已经天黑了。而真嗣……真嗣将会……

_It's all his fault for ignoring the plan and acting on his own_, she thought angrily. But really, that wasn't what she was angry with him for. Perhaps she wasn't even angry with _him_—she was angry with herself, for letting him worry her. And then there was Misato, looking frail as could be, with what was left of her tousled purple hair tangled and untamed. It was still hard for her to accept Misato's situation—_strange, really_, she thought, _since I was the one who realized it first._  
她气愤地想，这一切都是因为他无视计划擅自行动。但说真的，她生气的并不是这个。或许她甚至不是在生他的气——她是在生自己的气，因为让他担心了自己。而美里，看起来虚弱得不得了，她那凌乱的紫色头发剩下的部分纠结而未驯服。她仍然很难接受美里的状况——真是奇怪，她想，毕竟是我最先意识到的。

She turned to see Rei standing a short distance behind her, watching the UN's attempted siege in silence. Only the faintest glance out of the corner of her red eyes revealed that she knew Asuka was watching her.  
她转身看到丽站在她身后不远处，默默地观察着联合国试图的围攻。只有从她红色眼睛的角落里投来的最微弱的目光表明，她知道明日香在看着她。

Rei had not spoken to the Major since she had hurried out to the Geofront, and she did not try to do so now as Dr. Akagi made her way outside.  
自从丽匆忙离开前往地底都市后，她就没有和少校说过话，现在当赤木博士走向外面时，她也没有试图这样做。

"...it's the only way that may be possible," she heard the doctor saying. "Dropping all existing 992 N-2 bombs into its center. Taking time into account and letting the two AT-field protected Evas infiltrate the imaginary space for only one millisecond. Focusing the explosive power and destroying both angel and Dirac's Sea."  
"...这是唯一可能的方法，"她听到医生说。"将所有现有的 992 枚 N-2 炸弹投放到其中心。考虑到时间，让两台 AT 力场保护的 Eva 潜入虚数空间仅一毫秒。集中爆炸力，摧毁使徒和狄拉克之海。"

_But Ikari-kun! 但是碇君！_

The Major shared this thought. "But we don't know what will happen to Shinji!"  
少校也有同样的想法。"但我们不知道这会对真嗣造成什么影响！"

Dr. Akagi did not meet either of their eyes as she spoke. "Recovering the body of Unit 01 is the top priority in this operation. It may be badly damaged, but it'll be okay..."  
赤木博士说话时并未与他们中的任何一人对视。“回收 01 号机是本次行动的首要任务。它可能严重受损，但会没事的……”

Rei had never felt such dislike for anyone as she did for the blonde doctor at that moment. In three wide strides the shy, quiet pilot of Evangelion Unit 00 crossed the asphalt and stood head to head with Dr. Akagi.  
绫波从未对任何人有过如此强烈的反感，那一刻，她对那位金发博士的厌恶达到了顶点。这位害羞、安静的 00 号机驾驶员大步流星地穿过柏油路面，与赤木博士面对面站立。

_I have promised to protect Ikari-kun. I will keep that promise_.  
我承诺过要保护碇君。我会遵守这个承诺。

"Yes?" Ritsuko asked, raising an irritated eyebrow.  
"什么事？" 律子皱着眉问道，语气中带着不悦。

"You cannot do this," Rei stormed angrily, a pink flush creeping into her white cheeks. "You cannot destroy Ikari-kun just like that."  
"你不能这样做，" 丽愤怒地喊道，白皙的脸颊上泛起了粉红。"你不能就这样毁了碇君。"

"Yeah, Ritsuko," Misato edged into the conversation to take Rei's side. "I don't quite think..."  
"是啊，律子，" 美里插话进来，站在丽的一边。"我不太认为..."

"The condition of the pilot can't be taken into account in this situation," Ritsuko said coldly.  
“在这种状况下，无法考虑驾驶员的身体状况。”律子冷冷地说道。

Rei said nothing more, only kept her red-eyed glare evenly focused on Dr. Akagi's harsh face. Neither seemed willing to back down, Misato thought, glancing from one to the other, a wave of pride welling up within her at the thought of Rei standing up for Shinji.  
绫波没有再多说什么，只是将她那双红眼睛的目光牢牢锁定在赤木博士严厉的脸上。两人似乎都不愿意退让，美里从一旁看着她们，心中涌起一股自豪感，因为绫波在为真嗣挺身而出。

Ritsuko broke the contact by plainly ignoring Rei. "Misato, I'll be commanding everything in this operation. Trust me." She left, brushing the pilot aside.  
律子打破了僵局，直接无视了绫波。“美里，这次行动将由我全权指挥。相信我。”她说完便离开了，把驾驶员晾在了一边。

"Rei," Misato whispered. But Rei did not turn to look at her. It was Makoto who broke the spell.  
"丽," 美里低声呼唤。但丽并未回头看她。是真琴打破了这魔咒。

"The entry plug's backup power has reached its theoretical limit!" the technician shouted, whirling around to face Misato and Ritsuko, who stood in the doorway. Several panels flashed red and reflected their light in his glasses.  
"插入栓的备用电源已达到理论极限！" 技术员大喊，转身面对站在门口的美里和律子。几个面板闪烁着红光，反射在他的眼镜上。

Maya added, "The plug suit's life support system has almost reached the danger zone." She turned to look at Ritsuko, her eyes wide and filled with fear. "Sempai..."  
玛雅补充道，"插入栓服的生命维持系统已接近危险区域。"她转向律子，眼中满是恐惧。"前辈..."

"Let's move up the schedule twelve minutes then, while there's a chance that Shinji's still alive," Ritsuko ordered, without looking at her assistant. She had not noticed Rei wheeling Misato back into the building until they were almost by her side. "Asuka – Rei! Go get in position and wait for further instructions."  
"让我们把计划提前十二分钟，趁现在还有机会碇君可能还活着，" 律子命令道，没有看她的助手一眼。直到他们几乎走到她身边，她才注意到绫波推着美里回到了大楼。"明日香——绫波！去就位等待进一步指示。"

"Thanks," Misato whispered, but it was not clear to whom she was speaking.  
"谢谢，" 美里低声说，但并不清楚她在对谁说话。

---

Evangelion Unit 02 was crouching as close to the angel as her pilot dared. Despite having four eyes in her Eva, Asuka was having problems seeing in the dark and flickered on a light before quickly shutting it off. The angel had not moved.  
福音战士二号机蹲得离天使尽可能近，这是她的驾驶员敢做到的极限。尽管二号机有四只眼睛，但明日香在黑暗中仍难以看清，她打开了一盏灯，随即又迅速关闭。天使没有动。

"Hey, Wondergirl," she muttered, "where are you?"  
"嘿，奇迹少女，" 她喃喃自语，"你在哪儿？"

Rei's head appeared temporarily in a corner of the entry plug. "Approximately one hundred meters due east of the angel."  
零的头短暂地出现在插入栓的一角。"大约在天使正东一百米处。"

"Get ready to generate the AT-field," Maya announced.  
"准备好生成 AT 力场，" 真希波宣布道。"

Asuka steeled herself, closing her eyes temporarily.  
明日香鼓起勇气，暂时闭上了眼睛。

She was abruptly thrown on her side, gracelessly losing her balance as the ground gave a vicious quaver. Asuka placed a hand on the ground and brought herself back to a standing position with effort.  
她突然被甩到一边，毫无优雅地失去了平衡，地面猛烈地颤动。明日香一手撑地，费力地重新站了起来。

"What was that!?" “那是什么！？”

"Status!" Misato shouted, making an effort to leap out of the chair, but Ritsuko held her back.  
"状态！" 美里喊道，努力从椅子上跳起来，但律子拉住了她。

"I don't know! All the gauges are all off the scale!" Maya cried out.  
"我不知道！所有仪表都超出了刻度！" 真嗣哭喊着。

Ritsuko frowned. "But we haven't done anything..."  
律子皱眉。"但我们什么都没做..."

The speculation left Maya's lips as a whisper, but Ritsuko heard it and bristled. "Impossible! Unit 01 has zero power!"  
猜测从玛雅的唇间轻声逸出，但律子听见了，眉头紧皱。“不可能！初号机已经没有能量了！”

Yet the ground shook again and they watched from the safety of the Geofront while Asuka let out a string of German curses as she was again knocked to the ground. One panel showed the red Evangelion rising back to its feet, while another showed that Eva Unit 00 had also managed to right itself.  
然而地面再次震动，他们从地底都市的安全地带望去，只见明日香再次被击倒，一连串德语咒骂随之响起。一个画面显示红色福音战士重新站起，另一个画面则显示零号机也成功恢复了平衡。

_AT field,_ Asuka thought fiercely, concentrating on the sphere, _AT field_...  
AT 力场，明日香心中坚定地想着，集中精神于那球体，AT 力场……

But her concentration was shattered as the sphere quivered and its white stripes blended into black. Her eyes widened as a bloodied hand exploded out of its side.  
但她的专注被打破，球体颤动，白色条纹融入了黑色。她的眼睛睁大，一只血淋淋的手从侧面爆裂而出。

_Shinji! 真嗣！  
_

---

"_Shinji_-kun!"  "真嗣君！"

"Misato!" Ritsuko shouted, but the Major had already vaulted out of her wheelchair and was running barefoot down toward the silent Evangelion Unit 01.  
"美里！" 律子喊道，但美里少校已经从轮椅上一跃而起，赤脚向着寂静的初号机跑去。

---

_It's over_. 一切都结束了。

His limbs felt as if they were made of lead, and he felt perfectly content to lie back motionlessly and stare at the ceiling while LCL pooled around him. Someone was pounding on the door outside, shouting his name. He chose to ignore it all.  
他的四肢沉重得仿佛灌了铅，他感到无比满足，只想静静地躺着，凝视着天花板，任由 LCL 液体在他周围汇聚。外面有人用力敲门，呼喊着他的名字。他选择无视这一切。

The door burst open and a whoosh of cool air swirled into the entry plug. Someone heaved a cry and threw herself on top of him—_ouch, he thought—_and continued to sob his name, weaving her arms around his neck.  
门猛地被撞开，一股凉风旋即涌入插入栓。有人发出一声惊呼，扑倒在他身上——他心想，真疼——然后继续抽泣着呼唤他的名字，双臂紧紧环住他的脖子。

"Shinji-kun... Shinji-kun..."  
"真嗣君...真嗣君..."

Shinji made the effort to look down and saw purple hair.  
真嗣努力低下头，看到了紫色的头发。

"Misato...?" "美里...？"

He sat up a little, but the Major refused to let go.  
他稍微坐起身，但少校却不肯放手。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"It's okay," he told her softly, helping her up so that she was supporting her own weight. "I'm all right."  
"没事的，"他轻声对她说，扶她起身让她自己支撑体重。"我没事。"

Misato smiled through her tears. "I'm so g-gla-ad—"She started to cough, turning her head to the side. Shinji patted her back, not caring that both of them were soaked with LCL. Her coughing became hacking, more strained.  
美里含泪微笑。"我真——高兴——"她开始咳嗽，转过头去。真嗣拍着她的背，不在乎两人都已被 LCL 浸透。她的咳嗽愈发剧烈，更加费力。

"Sh-h-inji..." "嘘——真嗣..."

"MISATO!" Shinji screamed, plunging waist-deep into the LCL to hold her up.  
"美里小姐！" 真嗣尖叫着，腰部以下浸入 LCL 中，将她托起。

An emergency squad appeared within the minute and lifted the unconscious Major Katsuragi onto a stretcher, her LCL-soaked clothing and hair staining the cloth a rusty orange.  
一队急救人员在一分钟内赶到，将失去意识的美里少校抬上担架，她那浸透 LCL 的衣物和头发将布料染成了锈橙色。

Shinji sat silently in the entry plug, unable to move as the scene unfolded before him.  
真嗣静静地坐在插入栓内，眼前的场景让他动弹不得。

Several stories above him, Ritsuko did the same.  
在他上方几层楼的地方，律子也同样静止不动。

---

Asuka was glad to have Shinji home again. It had been rather uncomfortable sharing an apartment with only Hyuga-san, and she had passed the days by going to school early and finishing her afternoon chores at home quickly before disappearing into her bedroom. She had not expected to miss the Third Child.  
明日香很高兴真嗣又回家了。与只和日向先生同住一个公寓的日子相比，她每天早早去学校，迅速完成下午的家务，然后躲进自己的卧室。她没想到自己会想念第三适格者。

Three days had passed since she had been to NERV. Secondhand reports from Makoto did not reveal much, but she at least had the comforting news that Misato was awake and her condition had stabilized. Shinji had been hospitalized for two nights and released on the third day. Asuka bombarded him with questions about Misato the moment he walked in the door and learned that she seemed to have recovered from the incident, but treatments were not having nearly as much success as the doctors had hoped. But it was Shinji's description of the doctors brushing out her hair that had hit Asuka the hardest. She knew from experience that cleaning LCL out of one's hair was not fun, and she could barely imagine what it must be like for Misato in her current condition.  
自从她上次去 NERV 已经过去三天了。从真希斗那里听来的二手消息并没有透露太多，但她至少得到了一个令人欣慰的消息，那就是美里已经醒来，状况也稳定了。真嗣在医院住了两晚，第三天就出院了。阿斯卡一进门就迫不及待地向真嗣询问美里的情况，得知她似乎已经从那次事件中恢复过来，但治疗效果并没有医生们希望的那么好。但真嗣描述医生为她梳理头发的情景，却让阿斯卡感触最深。她自己有过经验，知道清理 LCL 的头发并不好玩，她几乎无法想象美里现在的情况会是怎样的。

Saturday morning Asuka poked her head out of the bathroom and called, "Shinji, are you done reading the newspapers?"  
周六早上，阿斯卡从浴室探出头来喊道：“真嗣，你看完报纸了吗？”

"Yeah, go ahead and take them."  
“嗯，拿去吧。”

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

She'd tried yesterday to do it herself and failed miserably. Asuka hated more than anything to fail, but at least no one would have to know this time—except for Hikari. The class rep was currently making her way to Makoto Hyuga's apartment by train, quite oblivious of what the redhead expected her to do.  
昨天她尝试自己动手却惨败。明日香最痛恨失败，但至少这次没人会知道——除了光。这位班长正乘火车前往真琴速贺的公寓，对红发少女对她的期望一无所知。

Asuka unfolded each newspaper to its maximum size and spread them thinly over the part of the floor that was positioned directly in front of the sink and mirror. When she could see none of the tiles, Asuka slipped back to her bedroom and returned with a pair of sharp scissors.  
明日香将每份报纸展开至最大尺寸，均匀铺在正对水槽和镜子前的地板上。直到看不见瓷砖，她才悄悄回到卧室，取来一把锋利的剪刀。

Back in the bathroom, the Second Child looked wistfully at her reflection and closed her eyes.  
回到浴室，二号机望着镜中的自己，恋恋不舍地闭上了眼睛。

_This is for Misato,_ she thought determinedly. _I can do this_...  
这是为了美里，她坚定地想着。我能做到...

The doorbell rang, shattering her thoughts. Shinji opened the door for her, greeting the class rep with a bow.  
门铃响起，打断了她的思绪。真嗣为她开了门，向班长鞠躬致意。

"Good afternoon, Miss Horaki."  
“下午好，堀崎小姐。”

"Thank you, Ikari," Hikari rewarded him with a smile and glanced around the apartment interestedly before following her friend to the bathroom. "Asuka, what are all the newspapers for? Asuka?"  
"谢谢你，碇，" 光用微笑回报他，好奇地环顾了一下公寓，然后跟着她的朋友走向浴室。"明日香，这些报纸都是干什么用的？明日香？"

"Here," Asuka grunted, and Hikari turned to see her hoisting a chair from the dinner table. She set it in the center of the newspapers and casually announced, "You're going to cut my hair."  
"给，" 明日香咕哝一声，光转头看到她从餐桌旁搬起一把椅子。她将椅子放在报纸中央，随意宣布道，"你要给我剪头发。"

"What!" Hikari jumped back. "Asuka! I couldn't possibly do that! Your hair is so beautiful..."  
"什么！" 光吓得跳开。"明日香！我怎么可能做得到！你的头发那么漂亮..."

She reached out to touch the copper strands, but the redhead jerked away and sat down, hissing, "Please... just do it..."  
她伸出手去触摸那些铜色发丝，但红发女孩猛地躲开并坐下，嘶声道：“请……就这样做吧……”

Hikari picked up the scissors uncertainly with one hand and a lock of hair with the other. It reached halfway down Asuka's back and glistened in the light. Hikari took a deep breath and snipped off about five inches.  
光用一只手不确定地拿起剪刀，另一只手抓起一缕头发。那头发长及明日香的后背，在灯光下闪闪发亮。光深吸一口气，剪掉了大约五英寸。

"Too long," the redhead complained, "keep going."  
“太长了，”红发女孩抱怨道，“继续剪。”

Hikari selected a lock just behind Asuka's ear and held it between her index and middle fingers at the shoulder. "To here?"  
光选择了明香耳后的一缕头发，用食指和中指夹在肩部。“到这里吗？”

"Shorter." “再短些。”

Hikari slid her fingers up an inch.  
光将手指向上移动了一英寸。

"No... shorter." "不...再短些。"

Unable to resist, Hikari asked incredulously, "You want a haircut like that of Miss Ayanami?!"  
无法抗拒，光难以置信地问道：“你想剪成绫波小姐那样的发型？！”

"Shorter," Asuka said firmly. "Erm... how about to here?" She placed her fingers just below the ear.  
"再短些，" 明日香坚定地说。"呃...到这里怎么样？" 她将手指放在耳垂下方。

"All right." But the class rep didn't quite have the heart to do it, and Asuka didn't complain when the finished product was still a bit longer than she had asked for. Hikari put plenty of effort into her task, layering Asuka's hair as best as she could and blow-drying it after combing everything delicately with a wet brush. Only when she was done did she dare to ask.  
“好吧。”但班长终究没狠下心，而明日香也没抱怨成品比她要求的稍长一些。光子投入了大量精力，尽可能地分层梳理明日香的头发，并用湿梳子细致地梳理后吹干。直到完成后，她才敢开口询问。

"But Asuka... you always loved your hair. Why did you decide to cut it?"  
“但明日香……你一直很珍爱你的头发。为什么决定剪掉它呢？”

Asuka's expression was clouded over in darkness. "It's been really hard for Misato to even look at me recently, with losing her hair to chemotherapy and all... I really didn't want her to hurt any more than she already did," she confessed.  
明日香的神情笼罩在阴霾中。“最近，美里连看我一眼都很难，因为她化疗掉光了头发……我真的不想让她再受更多苦了。”她坦白道。

Hikari nodded and hugged her friend. "I'm proud of you." She stepped back to look in the mirror, grinning. "It doesn't look so bad, if I do say so myself."  
光点点头，拥抱了她的朋友。“我为你感到骄傲。”她后退一步，对着镜子咧嘴笑道，“如果我自己这么说的话，看起来还不错。”

"You did a wonderful job," Asuka agreed.  
“你做得很好，”明日香赞同道。

---

Namika was in a furor, and rightly so.  
奈美香正处于狂怒之中，这是理所当然的。

"You knew perfectly well that she belonged in bed, and yet you chose to overwork her for six—SIX—hours! You—"  
"你明明清楚她应该躺在床上，却还让她连续工作了六个小时！你——"

"Do you have any idea how depressed you've made her, cooped up in that little room—"  
"你知道你把她关在那小房间里，让她有多沮丧吗？"

Miki slapped her. Ritsuko was forced to take a step back to regain her balance.  
美纪扇了她一巴掌。律子被迫后退一步以恢复平衡。

"All her latest test results show that—"  
"她最新的检查结果显示——"

"Damn the 'latest test results', what matters is that—"  
"该死的'最新检查结果'，重要的是——"

"Oh shut it, both of you," Misato said heavily, and both doctors fell silent. "Miki... don't kill Ritsuko, we wouldn't have much of a NERV without her... and Ritsuko... you know Miki only wants the best... for everyone."  
"行了，你们俩都闭嘴，" 美里沉重地说道，两位医生随即沉默。"三木...别对律子下杀手，没有她，我们 NERV 可就没什么了...而律子...你知道三木只是想为大家争取最好的。"

She was lying in bed, covered with several thick blankets that did not hide the line running into her arm; the doctors' argument had woken her from her deep slumber despite the fact that they had been outside her room. Now Ritsuko and Namika guiltily slinked in, both glaring daggers at each other but reserving a sympathetic expression for Misato.  
她躺在床上，身上盖着几条厚厚的毯子，毯子并未遮住她手臂上的输液管；尽管医生们在外面的房间争论，还是把她从沉睡中吵醒了。现在，律子和奈美香内疚地溜了进来，两人互相瞪眼，却对美里保持着同情的表情。

"How're you feeling?" Namika asked.  
“感觉怎么样？”奈美香问道。

"Fine," Misato replied moodily, "bored."  
“还好，”美里闷闷不乐地回答，“就是无聊。”

Ritsuko gave her old classmate an I-told-you look that emphasized the swollen redness of her left cheek.  
律子向她的老同学投去一个‘我早告诉过你’的眼神，强调了她左脸颊红肿的痕迹。

"Is Shinji still here?" “真嗣还在这里吗？”

"Nope, he left this morning," Ritsuko said. "Don't worry, he's completely fine."  
“没有，他今早离开了，”律子说，“别担心，他完全没事。”

"Now you, Misato, on the other hand," Namika seized an opportunity to cut into the conversation, "I don't want you out of the hospital again anytime soon. You'll be no use in an angel attack if you're not alive to see it."  
"至于你，美里，" 奈美佳抓住机会插话道，"我可不想你这么快又离开医院。如果你不在了，面对使徒的攻击我们可就束手无策了。"

"But when I'm here—" "但如果我在这里——"

"We've arranged to have three more television screens installed." Ritsuko spoke over her. "That way, you'll be able to see the maps, the pilots, along with anything the MAGI shows... and us."  
"我们已经安排再安装三个电视屏幕。" 律子打断她的话，"这样，你就能看到地图、驾驶员，以及 MAGI 显示的一切...还有我们。"

"All right," Misato agreed reluctantly.  
"好吧，"美里不情愿地同意道。

She had not seen her reflection in several days. Either she had been too tired to lift her head, or just hadn't cared. She hadn't been awake when they raked the LCL out of the precious amount of hair she had left. It was thinning by the day, Misato thought gloomily. Then a thought occurred to her.  
她已经好几天没照镜子了。要么是太累了抬不起头，要么就是根本不在乎。她没醒着的时候，他们把她那珍贵的发量中剩下的 LCL 清理掉了。美里忧郁地想，头发一天天变薄。这时，一个念头闪过她的脑海。

"Hey guys – I need a wig."  
"嘿，伙计们——我需要一顶假发。"

Both women blinked initially, but quickly recovered. Namika quickly deferred to Ritsuko, saying that the latter had had more experience with hair color. Ritsuko argued that Namika had had more experience dealing with what a patient might prefer. They compromised on the agreement that Namika would bring in an assortment of wigs for Misato to choose from.  
两位女士起初都眨了眨眼，但很快恢复了镇定。美香迅速将决定权交给律子，称后者在染发方面经验更为丰富。律子则认为美香更了解患者可能偏好的风格。最终，她们达成妥协，决定由美香带来一系列假发供美里挑选。

"Hey, have you seen the transferee?"  
“嘿，你见过那个转学生了吗？”

"Another one? First Shinji, then the redheaded devil..."  
“又一个？先是真嗣，然后是红发小魔头……”

Kensuke lowered his binoculars and pointed. "Well, it is another redhead... very short hair though, too bad she's facing away from us."  
健介放下望远镜，指着前方说：“嗯，又是一个红头发的……不过头发很短，可惜她背对着我们。”

"Well, I hope she's nothing like Sorhyu," Toji muttered darkly and lay down across the shingles, staring up at the cloudless sky. The wind ruffled his hair and made bits of it stand on end.  
“希望她不像素良那样。”东治低声嘟囔着，躺倒在瓦片上，仰望着无云的天空。风吹乱了他的头发，让几缕发丝竖了起来。

Kensuke adjusted his binoculars. "Class rep's coming!" He made to get off the roof immediately, but Toji was reluctant to follow.  
健介调整了一下望远镜。“班长来了！”他立刻准备离开屋顶，但东治却不太情愿跟随。

"Maybe we should stay up here, let the class rep come find us," he yawned, stretching as he did so. "I'm sure Sensei won't mind...Shinji's been gone half the time and he hasn't cared."  
“也许我们应该待在这儿，让班长来找我们，”他打着哈欠，边说边伸了个懒腰。“我相信老师不会介意的...真嗣有一半时间都不在，他也没在意过。”

"Right, right," Kensuke said tonelessly. "So you really like the class rep, huh?"  
“对，对，”健介无精打采地说。“所以你真的喜欢班长，是吧？”

Toji tossed a baseball with one hand and caught it nimbly with the other while he contemplated his answer. "She's not bad."  
当他在思考如何回答时，用一只手抛接着棒球，又灵巧地用另一只手接住。“她还不错。”

"AIDA! SUZUHARA!" "AIDA! 铃原!"

They ran for it. 他们跑了起来。

Hikari was standing with her hands on her hips, glaring at the two boys. "Have you been on the room ALL this—" her glare softened slightly at Toji's spinning the ball effortless across several fingers: "—time?"  
光站在那里，双手叉腰，瞪着两个男孩。“你们一直待在房间里吗——”她的目光在看到冬二轻松地在几根手指间旋转球时稍微柔和了一些：“——这段时间？”

"Well, we—" "嗯，我们——"

Asuka stepped out. 明日香走了出来。

Toji's jaw dropped. 真嗣的下巴掉了下来。

Kensuke stared. 健介瞪大了眼睛。

"Y-y-you're the transferee!" he stuttered.  
“你、你、你是转校生！”他结巴道。

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Transferee?"  
明日香挑了挑眉。“转校生？”

"Yeah, well, the hair," Toji mumbled, trying to demonstrate with his hands.  
“是啊，就是这头发，”冬二咕哝着，试图用手比划。

"Hikari cut it for me," Asuka said proudly.  
“光帮我剪的，”明日香自豪地说。

"Oh really?" Toji leaned forward for a closer look. "She did a nice job."  
“哦，真的吗？”冬二凑近了些仔细看。“她剪得挺好的。”

"I wouldn't have known that you didn't get it professionally cut," Kensuke assured, and Hikari beamed visibly with pride.  
"我真没想到你这头发不是专业剪的，" 真希波保证道，而光子则明显自豪地笑了。

They passed the morning in silence listening to renditions of what happened during the Second Impact. But when lunchtime came, the classroom broke into chatter and Asuka looked expectantly to Shinji for her lunch, as she usually did. The Third Child quickly retrieved her bento and placed it on Asuka's desk. She rewarded him with a smile and a "Thanks, Shinji", instead of the usual "it's about time!"  
他们整个上午都在安静地听着关于第二次冲击发生时的情况。但到了午餐时间，教室里开始热闹起来，明日香像往常一样期待地看着真嗣给她带午餐。第三适格者迅速取出她的便当放在明日香的桌上。她回报他一个微笑和一句"谢谢，真嗣"，而不是平常的"终于来了！"

"She's being a lot nicer to you today," Toji commented. "Got something to tell us, Shinji?"  
"她今天对你好多了，" 冬二评论道。"有什么要告诉我们的吗，真嗣？"

"What?! No!" Shinji exclaimed. Lowering his voice again, he added, "She's been like to almost everyone after we went to go Misato."  
"什么？！不！" 真嗣惊呼道。他再次压低声音，补充说，"自从我们去找美里之后，她几乎对每个人都这样。"

"Speaking of Misato-san, how is she?"  
"说到美里小姐，她怎么样了？"

Shinji sighed. "Not so great. She's very depressed—even took to smashing furniture. And running out to me after the last angel attack didn't do her any good." Shinji placed his hands on either side of his forehead and propped his elbows up on the desk. "All the doctors seem so pessimistic nowadays..."  
真嗣叹了口气。"不太好。她非常沮丧——甚至开始砸家具了。上次使徒袭击后跑来找我也没让她好过。" 真嗣双手撑在额头上，双肘支在桌子上。"最近所有的医生似乎都很悲观..."

Kensuke and Toji exchanged glances. No one knew what to say, so they ate in silence.  
健介和东治交换了一下眼神。没人知道该说什么，于是他们默默地吃着。

---

Misato was surprised to see her.  
美里看到她时感到惊讶。

"Rei," she said warmly, turning her head aside to cough. "I didn't expect to see you here."  
“丽，”她温暖地说道，侧过头去咳嗽了一声。“我没想到会在这里见到你。”

"I have made a promise to come, and I intend to keep it." She paused. "Furthermore, I like speaking with you, Major Katsuragi."  
"我已承诺前来，便打算遵守。" 她顿了顿。"而且，我喜欢与你交谈，葛城美里少校。"

"Then call me Misato," the Major smiled, genuinely pleased.  
"那就叫我美里吧，" 葛城少校微笑着，真心感到高兴。"

Rei nodded. 绫波点点头。

"You know, I'm very proud of you for sticking up for Shinji against Dr. Akagi, even if she considered it disobeying a direct order."  
"你知道吗，我为你能站在真嗣一边对抗赤木博士感到非常骄傲，即使她认为这是违抗直接命令。"

"I have made a promise to protect Ikari-kun and I intend to keep it as well," Rei explained honestly.  
“我曾承诺保护碇君，我打算坚守这个承诺。”绫波诚实地解释道。

Misato laughed. "You've made a lot of promises, haven't you?"  
美里笑了。“你许下了很多承诺，不是吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

She was content just being in the presence of the Major—_Misato_, she corrected herself mentally. Rei was not used to people actually liking to have her around—she simply existed, and most people did not question that. But Misato liked her, actually welcomed her and wanted her around. It was a new feeling.  
她只是满足于在美里少校——她在心里纠正自己，是美里——身边。绫波不习惯有人真的喜欢她在身边——她只是存在，大多数人对此并不质疑。但美里喜欢她，真正欢迎她，希望她在身边。这是一种新的感觉。

Rei had wondered whether or not to come at all. Perhaps the Major had simply been joking. Or maybe the Major was still critically ill and would not want to speak with her.  
丽一直在犹豫是否要来。也许少校只是开了个玩笑。或者少校仍然病重，并不想和她说话。

Yet here she was, swathed in white sheets, smiling up at the First Child from her abnormally pale face. She didn't have to do this—she could have easily ordered Rei out the very first day. But instead she had asked the girl to come and see her, and she had obviously meant it. Rei had never felt so appreciated in her life.  
然而她就在这里，裹在白色床单中，从她异常苍白的脸上对着第一适格者微笑。她本不必这么做——她完全可以第一天就命令丽离开。但她却让丽来看她，显然她是认真的。丽一生中从未感到如此被珍视。

"I... made you something, Maj—Misato," Rei commented quietly, reaching into her knapsack. The contents of the small translucent plastic container were still warm.  
“我……给你做了点东西，美——美里少校，”丽轻声说道，伸手去拿她的背包。小透明塑料盒里的东西还是温热的。

Misato watched interestedly as Rei held it out to her and savored the warmth in her dry hands, peeling off the plastic cover carefully. Inside, arranged in a colorful array, lay a variety of steamed vegetables, glistening in some sort of sauce.  
美里饶有兴致地看着丽将便当递给她，感受着干涩手中传来的温暖，小心翼翼地剥去塑料封套。里面，五彩缤纷地摆放着各式蒸蔬菜，在某种酱汁中闪闪发光。

"You made this for me?" Misato asked, incredulous. It had never occurred to her that the First Child cooked, but then again—she lived alone, so who would have cooked for her?  
“这是你为我做的？”美里难以置信地问。她从未想过初号机驾驶员会做饭，但转念一想——她独自生活，又有谁会为她做饭呢？

"Yes." Rei produced a pair of chopsticks from her knapsack, wrapped delicately in a pale pink napkin edged with cherry blossoms. "I do not know if Dr. Ishiyama would approve..."  
“是的。”丽从背包里拿出一双筷子，精致地包裹在淡粉色樱花边的餐巾中。“我不知道石山博士是否会同意……”

"Too bad for her." Misato plucked a slice of carrot from the bowl. "This is really good, Rei—where'd you learn to cook like this?"  
"她真倒霉。" 美里从碗里夹起一片胡萝卜，"这真的很好吃，绫波——你是在哪儿学会做这个的？"

"Ikari-kun prepared this dish for us when I was there, a few weeks ago," Rei replied, internally beaming with pride, "although I have experimented by adding different vegetables as well."  
"几周前我在那里时，碇君为我们准备了这道菜，" 绫波回答道，内心洋溢着自豪，"不过我也尝试加入了一些不同的蔬菜。"

Misato nodded and swallowed hard. "I can't sit here and eat the entire thing myself. Go on, have some yourself."  
美里点点头，用力咽下。"我不能坐在这儿一个人把这全吃了。来，你自己也吃点。"

"No, no," Rei insisted, "I made it for you."  
"不，不，" 丽坚持道，"这是我为你做的。"

"I can't eat all of it," Misato complained. There was a short pause in which she seemed to be thinking deeply. "All right then, as your commanding officer, I order you to eat."  
"我吃不完这么多，" 美里抱怨道。她短暂地停顿了一下，似乎在深思。"好吧，作为你的指挥官，我命令你吃。"

Rei thought this over, smiling a bit in spite of herself. A long hunt produced a plastic fork from the bottom of her bag. The blue-haired girl picked up a piece of Chinese cabbage and chewed slowly, giving Misato more time to eat.  
丽思考了一下，尽管如此还是微微一笑。她从包底翻出一把塑料叉子。蓝发女孩夹起一片中国白菜，慢慢地咀嚼，给美里更多时间吃。

"So how's school coming?"  
"学校怎么样了？"

Rei paused with her fork mid-air. "We are studying several pre-Impact novels, and in mathematics we are studying derivatives."  
丽停下手中悬在半空的叉子。“我们在学习几部前冲击时代的小说，数学课上则在学习导数。”

"And gym?" "体育课呢？"

"We have progressed from swimming to track."  
“我们从游泳转到了田径。”

"Track," Misato mused. "I never liked that... much more fun to watch Miki racing Kaji—they were the athletes of our year. Miki is short for Namika, Dr. Ishiyama's first name," she explained.  
“田径，”美里沉思道，“我从来不太喜欢……看美纪和加持比赛更有趣——他们是我们那一届的运动员。美纪是波香的昵称，石山博士的名字，”她解释说。

Rei nodded. "I know." 绫波点点头。“我知道。”

They ate in silence for a while before Misato tired of the quiet and ventured, "So what do you want to do in the future?"  
他们沉默地吃了一会儿，直到美里厌倦了这份安静，试探性地问道：“那么，你将来想做什么呢？”

Clearly taken aback, the First Child turned still as a statue and her eyes widened. _No one has ever asked me that before_, she thought. _No one has ever cared_. _I exist only to pilot Eva_.  
显然被这个问题吓了一跳，第一适格者僵硬如雕像，眼睛睁得大大的。她心想，从来没有人问过我这个问题，从来没有人关心过。我存在的意义只是为了驾驶 EVA。

_But Misato doesn't think so_, she reasoned.  
但美里不这么认为，她这样想着。

"I don't know," she said finally, looking away.  
"我不知道，" 她终于说道，目光移开。

Misato blinked at this response, but Rei said nothing. She could not tell Misato that she was essentially worthless, that there were a hundred some carbon copies floating in that underground cauldron.  
美里对这个回答眨了眨眼，但丽什么也没说。她无法告诉美里自己本质上毫无价值，有上百个碳复制品在那地下大锅中漂浮。

"I would like to go to college someday," she said.  
"我希望有一天能去上大学，" 她说。

Misato smiled. "Then I hope you go to Tokyo University. Of course they've had to rebuild it many times across the years due to Angel attacks, but I hear it's still a wonderful school."  
美里微笑道：“那我希望你能考上东京大学。当然，由于使徒的袭击，它多年来已被重建多次，但我听说它依然是一所很棒的学校。”

Rei nodded. Sensei had talked about the greatness of Tokyo University. For the first time, she felt a hope that she would one day be there.  
绫波点点头。老师曾谈及东京大学的卓越。这是她第一次感到有朝一日能进入那里的希望。

---

The days crawled by for Misato, each bringing more misery than the one before. She had read through _Rebecca_ three times. She had followed the affairs of every famous Japanese actress for weeks. And she had received more shots than she had in the rest of her life put together.  
对美里来说，日子一天天缓慢地过去，每一天都比前一天更加痛苦。她已经把《丽贝卡》读了三遍。她追踪了每一位日本著名女演员的动态长达数周。而且她接受的注射比她一生中其他时候加起来还要多。

Namika had taken her off the oral chemotherapy drugs and instead decided to inject it directly into the space around her spinal cord, explaining that leukemic cells tended to collect around that area. She could bear the needles in her arm, but she could not bear the idea of that needle going into the back of her neck, and it did not get any easier as days went on. Namika continued to maintain that perhaps she would soon go into remission; however, it was clearly becoming apparent that even the doctor was losing hope.  
纳米卡已经停掉了她的口服化疗药物，改为直接注射到她的脊髓周围空间，解释说白血病细胞往往会在那个区域聚集。她能忍受手臂上的针头，但无法忍受那个针头插入她颈后的想法，而且随着时间的推移，这种感觉并没有变得更容易。纳米卡继续坚持说，也许她很快就会进入缓解期；然而，很明显，连医生都开始失去希望了。

She drifted in and out of sleep nowadays, constantly tired, and feeling relieved that she didn't have to spend energy eating, even if it meant having to keep the line in her arm. Several infections came and went, including a particularly angry red rash that developed across the skin of her chest and shoulders. Several times Rei came to see her and was told that she was asleep; whenever this happened Misato would become angry and subdued and vow to be awake the next time she came.  
她现在时睡时醒，总是感到疲惫，庆幸自己不必花费精力进食，即便这意味着要一直保留手臂上的输液管。几次感染来来去去，包括胸前和肩部出现的一个特别红肿的皮疹。雷几次来看她，都被告知她在睡觉；每当这种情况发生，美里就会变得愤怒而消沉，并发誓下次她来时一定要醒着。

But she couldn't do it. Occasional high fevers would keep her bedridden and sleepy, barely conscious of what was going on around her. Namika continued to run bone marrow tests that left her feeling achy and sore for weeks at a time. Ritsuko bought her an audio device, similar to Shinji's SDAT, so that she could listen to pre-taped stories instead of having to hold up a book.  
但她做不到。偶尔的高烧会让她卧床不起，昏昏欲睡，几乎意识不到周围发生的事情。名花继续进行骨髓测试，这让她感到疼痛和酸痛，持续数周。律子给她买了一个音频设备，类似于真嗣的 SDAT，这样她就可以听预先录好的故事，而不必拿着书。

October came and passed before a day came when Misato could sit up and enjoy the autumn scene through her window. She had not really been awake to see the Japanese garden at its flowery peak, but she could take pleasure in the shady branches of scarlet maple. Ritsuko came by and opened the window for her so that she could hear the birds chirping.  
十月来了又去，直到有一天美里才能坐起来，透过窗户欣赏秋天的景色。她并没有真正清醒地看到日本花园在花期最盛时的样子，但她可以享受那片红枫树荫下的乐趣。律子过来看望她，并为她打开窗户，让她能听到鸟儿的鸣叫。

"I'm not looking forward to winter at all," Misato admitted. "When everything's white and dead... and so _clean_..."  
“我一点也不期待冬天，”美里坦言，“当一切都变得白茫茫、死气沉沉...却又如此干净...”

Ritsuko laughed. "None of us do. Except maybe Miki, since mosquitoes are buzzing rampant in summer while carrying all those diseases—and winter kills them off."  
律子笑了。“我们谁也不懂。除了可能美里，毕竟夏天蚊子猖獗，携带各种疾病——而冬天它们就销声匿迹了。”

She had expected to draw laughter from the Major, but she heard none. Instead, Misato said quietly, "Namika's attitude towards me has changed recently."  
她本以为会逗得美里发笑，却没听到任何笑声。相反，美里平静地说：“最近，美里对我的态度变了。”

"How so?" “怎么变了？”

"She's so curt," Misato muttered miserably. "Anything I mention to her—any pain, any discomfort—I get a 'we're _trying_, Misato, _be patient_ '. I never see her anymore, besides when she's injecting me with more drugs or sucking out more blood." She paused. "So doctor-like, so unfriend-like."  
"她太简短了，"美里痛苦地喃喃道。"我提到她的任何痛苦，任何不适——我得到的总是'我们在努力，美里，请耐心等待'。除了她给我注射更多药物或抽取更多血液的时候，我几乎见不到她。"她停顿了一下。"太像医生了，太不像朋友了。"

Ritsuko remained facing away, her weight balanced on one leg and the other toe tapping the floor silently as she gazed outside. A small bird landed on a nearby branch and cocked its head, watching her curiously. A moment later it took flight and left the bough quivering. Dr. Akagi sighed and turned away.  
律子依旧背对着，一只脚支撑着身体，另一只脚的脚尖轻轻敲打着地面，静静地望着窗外。一只小鸟落在附近的树枝上，歪着头好奇地看着她。片刻后，它飞走了，留下树枝微微颤动。赤城博士叹了口气，转过身来。

"Did you know that yesterday was Miki's birthday?"  
"你知道昨天是美纪的生日吗？"

"No," Misato was forced to admit, "I didn't."  
"不，" 美里不得不承认，"我没有。"

Ritsuko left the window and sat down in the chair that Rei had occupied days ago. "Too bad. I went to her house yesterday with a cake, but no one was there."  
律子离开了窗边，坐在了几天前绫波坐过的椅子上。"真可惜。我昨天带了蛋糕去她家，但没人在。"

"Where was she?" "她去哪儿了？"

The blonde held her companion's gaze firmly. "In the lab, running the latest tests on your blood."  
金发女子坚定地回望着她的同伴。“在实验室里，对你的血液进行最新测试。”

Misato flushed, and Ritsuko continued. "I know Miki's not the sort of person to spoil a patient, but she does care. She just tends not to show it."  
美里脸红了，而律子继续说道。“我知道美纪不是那种会宠坏病人的人，但她确实很关心。只是她不太表现出来。”

The Major nodded, embarrassed that she had been thinking only of herself.  
少校点了点头，为自己只考虑自己而感到尴尬。

"Hey." Kaji stuck his unshaven face in the doorway and waved a large hand. "Mind if I come in?"  
"嘿。" 加持把他的胡茬脸探进门来，挥了挥大手。"介意我进来吗？"

"Kaji!" Misato smiled happily as he strode in and gave her a big bear hug.  
"加持！" 美里笑着欢迎他，他大步走进来给了她一个大大的熊抱。

Kaji grinned and kissed her on the forehead. "And you." He patted Ritsuko in a friendly fashion on the shoulder. "So, Rit-chan says they've gone and bought you a wig. How does it look?"  
加持咧嘴一笑，在她额头上亲了一下。"你也是。"他友好地拍了拍律子的肩膀。"那么，律子说他们给你买了顶假发。看起来怎么样？"

Misato reached over and retrieved it from her bedside table. Almost all of her hair had fallen out in the days when she had being severely ill, and Ritsuko and Namika had decided to go ahead and buy a wig for her. Unfortunately, Ritsuko had insisted on being the only blonde and they couldn't find a purple of the same shade as her natural hair. Furthermore, Namika had declared brown too dull and Ritsuko argued vehemently against blue, so they had settled on red. Misato had taken a look at it and tossed it aside. Now she reluctantly lowered it over her head.  
美里伸手从床头柜上取过它。在她病重的那几天，几乎所有的头发都脱落了，于是律子和奈美香决定提前为她买一顶假发。不幸的是，律子坚持要成为唯一的金发女郎，她们找不到与她自然发色相同的紫色假发。此外，奈美香认为棕色太过沉闷，而律子则激烈反对蓝色，因此她们最终选择了红色。美里看了一眼，便把它扔到了一边。现在，她不情愿地将它戴在了头上。

Both Ritsuko and Kaji burst into unrestrained laughter; Misato, feeling that she might as well make the best of it, shrugged and gave a lopsided grin.  
律子和加持都忍不住大笑起来；美里觉得既然如此，不如尽量表现得自然些，于是耸了耸肩，露出了一个歪斜的微笑。

"You—look—like—" Kaji clutched his sides, laughing furiously: "Asuka—"  
“你——看——起——来——”加持捧腹大笑，几乎喘不过气来：“像——明日香——”

He tipped off the chair and rolled on the floor, still laughing. Misato demanded a mirror and Ritsuko, her face intensely red from laughter, produced a small compact from her purse. Misato's eyes widened at the sight of her familiar face framed in a shower of copper curls that made it so utterly unfamiliar even she had to laugh.  
他从椅子上滑落，滚到地上依然笑个不停。美里要求拿镜子，律子因大笑而满脸通红，从包里掏出一个小巧的化妆镜。美里看到镜中那张熟悉的面孔被一团铜色卷发包围，变得如此陌生，连她自己都忍不住笑了起来。

"Wait until Asuka hears about this," Kaji wheezed, holding onto his side with one hand as he climbed back onto his chair, only to burst into another fit of laughter. The two women exchanged glances and rolled eyes.  
“等明日香听到这事，”加持喘着气说，一手捂着侧腹，一边爬回椅子，随即又爆发出一阵大笑。两位女士交换了眼神，翻了个白眼。

"Yeah, how is she?" Misato asked, eager to draw the attention away from her hair.  
“是啊，她怎么样了？”美里问道，急切地想转移大家对她头发的注意力。

"They seem to have bonded pretty well with Makoto," Ritsuko informed her. "Actually, they invited their classmates over a few days ago. Makoto seems to be pretty cool in the children's eyes."  
“他们似乎和真琴相处得很好，”律子告诉她，“实际上，前几天他们还邀请了同学过来。在孩子们眼中，真琴似乎很酷。”

Misato smiled, thinking of how well Kensuke and Makoto would get along. She snapped the compact shut and handed it back to Ritsuko, then tore the wig off her head.  
美里微笑着，想象着健介和真琴会相处得多好。她啪的一声合上粉盒，递还给律子，然后一把扯下头上的假发。

---

November saw Misato through yet another bout of chronic illness, this one even more virulent than the last. Doctors hurried in and out of her room in a swish of white lab coats. To Misato, it all seemed as if the scenes were being played in fast-forward. Sometimes Kaji would be there, holding on to her hand. Other times she would be completely alone, either shivering from cold or soaked in her own sweat. Namika changed her to another chemotherapy drug, but the side effects only worsened.  
十一月，美里又经历了一轮慢性病发作，这次比上次更为凶猛。医生们穿着白大褂匆匆进出她的房间。对美里来说，这一切仿佛是在快进播放。有时，加持会在那里握着她的手。其他时候，她则完全独自一人，要么因寒冷而颤抖，要么被自己的汗水浸透。奈美香给她换了另一种化疗药物，但副作用却愈发严重。

For Shinji and Asuka, this was a time of extreme emotional turmoil and surprisingly, a time of bonding. They did not leave NERV each day until they had pestered the latest news out of Ritsuko, and when they walked home it was often in silence. Makoto, meanwhile, often worked overtime without complaint, so the children were left at home. Asuka took to watching TV late into the night and often falling asleep on the couch. Shinji was left to do homework alone in the bedroom.  
对于真嗣和明日香来说，这是一个情感极度动荡的时期，却也出奇地成为了他们关系紧密的时期。他们每天都不离开 NERV，直到从律子那里打听到最新的消息，而回家的路上往往是一片沉默。与此同时，真希常常无怨无悔地加班，所以孩子们只能独自在家。明日香开始熬夜看电视，经常在沙发上睡着。真嗣则独自一人在卧室里做作业。

Homework rarely stumped him. Shinji was not a dim student, and he liked to have his work done correctly and on time. However, this time he was utterly stumped, so he slid the door open and poked his head out.  
作业很少难倒他。真嗣并不是一个愚笨的学生，他喜欢按时且正确地完成作业。然而，这次他完全被难住了，于是他拉开房门，探出头来。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

Perhaps she was still awake; her usual array of talk shows lasted until at least one in the morning. Shinji tiptoed out, clutching the paper between two fingers.  
也许她还没睡；她常看的那些脱口秀节目至少会持续到凌晨一点。真嗣蹑手蹑脚地走出来，用两根手指夹着那张纸。

Nope, he was wrong. Her hair was scattered loosely over the pillow and formed a fiery frame for her sleeping face. The lights were on, but the TV volume had been tapered down until it was barely audible.  
不，他错了。她的头发随意散落在枕头上，为她的睡颜勾勒出一道火红的边框。灯光亮着，但电视音量已被调低，几乎听不见。

Her moaning though, was quite audible.  
但她的呻吟声，却相当清晰。

He couldn't make out what she was saying. There were several "m" sounds and a few "s" sounds, or perhaps that was simply a sharp intake of breath. Shinji, who had witnessed her nightmares before, concluded that she was dreaming about her mother again.  
他听不清她在说什么。有几个“m”音和一些“s”音，或许那只是急促的吸气声。真嗣，曾目睹过她的噩梦，断定她又在梦见她的母亲了。

_Time to go to bed and leave her be_, his rational mind prodded. But he had barely turned when Asuka flipped over and shrilly cried out, "Don't die!"  
是时候去睡觉，让她一个人待着了，他的理智这样提醒着。但他刚一转身，明日香就翻了个身，尖声喊道：“不要死！”

The rational voice continued to inform him that he was being an idiot, but regardless, Shinji made his way to her bedside and knelt down, pulling a blanket over her body.  
理智的声音继续告诉他，他这样做很愚蠢，但尽管如此，真嗣还是走到她的床边跪下，拉过一条毯子盖在她身上。

Silence. 沉默。

Shinji hovered, wanting to make sure that she was okay. Asuka took in shallow, even breaths, her lips just slightly parted. Out of nowhere her face contorted and her hand shot out, grasping, reaching—he heard the blended "m" and "s" sound again—  
真嗣徘徊着，想确认她是否安好。明日香呼吸浅而均匀，双唇微微分开。突然间，她的脸扭曲了，手猛地伸出，抓握，探寻——他又听到了那个混合的“m”和“s”音——

Without thinking, Shinji put up his hand and let her take hold of it.  
未经思考，真嗣举起手，让她握住。

Wrong move. She squeezed it tightly, holding it close to herself in such a position that Shinji had to quickly get up and move or risk having his hand torn off. He hesitated, giving her hand just the tiniest squeeze. Her eyes flew open.  
这一举动错了。她紧紧地握住他的手，将它拉近自己，使得真嗣不得不迅速起身移动，否则就有可能被扯断手。他犹豫了一下，只是轻轻地回握了一下她的手。她的眼睛猛地睁开。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

"Sorry," he apologized quickly, drawing his hand away. "Sorry..."  
“对不起，”他迅速道歉，抽回手。“对不起……”

Asuka looked down and was pleased to find that she was fully dressed. "It's all right. I was dreaming..." She shivered.  
明日香低头一看，发现自己衣着整齐，心中一喜。“没事，我只是在做梦……”她打了个寒颤。

"About your mother?" Shinji supplied helpfully.  
“关于你母亲？”真嗣贴心地补充道。

"No..." Asuka drew her legs closer to her and buried her face in the blanket. "I dreamed that Misato was dying."  
“不是……”明日香将双腿蜷缩得更紧，把脸埋进毯子里。“我梦见美里快要死了。”

This took Shinji by surprise, and he crept closer and sat down beside her on the floor.  
这让真嗣感到意外，他悄悄地靠近，坐在她旁边的地板上。

"Do you want to talk?" he asked at last.  
“你想谈谈吗？”他终于问道。

Asuka revealed her face at last, looking straight ahead. "We were all there," she began shakily. "She just... faded a-away..."  
绫波终于露出了脸，直视前方。“我们都在那里，”她颤抖着开始说，“她就那样……渐渐消失了……”

Her voice shook and died. Asuka lay down and turned her face inward so that it faced the back of the couch. "Shinji, what will we do if she dies?"  
她的声音颤抖着消失了。明日香躺下，将脸转向内侧，面向沙发的背面。“真嗣，如果她死了，我们该怎么办？”

It was hard for him to believe even that this terrified girl before him was really Sorhyu Asuka Langley, but Shinji did his best to respond. "I don't think she will, Asuka... don't think such thoughts."  
他很难相信眼前这个惊恐的女孩真的是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，但真嗣尽力回应道：“我想她不会的，明日香……别想这些了。”

"I didn't think I cared so much," Asuka whispered hollowly. "I didn't want to care."  
“我没想到我会这么在乎，”明日香空洞地低语，“我本不想在乎的。”

Shinji took some time to reflect. "I didn't want to come," he said at last. "I didn't want to pilot Eva... I had never had anyone care for me before. My father didn't care... the teacher I stayed with treated me like a burden. Misato was the first person who actually, honestly, cared..."  
真嗣花了一些时间反思。“我本不想来，”他终于说道，“我不想驾驶 Eva……我以前从未有人关心过我。我父亲不关心……我寄宿的老师把我当负担。美里是第一个真正、诚实地关心我的人……”

Asuka shut the TV off and hugged her legs to herself. Shinji stood up and hesitated before putting his arms around her tentatively, then quickly drawing away.  
明日香关掉电视，抱紧自己的双腿。真嗣站起身，犹豫了一下，然后试探性地伸出双臂抱住她，又迅速抽回。

"You should get some sleep," he advised. "Are you sure you don't want your room back?"  
“你应该去睡一会儿，”他建议道，“你确定不想搬回你的房间吗？”

"No, I'm fine." She slid back down and drew the blanket up to her nose.  
“不，我没事。”她滑回被窝，将被子拉到鼻尖。

Shinji smiled. "Asuka..."  
真嗣微笑道：“明日香……”

"Hmm?" "嗯？"

There was no doubt in his voice as his spoke.  
他开口时，语气中没有丝毫怀疑。

"Whatever happens, we'll make it through."  
无论发生什么，我们都会挺过去。

Author's Notes: sort of a weird chapter, hopping through the months, but I really wanted to get this one out (it's been sitting in the depths of my computer for much too long.) I'm hoping to update around once a month from now on...  
作者笔记：这一章有点奇怪，跳跃了几个月，但我真的很想把它发出来（它在我电脑深处已经躺了太久。）我希望从现在开始大约每月更新一次……

I know that at some point in one of the flashbacks Fuyutsuki says, "Back then this country still had seasons", but I've decided to add them in anyway for effect.  
我知道在某个闪回中，冬月说过，“那时这个国家还有四季”，但我决定还是加上它们，以增强效果。

And thanks to XXXG-00W0 and KenshinNigoki for the tips on Asuka's character – hope she's much better in this one.  
感谢 XXXG-00W0 和 KenshinNigoki 对明日香角色塑造的建议——希望她在这部作品中表现得更出色。

Lastly, to jennyjennai—your review touched me in a way that I really can't explain. I'm very glad that everything's all right now and that you've come through it all!  
最后，致 jennyjennai——你的评论以一种我难以言表的方式触动了我。非常高兴你现在一切都好，并且已经度过了所有难关！

Thanks everyone! 感谢大家！

### Chapter 4: apprehension
第四章：忧虑

December 8: another usual day in bed for Misato, who had finally grown used to her Asuka-like hair. Namika came in to bring her a glass of water and congratulated her, but that was it. No Shinji, no Asuka, no Rei— or even Ritsuko, Misato thought morosely. She passed the morning listening to a recorded version of _Anna Karenina_, occasionally pausing her SDAT when a familiar voice passed by her room. Once or twice she thought she heard Kaji, but he never came in.  
12 月 8 日：对于已经习惯了像明日香那样发型的美里来说，又是一个寻常的卧床日子。纳米卡进来给她送了一杯水，并祝贺她，仅此而已。没有真嗣，没有明日香，没有绫波——甚至连律子也没有，美里忧郁地想着。她整个上午都在听《安娜·卡列尼娜》的录音版，每当有熟悉的声音经过她的房间时，她会偶尔暂停她的 SDAT。有一两次她以为她听到了加持的声音，但他从未进来。

She hoped it hadn't been him. If it had been him, well—of all the days not to come by!  
她希望那不是他。如果是他，好吧——偏偏是今天没来！

Misato gave up hope and drifted off to sleep around noon, waking up at sporadic intervals. Someone came in and removed a piece of equipment but did not speak to her. At four thirty-two, Misato decided that she had slept far more than was necessary, and settled down to celebrate alone.  
中午时分，美里放弃了希望，渐渐入睡，醒来时断时续。有人进来取走了一台设备，但没有和她说话。四点三十二分，美里觉得她睡得已经足够多，便决定独自庆祝。

"Happy birthday to me…" “祝我生日快乐…”

_Is there any reason to be happy that I'm turning 30?  
我三十岁了，有什么值得高兴的理由吗？_

"Happy birthday…to me…" "生日快乐……给我自己……"

_I wonder if I'll live to see my 31st year?  
不知道我能不能活到 31 岁呢？_

"Don't wake her—Dr. Ishiyama said she was asleep."  
"别吵醒她——石山医生说她睡着了。"

The door slid open and in came Makoto, hauling an entire drum set on wheels. Upon noticing that the Major was awake and watching him, the technician blushed crimson and muttered, "Ah… uh… guys! She's awake!"  
门滑开了，真琴推着一整套带轮子的鼓组走了进来。注意到少校已经醒来并看着他，技术员的脸顿时涨得通红，结结巴巴地说：“啊…呃…大家！她醒了！”

Shigeru strutted into the room, his guitar hanging over his shoulder by a nylon strap. He cleared his throat, glanced to the others for confirmation, and began singing loudly.  
茂手持吉他，肩上挂着尼龙带，大摇大摆地走进房间。他清了清嗓子，瞥了其他人一眼以确认，然后大声唱了起来。

"Happy Birthday to you; Happy Birthday to you!"  
“祝你生日快乐；祝你生日快乐！”

"Happy Birthday dear Misa—"  
"生日快乐，亲爱的美砂——"

"Major," Maya hinted. "少校，" 真宵暗示道。"

"—Major Katsuragi…" "——葛城少校……"

Shigeru drew out the last syllable. "Happy birthday to you!" He strummed out the final chord as Makoto's drumming built to a climax and Maya accented the ending with a delicate _ting_ on her triangle.  
茂抽长了最后一个音节。“祝你生日快乐！”随着真琴的鼓点达到高潮，他弹出了最后的和弦，而真希则用三角铁的清脆声点缀了结尾。

Grinning proudly now, Misato clapped eagerly. Makoto began drumming again with newfound confidence. Shigeru quickly jumped in, but their rhythms did not match and Maya was soon begging them to stop.  
现在，美里自豪地笑着，急切地鼓掌。真琴重拾信心，再次敲起鼓来。茂迅速加入，但他们的节奏并不协调，真希很快就开始恳求他们停下来。

The presents began to shower upon her. Ritsuko had bought her a pair of crystal earrings and Maya an elegant gold locket. Namika demanded upon inspecting all presents after Kaji attempted to sneak in a case of beer, crudely disguised as perfume.  
礼物开始如雨点般落在她身上。律子送了她一对水晶耳环，真希则送了一个优雅的金制项链。在加持试图偷偷塞进一箱伪装成香水的啤酒后，美里要求检查所有的礼物。

"It was just a joke," he complained peevishly as the doctor dumped everything into the trash.  
"那只是个玩笑，"他不满地抱怨道，医生却把所有东西都扔进了垃圾桶。

"Not a very funny one," she assured him.  
"确实不怎么好笑，"她向他保证。

Misato was having a grand time when Asuka and Shinji pushed their way into the room, followed closely by Rei. All three were dressed in school uniforms and had apparently come over directly after class. Shinji was carrying a white frosted cake, and Rei was balancing a large rectangular box in her arms.  
美里正玩得不亦乐乎，这时明日香和真嗣挤进了房间，紧随其后的是绫波。三人都穿着校服，显然是下课后直接过来的。真嗣手里提着一个白色霜面的蛋糕，而绫波则稳稳地抱着一个大长方形盒子。

Somebody fetched a knife and Shinji sliced the cake, handing the first slice to Misato. Namika, however, was quick to intervene.  
有人拿来了一把刀，真嗣切开了蛋糕，第一块递给了美里。然而，纳米卡迅速介入。

"But _Miki_," Misato groaned, "it's my birthday!"  
“但是美纪，”美里抱怨道，“今天是我的生日！”

The doctor exchanged a look with Ritsuko, relented, and allowed Misato a few bites. Namika got the next slice, then Ritsuko, and finally Kaji. Rei declined, and Asuka had only a small piece.  
医生与律子交换了一个眼神，最终妥协，允许美里吃几口。纳米卡拿到了下一块，接着是律子，最后是加持。丽拒绝了，而明日香只吃了一小片。

"So what's in that box?" Kaji muttered through a mouthful of cake. He turned his head to the side and swallowed hard. Ritsuko shot him a dirty look and exchanged an exasperated smile with the other doctor.  
"“那盒子里装的是什么？”加持嘴里塞满蛋糕，含糊不清地嘟囔着。他侧过头，用力咽了下去。律子瞪了他一眼，与其他医生交换了一个无奈的微笑。”

Rei set down her cake and gently tore off the binding tape to reveal a case stuffed with foam peanuts.  
"绫波放下手中的蛋糕，轻轻撕开绑带，露出了一个塞满泡沫花生的箱子。”

_I wish I could have opened it myself,_ Misato thought sadly, _too bad there's no way I can reach the box, and there's no way it would fit on my lap.._.  
"真希望我能亲自打开它，美里难过地想，可惜我够不到那个盒子，而且它也没法放在我腿上……”

The First and Third Children held the cardboard flaps open while the Second reached in to pull out an elegant stained-glass lamp, furnished with a slender brass stem to hold up the lampshade.  
第一和第三适格者撑开纸板挡板，而第二适格者伸手从中取出了一盏优雅的彩色玻璃灯，配有一根细长的黄铜灯杆来支撑灯罩。

"Originally we were going to just buy you a lamp," Shinji explained, "but we couldn't find anything that was pretty, so we ended up making our own lampshade."  
“原本我们打算直接给你买一盏灯，”真嗣解释道，“但我们找不到任何漂亮的，所以最后我们决定自己做一个灯罩。”

"You _made_ this?!" “你们做的这个？！”

She rotated it around slowly in her hands and saw that her name was embedded into the bottom edge with fragments of purple glass. The rest of the cover consisted of a background made from pure white pieces of glass, with branching greenery and yellow glass flowers positioned neatly in between.  
她将它在她手中缓缓转动，发现自己的名字嵌在底边，点缀着紫色玻璃碎片。封面的其余部分由纯白玻璃片构成背景，其间整齐地穿插着枝叶繁茂的绿植和黄色玻璃花朵。

"Where'd you guys learn to do this?" she asked.  
“你们是在哪儿学会做这个的？”她问道。

Both Shinji and Asuka deferred to the quiet one: "Rei."  
真嗣和明日香都看向了那位安静的伙伴：“丽。”

"You taught them how to do this?" Misato stammered. "Where'd you come up with the idea for this?" She spun it in her hands again. "It's lovely…"  
"你教他们怎么做这个的？" 美里结巴道。"你是怎么想到这个点子的？" 她再次转动着手中的物品。"真漂亮……"

"The idea came to me after I noticed that you did not have a lamp in your room," Rei said modestly. Ritsuko bristled and made as if she wished to speak with Namika, but Rei simply continued and did not give her the chance. "I am very happy that you are pleased, Misato."  
"这个点子是我在注意到你房间里没有台灯后想到的，" 绫波谦虚地说。律子有些不悦，似乎想和美里说话，但绫波继续说着，没有给她机会。"我很高兴你喜欢，美里。"

_Did she really just place a tiny accent on that last word?_ Ritsuko pondered, but let it go.  
她真的在最后一个词上加了点小强调吗？律子思索着，但没有深究。

"We definitely couldn't have done it without Wondergirl's help," Asuka assured Misato. "Here, let's plug it in."  
"没有明日香的帮助，我们肯定做不到这一点，"明日香向美里保证道。"来，我们把它插上。"

Misato threw out her arms and drew all three Children into a tight hug as the room burst into light.  
美里张开双臂，将三个孩子紧紧抱住，房间里顿时充满了光芒。

"What would I do without you guys?"  
"没有你们，我该怎么办呢？"

---

She guarded those memories fiercely over the next few days, feeling a warm sensation of happiness break over her every time she turned on the lamp and filled the room with illuminated flowers. They cared about her; they loved her, and that was enough to keep Misato going.  
在接下来的几天里，她紧紧守护着这些记忆，每当她打开台灯，让房间充满光影交织的花朵时，一种温暖的幸福感便涌上心头。他们关心她；他们爱她，这足以支撑美里继续前行。

But only two days later the Major was again listening to _Anna Karenina_ when she unconsciously reached up to scratch an itchy spot on her neck, exactly where Maya's locket rested. _No…_ surely she was imagining it. With her hands shaking, Misato reached into the top drawer of her wooden bedside table and drew out a compact mirror, anxiously flipping it open.  
但仅仅两天后，少校再次听着《安娜·卡列尼娜》时，她无意识地伸手去挠脖子上的痒处，正好是真嗣的项链所在的位置。不……她肯定是在想象。美里双手颤抖着，从木制床头柜的最上层抽屉里拿出一个小巧的镜子，焦急地翻开。

It was there. An angry red rash, spreading from the area under the locket as if being egged on by some invisible flame.  
它就在那里。一片愤怒的红色疹子，从项链下的区域蔓延开来，仿佛被某种无形火焰所驱使。

Misato threw the compact back into the drawer and quickly closed it. She picked up her SDAT and lay flat, breathing heavily. She knew by now, from past experience, that the first sign of a major infection was usually the rash.  
美里将粉盒扔回抽屉，迅速关上。她拿起 SDAT，平躺下来，呼吸急促。根据以往的经验，她知道重大感染的首个征兆通常是皮疹。

She felt for the clasp of the necklace and fumbled with it, but her fingers were clammy and kept slipping off the slender metal hooks. A few moments passed before the necklace came free and she tossed it aside as if it were on fire.  
她摸索着项链的搭扣，但手指湿滑，总是从细小的金属钩上滑落。过了好一会儿，项链才被解开，她像扔掉烫手山芋一样把它甩到一旁。

She forced herself to calm down.  
她强迫自己冷静下来。

_It's probably just a reaction from the locket_.  
可能只是那块锁链的反应。

_That doesn't quite make sense though_, she thought. _I've worn gold earrings and stuff before and had no adverse reactions._  
但她觉得这说不通。我以前戴过金耳环之类的东西，并没有不良反应。

Perhaps the alloy was different from what she had worn before?  
或许是合金与她之前戴的不同？

That made more sense. 这样更有道理。

She heard Namika's voice passing by her room and considered asking her to take a look at it, but the thought of more needles and side effects drove that idea away.  
她听到娜美卡的声音从房间外经过，考虑让她帮忙看看，但想到更多的针和副作用，这个念头就打消了。

_It's just the locket_, Misato convinced herself. _So I'll just quit wearing it… and it'll all be fine_. She retrieved the necklace from the other end of the table and dropped it into a drawer, sliding it shut before replacing her earphones and depressing the play button on her SDAT.  
这只是个项链坠子，美里说服自己。那我就不戴了……一切都会好起来的。她从桌子的另一端取回项链，将其丢进抽屉，关上抽屉前重新戴上耳机，按下了 SDAT 上的播放键。

---

"Thanks." “谢谢。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Thanks for agreeing to go through this," Asuka murmured quietly.  
“谢谢你同意这么做，”明日香轻声低语。

Shinji looked at her quizzically. She shook her head and looked away. Pen-pen gave her a curious look.  
真嗣疑惑地看着她。她摇了摇头，转过脸去。Pen-pen 好奇地看了她一眼。

It had been her idea to move back to Misato's apartment. Surprisingly, it had not taken long to win The Commander's approval (after all, the First managed alone; why couldn't the Second and Third?). Telling Hyuga-san had been harder. Ritsuko took it upon herself to break the news to him, stressing that he had done nothing wrong, just that the Children would like to be back home. Even so, the technician was gloomily quiet as he pulled into the parking spot beside Misato's old blue car.  
搬回美里小姐的公寓是她提出的主意。出乎意料的是，赢得指挥官的同意并没有花费太多时间（毕竟，第一适格者一个人也能应付；为什么第二和第三适格者就不行呢？）。告诉日向先生则更为困难。律子主动承担了告知他的任务，强调他并没有做错什么，只是孩子们希望回到家中。即便如此，这位技术员在将车停靠在美里旧蓝色汽车旁边时，依然显得阴郁而沉默。

He got out of the car without looking at either of them and popped open the trunk. Shinji followed and quickly made to take out the boxes. Asuka, feeling as if she were living in some sort of a morbid haze, was the last out of the car.  
他下车时没有看她们中的任何一个，径直打开了后备箱。真嗣紧随其后，迅速上前搬出箱子。明日香感觉自己仿佛生活在一个病态的迷雾中，是最后一个下车的。

"Let me carry that," Hyuga-san offered. Shinji shook his head vehemently.  
“让我来拿吧，”日向先生提议道。真嗣坚决地摇了摇头。

"No, no, it's fine—I can handle it."  
“不，不，没事的——我能应付。”

_I'm not doing my part_, Asuka thought. She circled the car slowly and took one of the boxes in her hand. A large strip of masking tape held it closed and bore the words _Andenken von Deutschland._  
我没有尽到自己的责任，明日香心想。她缓缓绕着车走了一圈，拿起一个箱子。一大条胶带封住了箱子，上面写着‘德国记忆’。

_How long ago it seems, that I packed this box_. _I never even bothered to open it_.  
仿佛已经过去很久了，那时我打包了这个箱子。我甚至从未费心打开过它。

"I think that's it—Shinji, are you sure you don't want any help?"  
"我想就是这里了——真嗣，你确定不需要帮忙吗？"

"Yes; err—thank you, Hyuga-san."  
"是的；呃——谢谢你，日向先生。"

Asuka could almost feel invisible fingers of etiquette prodding her in the back; quickly she added, "Thank you."  
明日香几乎能感觉到无形的礼仪之手指在背后戳她；她迅速补充道："谢谢。"

"_Wark_," Pen-pen chimed in.  
"Wark," 企鹅潘-潘附和道。

"You're both very welcome." He lifted a hand in brief farewell. "Feel free to come back at any time."  
"你们太客气了。" 他举手简短地告别。"随时欢迎回来。"

Shinji took three boxes and Asuka took two, both declining to have the technician walk upstairs with them. The elevator ride was silent, and when it stopped Shinji balanced his boxes on one knee in order to free up a hand so that he could open the door.  
真嗣拿了三个箱子，明日香拿了两个，两人都婉拒了技术员陪同上楼的提议。电梯里一片寂静，到达时真嗣将箱子放在一个膝盖上，腾出一只手来开门。

"It's so quiet," Asuka whispered as the door slid open.  
“这里真安静，”明日香轻声说道，门缓缓滑开。

The apartment was in disarray, as almost three months had passed since anyone had inhabited its rooms. The boxes that Asuka had left half-packed were still strewn across the hallway. A thick layer of dust covered the tabletop.  
公寓一片凌乱，几乎三个月无人居住。明日香留下的半打包箱子仍散落在走廊上。桌面上覆盖着一层厚厚的灰尘。

It took them some time to get settled in again. Shinji locked the door behind them and Asuka opened the windows to let in some fresh air; Pen-pen _warked_ loudly until Shinji found him a can of beer. They turned on the TV purely for the sake of having some noise to break the dead silence, ignoring the fact that only soap operas were on.  
他们花了些时间重新安顿下来。真嗣在他们身后锁上门，明日香打开窗户让新鲜空气进来；Pen-pen 大声叫着，直到真嗣找到一罐啤酒给他。他们打开电视，纯粹是为了打破死寂，尽管只有肥皂剧在播放，他们也毫不在意。

Asuka wiped down the tabletops while Shinji decided not to go shopping, for which she was glad. She didn't want to be left alone for any reason. They ate pancakes since the only thing Shinji could find was a box of dry pancake mix. Neither touched the beer. Neither spoke for the most part, either; the only sound was of Pen-pen drinking his beer eagerly. Hyuga-san had not been an avid drinker and Pen-pen had dearly missed his beer.  
明日香擦拭着桌面，而真嗣决定不去购物，这让她感到庆幸。她不想因为任何理由被独自留下。他们吃了煎饼，因为真嗣唯一能找到的是一盒干煎饼粉。两人都没碰啤酒。大部分时间也都没说话；唯一的声音是 Pen-pen 急切地喝着啤酒。日向先生并不是个爱喝酒的人，而 Pen-pen 非常想念他的啤酒。

Nighttime was a different issue. Asuka had looked forward to sleeping in her own bed again, but now she could not rely on TV to tire her to the point where she could fall asleep as soon as all was quiet. Instead the redhead lay awake, shivering beneath her cold blankets.  
夜晚则是另一回事。明日香曾期待再次睡在自己的床上，但现在她无法依赖电视让她疲惫到一安静下来就能入睡。相反，红发女孩躺在床上，在冰冷的毯子下瑟瑟发抖。

The heat came unexpectedly to life with only a soft growl before dying to a faint hum, but it was one that nevertheless made her jump. _I shouldn't be scared of such stupid things_, Asuka admonished herself, _seriously, what am I turning into?_  
暖气意外地启动，只发出一声轻微的咆哮，然后又变回微弱的嗡嗡声，但这足以让她吓一跳。我不应该害怕这种愚蠢的东西，明日香自责道，说真的，我这是变成什么了？

She wondered if Shinji was asleep.  
她想知道真嗣是否已经睡着了。

Asuka drew the blankets up to her nose and pulled her legs up closer to her body, rubbing her cold feet. Maybe she ought to open the window; a little noise might help her to settle down—the quietudeof her once-familiar room was now altogether much too eerie.  
明日香把毯子拉到鼻子下面，将双腿蜷缩得更靠近身体，揉搓着冰冷的脚。也许她应该打开窗户；一点噪音或许有助于她安定下来——她曾经熟悉的房间此刻静得太过诡异。

The Second Child walked to the window, rubbing her arms as she did so. Tokyo-3 was still alight outside; many buildings continued to cast soft glows of yellow light from their curtainless windows. The grove of trees beneath her had been reduced to a gray smudge in the darkness. Asuka tilted her head, looking for the NERV building, where Misato was residing.  
第二适格者走到窗前，边走边搓着双臂。第三新东京市依然灯火通明；许多建筑物的无帘窗户继续投射出柔和的黄色光芒。她下方的那片树丛在黑暗中已化作一片灰色的模糊。明日香侧过头，寻找着 NERV 总部大楼，那是美里所在的地方。

_You don't belong there, Misato…you belong here, at home…  
你不属于那里，美里……你属于这里，在家……_

The window wouldn't budge, and all Asuka got for her efforts were cold hands. However, instead of clambering back into bed, Asuka picked up her blankets, sheets, and pillow and tiptoed over to Shinji's room.  
窗户纹丝不动，明日香的努力只换来了冰冷的双手。然而，她没有爬回床上，而是拿起毯子、床单和枕头，蹑手蹑脚地走向真嗣的房间。

She slid the door open an inch and whispered, "Shinji… are you still awake?"  
她将门拉开一寸，低声问道：“真嗣……你还没睡吗？”

No response. 没有回应。

Asuka let herself in and closed the door silently behind her. Shinji lay facing the wall, his shape only vaguely distinguishable under the thick blanket. The girl threw her cargo to the ground and spread out the sheet on the floor.  
明日香自己进了门，悄无声息地关上身后的大门。真嗣面朝墙壁躺着，厚厚的毯子下只能隐约看到他的轮廓。女孩将行李扔到地上，展开地上的床单。

_I really must be going crazy_.  
我一定是真的疯了。

But nevertheless, she lay down, drew the blanket over her shivering body, and slept better than she had in weeks.  
但尽管如此，她还是躺了下来，拉过毯子盖住自己颤抖的身体，睡得比几周以来都要好。

---

She was awakened hours later by the sunlight streaming in through the frozen windowpanes. Asuka stretched, realized it was cold, and quickly retracted her arms. It took her a moment to remember where she was.  
几个小时后，阳光透过结霜的窗玻璃洒进来，她被唤醒了。明日香伸了个懒腰，意识到天气很冷，迅速缩回了手臂。她花了一会儿时间才想起自己身在何处。

She hadn't remembered the floor being so soft…  
她不记得地板有这么柔软……

Asuka propped herself up on her elbows and realized, to her horror, that she was in Shinji's bed.  
明日香用胳膊肘撑起自己，惊恐地意识到她正躺在真嗣的床上。

Fortunately, Shinji was not also in it.  
幸运的是，真嗣并不在床上。

She looked to her right and saw that Shinji was fast asleep on the floor, under her blanket and pillow.  
她向右边看去，发现真嗣正裹着她的毯子和枕头，在地板上熟睡着。

"What the hell?" “搞什么鬼？”

Shinji shifted, muttering something indistinguishable, and she quickly said nothing more. Asuka remembered that her clothes were still in their cardboard box and hurried to find some warm clothing. After a warm shower she felt sufficiently awake and headed to the kitchen.  
真嗣挪了挪身子，咕哝着什么听不清的话，她便立刻不再多言。明日香记起自己的衣服还在那个纸箱里，急忙去找些保暖的衣物。洗了个热水澡后，她感觉精神多了，便朝厨房走去。

There really was nothing but beer and pancakes. Asuka pushed all the alcohol away impatiently and uncovered a loaf of bread, only to find it crusted with blue mold. In disgust, she flung it into the trashcan and scrubbed her hands viciously over the sink despite the fact that they had only come in contact with the plastic wrap.  
真的除了啤酒和煎饼什么都没有。明日香不耐烦地把所有酒都推开，揭开一条面包，却发现上面长满了蓝霉。她厌恶地把它扔进垃圾桶，尽管双手只是碰到了塑料包装，还是用力在洗手池里搓洗。

_I guess I'll have to make pancakes again… and we'll drink water.  
看来我又得做煎饼了……我们就喝水吧。_

Shinji walked in just as she was getting flustered at having burned three in a row.  
真嗣走进来时，她正因为连续烧焦了三个而感到慌乱。

"Here, let me do it," he murmured, suppressing an enormous yawn, "don't flip it just yet, give it a minute more—"  
“来，让我来吧，”他低声说着，强忍住一个巨大的哈欠，“别急着翻面，再等一分钟——”

"But then it burns," Asuka complained, removing her spatula and frowning at the batter that remained stuck to the metal surface. Shinji took it gently from her hands, wiped off the batter, and flipped it over perfectly. The moist side sizzled in the heat.  
"但那样会烧焦的，" 明日香抱怨道，取下锅铲，皱眉看着粘在金属表面上的面糊。真嗣轻轻地从她手中接过锅铲，擦掉面糊，完美地翻了个面。湿润的那一面在热气中滋滋作响。

"Hey," Asuka asked, "why was I in your bed last night?"  
"嘿，" 明日香问道，"为什么我昨晚在你的床上？"

"Well… you were cold as an icicle on the floor after having kicked your blanket off, and I figured that my bed was probably a lot more comfortable than the floor."  
"嗯……你把毯子踢掉后，地板上冷得像冰柱一样，我想我的床肯定比地板舒服多了。"

"That doesn't explain _how_ I got into _your_ bed though."  
"那可没解释我怎么跑到你床上去的。"

Shinji blushed. "I…er…put you there."  
真嗣脸红了。"我……呃……把你放那儿的。"

"You WHAT?" "你干了什么？"

"S-sorry…" Shinji turned away, his head lowered.  
“对-对不起…” 真嗣转过头去，低下了头。

Asuka thought about it and shook her head with a sigh. "You're forgiven. Or maybe I should be thanking you for it. Your bed is a lot nicer than the floor."  
明日香想了想，叹了口气摇摇头。“我原谅你了。或许我还该谢谢你呢。你的床比地板舒服多了。”

She shook her head again and left the kitchen. Shinji gave the pancake a final flip to make sure that both sides were sufficiently cooked and slid it onto a plate, all the while pondering this change in his roommate. _Only a few weeks ago she would have killed me for doing what I did…_  
她再次摇了摇头，离开了厨房。真嗣最后翻了一下煎饼，确保两面都煎得恰到好处，然后将其滑到盘子上，同时思考着室友的这种变化。仅仅几周前，她还会因为我做的事而杀了我呢…

He smiled to himself as he turned off the heat.  
他自顾自地笑了笑，然后关掉了炉火。

---

"Morning, Misato."  "早安，美里。"

"Hey." The Major didn't turn her head. "What's the date?"  
"嘿。" 这位少校没有转头。"今天几号？"

"December 16. Why?" "12 月 16 日。怎么了？"

"Lost track of the days."  
"日子过得糊涂了。"

Namika frowned a little at this. "Is something wrong?"  
听到这话，娜美卡微微皱眉。“有什么不对劲吗？”

"No."

"Misato—look at me." "美里——看着我。"

Slowly, as if it took great effort, Misato turned to face the doctor, revealing her flushed face. Namika took caution in keeping the worry out of her expression as she placed a hand to Misato's forehead.  
慢慢地，仿佛费了很大力气，美里转过身来面对医生，露出了她通红的脸。奈美香小心翼翼地不让担忧显露在脸上，她把手放在美里的额头上。

"I'm going to take your temperature, just in case," she explained smoothly, fumbling for an electronic thermometer in one of the lower drawers of Misato's bedside table. Several anxious moments passed while they waited for a reading.  
"我要给你量一下体温，以防万一，""她流畅地解释道，在一旁的床头柜抽屉里摸索着找电子体温计。他们焦虑地等待着，几秒钟仿佛过了很久。

"It's not very high," Namika commented. Her comment failed to draw any sort of response from the patient. "You haven't been experiencing any other symptoms, have you?"  
"它并不算很高," 纳美卡评论道。她的评论并未引起病人的任何反应。"你没有经历其他症状，对吧？"

_The locket_. 那条项链。

There was no point in hiding it longer. Misato undid the first button of her hospital gown to reveal the rash, which now had spread to cover an area about the size of her hand. Namika's eyes widened considerably.  
再隐藏下去也没有意义了。Misato 解开了病号服的第一颗扣子，露出那片皮疹，现在已经扩散到大约手掌大小。纳美卡的眼睛明显睁大了许多。

"How long have you had that?" she demanded.  
"你那东西有多久了？" 她质问道。

"About a week…" "大约一周了……"

"Why didn't you tell me?"  
"你为什么不告诉我？"

"I thought it was just from the locket Maya gave me."  
"我以为这只是玛雅给我的那个小盒子的缘故。"

Namika groaned. 奈美卡呻吟了一声。

Misato sighed and braced herself for another round of treatments.  
美里叹了口气，准备好接受新一轮的治疗。

---

Kaji was driving from Nagoya back to Tokyo-3, his third such trip in two days. Of course, he would have much rather flown, but these choices were never for him to make. At least they allowed _him_ to drive; there were few things Kaji hated more than security officers following him about. He took the beachside road and drank in the seascape as the car droned down the narrow road. A small sigh escaped his lips as he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.  
加治正从名古屋驱车返回第三新东京市，这是他两天内的第三次行程。当然，他更愿意乘飞机，但这些选择从来不是由他决定的。至少他们允许他开车；没有什么比安全官员紧随其后更让加治讨厌的了。他沿着海滨公路行驶，随着车子在狭窄的道路上缓缓前行，他尽情欣赏着海景。他轻轻叹了口气，手指在方向盘上敲打着。

His cell phone rang. Kaji wondered briefly whether or not to answer it.  
他的手机响了。加治短暂地犹豫了一下是否要接听。

"Ah, why not." “啊，为什么不呢。”

It was Ritsuko, explaining that Misato had gone unexpectedly into a coma.  
是律子，解释说美里突然陷入了昏迷。

The car swerved. Kaji earned himself a loud beep and a string of colorful language from the driver behind him as he shouted into the phone.  
车子猛地一偏。因为对着电话大喊，加持引来了身后司机的一声响亮喇叭和一连串五颜六色的咒骂。

"We don't know yet!" Ritsuko yelled, so that he could hear her over the noise.  
“我们还不知道！”律子大声喊道，以便在嘈杂声中让他能听见。

Kaji pulled over. The angered driver behind him stopped momentarily to shake a fist in his face before taking off in a storm of dust. He concentrated on shifting his attention back to Misato, but couldn't find anything to say.  
加治靠边停车。后面那位愤怒的司机在他面前短暂地停了一下，挥拳示威，随后便在一片尘土中疾驰而去。他努力将注意力转回到美里身上，却找不到任何话可说。

That was, besides the one thing he didn't want to ask.  
除了那件他最不想问的事。

"Is she going to live?"  
“她会活下来吗？”

It was a long time before Ritsuko answered. "Miki says it's still too early to tell."  
过了很久，赤木律子才回答道：“美里说现在还太早，无法确定。”

Kaji cursed in German and thought he heard a sharp intake of breath on Ritsuko's end as he pulled back into the driving lane.  
加持在德语中咒骂了一声，他觉得赤木律子那边传来了一阵急促的吸气声，随后他回到了行车道上。

"Just get back here soon, will you?" Ritsuko's mechanically modified voice echoed in his head. "The Children are near inconsolable."  
“尽快回来，好吗？”赤木律子那经过机械改造的声音在他脑海中回响，“孩子们都快无法自持了。”

"I'm not surprised," Kaji replied.  
“我并不惊讶，”加持回答道。

Two hundred and sixty kilometers away, Ritsuko slowly put down the phone and temporarily rested her head against the doorframe of Namika's office. It was white and ridged, simplistic yet stylish. Ritsuko remembered the time she had thought Misato's blood had a whitish tinge on her hand. She backed away from the door.  
两百六十公里外，律子缓缓放下电话，暂时将头靠在美里办公室的门框上。那门框是白色且有棱纹的，简约而时尚。律子记得自己曾以为美里手上的血带有白色调。她从门边退开。

She knew that Namika was furious with herself for letting the situation fly out of her hands. The doctor was now constantly hovering over Misato's bedside, fiddling with the various tubes that were currently keeping her alive. In the few hours since the Major had lost consciousness, she had received several blood transfusions to bring up her low blood counts.  
她知道美里对自己让局势失控感到愤怒。医生现在不停地在美里床边徘徊，摆弄着那些维持她生命的各种管子。自从少校失去意识后的几个小时内，她已经接受了几次输血以提高她的低血细胞计数。

Ritsuko had taken care of informing Shinji and Asuka, both of whom had been at school and quite willing to skip the rest of classes to come over. However, as there wasn't particularly anything they could do to help, they were temporarily ordered to stay at school. Either she or Kaji would spend the night at Misato's apartment with them.  
律子已经通知了真嗣和明日香，他们当时都在学校，非常愿意逃掉剩下的课赶过来。然而，由于并没有什么特别能帮上忙的事情，他们被暂时命令留在学校。无论是她还是加持，都会在美里公寓里陪他们过夜。

Makoto and Aoba had been shocked, the former more so than the latter. Maya had completely fallen to pieces and insisted that the entire ordeal was her fault.  
真和与青叶都感到震惊，前者比后者更为强烈。摩耶完全崩溃了，坚持认为整件事是她的错。

"If only I had known, I would never have given her that necklace…" she sobbed. Medical knowledge could only comfort her to a nominal degree; regardless of Ritsuko's efforts to explain that her necklace had not caused the rash, Maya was not convinced.  
“如果我早知道，我绝不会给她那条项链……”她啜泣着。医学知识只能给她带来有限的安慰；尽管律子努力解释她的项链并非导致皮疹的原因，摩耶仍未被说服。

But outside of their private worlds, NERV continued to function. The Commander had displayed no emotion when Ritsuko had informed him of the situation—not that she had expected him to. His sole interest was that the progress of NERV not falter under these unexpected circumstances, and so the workers continued their construction. Testing continued as best as the technicians could manage. Ritsuko herself could hardly manage to keep her composure during the long hours she spent in the Geofront, and ran down to the hospital as often as she dared.  
但在他们的私人世界之外，NERV 依然在运转。当律子向他汇报情况时，司令官没有表现出任何情感——她也没指望他会。他唯一关心的是，在这些意外情况下，NERV 的进展不能停滞，于是工人们继续他们的建设。技术人员尽其所能继续测试。律子自己几乎无法在地下空间长时间保持镇定，她尽可能频繁地跑到医院去。

Kaji arrived at NERV within the hour, having apparently driven Misato-style for the remainder of the journey.  
卡 aji 在一个小时内抵达了 NERV，显然在剩下的旅途中以美里式的风格驾驶。

"Where are Shinji and Asuka?" he muttered glumly.  
“真嗣和明日香在哪里？”他沮丧地喃喃自语。

"Still at school," Ritsuko replied, checking her watch. The Commander would not stand for her being away for long. "Do you mind staying with them tonight?"  
"还在学校，" 律子回答，看了看手表。司令不会容忍她离开太久。"你介意今晚陪着他们吗？"

"That's fine. Look at me, Rit-chan—" he grasped her around the shoulders so that she was facing him— "how bad is it, really?"  
"那没问题。看看我，律子酱——" 他抓住她的肩膀，让她面对他—— "真的有多糟糕？"

"If she can survive this weekend…" Ritsuko looked away for a split second. Kaji shook her lightly. "…she'll have a much improved chance."  
"如果她能挺过这个周末…" 律子转开视线一瞬间。加持轻轻摇了摇她。"…她就会有更大的机会。"

---

Asuka was angry, very angry, even given the Second Child's usual temper.  
明日香很生气，非常生气，即便考虑到这位二号机驾驶员平时的脾气。

"WHY won't they let us see her?" she raged, ignoring the crowd that was gathering around her. "It's not like we've done anything important in school since I've gotten here!"  
“为什么他们不让我们见她？”她愤怒地咆哮着，无视周围聚集的人群。“自从我来到这里，我们在学校里就没做过什么重要的事！”

Hikari tried to console her, but she shook her friend off and pushed her way through the crowd, disappearing into a grove of leafless trees.  
光试图安慰她，但她甩开了朋友，推开人群，消失在一丛光秃秃的树丛中。

The class rep watched her anxiously, then shook her head and looked for Shinji. He was seated under a tree some distance away from the group of girls, accompanied by Kensuke and Toji. She felt a familiar thrill at the sight of the latter, but pushed it away. Now was not the time.  
班长紧张地看着她，然后摇了摇头，寻找真嗣。他坐在离女生们有一段距离的树下，和健介、渡治在一起。看到后者，她感到一阵熟悉的激动，但还是压了下去。现在不是时候。

She knew Major Katsuragi, obviously not as well as Asuka, Shinji and Rei did, but she did consider her a nice woman. The thought that she was tottering on the edge of death made distressed Hikari greatly.  
她当然认识葛城美里少校，虽然没有明日香、真嗣和丽那么熟悉，但她确实认为她是个好人。想到她正徘徊在死亡边缘，光感到非常难过。

"And so close to Christmas too…"  
“而且离圣诞节这么近……”

If only there were something she could do. Hikari could cook and console, but she could not cure leukemia. The class rep sighed.  
如果她能做些什么就好了。光可以烹饪和安慰，但她无法治愈白血病。班长叹了口气。

She was the last thing on Asuka's mind as the Second continued to force her way through the woods, completely oblivious of the bare branches that clawed at her skirt. _Anger does not begin to describe how I feel_, she thought furiously, forcing herself to breathe. The initial anger at Dr. Akagi had faded somewhat, and was instead replaced by a fresher, brighter hatred for whatever mystical power had brought this fate upon them.  
当明日香继续强行穿过树林时，光是她脑海中最后想到的事情，完全没注意到裸露的树枝抓扯着她的裙子。愤怒甚至不足以形容我的感受，她愤怒地想着，强迫自己呼吸。对赤城博士的最初愤怒已经有所消退，取而代之的是对任何神秘力量将这种命运降临于他们的更强烈、更鲜明的憎恨。

She plowed on for some distance, wanting to get away from the noise of her schoolmates. _How petty of them, to moan like that about boys and clothes_. Asuka's hands clenched into fists. _Why US? Why Misato?_  
她继续前行了一段距离，想要远离同学们的喧闹声。他们为了男孩和衣服而那样抱怨，真是太幼稚了。明日香双手紧握成拳。为什么是我们？为什么是美里？

There were no answers to her questions.  
她的疑问没有得到任何答案。

Asuka pounded her fist into a nearby oak, but the great tree responded only with silence. The girl slowly tipped her head back, squinting at the sky—it was not quite definable as "sunny", but nevertheless hard for her to look at with her eyes fully open. A large black bird took wing from a bare branch above her. Asuka shook her head, closing her eyes tightly and refusing to open them for fear that the inevitable tears wouldcome.  
明日香一拳砸向旁边的橡树，但那棵大树只是沉默以对。女孩缓缓地仰起头，眯着眼睛望向天空——那并不算得上是“晴朗”，但对她来说依然刺眼。一只黑色的大鸟从她头顶的枯枝上振翅飞起。明日香摇了摇头，紧紧闭上双眼，不敢睁开，生怕泪水会不自觉地涌出。

Slowly she slid down to the ground and sat at the foot of the tree, leaning against its coarse bark, cold and withered with age.  
她慢慢地滑坐到地上，靠在树干旁，倚着那粗糙、冰冷且因岁月而枯萎的树皮。

"Arrrgh…" “啊……”

Asuka opened her eyes. Her eyelashes were crusted with teardrops.  
明日香睁开双眼。她的睫毛上还挂着泪珠。

She hugged her folded legs to her body, the anger dissipating quickly, but immediately being replaced by feelings she couldn't quite describe. Feelings she hated. Feelings that she had trampled down deep inside her and plastered away behind a concrete wall because she never wanted to feel them again.  
她紧紧抱住蜷缩的双腿，怒气迅速消散，随即被一些难以名状的情感所取代。这些情感让她憎恶，是她曾深埋心底、用混凝土墙封存起来的，因为她再也不想体验它们。

Feelings that had coursed through her the day her mother died.  
在她母亲去世的那天，她心中涌动的情感。

She felt like a little girl again.  
她感觉自己又变成了一个小女孩。

Asuka groaned, angry with herself now, but unable to stop the droplets of worry and anguish that fell from her blue eyes.  
明日香呻吟着，现在对自己感到愤怒，却无法阻止忧虑和痛苦的泪珠从她蓝色的眼睛中滑落。

_I…I'm the best of the Eva pilots;_ she thought. _I have the highest grades in the class. I've broken eight school swimming records since I arrived here._  
我……我是 Eva 驾驶员中最出色的；她想。我的成绩在班上名列前茅。自从来到这里，我已经打破了八项学校游泳记录。

_But none of that will save Misato_.  
但这些都无法拯救美里。

_I can't do anything_. 我什么也做不了。

How she wished at that moment, that leukemia existed in the form of a huge angel. She would have dearly loved to stamp upon it, fire upon it, rip it to pieces. But she had no power against tiny malignant cells.  
那一刻，她多么希望白血病能以一个巨大的天使形态存在。她真想狠狠地踩在它身上，向它开火，将它撕成碎片。但她对那些微小的恶性细胞无能为力。

Something crackled behind her. Asuka turned instinctively in the direction of the noise. Had somebody come for her? Hikari?  
有什么东西在她身后噼啪作响。明日香本能地转向声音的方向。是有人来找她了吗？光？

"Better not be Shinji…" She raked a sleeve across her damp eyes.  
“最好别是真嗣……”她用袖子擦了擦湿润的眼睛。

It wasn't Shinji. It was a squirrel, apparently trying to decide whether or not she would hurt him if he attempted to cross in front of her. It hesitated for some time, studying the girl with his beady black eyes, then flew across the ground and was gone in a flash.  
那不是真嗣。是一只松鼠，显然正在犹豫如果他试图从她面前穿过，她是否会伤害他。它犹豫了一会儿，用它那双黑色的小眼睛打量着女孩，然后飞快地穿过地面，一闪而逝。

Reluctantly, Asuka rose to her feet and brushed the dirt off of the back of her skirt. Her feet carried her without instructions from her mind, and her hand moved instinctively some fifteen minutes later to open the doorknob. The teacher paused midsentence as every head in the class swung in her direction.  
阿斯卡不情愿地站起身，拍了拍裙子后面的尘土。她的双脚在没有意识指令的情况下带着她移动，十五分钟后，她的手本能地伸向门把手。老师话说到一半停了下来，全班同学的目光都转向了她。

Asuka did not meet any of their eyes as she quietly shut the door behind her and took her seat.  
明日香没有与任何人对视，她静静地关上门，坐到了自己的座位上。

---

Shinji was silent the entire way home, which was quite usual for him. However, Asuka was also silent, and that he did not find normal; nevertheless, he didn't question her behavior. Their cell phones had rung again just as they stepped out of the school—it was Ritsuko, again, to tell them that they were to head directly home and not to take the train to NERV. When Asuka protested weakly, Ritsuko informed her that the next day would be Saturday and that they would be free to visit Misato then.  
回家的路上，真嗣一直沉默不语，这对他来说很平常。然而，明日香也同样沉默，这让他觉得不寻常；尽管如此，他并没有询问她的行为。他们刚走出学校，手机又响了——又是律子，告诉他们直接回家，不要乘电车去 NERV。当明日香微弱地抗议时，律子告诉她第二天是周六，他们可以在那时去见美里。

They did not speak on the train either. Shinji sat to Asuka's right and held his bag close while Asuka let hers dangle loosely from her hand by one of its straps, the majority of the weight resting on the floor of the train.  
在电车上他们也没有说话。真嗣坐在明日香右边，紧紧抱着他的包，而明日香则让她的包用一根带子松松地挂在手上，大部分重量靠在电车地板上。

Kaji was waiting for them at the door, his face set in hard lines that betrayed the severity of the situation. Asuka ignored him and went directly to her room.  
加持在门口等着他们，他的脸绷得紧紧的，透露出情况的严重性。明日香无视他，直接回了房间。

"Kaji?" "加持先生？"

"Yes, Shinji?" "什么事，真嗣？"

_I can trust him not to lie to me_, Shiniji thought sadly, as he broached the topic with caution. "How bad is it?"  
"真嗣悲伤地想，他可以信任加持不会对他撒谎，于是小心翼翼地提出了那个话题。“情况有多糟糕？””

"Very bad." Kaji coaxed him out of the doorway so that he could shut and lock the door. "I'm not going to lie to you, Shinji…they're not sure if she'll even make it through the weekend."  
“非常糟糕。”加治哄着他离开门口，以便能关门上锁。“我不打算骗你，真嗣……他们不确定她是否能撑过这个周末。”

He watched as Shinji thought this over.  
他看着真嗣思考着这些。

Asuka, meanwhile, had busied herself piling up all the furniture against the door, more because she needed something to do than to avoid Shinji and Kaji. Mental exercises such as algebra problems wouldn't do. She needed something physical to do.  
与此同时，明日香忙于将所有家具堆在门口，与其说她需要这样做来避免真嗣和加治，不如说她需要找点事情做。像代数题这样的脑力活动已经不够了。她需要一些体力活来分散注意力。

When that was over with, she flopped herself onto her bed and lay down.  
事情结束后，她一头栽倒在床上躺了下来。

"Why…" “为什么……”

_Why did she have to get sick? She can't die now…she's much too young…  
为什么她会生病？她现在不能死……她还太年轻……_

_Mama died when she was not much older than Misato is now.  
妈妈去世时，年纪并不比现在的美里大多少。_

_She's still too young to die…  
她还太年轻，不该死去……_

_Do you consider Misato better than your mother, then?  
那么，你是否认为美里比你的母亲更好呢？_

"No," Asuka whispered defiantly, "she's not better than my mother, she'll never be my mother."  
“不，”明日香倔强地低声说，“她不如我母亲，她永远不可能成为我的母亲。”

Silence. 沉默。

_Why do I care? She's not my mother.  
我为什么要在乎？她又不是我母亲。_

Asuka buried her face into her pillow and refused to breathe, because she knew that when she did it would come out as a choking cry.  
明日香将脸埋进枕头，拒绝呼吸，因为她知道一旦呼吸，那将会变成哽咽的哭泣。

_I promised myself, when I came here, that I wouldn't grow attached to anyone here. For me, there is only Kaji; for me, there is only Deutschland.  
我曾对自己承诺，来到这里后，不会对任何人产生依恋。对我来说，只有卡吉；对我来说，只有德国。_

_But I broke that promise… I let Misato in… and Shinji, argh…baka Shinji…  
但我违背了那个承诺……我让美里进入了我的生活……还有真嗣，啊……笨蛋真嗣……_

She pressed the pillow closer to her face.  
她将枕头紧紧压在脸上。

_Air_, her lungs reminded her, _air…_  
空气，她的肺提醒她，空气……

Shinji and Kaji winced simultaneously as the loud, heartbreaking sob echoed from Asuka's room.  
真嗣和加持同时皱眉，阿斯卡房间里传来的响亮、令人心碎的哭泣声回荡着。

---

She woke before dawn the next morning, her eyes reddened and swollen. It was cold, and she made no effort to get out of the bed. Her gaze fell on the German calendar hanging from the edge of her windowsill. It was December 21.  
第二天清晨，天还未亮她就醒了，双眼红肿。天气很冷，她没有起床的打算。目光落在窗台边缘挂着的德文日历上。那是 12 月 21 日。

_Winter vacation has begun,_ she realized. _I didn't even say goodbye to Hikari on the last day of school._  
寒假开始了，她意识到。我在学校最后一天甚至没和光说再见。

She remembered Christmases in Germany. By this time, Kaji would have set up a magnificent tree—Christmas trees were a German tradition, after all—and he would sit back and let her decorate it, with the aid of a ladder.  
她回忆起在德国的圣诞节。到了这个时候，加治应该已经布置好了一棵壮观的圣诞树——毕竟圣诞树是德国的传统——然后他会坐在一旁，让她借助梯子来装饰它。

"_Don't you think this one would look so pretty up near the top, Kaji-kun?"_  
“你不觉得这个放在靠近顶端会很好看吗，加治君？”

"_Hm… I think it looks better off the to side."_  
"嗯……我觉得放在旁边看起来更好。"

_Little Asuka, not aged more than eight years old, climbed to the top of the ladder and stood on tiptoe to place the glass star where she saw fit. The ladder toppled over, throwing her into Kaji, who in turn fell into the Christmas tree. The tree broke in half and Kaji was very sore for some days, but Asuka was unhurt and had even managed to guard her precious star ornament_.  
小小的明日香，不超过八岁，爬到梯子顶端，踮起脚尖将玻璃星星放在她认为合适的位置。梯子翻倒了，她摔向了加持，加持也随之倒向了圣诞树。树断成了两截，加持好几天都感到疼痛，但明日香毫发无损，甚至还保护了她珍贵的星星装饰。

Asuka smiled dryly, the magic of that moment gone. Her expression changed dramatically as she thought of Misato. The Second Child leapt out of bed and ran to the window, searching half-heartedly for the familiar NERV building, as she had secretly done every night.  
明日香干笑了一下，那一刻的魔力消失了。她的表情突然变得严肃，想起了美里。第二适格者跳下床，跑到窗前，半心半意地寻找着熟悉的 NERV 大楼，就像她每晚偷偷做的那样。

She looked at the mass of furniture stacked against her door and sighed. Well, she wasn't going to get more sleep anyway; might as well start taking it down—unless she wanted to exit her room through the window. Asuka found a jacket to keep herself warm and got to work. When everything was finally back where it belonged, she slowly slid open the door and took a step into the dark hallway.  
她看着堆在门前的家具堆，叹了口气。反正也睡不着了，不如开始搬开它们——除非她想从窗户出去。明日香找了件夹克保暖，然后开始动手。当一切终于归位时，她缓缓推开门，踏入了昏暗的走廊。

"_Wark!"_ “Wark！”

"Pen-pen?" “Pen-pen？”

She got a disgruntled penguin sneeze in return. "What are you doing here?"  
她得到了一只不满的企鹅喷嚏作为回应。“你在这里做什么？”

Had the apartment been sufficiently lit, she would have seen Pen-pen throw her a disgusted look before waddling off to find somewhere else to sleep.  
如果公寓里的光线足够明亮，她就会看到 Pen-pen 向她投去一个厌恶的眼神，然后摇摇摆摆地去找别的地方睡觉。

She saw the reason for his discomfort a few moments later. The light was on in the kitchen, and she could hear water boiling—the stove, after all, was not far from his usual sleeping place.  
几分钟后，她明白了他的不适原因。厨房的灯亮着，她能听到水沸腾的声音——毕竟，炉子离他通常睡觉的地方并不远。

"Kaji-kun?" “加持君？”

He was dressed loosely, in an old university t-shirt and overly large pants. Asuka noticed dark circles under his eyes as he turned to greet her without a smile.  
他穿着随意，一件旧大学 T 恤和过于宽松的裤子。当他转身向她打招呼时，脸上没有笑容，明日香注意到他眼下的黑眼圈。

She edged closer for a better view. "You're making German dumplings."  
她小心翼翼地靠近，以便看得更清楚。“你在做德国饺子。”

"Tradition," he muttered shortly.  
"传统，"他简短地咕哝道。

Asuka smiled wryly in spite of herself, temporarily lost in the past. "Yeah, you always made them for breakfast…"  
尽管心中苦涩，明日香还是不由自主地笑了，一时沉浸在过去的回忆中。"是啊，你总是做早餐时做这些……"

"Yeah." He dipped his fingers into a small bowl of flour and spread the residue over the countertop. "Made them for Katsuragi too, some years ago."  
"是啊。"他手指蘸了点小碗里的面粉，在台面上涂抹开来。"几年前也给葛城做过。"

"Oh."

The conversation died then, as Kaji was clearly not eager to speak. Asuka stayed for a few moments longer, watching him drop the raw dumplings into the hot water. She cast a glance toward the oven's clock; it was not quite six.  
对话随即中断了，显然加持并不急于开口。明日香又停留了几分钟，看着他将生饺子一个个丢进滚烫的水中。她瞥了一眼烤箱上的时钟；还不到六点。

Shinji did not wake until seven-thirty, by which time Asuka had forced herself to complete most of her homework (a task that had been made much more pleasant by Kaji's dumplings, which were every bit as delectable as she remembered). The Third Child greeted his roommates gloomily before disappearing quickly into the bathroom to shower. Kaji made sure that he ate his share of the dumplings, and then the three set off for NERV.  
真嗣直到七点半才醒来，此时明日香已经强迫自己完成了大部分作业（这多亏了加持的饺子，它们和她记忆中一样美味）。第三适格者阴郁地向室友们打了个招呼，然后迅速躲进浴室洗澡。加持确保他吃了自己的那份饺子，随后三人动身前往 NERV。

As was custom, Shinji entered from the left side of the car and seated himself in the back. Kaji settled himself into the driver's seat, and Asuka chose to sit as his side. Shinji stole frequent glances at her and noticed that she did not fawn over the older man as usual, but laid her head against the window and stared out into the cold environment.  
按照惯例，真嗣从车左侧进入，坐在了后排。加持坐进驾驶座，明日香则选择坐在他旁边。真嗣不时偷瞄她，注意到她没有像往常那样对年长的男人献殷勤，而是将头靠在车窗上，凝视着外面的寒冷环境。

---

He tried to convince himself that she was just sleeping. At any moment, her eyes would register the slightest bit of movement and their guardian would jump out of bed, exclaiming, "I knew it! Admit it, you've liked Asuka all this time!"  
他试图说服自己她只是在睡觉。随时，她的眼睛会微微一动，他们的守护者就会从床上跳起来，惊呼：“我就知道！承认吧，你一直都喜欢明日香！”

But this was no prank. Misato did not sleep in such—well, decent positions.  
但这不是恶作剧。美里不会以这样——嗯，体面的姿势睡觉。

Shinji glanced at Asuka. Her eyes were downcast and focused on her toes. He turned his gaze instead to the lamp they had made for her. It was off now, the pieces of glass dark from lack of light.  
真嗣瞥了一眼明日香。她的目光低垂，专注于自己的脚趾。他转而看向他们为她做的那盏灯。现在它关着，玻璃碎片因缺乏光线而显得暗淡。

The doctor stepped in, temporarily breaking the silence to place Kaji's bouquet of flowers on her bedside table. Kaji nodded briefly in thanks and smoothed a lock of hair away from Misato's face. His earlier words echoed in Shinji's head.  
医生走了进来，暂时打破了沉默，将加持送的花束放在她的床头柜上。加持微微点头致谢，轻轻将一缕头发从美里脸上拨开。他之前的话在真嗣脑海中回响。

_I'm not going to lie to you, Shinji…they're not sure if she'll even make it through the weekend.  
我不会对你撒谎，真嗣……他们不确定她是否能撑过这个周末。_

Misato had been here many times for him before, when he had been unconscious after battles, but this was the first time he had had to sit by her side and wonder if she would ever open her eyes again. Only now did he truly understand what his guardian had been through.  
美里曾多次在他战斗后昏迷时守在他身边，但这是他第一次不得不坐在她身旁，担心她是否还会再次睁开眼睛。直到现在，他才真正理解了他的监护人所经历的一切。

It suddenly occurred to him that Misato was not much older than his mother at the time of her death.  
他突然意识到，美里其实比他母亲去世时的年纪还要小。

_She's been like a mother to us_.  
她对我们来说就像母亲一样。

Asuka would not have shared that point of view, he thought, turning slightly to look at the girl again. Her eyes remained focused on Misato's expressionless face, but held just a faint trace of dampness.  
他想，明日香肯定不会这么看。他微微转头再次看向女孩。她的目光依旧紧盯着美里那毫无表情的脸庞，但眼中隐约带着一丝湿润。

Kaji reached over and turned on the light, casting a soft glow on Misato's face.  
加持伸出手，打开了灯，柔和的光线映照在美里脸上。

"Looks better that way, don't you think?"  
“这样看起来好多了，你不觉得吗？”

Neither pilot answered him.  
两位驾驶员都没有回应他。

They left the lamp on when they left, at Asuka's request.  
他们离开时按照明日香的要求留下了灯。

---

On day two of winter break Shinji awoke early to the sound of feminine chattering in the kitchen. Hikari was here and had brought a large platter of sugar cookies fresh from the oven. Each cookie had been cut into the shape of a Christmas tree, a heart, or a star, then sprinkled with colored sugar.  
寒假第二天，真嗣一大早就被厨房里女性的闲聊声吵醒。光子来了，还带来了一大托盘刚出炉的糖饼干。每块饼干都被切成了圣诞树、心形或星星的形状，并撒上了彩色糖粒。

"Ikari!" Hikari greeted him.  
“碇君！”光子向他打招呼。

"Hi, Miss Horaki," he mumbled, not quite wanting to face the girl. Quickly he disappeared into the kitchen, not noticing Hikari's crestfallen look.  
"你好，碇小姐，"他含糊地打了个招呼，不太想面对这个女孩。他迅速躲进了厨房，没注意到碇唯失望的表情。

"Oh, don't bother with him," Asuka muttered. "He's just… been off recently."  
"哦，别管他了，"明日香咕哝道。"他只是……最近有点不对劲。"

"Because of Miss Katsuragi?" Hikari guessed, and Asuka's eyes clouded over. "Asuka…I know you're very hurt and all, but shouldn't you be feeling more considerate towards him since you know what he's going through?"  
"是因为葛城小姐吗？"碇唯猜测道，明日香的目光变得阴沉。"明日香……我知道你很受伤，但既然你知道他在经历什么，难道不应该对他更体贴一些吗？"

"I guess," she mumbled. "我想是吧，"她咕哝道。

Hikari took a cookie and bit into it, chewing thoughtfully. "Asuka, if you'd rather I not be here intruding, I can go home at any time. I don't want to inconvenience you, especially so early in the morning."  
光拿起一块饼干咬了一口，若有所思地嚼着。"明日香，如果你觉得我在这里打扰了你，我可以随时回家。我不想给你添麻烦，尤其是在这么一大早。"

"No." For a moment Asuka was almost tempted to reach out and grab Hikari's arm, but held herself back. "Damn it, Hikari, you're the only person in this place who's not moping. Shinji's barely spoken in the last few days, and Kaji, well, given the relationship he and Misato had, you can imagine how he's reacting…"  
"不。"有那么一会儿，明日香几乎想伸出手去抓住光的胳膊，但还是忍住了。"该死，光，你是这里唯一一个没有垂头丧气的人。真嗣这几天几乎没怎么说话，而加持，他和美里之间的关系，你可想而知他现在是什么反应……"

The door to Misato's room slid open and Asuka colored a bit, expecting a light reprimanding from Kaji for having spoken about his love life behind his back.  
Misato 房间的门滑开了，Asuka 微微脸红，以为 Kaji 会因为她在背后谈论他的爱情生活而轻声责备。

"Kaji-kun—" "Kaji 君—"

"It's not Kaji," a feminine voice said. Ritsuko Akagi ran a hand through her blonde hair, already neat and groomed. "Hello, Miss Horaki."  
"不是 Kaji，"一个柔和的女声说道。Ritsuko Akagi 用手梳理了一下她那已经整齐的金发。"你好，Horaki 小姐。"

Asuka blinked as Hikari jumped to her feet and bowed. "Dr. Akagi."  
明日香眨了眨眼，看着光希跳起来鞠躬。"赤城博士。"

"Kaji said he would be staying with Misato and coming back sometime in the night, so we were not to wait for him," the Second protested weakly.  
"加持说他会在美里那里过夜，晚上某个时候回来，所以我们不用等他，"二号机驾驶员无力地抗议道。"

"Yes, and he's finally gone home to get some sleep, so I'm taking over for the time being," she replied curtly before entering the kitchen. "Morning, Shinji."  
"是的，他终于回家睡觉了，所以我现在暂时接手，"她简短地回答，然后走进厨房。"早上好，真嗣。"

"M-morning, Dr. Akagi." "早…早上好，赤木博士。"

"Ritsuko'll do outside of NERV." She poured herself a cup of coffee and drank deeply. "Finished your homework yet?"  
"在 NERV 之外，叫我律子就行了。"" 她给自己倒了杯咖啡，深深地喝了一口。""作业做完了吗？"

"Er…not quite…" "呃…还没完全…"

Asuka turned slowly to look at Hikari, her eyes wide with astonishment.  
明日香缓缓转身看向光，眼中满是惊讶。

_How can she be doing this?_ she wondered silently, watching Ritsuko go about the kitchen as if she owned everything. _As if everything was just fine._  
她怎么能这样？她默默地想着，看着律子在厨房里忙活，仿佛一切都是她的。仿佛一切都很好。

Pen-pen warked, and Asuka half-heartedly tossed him half a cookie.  
企鹅 Pen-pen 叫了一声，明日香半心半意地扔给他半块饼干。

Hikari stood up and gracefully pushed in her chair. "I should probably be getting home now, since Nozomi and Kodama will be awake soon." She reached across the table to hug Asuka. "Take care."  
光站起身来，优雅地将椅子推回原位。“我可能该回家了，因为望和儿玉很快就要醒了。”她伸手越过桌子拥抱明日香。“保重。”

---

Today was by far the most miserable day of Shinji's life—at least that he could remember—and that was saying a lot. He sighed and glanced down at his incomplete work, a mumbo-jumble of numbers of terms that seemed quite incomprehensible to him now. Shinji's gaze fell upona single digit, a roughly penned 3.  
今天无疑是真嗣一生中最悲惨的一天——至少是他能记得的——而这已经说明了很多。他叹了口气，瞥了一眼未完成的工作，一堆杂乱无章的数字和术语，现在看来颇为费解。真嗣的目光落在一个潦草的数字 3 上。

_3 whats? 3 meters, 3 yard, 3 miles? 3 train stops from here to NERV?  
3 什么？3 米，3 码，3 英里？从这里到 NERV 的 3 站火车？_

It didn't matter. Shinji sighed and put down his pencil.  
这无关紧要。真嗣叹了口气，放下手中的铅笔。

Nothing had happened all day. The Third Child remembered one dreadful experience when Eva-01 lay prostrate upon the ground, waiting for the Angel to crush it. Thissuspense was not all that different, Shinji thought. He could not help fully expecting the worst, and had nearly lost it when a few hours ago the phone had begun to ring.  
一整天什么都没发生。第三适格者记得有一次可怕的经历，当时 EVA-01 躺在地上，等待使徒将其碾碎。这种悬念并没有太大不同，真嗣想。他忍不住完全预期最坏的情况，几个小时前电话开始响的时候，他几乎崩溃了。

He had been sitting at the dinner table and Asuka lying on the couch, studying the ceiling. The Third's hands clenched into fists, nails digging into his palm, while the Second turned her face away to avoid looking at the doctor.  
他坐在餐桌旁，而明日香躺在沙发上，盯着天花板。第三适格者的双手紧握成拳，指甲深深陷入掌心，而第二适格者则转过脸去，避免看向医生。

Dr. Akagi answered it, and they watched nervously for any body gestures that might hint about the nature of the call. There were none.  
赤木博士接了电话，他们紧张地观察着她是否有任何肢体动作暗示通话的性质。但什么也没有。

When it was over, the blonde simply replaced the receiver, sighed, and moved out of the room. The two pilots looked at each other.  
通话结束后，金发女子只是放下听筒，叹了口气，便离开了房间。两位驾驶员面面相觑。

Shinji, feeling a small bubble of hope, said quietly, "No news is good news, right?"  
真嗣感到一丝希望的泡沫升起，轻声说道：“没有消息就是好消息，对吧？”

Asuka glared at him before climbing reluctantly off the sofa and disappearing into her room. Wondering what he'd done wrong this time, Shinji retired to his room as well and decided to start his homework. He did not wish to have Dr. Akagi reprimanding him for low grades.  
明日香瞪了他一眼，不情愿地从沙发上爬下来，消失在自己的房间里。不知道这次又做错了什么，真嗣也回到自己的房间，决定开始做作业。他可不想让赤木博士因为成绩差而训斥他。

Through the door he heard a door slam and Dr. Akagi call, "Where are you going, Asuka?"  
透过门，他听到一声门响，赤木博士喊道：“你要去哪儿，明日香？”

"Out," the Second called, and Shinji heard the door shut.  
“出去，”第二适格者喊道，真嗣听到门关上了。

Shinji placed his head on the table and covered his ears, hoping that Dr. Akagi would not come into his room despite the closed door. It occurred to him that perhaps Asuka had taken a leaf out of his book and was running away, at least for the time being, even if it was only to Hikari's.  
真嗣把头靠在桌上，捂住耳朵，尽管房门紧闭，他仍希望赤木博士不会进到他的房间。他突然想到，或许明日香从他那儿学了一招，正在逃避，至少暂时如此，哪怕只是逃到光那里。

Some time later Shinji rose from his chair and made his way to the window, only to see Asuka's red hair standing out against the white snow. She had both hands tucked in her pockets and was walking away from the building at a steady rate.  
过了一会儿，真嗣从椅子上站起来，走向窗边，只见明日香红色的头发在白雪中格外显眼。她双手插在口袋里，稳步远离建筑。

He wondered where she was going.  
他好奇她要去哪里。

---

"Excuse us." “打扰一下。”

Asuka moved woodenly over and the middle-aged lady stepped in front of her, pulling a young child by the hand. The boy was shouting off a long list of the items he wanted for Christmas, and his mother hastened to tell him not to make a scene.  
明日香木然地挪开位置，一位中年女士牵着一个小男孩的手走上前来。男孩正大声念叨着一长串他想要的圣诞礼物，他的母亲连忙告诉他不要在大庭广众下闹腾。

_Maybe I shouldn't have come_, Asuka thought. _It's too cheery here_.  
也许我不该来，明日香心想。这里太欢乐了。

Contrary to what Shinji thought, she had not been running away to Hikari's. Some twenty minutes after leaving the apartment, Asuka had found herself in the middle of the local shopping district, with no idea how she had arrived. The Second leaned against the wall of a candy shop and watched the shoppers, arms laden with variously sized packages, file past her. Some sang Christmas carols or hummed to themselves as they moved, and others paused from time to time to admire all the decorations that the stores had put up. Most of the snow had either melted from all the footsteps or was becoming increasingly dirty. Every once in awhile a car would drive by and splash the shoppers with muddy water.  
与真嗣所想相反，她并没有逃到光那里。离开公寓约二十分钟后，明日香发现自己置身于当地的商业区中心，全然不知是如何到达的。第二适格者靠在一家糖果店的墙上，看着购物者们手提大小不一的包裹从她面前经过。有些人唱着圣诞颂歌或自顾自地哼着曲子，还有些人时不时停下来欣赏商店挂起的各种装饰。大部分积雪已被行人踩化或变得愈发肮脏。偶尔会有车辆驶过，溅起泥水洒向购物者。

She blended into the crowd and traveled within it for some time before coming to a stop in front of a clothing store. Asuka pushed open the door and entered.  
她融入人群中，随之一段时间后，在一间服装店前停下。明日香推开门，走了进去。

Her movements caused a medley of small bells hung above the door to begin ringing, and the clerk looked up with a smile. Asuka recognized her as the one who, so many months ago, had told her that she looked lovely in the dress Hikari had pressured her to buy.  
她的动作触发了门上悬挂的一串小铃铛，发出清脆的响声，店员随即抬头微笑。明日香认出她就是几个月前告诉自己穿上光逼她买的那条裙子看起来很美的那位。

"May I help you?" "需要帮忙吗？"

"No," Asuka glanced over her shoulder and was relieved to see that her item of choice was still here. "I know what I'm here for."  
"不用，" 明日香回头瞥了一眼，庆幸她选中的物品还在。"我知道我来这里的目的。"

"Oh." The lady looked slightly taken aback. "Are you sure you wouldn't like any help?"  
"哦。" 那位女士看起来有些意外。"你确定不需要任何帮助吗？"

And then Asuka realized it. The woman didn't remember her as the proud _adult_ that had come here to shop so many days ago. Her short hair and sad eyes were making her look younger than she had expected. Instead of making her stronger, Misato's ordeal had changed her into a _child_. The clerk was seeing her as a child.  
然后明日香意识到了。那位女士不记得她是那个骄傲的成年人，曾在这么多天前来这里购物。她短短的头发和悲伤的眼神让她看起来比预期的更年轻。米莎的磨难并没有让她变得更坚强，反而将她变成了一个孩子。店员把她当成了一个孩子。

"Yes, I'm very sure," Asuka stated, and stepped around her, making her way directly to the rack. Once there, she paused for a moment to regain her composure.  
“是的，我非常确定，”明日香说道，绕过她，径直走向衣架。一到那里，她停顿了一下，重新调整自己的情绪。

It was still there, the maroon dress that she had tried on last summer, the price slashed for the holiday season but still hovering at a handsome sum. Asuka slipped it off the hanger and brought it to the register.  
那件酒红色的裙子还在，就是她去年夏天试穿过的那件，节日季价格被砍了一刀，但依然维持在一个可观的数字。明日香从衣架上取下它，拿到收银台。

One of the benefits of being a NERV pilot was that she received a generous salary; after all, mankind's survival depended on them. Asuka drew out her wallet from a pocket on the inside of her jacket and handed over her credit card. The clerk wished her a Merry Christmas as she left the store with her purchase in a seasonal bag.  
成为 NERV 驾驶员的好处之一是她能获得丰厚的薪水；毕竟，人类的存亡系于他们之手。明日香从夹克内侧口袋里掏出钱包，递过信用卡。店员祝她圣诞快乐，她带着装在节日包装袋里的商品离开了商店。

She took her time getting home. She had her cell phone, after all, and they could easily reach her if there was an angel attack. Asuka clenched her free hand into a fist, trying to retain as much warmth as she could.  
她不急不忙地往家走。毕竟她有手机，一旦有使徒袭击，他们随时可以联系到她。明日香紧握着空着的那只手，试图尽可能多地留住温暖。

She paused a short distance away from the apartment building, recalling fond memories as the cherry tree came into sight.  
她在离公寓楼不远处停下脚步，看到那棵樱花树时，温馨的回忆涌上心头。

It was bare now, its branches empty and forlorn, but Asuka made her way over to it, her footsteps leaving even prints in the snow. The last time that she had stopped to see this tree, she had spent the day insulting Misato over every little aspect of her life. The memory made Asuka blush with shame and guilt, and she turned away, promising herself mentally that as soon as it bloomed, she would bring Misato a large sprig of the flowers.  
如今它光秃秃的，枝桠空荡而凄凉，但明日香还是走了过去，她的脚印在雪地上留下均匀的痕迹。上次她驻足观赏这棵树时，曾一整天对美里生活的方方面面冷嘲热讽。这回忆让明日香羞愧难当，她转过身去，暗自许诺等花开时，一定要给美里带一大束花。

---

"I can't believe we're doing homework on Christmas Eve."  
“真不敢相信我们居然在圣诞夜做作业。”

The doorbell rang, cutting off her rant.  
门铃响起，打断了她的抱怨。

Asuka and Shinji glanced at each other across the table at which they were collaborating on a science project.  
明日香和真嗣在合作科学项目的桌子对面互相对视了一眼。

"Can't be anything bad, they'd call us if it was," Asuka said cryptically. Shinji thought this over and went to open the door.  
"不会是什么坏事，如果是的话他们会叫我们的，"明日香神秘地说道。真嗣思考了一下，然后去开门。

"Ayanami!" "绫波！"

Asuka jumped out of her chair as Rei stepped in, wearing a faded brown coat that was much too large for her. Ice crystals glistened in her hair.  
明日香从椅子上跳了起来，当绫波走进来时，她穿着一件褪色的棕色大衣，对她来说太大了。冰晶在她头发上闪闪发光。

"Do you… do you want a change of clothes?" she blurted, as Rei removed her snow-caked shoes. _Did I really just say that? I offered Wondergirl MY clothes?_  
“你…你想换件衣服吗？”她脱口而出，看着绫波脱下结满雪的鞋子。我真的这么说了吗？我居然提出把自己的衣服给三无少女穿？

"I would appreciate that very much," Rei stated calmly, "if it would not inconvenience you, Pilot Sorhyu."  
“我会非常感激，”绫波平静地说，“如果不麻烦你的话，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”

"Uh, yeah," Asuka mumbled. "My room's this way."  
"呃，是的，" 明日香咕哝道。"我的房间在这边。"

She fetched Rei a towel and made her way back to the main room after showing the First Child to her room. Shinji was idling, waiting for them to come back.  
她给绫波拿了条毛巾，并在带第一适格者到她房间后，回到了主房间。真嗣正无所事事地等着她们回来。

"That was really nice of you," he said quietly.  
"你真是太好了，" 他轻声说道。

Asuka bristled. "Now don't be getting all mushy on me, Third Child… she was wet, was I supposed to let her freeze?" She dwelled awhile on some random thought. "I wonder what's in her bag?"  
明日香皱起眉头。“现在别跟我来这套肉麻的，第三适格者……她浑身湿透了，我难道该让她冻着吗？”她沉思了一会儿，想着些无关紧要的事。“不知道她包里有什么？”

"I don't know…" Shinji stared at the wet backpack, the one she carried to school and back every day. It was zipped tightly and gave no hint of its contents.  
“我不知道……”真嗣盯着那个湿漉漉的书包，那是她每天上学放学都背着的。它拉得紧紧的，看不出里面装了什么。

The owner appeared a moment later, dressed in an overly large shirt that read "_Ich bin Stolz, Deutsch zu sein_" and a pair of Asuka's old jeans. It appeared that she had selected the oldest and most frayed clothes, not wanting to be an inconvenience.  
过了一会儿，书包的主人出现了，穿着一件过大的衬衫，上面写着“Ich bin Stolz, Deutsch zu sein”，以及一条明日香以前的旧牛仔裤。她似乎选择了最旧、磨损最严重的衣服，不想给别人添麻烦。

"Oh, honestly, Wondergirl…" Asuka ran off to her room, muttering, "It's not like I'll kill you if you borrow some clothes."  
"哦，老实说，奇迹少女……" 明日香跑回她的房间，嘀咕着，"借几件衣服又不会要了你的命。"

Shinji tried to strike up a conversation.  
真嗣试图挑起话题。

"Umm…what's in your bag?"  
"嗯……你包里装的是什么？"

Rei responded by plucking out three packages of different sizes; one was wrapped in blue paper, one red, and one purple. Shinji felt an uneasy situation at what he knew was coming, but Asuka had saved him from having to speak.  
丽回应着，拿出了三个不同尺寸的包裹；一个用蓝色纸包裹，一个红色，还有一个紫色。真嗣感觉到即将发生的事情让他不安，但明日香替他解了围，让他不必开口。

"Put these on, Wondergirl… and what are you doing?"  
“把这些穿上，三无少女……你在做什么？”

"I have brought Christmas presents," Rei stated matter-of-factly. "And thank you for lending me these clothes, Pilot Sorhyu."  
“我带来了圣诞礼物，”丽平静地陈述道，“谢谢你借给我这些衣服，惣流驾驶员。”

Asuka glanced over Rei's shoulder at Shinji, as if to ask, "Did you know about this?"  
明日香从绫波的肩头瞥向真嗣，仿佛在问：“这事你知道吗？”

Shinji shook his head furiously and held up both hands as if to say, "What are we going to do?"  
真嗣疯狂地摇头，双手举起，似乎在说：“我们该怎么办？”

"Well, seeing as we haven't got a tree…" Asuka's sentence drifted off. Her gaze fell on the leafy plant beside the entrance to the kitchen. "Well, it's not the most convenient place, but… do you want to place them there?"  
“好吧，既然我们没有树……”明日香的话音渐渐消失。她的目光落在了厨房入口旁的那株绿叶植物上。“虽然不是最方便的地方，但……你想把它们放在那里吗？”

Rei did so, and Shinji quickly followed her, saying, "You really shouldn't have done this, Ayanami—we—we're—"  
丽照做了，真嗣迅速跟上她，说道：“你真的不该这么做，绫波——我们——我们——”

"It is customary to give presents at Christmastime, is it not?" she countered quietly.  
“圣诞节送礼物不是惯例吗？”她平静地反驳道。

"Yes, well…" Shinji blushed.  
“是的，嗯……”真嗣脸红了。

Asuka's mind was spinning. Within the last minute, Wondergirl had showed up, brought her presents, and she had given Wondergirl her clothes. Now a new worry faced her: amidst all the recent angst, she had not put any thought into Christmas presents.  
明日香的大脑一片混乱。就在最后一分钟，奇迹少女出现了，带来了礼物，而她则把衣服送给了奇迹少女。现在一个新的担忧摆在她面前：在最近的种种焦虑中，她完全没有考虑过圣诞礼物的事情。

"Erm… would you like to stay for dinner?" Shinji invited.  
“呃……你愿意留下来吃晚饭吗？”真嗣邀请道。

Rei rose to her feet. "I shall not inconvenience you further," she insisted, turning to Asuka. "Thank you again for the clothing."  
绫波站起身来。“我不会再给您添麻烦了，”她坚持道，转向明日香。“再次感谢您的衣物。”

"Hey, you can't go now," Asuka found herself protesting. "It's… it's dark outside. You'll get mugged or something. And it's cold."  
"嘿，你现在不能走，" 明日香发现自己不由得抗议道。"外面……天黑了。你会被抢劫什么的。而且很冷。"

The door opened behind Asuka and Dr. Akagi stepped out, buttoning up the front of her jacket as she did so. She stiffened upon encountering Rei, who simply focused on her with large red eyes.  
门在明日香身后打开，赤城博士走了出来，一边扣上夹克的前襟。她一见到绫波，身体便僵住了，而绫波只是用她那双大大的红眼睛注视着她。

"I'm going to the hospital and probably won't be back until late," she warned them. "There's money on the table. Order something if you'd like."  
"我要去医院，可能要到很晚才能回来，" 她警告她们。"桌上有钱。如果你们愿意的话，可以点些东西吃。"

Shinji turned to Rei as the door shut. "See, you won't be of any inconvenience—I won't have to cook extra or anything."  
门一关上，真嗣转向绫波。“看吧，你不会造成任何不便——我不需要多做或额外准备什么。”

Rei glanced toward the door, thinking of Dr. Akagi. She would not like to meet the doctor on her way home. She accepted Shinji's invitation.  
绫波瞥向门口，想起了赤城博士。她不想在回家的路上遇到博士。于是她接受了真嗣的邀请。

Asuka found the number of a local restaurant and made the call. Less than fifteen minutes later, the doorbell rang.  
明日香找到了一家当地餐厅的电话并拨了过去。不到十五分钟，门铃响了。

"Technology sure is fast these days," Asuka commented.  
“现在的科技真是快得惊人，”明日香评论道。

They ate in silence, punctuated only occasionally with a comment about school. Asuka grumbled about the lack of swim classes in winter and to her surprise, Rei commented quietly that she did too. For a moment Asuka was temporarily taken aback by her courage to speak, then remembered the times that Rei had beaten her in the pool and chose to remain silent while she tried to decide what to do. Instead she lowered her head and stabbed at a piece of pork with her chopsticks. Rei had chosen the vegetarian course and seemed to be enjoying it. Shinji had chosen somewhat of a mix between the two girls' choices.  
他们默默地吃着饭，偶尔穿插几句关于学校的评论。明日香抱怨冬天游泳课的缺乏，令她惊讶的是，绫波也轻声附和说她也有同感。有那么一会儿，明日香被她的勇气所打动，随后想起了绫波在泳池中击败她的那些时刻，决定保持沉默，同时思考该如何应对。相反，她低下头，用筷子戳着一块猪肉。绫波选择了素食，看起来吃得津津有味。真嗣的选择介于两位女孩之间。

He finished first and excused himself for a moment, leaving Asuka and Rei alone. Surprisingly, it was the latter who spoke first.  
他最先吃完，并为自己暂时离开表示歉意，留下明日香和绫波独处。出乎意料的是，首先开口的是绫波。

"Have you been to visit Misato recently?"  
"你最近去看过美里吗？"

Asuka stabbed at her food miserably. "Yeah. It was really hard to see her like that." She turned away, annoyed at herself for showing weakness.  
明日香痛苦地戳着她的食物。“嗯。看到她那样真的很难受。”她转过头去，对自己表现出软弱感到恼火。

"When did you go?" "你什么时候去的？"

"Two, maybe three days ago?"  
"两三天前吧？"

"I see." “我明白了。”

The conversation died abruptly, leaving Asuka to wonder about Rei's motives. Shinji reappeared a moment later, looking slightly preoccupied.  
对话突然中断了，留下明日香对绫波的动机感到疑惑。真嗣片刻后又出现了，看起来有些心事重重。

"Ayanami, it's snowing furiously outside. I don't think it would be in your best interests to try going home in this condition; you might be better off spending…the night here…"  
"绫波，外面雪下得很大。我觉得在这种条件下回家对你不太好；你或许最好在这里过……夜……"

"I cannot do that," Rei protested. "I have already imposed enough on you and Pilot Sorhyu by staying for dinner and borrowing clothes."  
"我不能这么做，" 丽抗议道，"我已经给你们添了太多麻烦，留下来吃晚饭还借了衣服。"

"I'm sure Asuka wouldn't mind sharing a room with you," Shinji pressed, hoping that this move wouldn't get him killed.  
"我相信明日香不会介意和你共住一间房的，" 真嗣坚持道，心里祈祷这一举动不会让他丧命。"

The redhead nodded without looking up from her food.  
红发女孩点了点头，目光依旧没有离开她的食物。

The Third Child did the dishes and cleared up while Asuka laid out a stack of blankets on the floor for the First. Rei decided that she would be fine sleeping in what she was wearing now, and Asuka figured it would be easiest to let her. She located a NERV complimentary set of toiletries in the bottom of one of the cabinets and handed that to Rei.  
第三适格者洗完碗并整理好厨房，而明日香则在地板上铺开一堆毯子给第一适格者。绫波决定她穿着现在的衣服睡觉就可以了，明日香觉得这样最方便，便随她去了。她在橱柜底部找到了一套 NERV 提供的洗漱用品，递给了绫波。

Later, Asuka had almost drifted off to sleep, when Rei suddenly said, "You are very upset about Misato."  
后来，明日香几乎要睡着时，绫波突然说道：“你对美里很生气。”

Asuka's eyes snapped open. "And you're not?" she whispered sarcastically.  
明日香的眼睛猛地睁开。“难道你不生气吗？”她讽刺地低声反问。

"I am," the First Child said quietly, "but I am concerned about your demeanor about the whole affair…it is not good to keep one's emotions bottled up as you have been doing."  
"我是，" 第一适格者平静地说，"但我担心你对整个事件的态度……像你这样压抑自己的情绪并不好。"

"Shut up," Asuka hissed. "I don't need you telling me how to handle this situation, damn it. You—you have absolutely no right to—"  
"闭嘴，" 明日香低声怒道，"我不需要你来教我怎么处理这种情况，该死。你——你根本没有权利——"

Images of her mother fluttered across her mind, silencing her.  
她母亲的形象在她脑海中闪过，让她沉默了。

Rei said nothing more. 丽没有再说什么。

Asuka turned her face to the wall and shut her eyes tightly, but it was a long time before sleep came to her.  
明日香把脸转向墙壁，紧紧闭上眼睛，但过了很久才睡着。

---

Ritsuko touched her friend gently on the shoulder. "Miki."  
律子轻轻地碰了碰她的朋友肩膀。“美里。”

The other doctor shook her head and remained hunched over her desk, sobbing quietly into her hands.  
另一位医生摇了摇头，依旧弓着身子伏在桌前，双手掩面低声啜泣。

"Misato needs you to hope for her, not cry for her," Ritsuko said quietly, and sighed. She was no good at this. "Miki, we know you did everything you could have to make her well. Nobody blames you—"  
"美里需要你为她抱有希望，而不是为她哭泣，"律子轻声说道，叹了口气。她不擅长这种事。"美纪，我们知道你已经尽了一切可能让她康复。没有人责怪你——"

"I do," Namika sobbed quietly.  
"我怪，"奈美卡低声啜泣道。

Kaji took an understanding but firm grip on Ritsuko's arm and led her out of the office and back to Misato's room. They didn't enter, but instead stood by the window where they could have a clear view of the Major.  
加持以一种理解但坚定的手势抓住了律子的手臂，带她离开了办公室，回到了美里房间外。他们没有进去，而是站在窗边，可以清楚地看到美里。

"This brings back bad memories for you, doesn't it?" he murmured.  
“这让你想起了不好的回忆，对吧？”他低声说道。

Ritsuko was silent a long while before she answered. "I couldn't handle my mother's death," she said quietly. "She wasn't much of a mother to me, and she was not all that well liked at Gehrin, but she was my only relative. Still, it was much easier to pretend that I didn't care."  
律子沉默了许久才回答。“我无法承受母亲的去世，”她轻声说，“她对我来说并不是一个好母亲，在格芬也不太受欢迎，但她是我唯一的亲人。尽管如此，假装不在乎要容易得多。”

"And your father?" Kaji promptly gently.  
"你父亲呢？" 加持温和地问道。

"I never met him, and I don't care to." The blonde threw back her dyed hair, her feigning of nonchalance failing as a dark curtain of gloom settled over her eyes.  
"我从没见过他，也不想见。" 金发女孩甩了甩染过的头发，故作无所谓的样子在她眼中笼上一层阴郁的阴影时失败了。

"I see." Kaji shrugged. "That's understandable."  
"我明白了。" 加持耸耸肩。"这可以理解。"

"This is a different situation, though. Last time I had only to deal with my own feelings. This time there's Shinji and Asuka."  
“但这次情况不同。上次我只需处理自己的感情。这次还有真嗣和明日香。”

"The whole situation is hurting Asuka much more than she wants to admit," Kaji commented. He gripped the windowsill tightly and mentally willed Misato to come back, not only for himself, but for Shinji and Asuka.  
“整个情况对明日香的伤害远比她愿意承认的要大，”加持评论道。他紧紧抓住窗台，心中默默祈祷美里能回来，不仅是为了他自己，也是为了真嗣和明日香。

Unbeknownst to him, Ritsuko mentally voiced the same prayer.  
他不知道的是，律子也在心中默默祈祷着同样的事情。

---

On Christmas Day Asuka awoke with her eyes swollen almost shut. She touched them gingerly and found them sticky and wet. Something in her dream had made her cry, but she could not recall it now.  
圣诞节那天，明日香醒来时双眼肿得几乎睁不开。她小心翼翼地触摸着，发现它们又粘又湿。梦中的某些东西让她哭了，但现在她却记不起来了。

She turned to her right and with some difficulty saw that Rei was gone, having folded her "bed" into a neat pile of blankets and pillows.  
她转向右边，费了些劲才看到绫波已经不在了，她的“床”被折叠成了一摞整齐的毯子和枕头。

It's Christmas, she thought.  
今天是圣诞节，她想。

She remembered and hastened to her closet, tearing out whatever might be suitable to give as gifts. There was an old tape of German lullabies that Kaji had given her when she was young; perhaps Shinji could listen to it on his SDAT. Now for Rei…  
她记起了什么，急忙跑到衣橱前，翻找着任何可能适合作为礼物的物品。有一盘卡兹在她年幼时送给她的德国摇篮曲磁带；或许真嗣可以用他的 SDAT 听听。现在轮到丽了……

Asuka searched frantically, finally emerging with a picture frame. It was covered with dust but the violets pressed between the two sides of the glass border were still as beautiful as ever. She grabbed an old T-shirt and scrubbed the glass as clean as she could, then slid out the picture of Kaji holding an eight-year-old Asuka. She'd find somewhere else to put that photograph later.  
明日香焦急地搜寻着，最终拿出一个相框。它布满灰尘，但夹在玻璃两侧的紫罗兰依然美丽如初。她抓起一件旧 T 恤，尽可能地将玻璃擦得干干净净，然后抽出了卡兹抱着八岁明日香的照片。她打算稍后再找个地方放这张照片。

She didn't have fancy wrapping paper, but the tape had a clear plastic case and she found a small souvenir bag in which to place it. Rei's picture frame she placed in an old box decorated with fake flowers. Asuka held their gifts in one hand and with the other, picked up Misato's dress.  
她没有精美的包装纸，但磁带有透明的塑料盒，她还找到了一个小纪念品袋来装它。丽的相框则被她放入一个装饰着假花的旧盒子里。明日香一手拿着礼物，另一手拿起美里小姐的裙子。

They were both outside waiting for her already. Asuka noted three more packages beneath the tree, and added hers to the pile.  
他们俩已经在门外等她了。明日香注意到树下还有三个包裹，便把自己的也放到了那堆里。

"Merry Christmas," Shinji greeted her.  
“圣诞快乐，”真嗣向她问候道。

"Yeah, you too," she said quietly. Asuka poured herself a large cup of hot coffee and sipped contentedly. "Where are Ritsuko and Kaji?"  
“嗯，你也是，”她轻声回应。明日香给自己倒了一大杯热咖啡，满意地啜饮着。“律子和加持在哪里？”

"Both at the hospital," Shinji answered her. He poured out a cup of coffee for Rei and finally one for himself. "They said they'd come back for lunch, though."  
"都在医院，" 真嗣回答她。他倒了一杯咖啡给丽，最后也给自己倒了一杯。"不过他们说会回来吃午饭。"

"What about Misato?" Rei interjected softly.  
"那美里呢？" 丽轻声插话道。

"I guess she'll be alone," Asuka murmured, staring into her cup. "How dreadful… maybe we should all go eat at the hospital so we can at least be near her." She looked around for support. "Right guys?"  
"我想她会一个人吧，" 明日香喃喃自语，盯着她的杯子。"真可怕……也许我们都应该去医院吃饭，至少能离她近一些。" 她环顾四周寻求支持。"对吧，大家？"

"I approve," Rei said quietly.  
"我同意，" 丽轻声说道。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Then that's settled. I'll call Kaji and tell him that." Asuka stirred her coffee and rubbed her hands together to keep warm.  
"那就这么定了。我会打电话给加持，告诉他这件事。" 明日香搅拌着咖啡，双手摩擦着取暖。

"Should we open presents now?" Shinji wondered aloud, as he carried two steaming plates over to the table.  
"我们现在可以拆礼物了吗？" 真嗣一边说着，一边端着两盘冒着热气的盘子走向餐桌。

"Yeah, except it's too crowded for all of us to squeeze around Misato's plant, so everyone go get your own presents and bring them over here."  
“是啊，只是 Misato 的植物周围太挤了，我们没法都围过去，所以大家各自去拿自己的礼物，然后带到这里来。”

There was a bit of holiday cheer as they tried to decide whose was whose, as the givers watched the receivers attempt to decide which present belonged to them without opening them. Rei's was not too hard to guess, as the red package was evidently Asuka's and the blue Shinji's. Shinji had made his overly easy by putting their names on their packages. Asuka's, however, were not color-coded and had no labels. Shinji, unfortunately, soon correctly guessed that his was a tape and decided that the other must belong to Rei, as Asuka had told them which was Misato's. None of them said anything about Misato's packages, leaving them where they were.  
他们试图分辨谁的礼物是谁的，送礼者看着收礼者尝试在不打开的情况下决定哪个礼物属于自己，气氛中带着一丝节日的欢乐。Rei 的礼物不难猜，红色的显然是 Asuka 的，蓝色的则是 Shinji 的。Shinji 过于简单地将他们的名字写在包装上。然而，Asuka 的礼物既没有颜色编码也没有标签。不幸的是，Shinji 很快正确猜到自己的是一盘磁带，并断定另一个一定是 Rei 的，因为 Asuka 已经告诉他们哪个是 Misato 的。关于 Misato 的礼物，他们都没有说什么，任由它们留在原地。

Asuka opened Rei's present first, to find a delicately crafted tree ornament, a glass flower made with different shades of pink. Shinji's was a snowflake of blue and white glass.  
Asuka 首先打开了 Rei 的礼物，发现是一个精巧的手工树饰，用不同深浅的粉色制成的玻璃花朵。Shinji 的则是一个蓝白相间的玻璃雪花。

Shinji hurried to find his SDAT in order to listen to Asuka's tape while the two girls opened his presents. They received identical pendants, a delicate glass rose hanging on a gold chain. Parts of the charm had been dyed red and green to match the petals and leaves.  
真嗣急忙去找他的 SDAT，想在两个女孩拆礼物时听明日香录的磁带。她们收到了相同的吊坠，一条金链上挂着精致的玻璃玫瑰。吊坠的部分被染成了红色和绿色，以匹配花瓣和叶子。

"Thank you for the picture frame, Pilot Sorhyu," Rei voiced, and Asuka could almost swear that she saw a hint of a smile grace Rei's face for a split second. "It is quite lovely."  
"谢谢你送的相框，索留香飞行员，"丽说道，明日香几乎可以发誓，她看到丽的脸上有一瞬间露出了微笑的痕迹。"非常漂亮。"

"You're welcome," Asuka mumbled. "And thanks for your present too." She fastened Shinji's pendant around her neck. "And you, Shinji."  
"不客气，"明日香咕哝道。"也谢谢你的礼物。"她把真嗣的吊坠系在脖子上。"还有你，真嗣。"

"It's nothing," Shinji mumbled. He appeared to be deeply entranced as he listened to the tape, and Asuka beamed.  
"没什么," 真嗣咕哝道。他似乎完全沉浸在听磁带中，而明日香则露出了灿烂的笑容。

---

Ritsuko didn't mind the idea of not going back to Misato's for Christmas Day lunch. In fact, she thought it was better this way, since Namika could be included in their celebration as well—there was no way that Namika was going to leave the hospital.  
律子并不介意不在美里家过圣诞节午餐的想法。事实上，她认为这样更好，因为奈美香也能参与到他们的庆祝中——奈美香是不可能离开医院的。

Kaji had purchased a large stack of festive plates and napkins, and now she spread these around the table while he placed a fork and knife at each place. They had chosen to eat in a small room off the corridor beside Namika's office, where staff parties were usually held. Maya, Shigeru, and Makoto were due to arrive any moment. They had extended an invitation to The Commander only out of duty, but he had not responded, and Ritsuko felt it safe to assume that he wouldn't show up.  
加持买了一大堆节日餐盘和餐巾纸，现在她正把这些东西铺在桌子上，而他则在每个座位上放好叉子和刀。他们选择在奈美香办公室旁边走廊的一个小房间里用餐，那里通常是举办员工聚会的地方。真耶、茂和真希波随时都会到达。他们出于职责邀请了司令，但他没有回应，律子觉得他不会出现是安全的假设。

She heard Maya calling her softly and turned around. "Come in and pick a place to sit."  
她听到玛雅轻声呼唤她，便转过身来。“进来找个地方坐吧。”

The pilots followed the technicians in and seated themselves in a row. Kaji commented on Asuka and Rei's matching necklaces, and they informed him that they had been gifts from Shinji. Kaji pulled out a camera and snapped a picture of the two girls together, promising a copy to both after he got it developed.  
飞行员们跟着技术人员走进来，依次坐下。加持注意到明日香和绫波戴着相同的项链，她们告诉他这是真嗣送的礼物。加持拿出相机，给两位女孩拍了张合影，承诺冲洗好后会给她们每人一份。

Dr. Ishiyama was the last to show up, her hair disheveled and her eyes red from crying. Ritsuko welcomed her with a hug and made her to sit at the head of the table.  
最后到场的是碇博士，她的头发凌乱，眼睛因哭泣而红肿。律子给了她一个拥抱，并让她坐在桌子的首位。

"None of us wanted to cook, so we ordered out," she explained apologetically.  
"我们都不想做饭，所以点了外卖，" 她抱歉地解释道。

Namika shook her head. "That's quite fine. It all looks very good."  
Namika 摇了摇头。"那挺好的。看起来都很不错。"

"Well then, dig in." "那么，开动吧。"

They did, with only Kaji pausing to fill everyone's glasses. It would have been a good occasion to share a few cans of beer, but given the condition of the beer-lover who should have been with them that day, the adults deferred and settled on juice and water.  
他们确实如此，只有加持停下来为大家倒满杯子。本是个分享几罐啤酒的好时机，但考虑到那天本应与他们同在的那位啤酒爱好者的情况，大人们选择了退让，改为喝果汁和水。

Shinji hadn't realized that he was so hungry. Days of not bothering to cook nor eat properly had taken their toll on him, but he hadn't noticed. The Third helped himself to large servings of everything in sight and ate hungrily.  
真嗣没有意识到自己如此饥饿。多日来既不做饭也不好好吃饭，已经对他造成了影响，但他并未察觉。第三适格者大口享用着眼前的一切，狼吞虎咽。

Rei declined the turkey but accepted a large helping of mashed potatoes and rice. Asuka, like Shinji, ate freely.  
绫波拒绝了火鸡，但接受了一大份土豆泥和米饭。明日香和真嗣一样，随意地吃着。

Ritsuko was helping herself to another spoonful of rice when she noticed her colleague picking at her food. She responded by splashing a large spoonful of mashed potatoes into Namika's plate. The doctor looked up, startled, and began to protest, but was silenced by Ritsuko's firm "Just eat it."  
当 Ritsuko 正为自己再添一勺米饭时，她注意到同事正挑拣着食物。她回应的方式是将一大勺土豆泥泼洒到 Namika 的盘子里。医生抬起头，吃惊地开始抗议，但被 Ritsuko 坚定的一句“快吃吧”给打断了。

She did, and Kaji took the opportunity to use his spoon to flick a few peas into her plate so that they landed neatly in the middle of her mashed potatoes.  
她照做了，Kaji 趁机用勺子弹了几颗豌豆到她的盘子里，它们恰好落在土豆泥中央。

"HEY!" Miki protested, but Kaji was laughing furiously now, and Ritsuko was joining in. The doctor retaliated by flinging her balled up napkin at him. It hit him in the eye, but didn't stop him from laughing. By now even Shinji was having a hard time trying to keep from laughing, and Asuka was giggling openly.  
“嘿！”Miki 抗议道，但 Kaji 已经笑得前仰后合，Ritsuko 也加入了笑声。医生反击，将揉成团的餐巾扔向他。餐巾击中了他的眼睛，但并未阻止他的笑声。此刻，就连 Shinji 也难以抑制笑意，而 Asuka 则毫不掩饰地咯咯笑了起来。

A sharp series of beeps silenced them all immediately. Namika jumped out of her chair and ran out of the room. Ritsuko did the same. Shinji and Asuka made to follow, but Kaji instructed them to sit down.  
一连串尖锐的哔哔声立刻让他们全都安静下来。娜美卡从椅子上跳起来，跑出了房间。律子也紧随其后。真嗣和明日香正要跟上，但加持示意他们坐下。

"Kaji!" Asuka protested. “加持！”明日香抗议道。

He silenced her with a finger on her lips. Presently Ritsuko came hurrying back.  
他用手指按住她的嘴唇让她安静。不一会儿，律子匆匆赶了回来。

"She's awake." “她醒了。”

---

_How long have I slept? Three days? A week? Maybe years.  
我睡了多久？三天？一周？或许已经好几年了。_

_It certainly feels like it.  
确实感觉如此。_

Somebody was shining a light in her eye, and Misato tried to turn her head away.  
有人正用光线照射她的眼睛，美里试图把头转开。

Somebody was repeating her name.  
有人在反复呼唤她的名字。

Somebody was holding her hand and patting it reassuringly.  
有人握着她的手，轻轻拍打着以示安慰。

_Too much attention_. 太过引人注目了。

But she forced herself to adjust to it slowly, opening her eyes millimeter by millimeter, to see Namika leaning over her and Kaji behind the doctor. She recognized Ritsuko's voice.  
但她强迫自己慢慢适应，眼睛一毫米一毫米地睁开，看到美香俯身在她上方，而加治在医生身后。她认出了律子的声音。

Misato tried to speak and found that she couldn't.  
美里试图说话，却发现她说不出来。

"There's a tube in your throat right now," Miki told her. Her eyes were swollen and red as she addressed Misato. "We should have it out by the end of the day."  
"现在你的喉咙里插着一根管子，"美纪告诉她。她的眼睛肿胀通红，对美里说道，"我们今天之内应该会把它取出来。"

She closed her eyes and opened them once to show that she understood.  
她闭上眼睛，又睁开一次，表示她明白了。

"Hey, Katsuragi." Kaji nodded to the doctor, who quickly moved aside. "Merry Christmas."  
"嘿，葛城。"加持向医生点头示意，医生迅速让开。"圣诞快乐。"

She couldn't begin to tell him how she felt…drained and empty, devoid of life. Nevertheless, she made an effort to nod when Kaji asked if she would like to see the three Children.  
她无法向他诉说自己的感受……筋疲力尽，空洞无物，仿佛失去了生命。尽管如此，当加持问她是否想见三位孩子们时，她还是努力点了点头。

If she had been able to, she would have cried upon seeing the relief flood Shinji's face as he hurried to her side. Rei stayed behind him, waiting her turn to speak, while Asuka crossed the room to get to her other bedside. Kaji briefly disappeared and reappeared a moment later with the pilots' presents.  
如果她能的话，看到真嗣脸上涌出的宽慰之情，她早已泪流满面，他急忙赶到她身边。绫波跟在他身后，等待着轮到自己说话，而明日香则穿过房间来到她的另一边床旁。加持短暂地消失了一会儿，随后带着飞行员们的礼物重新出现。

There was a moment of tension in which everyone was silent, wondering if Misato could open her own presents. The Major solved that problem herself—she would not let her kids down. She moved only one finger, but everyone understood that she wished to do it herself. Namika and Ritsuko moved some pillows around to help prop her up.  
有那么一刻，气氛紧张，大家都沉默不语，不知道美里是否能自己打开礼物。这位少校自己解决了这个问题——她不会让自己的孩子们失望。她只动了一根手指，但大家都明白她希望自己来做。美里和律子移动了一些枕头，帮助她坐起来。

She opened Shinji's first, refusing to let anyone help her despite her obvious difficulties, and found a pendant that identical to those of Asuka and Rei. Ritsuko fastened it around her neck, and Maya sighed in delight and commented about the fact that this pendant was glass and wouldn't cause any problems. If Misato minded the remark, she gave no hints.  
她首先打开了真嗣的礼物，尽管明显有困难，却拒绝让任何人帮忙。她发现了一个与明日香和丽所佩戴的完全相同的吊坠。律子将它系在她的脖子上，玛雅欣喜地叹息，并评论说这个吊坠是玻璃制成的，不会引起任何问题。如果美里介意这个评论，她没有表现出来。

Rei's was packaged with super sticky tape and gave her some trouble, even after Kaji encouraged her to just rip it up instead of attempting to preserve the paper. A third Christmas tree ornament emerged after she pulled open the box with trembling fingers. This one was white, simple and delicate, an angel floating in midair with its wings and dress billowing behind.  
丽的礼物被超粘胶带包裹着，给她带来了一些麻烦，即使加持鼓励她直接撕开而不是试图保留包装纸。在她颤抖的手指拉开盒子后，第三个圣诞树装饰品出现了。这个是白色的，简单而精致，一个天使悬浮在空中，翅膀和裙子在身后飘扬。

She tried again to speak but failed.  
她再次试图说话，但失败了。

Asuka's dress was still resting in its bag, and Misato drew it out slowly with effort before spreading it over her lap for everyone to admire. After everyone had done so and the females had touched the soft velvet, the Major motioned for a pen. Namika pulled out the notebook she normally used for giving prescriptions, along with a blue ink pen.  
明日香的礼服依旧静静躺在袋中，美里费力地缓缓取出，展开铺在膝上供大家欣赏。众人观赏过后，女性们轻抚着柔软的天鹅绒，美里示意拿支笔来。纳米卡掏出了她平时用来开处方的小笔记本，以及一支蓝墨水笔。

After unsuccessful several attempts, they all leaned forward to see what Misato had written: a simple, unpunctuated sentence.  
经过几次不成功的尝试后，他们都凑上前去看美里写了什么：一个简单、未加标点的句子。

_I'll wear it the day I come home  
我回家那天会穿上它_

---

Asuka fell asleep on Shinji's shoulder on the way home, and the latter received several "awwww!"s from other girls on the train. He blushed to himself, secretly being quite appreciative of the fact that Asuka was not awake to hear them.  
回家的路上，明日香靠在真嗣的肩膀上睡着了，后者在电车上收到了其他女孩们的几声“哎呀呀！”。他暗自脸红，庆幸明日香没有醒来听到这些。

The train rumbled to a stop, and Shinji gently shook her awake.  
电车隆隆地停了下来，真嗣轻轻地摇醒了她。

"Mm…don't want to go…" “嗯……不想走……”

The girls giggled hysterically and made Shinji blush even further as he tugged on Asuka's arm, muttering, "Come on!"  
女孩们歇斯底里地笑着，让真嗣的脸更红了，他拉着明日香的手臂，咕哝着：“快点！”

The cold air refreshed her a bit as they stepped out of the train station, and Asuka stretched her arms into the air and yawned before snapping them back into place and proclaiming that she hated the cold. Shinji smiled but said nothing. A few feet farther down the road, Asuka confided, "I'm really happy right now."  
走出火车站，冷空气让她稍微清醒了一些，明日香伸开双臂打了个哈欠，然后迅速收回，宣布她讨厌寒冷。真嗣微笑着，但没有说话。再往前走几步，明日香坦白道：“我现在真的很开心。”

"I am too," Shinji admitted. "I feel like I could… run into that field and build a snowman and just… I don't know… roll in the snow."  
“我也是，”真嗣承认道，“我感觉我可以……跑进那片田野，堆个雪人，然后……我不知道……在雪地里打滚。”

He shook his head, still expecting Asuka to yell at him. Instead, she stopped in her tracks and waited for him to notice that she was no longer beside him.  
他摇了摇头，依旧以为明日香会对他大吼大叫。然而，她却停下了脚步，等着他注意到她已不在他身旁。

"Why don't we?" “为什么不呢？”

"Eh?"

"You said it yourself—why don't we go build a snowman and roll in the snow?"  
“你自己说的——我们为什么不一起去堆个雪人，然后在雪地里打滚呢？”

"Because I've never built a snowman," Shinji mumbled, flustered now.  
"因为我从没堆过雪人，" 真嗣咕哝着，现在有些慌乱了。

"That's not an excuse. Come on." She grabbed him by the sleeve of his jacket and dragged him through the gates into the field, where she promptly pushed him over and began rolling him like a log through the snow.  
"那不是借口。快来。" 她抓住他夹克的袖子，拉着他穿过大门进入场地，随即把他推倒，开始像滚木头一样在雪地里滚他。

"Stop it! mmph! Snow tastes… bad…"  
"住手！唔！雪的味道……很难吃……"

Asuka giggled until she was hurting to let him stop, at which point he quickly took the opportunity to give her the same treatment.  
明日香笑得直喊疼，让他赶紧停下，他便趁机也给她来了同样的待遇。

"BAKA! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!" she shouted, through mouthfuls of snow.  
“笨蛋！我要杀了你！”她嘴里含着雪，大声喊道。

Shinji had never felt such exhilaration in his life as he let Asuka chase him around the field as she screamed out German and Japanese curses, both of them ducking and blinding hurling crudely made snowballs in the other's direction.  
真嗣这辈子从未感受过如此的兴奋，他让明日香追着他满场跑，她一边尖叫一边用德语和日语咒骂，两人互相躲避，胡乱地朝对方扔着粗制滥造的雪球。

NERV did not print maps of its facilities. After all, they did not regularly entertain tourists in a building where 95 of its contents were top secret.  
NERV 并未印制其设施的地图。毕竟，他们并不常在这样一个 95%内容都属绝密的大楼里接待游客。

So Asuka had some trouble getting there. In the few times that she had come before, Shinji had led the way and she had been content to follow without paying any attention. Now, however, she was alone, and the Second came to quite a few dead ends before the automatic sliding doors came into view.  
因此，Asuka 到达那里时遇到了一些麻烦。之前几次来访，都是 Shinji 带路，她只需跟随而不必留意。然而现在，她独自一人，在自动滑动门映入眼帘之前，Second 经历了好几次死胡同。

She didn't quite know where to go. A nurse clad in white approached her, bowing respectfully.  
她不太清楚该去哪里。一位身着白衣的护士向她走来，恭敬地鞠了一躬。

"Major Katsuragi is down this hallway, Pilot Sorhyu—"  
"葛城少校在这条走廊上，惣流驾驶员——"

"I'm not here to see Misato," she interjected. "I'm here to see Dr. Ishiyama."  
"我不是来找美里小姐的，"她打断道。"我是来找石山博士的。"

"Oh." The nurse hesitated, a bit taken back. "Her room is the third on the left, down the back hallway—"  
"哦。"护士犹豫了一下，有些意外。"她的房间在后面走廊左边第三间——"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

And she was off, tucking a lock of shorn red hair behind her ear. Several nurses passed her with quizzical looks. Asuka made no reaction and came to the soundproof wooden door at last.  
她随即出发，将一缕剪短的红发别到耳后。几名护士带着好奇的目光从她身边经过。明日香没有任何反应，最终来到了那扇隔音的木门前。

**Dr. Namika Ishiyama 石山波香博士**

She knocked twice. 她敲了两下门。

"Come in." "进来吧。"

The doctor was surprised to see her. Ritsuko had warned her that the Second Child was not an easy one, and she braced herself mentally.  
医生见到她时颇为惊讶。律子曾提醒过她，二号机驾驶员可不是个好对付的角色，她已经做好了心理准备。

"Yes, Pilot Sorhyu?" “是的，绫波零驾驶员？”

Asuka thought briefly about telling her that she preferred to be called by her first name and decided against it.  
明日香短暂地考虑了一下是否要告诉对方自己更喜欢被叫名字，但最终还是决定算了。

"I want to be tested, to see if I'm a match."  
"我想做个测试，看看是否匹配。"

Namika did not blink. "Excuse me?"  
娜美卡没有眨眼。"你说什么？"

Asuka sighed. "Look, it's pretty obvious by now that whatever therapy you've got Misato on isn't doing much good. Don't tell me it hasn't occurred to you that she needs a bone marrow transplant."  
明日香叹了口气。"看，现在已经很明显了，你给美里用的任何疗法都没什么效果。你难道没想到她需要骨髓移植吗？"

Even as nimble as she usually was, Namika was temporarily dumbfounded. The doctor rose from her swiveling chair, white lab coach swishing about her legs.  
尽管通常敏捷如她，娜美卡此刻也一时语塞。医生从她的旋转椅上站起身，白色的实验室外套在她腿边摆动。

"The system of treatments being used on Major Katsuragi is none of your concern," she said coldly. "If she eventually needs a transplant, it is I who will make that decision."  
“对葛城美里少校使用的治疗系统，与你无关，”她冷冷地说道，“如果她最终需要移植，那也是由我来决定。”

"Fine," Asuka retorted. "But you really ought to see how much it's hurting Shinji Ikari to see Misato like this. And the very least you could do in return for all the times he's saved your life in Angel attacks—is to put forward 110 toward saving Misato."  
“好吧，”明日香反驳道，“但你真该看看真嗣看到美里这样有多痛苦。而作为他多次在使徒袭击中救你一命的回报——你至少应该全力以赴去救美里。”

The door closed behind her.  
她身后，门关上了。

Author's Notes: The Christmas chapter, which I fortunately managed to finish before Christmas. Unfortunately, it's still about two months late. . Sorry guys.  
作者的话：圣诞节章节，幸运的是我在圣诞节前完成了。不幸的是，它仍然晚了大约两个月。抱歉，各位。

This story started in summer and I'm planning to bring it around full circle and have it end in summer too, one year after Misato's diagnosis.  
这个故事始于夏天，我计划让它圆满收尾，在 Misato 确诊一年后的夏天结束。

I got the German translations from an online translator and unfortunately don't know anybody who speaks fluent German, so I hope they're fairly accurate. In case they're extremely off, Asuka's box (the one she removes from Makoto Hyuga's car) is labeled "Souvenirs from Germany" and the shirt that Rei borrows reads "I am proud to be German".  
我使用了在线翻译器获取德语翻译，遗憾的是我不认识任何流利的德语人士，所以希望它们相当准确。万一它们非常离谱，Asuka 的盒子（她从 Makoto Hyuga 的车上取下的那个）标有“来自德国的纪念品”，而 Rei 借的那件衬衫上写着“我为身为德国人而自豪”。

Unfortunately, Quickedit seems to love stripping away all of my dividers. Does anyone know what can be used as dividers in Word that won't get stripped off as soon as I upload it? (Hopefully it's been fixed now, since I readded them in after uploading.)  
不幸的是，Quickedit 似乎总是把我所有的分隔符都去掉。有人知道在 Word 中可以用什么作为分隔符，上传后不会被删除吗？（希望现在已经被修复了，因为我上传后又重新添加了它们。）

I think that's all, beyond the fact that I really wish it would snow here.  
我想除此之外，我真的很希望这里能下雪。

Happy Thanksgiving all! 祝大家感恩节快乐！

### Chapter 5: despondency
第五章：绝望

In her heart, she knew—had known before—that the Second was right. But she had hoped desperately that something else would work and that they wouldn't have to come to this—their _last_ hope—because if it failed…  
在她心中，她明白——早已明白——第二位是对的。但她曾绝望地希望有其他办法能奏效，他们不必走到这一步——他们最后的希望——因为如果失败了……

Namika slid a thick leather-bound book out of its place on her bookshelf of medical encyclopedias and opened it, flipping relentlessly through the pages until she found what she was looking for.  
纳米卡从她的医学百科书架上抽出一本厚厚的皮革装订书，打开它，无情地翻阅着页面，直到找到她要找的内容。

All the basic "match" stuff about bone marrow transplants was common knowledge in these ages, even if the full mechanics remained a mystery except for those in the medical field. Everyone knew that a matched donor gave the patient the best hope for life and that a close relative—preferably a brother or sister—was most likely to have the same HLA antigens on their white blood cells. Which, of course, put Misato at a disadvantage.  
在这个时代，关于骨髓移植的基本“匹配”知识已是常识，尽管其完整的机制仍只有医疗领域的人士才了解。大家都知道，匹配的供体为患者提供了最大的生存希望，而近亲——最好是兄弟或姐妹——最有可能拥有相同的 HLA 抗原。当然，这对美里来说是个不利因素。

She remembered once, many years ago, when the conversation at their table had switched around to their families. Ritsuko had shut up almost immediately. Misato said nothing either. Everyone knew who she was and who her father _had_ been. Namika had not thought it appropriate then to question about her mother. She had not expected it to become a necessity in the future.  
她记得多年前的一次，当时餐桌上的话题转到了各自的家庭。律子几乎立刻就闭口不言了。美里也没有说什么。大家都知道她是谁，她的父亲是谁。那时，七美并没有觉得有必要询问她的母亲。她没想到这会在未来成为一种必要。

She glanced out of the window and opened it to give herself a full view. Christmas had gone and passed, as had New Year's. Misato had recovered decently from her sudden collapse, and the doctor had even chosen to let her go home for two days—forty-eight hours, and no more. It made her smile, remembering how Misato's eyes had lit up like a child on Christmas morning when she heard the news. Kaji drove her home, all dressed up in Asuka's gown, and Ritsuko drove Shinji and Asuka, though both adults scattered soon afterwards—after all, they didn't live in the Katsuragi residence.  
她瞥了一眼窗外，推开窗户以便一览无余。圣诞节已经过去，新年也已结束。美里从那次突然的昏倒中恢复得不错，医生甚至允许她回家两天——四十八小时，不能再多。这让她微笑起来，回想起美里听到消息时，眼中闪烁着如同圣诞早晨的孩子般的光芒。加持开车送她回家，她穿着明日香的礼服，而律子则载着真嗣和明日香，尽管两位成年人随后很快就各自散去——毕竟，他们并不住在葛城家。

"I want you to call me immediately—and I mean IMMEDIATELY—if you feel any discomfort," she had instructed Misato, "and you two—" gesturing to Shinji and Asuka: "make sure she does so."  
“如果你感到任何不适，我要你立刻——我是说立刻——给我打电话，”她曾这样叮嘱美里，“还有你们两个——”她向真嗣和明日香示意：“确保她这样做。”

---

"You used the plant for a Christmas tree?"  
“你用那棵植物当圣诞树？”

Misato couldn't help from giggling. Whatever feelings of despair that had plagued her a few weeks ago were long gone, replaced with bubbles of giddiness as Asuka and Shinji related all the tales of the days they had spent together, leaving out the loneliness and suspense.  
美里忍不住咯咯笑了起来。几周前困扰她的绝望感早已消失无踪，取而代之的是一股股兴奋的气泡，随着明日香和真嗣讲述他们共同度过的日子里的种种趣事，那些孤独和紧张的情节都被省略了。

"And then Asuka burned three pancakes in a row—"  
“然后明日香一连烧焦了三张煎饼——”

"You stepped on Pen-pen's flipper in the night—"  
“你晚上踩到了企鹅潘-潘的鳍——”

"—Asuka had just tripped over her German dictionary—"  
"—明日香刚刚被她的德语词典绊倒了—"

"—at least I wasn't peeping while you were showering!"  
"—至少我没在你洗澡时偷看！"

"I DID NOT!" "我没有！"

"DID TOO!" "就是有！"

"DID NOT! I didn't know you were in there!" Shinji protested, his face beet red.  
"才没有！我不知道你在里面！" 真嗣抗议道，脸红得像甜菜根。

The temporarily silence, consisting of Shinji and Asuka glaring daggers at each other, was temporarily broken by Misato clapping her hands and laughing.  
短暂的沉默被打破了，真嗣和明日香互相瞪着对方，这时美里拍手大笑，打破了僵局。

"Oh, that's beautiful, just beautiful…"  
"哦，真是太美了，简直美极了……"

Asuka and Shinji glared at each other and decided to reconcile their differences later.  
明日香和真嗣互相瞪了一眼，决定稍后再解决他们之间的分歧。

Misato looked lovely despite the weight she had lost; the red tone of the dress went nicely with her dark eyes and hair. She wore Shinji's necklace around her neck, and it swung back and forth from time to time as she leaned forward. Asuka saw it, smiled, and instinctively reached up to touch her own. Burned pancakes or not, she appreciated the boy more than she cared to admit.  
尽管体重减轻了，美里看起来依然很迷人；那件红色的裙子与她深邃的眼睛和黑发相得益彰。她脖子上戴着真嗣送的项链，随着她前倾的动作不时摇摆。明日香看到了，微笑着，本能地伸手去摸自己的项链。尽管煎饼烧焦了，但她对那个男孩的欣赏之情远超她愿意承认的程度。

"And school?" Misato asked.  
"学校呢？" 美里问道。

"It's decent," Asuka proclaimed. "I eat lunch with Hikari every day in the hallway since it's _so_ cold outside nowadays. And I have a 98 in Japanese literature now! I've been working on my kanji."  
"还不错，" 明日香宣称，"我每天都在走廊里和光一起吃午饭，因为现在外面太冷了。而且我的日本文学成绩现在是 98 分！我一直在练习我的汉字。"

Misato reached across the table and gave Asuka a hug. The Second Child was touched, but couldn't help feeling a tinge of sadness at how weak her arms were now.  
美里伸手越过桌子拥抱了明日香。二号机驾驶员感动不已，但仍不禁感到一丝悲伤，因为她的手臂现在变得如此无力。

"I wish I could go outside for a little while," Misato mused. "I'm so sick of being inside."  
"我真希望能出去一会儿，" 美里沉思道，"我真是受够了待在室内。"

"It's kind of cold outside though," Shinji pointed out.  
"不过外面挺冷的，" 真嗣指出。"

Asuka stood up. "Why should that matter if we bundle her up properly? Here, put on some pants under your dress, and take my boots—Shinji, get her winter jacket, the one with the hood—"  
明日香站了起来。"只要我们给她穿暖和点，这有什么关系？来，在你的裙子下面再穿条裤子，穿上我的靴子——真嗣，去拿她的冬装外套，带帽子的那件——"

"You know Dr. Ishiyama would never allow this," he whispered, as Asuka ducked into the closet for the winter boots.  
“你知道石山博士绝不会允许这种事，”他低声说，而明日香正弯腰钻进衣柜寻找冬靴。

"It's time she had some freedom," Asuka insisted. Her voice came out muffled as she searched behind the rack of clothes. "At the first sign of anything, we'll call NERV."  
“是时候让她有些自由了，”明日香坚持道。她的声音因在衣架后搜寻而显得有些含糊。“一旦有任何动静，我们就联系 NERV。”

Shinji hesitated. "Ten minutes only."  
真嗣犹豫了一下。“只限十分钟。”

"Ten minutes," she agreed.  
“十分钟，”她同意道。

They bundled Misato up as warmly as they could get. Asuka removed a pair of leather gloves from the jacket's pockets and insisted that she wear them, as well as an old, ragged blue scarf ("Well, it's the only one I can find.")  
他们尽可能地把美里裹得暖暖的。明日香从夹克口袋里拿出了一副皮手套，坚持让她戴上，还有一条旧旧的、破烂的蓝色围巾（“嗯，这是我唯一能找到的。”）

She loved being able to walk on her own and having Shinji and Asuka on either side. Being waited on constantly had initially been interesting, but it soon grew old when the only reason the nurses did so was because she couldn't do it herself.  
她喜欢自己走路，身边有真嗣和明日香一左一右陪伴着。起初，被人不断照顾还挺有趣，但很快这种新鲜感就消失了，因为护士们这么做只是因为她自己做不到。

They entered the elevator and Misato pushed the button for L1.  
他们进入电梯，美里按下了 L1 的按钮。

"It's hot," she complained, as the elevator slowly lowered itself down to the first floor.  
“好热，”她抱怨道，电梯缓缓下降到一楼。

"You won't think that when you get outside."  
“你出去后就不会这么想了。”

She had to agree with them when the time came. The cold air bit her skin and stung her nose and ears. Nevertheless, she followed Asuka and Shinji eagerly, like little children, into the parking lot where her old, broken down car lay unused.  
当那一刻来临时，她不得不赞同他们的意见。寒风刺骨，她的皮肤、鼻子和耳朵都感到刺痛。尽管如此，她还是像小孩子一样急切地跟着明日香和真嗣，走进了停车场，那里停放着她那辆老旧破损、久未使用的汽车。

"Hey, it's you," she laughed, touching the trunk affectionately to make two handprints in the snow.  
“嘿，是你呀，”她笑着，温柔地触摸着后备箱，在雪地上留下了两个手印。

"HEY!" "嘿！"

Shinji rubbed the back of his head, having just been attacked by a perfectly aimed snowball from Asuka. In an instant he was off chasing her for revenge, crumpling snow into as tight a ball as he could manage while he ran.  
真嗣揉着后脑勺，刚刚被明日香一个精准的雪球击中。转眼间，他便开始追逐她以图报复，一边跑一边将雪捏成尽可能紧实的雪球。

Misato dipped her fingers into the powdery snow and sprinkled them over Asuka's red hair as she passed.  
美里将手指浸入粉末般的雪中，撒向经过的明日香的红发。

"That's not fair!" Asuka whined, but the short moment she paused gave Shinji the opportunity to launch another snowball at her face.  
“这不公平！”明日香抱怨道，但她短暂的停顿给了真嗣再次向她脸上扔雪球的机会。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Don't apologize, Third Child." Asuka seized a handful of snow and rubbed it in his face. "Or you're going to regret it."  
“别道歉，第三适格者。”明日香抓起一把雪，抹在他的脸上。“否则你会后悔的。”

"Hey, hey, HEY!" “嘿，嘿，嘿！”

While Asuka busied herself keeping Shinji on the ground as she rubbed snow onto his face, ignoring his howls, Misato slowly bent her knees, wincing as she heard them crack. She gathered a small handful of snow and packed it into a tiny, compact sphere, then slowly added more to it. Shinji's shrieks were growing higher pitched now, and Asuka did not relent.  
当明日香忙着让真嗣躺在地上，用雪搓他的脸，无视他的嚎叫时，美里慢慢地弯下膝盖，听到它们发出嘎吱声时皱了皱眉。她抓起一小把雪，捏成一个微小的紧实球体，然后慢慢地往里加雪。真嗣的尖叫声越来越高，但明日香并未停手。

Misato stared at the snowball in her hand, then suddenly pulled her arm back and let it fly. It smashed into tiny pieces on Asuka's shoulder.  
美里盯着她手里的雪球，突然向后一甩手臂，将它扔了出去。雪球在明日香的肩膀上碎裂开来。

"HEY!" the girl shouted, whirling around. In that one moment Shinji recovered and leapt to his feet, but this time didn't attack in retaliation.  
"嘿！" 女孩大喊一声，猛地转过身来。就在那一刻，真嗣恢复了过来，跳起身来，但这次没有进行报复性的攻击。

"That was a pretty good shot," he commented, with real admiration in his voice. "I saw that coming."  
"那一击相当不错，" 他评论道，声音中带着真挚的赞赏。"我早料到了。"

"Why didn't you warn me!"  
"你为什么不提醒我！"

"Er…was I supposed to?" "呃…我应该这么做吗？"

"Baka." Asuka pushed him over again.  
"笨蛋。" 明日香再次把他推倒。

---

"You look happy today."  
"你今天看起来很开心。"

"You look pretty today," Misato commented, as the doctor flipped a page on the newly added calendar that hung above her television. "What? You do."  
"你今天看起来很漂亮，" 美里评论道，医生翻开了挂在电视上方新挂历的一页。"什么？你确实很漂亮。"

"Thanks. Anyway." She took a seat on the nearest chair and began without preamble. "I've just been looking over your latest test results, and I've come to the conclusion that your best option is to do a bone marrow transplant."  
"谢谢。话说回来。" 她坐在最近的椅子上，开门见山地说道。"我刚刚看了你最新的检查结果，得出的结论是，你最好的选择是进行骨髓移植。"

Silence. 沉默。

"Misato?" “美里？”

"I'm just thinking," she said quietly. "Doesn't that require one of my relatives…or something?"  
"我只是在想，" 她轻声说道。"那不是需要我的一个亲属……或者什么的吗？"

Namika leaned forward slightly. "Are there any that might be willing?"  
Namika 微微前倾。“有没有可能愿意的呢？”

"I have none alive," Misato stated flatly. "My mother died some ten years ago."  
“我没有活着的亲人，”Misato 平淡地说。“我母亲十年前去世了。”

"Oh," Namika said softly, returning to her normal sitting stance. "Well, we can try for a non-related donor then."  
“哦，”Namika 轻声说，恢复了正常的坐姿。“那么，我们可以尝试找一个非亲属的捐赠者。”

"That's pretty unlikely though, isn't it?"  
"那可能性不大，不是吗？"

Namika thought back to a time before Second Impact, before she had decided to become a doctor, when the word had been spreading about the need for bone marrow donors and people had signed up by the thousands. Time and energy had been diverted toward much more pressing needs after the year 2000.  
直美回想起第二次冲击之前，那时她还未决定成为医生，关于需要骨髓捐献者的消息正在传播，成千上万的人报名捐献。2000 年后，时间和精力被转移到了更为紧迫的需求上。

"We'll try," she promised.  
"我们会尝试的，"她承诺道。"

"I really don't have any other options, do I?"  
"我真的没有其他选择了，是吗？"

"Not really." Namika was forced to concede. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the Major shift.  
"确实没有。" 纳米卡不得不承认。她眼角的余光瞥见少校移动了一下。

"All right then. Let's go for it."  
"好吧，那就这么办吧。"

---

"Why's Sorhyu getting out of Sensei's lectures early?" Touji grumbled. His stomach growled, and he recalled with annoyance that he had forgotten to pack his lunch. He glanced jealously at Hikari Horaki, who always had the best lunches. Perhaps he'd be able to convince her to share a bit with him.  
"“为什么索菲尤总是提前离开老师的课？” 东治嘟囔着。他的肚子咕噜作响，他懊恼地想起自己忘了带午餐。他嫉妒地瞥了一眼总是带最好午餐的洞木光。也许他能说服她分一点给他。”

"Because I am divine, stooge," she muttered, slinging her bag over her shoulder and disappearing out the door. "See you, Hikari."  
"“因为我就是神，傻瓜，”她低声嘀咕，把书包甩到肩上，消失在门外。“再见，洞木。””

"Well, it must not be NERV related," Shinji commented quietly. "I haven't been called… and neither has Ayanami…"  
"“嗯，肯定和 NERV 无关，”真嗣轻声评论道。“我没有被叫……绫波也没有……””

Asuka, too, had no idea what she was being called to NERV for, but she didn't let this show in front of her classmates. She had a reputation to maintain, after all, but once she boarded the nearly-empty train, her fingers twisted into knots and she crossed her legs, clearly uncomfortable with the situation.  
明日香同样不知道自己被叫到 NERV 是为了什么，但她没有在同学面前表现出这一点。毕竟，她还得维持自己的形象，但一旦登上几乎空无一人的列车，她的手指就纠结在一起，双腿交叉，显然对这种情况感到不安。

Her sync ratios had been stable in the last few weeks.  
她的同步率在过去几周一直很稳定。

The angel alarms had not gone off.  
天使警报并未响起。

Misato— 美里——

Asuka pushed that thought out of her mind.  
明日香将这个念头从脑海中赶走。

_They'd call Shinji and Wondergirl if anything had happened.  
如果有事发生，他们会联系真嗣和那个书呆子的。_

"I'm here, Dr. Akagi," she called out upon entering the Geofront. "What do you need me for?"  
"我来了，赤木博士，"她一进入地底空洞就喊道，"需要我做什么？"

"You're not needed here, you're needed at the hospital," Ritsuko informed her, watching her beadily over the rim of her spectacles.  
"这里不需要你，医院那边需要你，"赤木律子透过眼镜框盯着她，冷冷地告诉她。"

After she had disappeared, Maya asked softly, "Sempai, why?"  
在她离开后，真希波轻声问道："前辈，为什么？"

Ritsuko shrugged without response and turned back to the report clamped to her clipboard, absentmindedly tracing the bolded _Unit_ _03_ splashed across the top of page.  
律子无言地耸了耸肩，转回夹在文件夹上的报告，心不在焉地沿着页首加粗的“三号机”字样划过。

---

"I need a compass," Asuka growled. When she was piloting her Eva she had free reign of Tokyo-3—no need to follow roads or paths—but a few twists and turns within the many hallways of the NERV building soon had her perplexed. It was relief that she finally found the hospital and entered, this time making her way directly to the head doctor's office.  
“我需要个指南针。”明日香咆哮道。驾驶 Eva 时，她在第三新东京市可以自由行动——无需遵循道路或路径——但 NERV 总部内错综复杂的走廊很快让她感到困惑。最终找到医院并进入，这次她直接走向主治医生的办公室，心中松了一口气。

She knocked twice. 她敲了两下门。

"Come in." Namika laid down her clipboard. "Good afternoon, Pilot Sorhyu."  
“请进。”奈美放下文件夹，“下午好，惣流驾驶员。”

"Good afternoon." “下午好。”

"Are you still willing to be tested to see if you're a match for Major Katsuragi?" she asked, rising to her feet and pushing in her chair.  
“你还是愿意接受测试，看看是否与葛城美里少校匹配吗？”她站起身，将椅子推回原位问道。

Asuka's eyes widened. Quickly she regained her composure, and there was no doubt in her voice when she spoke.  
明日香的眼眸微微睁大。她迅速恢复了镇定，语气中没有丝毫犹豫。

"Yes." "是的。"

"Follow me." "跟我来。"

They led her into a tiny, windowless room with blinding white walls and a white bed, upon which she was made to sit while the doctor organized supplies.  
他们带她进了一个没有窗户的小房间，墙壁白得刺眼，里面有一张白色的床，她被要求坐在上面，而医生则在整理医疗用品。

"Hold out your arm." "伸出你的手臂。"

She did so, and Namika sterilized it with a dab of alcohol.  
她照做了，纳美卡用一点酒精轻轻擦拭进行消毒。

The needle went into her arm without warning. Asuka watched disinterestedly while the small tube filled with her blood. The doctor slid the needle out deftly, wiped the puncture with a sterile piece of gauze, and taped a colorful bandage over it.  
针头毫无预警地扎进了她的手臂。明日香漠然地看着小管子渐渐充满她的血液。医生熟练地拔出针头，用一块无菌纱布擦拭了针孔，并贴上了一个色彩鲜艳的创可贴。

"You're free to go." “你可以走了。”

"When'll we know the results?" she queried.  
“我们什么时候能知道结果？”她问道。

"In a few days," the doctor promised. "Anything else?"  
“几天后，”医生承诺道，“还有其他事吗？”

"No."

Asuka tore off the bandage and threw it in the trash on her way out.  
明日香撕下绷带，出门时顺手扔进了垃圾桶。

---

"What's wrong with your arm, Asuka?"  
“你的手臂怎么了，明日香？”

"It hurts," she grumbled. Getting blood drawn was not supposed to be a big deal—she had had the procedure done many times before—but somehow this time it was bruising severely, as if someone had punched her in the crook of her elbow.  
“疼，”她咕哝着。抽血本不该是什么大事——她以前做过很多次——但不知怎么的，这次却严重淤青，好像有人在她肘弯处打了一拳。

Shinji looked concerned. "Do you want some ice for it? Or a heating pad?"  
真嗣看起来很担心。“你需要冰敷一下吗？还是用热敷垫？”

"N—" Asuka started to say, then changed her mind. "That would be quite nice, actually."  
"N—" 明日香刚开口，随即改变了主意。"其实，那样挺好的。"

Shinji smiled and disappeared to the kitchen.  
真嗣微笑着消失在厨房里。

Asuka nursed her arm with the other hand and stared down at Pen-pen, who was fast asleep on his back after having finished his meal. _Suspense is worse than knowing_, she thought worriedly. She wished she had asked the doctor for a more specific date. A "few" days could mean anywhere from two to five.  
明日香用另一只手护理着她的手臂，低头凝视着吃饱后仰面朝天熟睡的企鹅 Pen-pen。未知的悬念比已知更让人焦虑，她忧心忡忡地想。她真希望自己能向医生询问一个更确切的日期。"几天"可能意味着从两天到五天不等。

"Here you go," Shinji handed her the heating pad. His eyes widened at the sight of her bruised arm. "What happened to you?"  
"给你，" 真嗣递给她加热垫。看到她瘀青的手臂，他的眼睛睁大了。"你怎么了？"

"I had some blood drawn... nothing too serious." Asuka was reluctant to tell him the truth, wanting instead to avoid the subject.  
"抽了点血...没什么大不了的。" 明日香不愿告诉他真相，宁愿避开这个话题。"

"Oh…" Shinji suddenly felt rather guilty. "You're not supposed to put heat on bruises… I'll go make you an ice pack instead."  
"哦…" 真嗣突然感到相当内疚。"你不应该在瘀伤上加热… 我去给你做个冰袋。"

"Don't, Third," Asuka called. "It's cold enough in this place. I'll freeze if I have to place ice on my arm." He hesitated, and she patted the chair next to him. "Come sit here and talk to me for awhile."  
"别这样，三号，" 明日香喊道。"这个地方已经够冷了。如果我得在手臂上放冰块，我会冻僵的。" 他犹豫了一下，她拍了拍他旁边的椅子。"过来坐这儿，陪我聊一会儿。"

Shinji obeyed. 真嗣顺从了。

"So what were you doing, skulking around the house when I came in?"  
"那么，我进来时你鬼鬼祟祟地在屋里做什么？"

"I was looking for a calculator," Shinji replied smoothly, "…so I could finish the problems Sensei left us in class." He shifted uneasily. "I'm kind of worried about tomorrow's exam…"  
"我在找计算器，" 真嗣流畅地回答，"……这样我就能完成老师在课上留给我们的题目了。" 他不安地挪动了一下。"我对明天的考试有点担心……"

Asuka laughed. "What I like, you hate. What you hate, I like." Seeing Shinji's baffled expression, she elaborated, "Algebra doesn't require nearly as much knowledge of kanji as any of the other things we do in school. Besides, I've done all of this before in college, so it's easy for me."  
明日香笑了。"我喜欢的东西，你讨厌。你讨厌的东西，我喜欢。" 看到真嗣困惑的表情，她进一步解释道，"代数不需要像我们在学校做的其他事情那样掌握那么多汉字。而且，我在大学里已经做过所有这些了，所以对我来说很简单。"

"You're lucky." "你真幸运。"

She shrugged. "Well, I have to redo several years of high school after graduating college, in a language I'm not too familiar with. That's not really something you'd want to do."  
她耸了耸肩。“好吧，我得在大学毕业后，用一种不太熟悉的语言重读几年的高中。这不是你真正想做的事情。”

"I guess…" “我想……”

When it became apparently that he wasn't going to say anything else, she took the initiative.  
当明显看出他不会再多说什么时，她主动出击了。

"Come on, Third Child… get your books, and I'll explain DeMoivre's Theorem to you."  
"来吧，三号孩子……带上你的书，我来给你解释德莫弗定理。"

"Are you sure?" Shinji hesitated. "I-I don't want to bother you or anything, I mean…"  
"你确定吗？" 真嗣犹豫了。"我……我不想打扰你或者别的什么，我是说……"

"Just do it." "就这么做吧。"

He copied while she talked, and then she forced him to reiterate her words in a way that convinced her he had understood.  
她说话时他抄写着，随后她逼迫他用一种让她确信他已理解的方式复述她的话。

"Three root two." “三倍根号二。”

"Three? I thought negative three." Asuka frowned at the paper and pointed to the mistake. "You dropped a negative sign there, Shinji."  
“三？我以为是负三。”明日香皱眉看着纸张，指出了错误。“你那里漏了一个负号，真嗣。”

"Sorry," he mumbled and fumbled with his eraser. A moment later he noticed that not only had Asuka not insulted him, she had called him Shinji. The girl wore a sad and faraway expression, as if she were in a world of her own. He finished the problem, took a deep breath, and went out on a limb.  
"对不起，" 他咕哝着，摆弄着手中的橡皮。片刻后，他注意到不仅明日香没有骂他，还叫了他的名字真嗣。女孩脸上带着悲伤而遥远的表情，仿佛置身于自己的世界。他完成了题目，深吸一口气，鼓起勇气开口。

"Do you want me to teach you some kanji?"  
"你想让我教你几个汉字吗？"

She perked up again at this and seemed to consider. "If you don't mind."  
听到这话，她又振作起来，似乎在考虑。"如果你不介意的话。"

Shinji fetched the book, and Asuka curled up her legs and put her head on his shoulder, maintaining the ice pack on her elbow with the other hand. Shinji blushed crimson, quickly chose a page, cleared his throat, and began to read.  
真嗣取来书，明日香蜷起双腿，将头靠在他的肩上，另一只手继续用冰袋敷着肘部。真嗣的脸红得像熟透的番茄，迅速翻到一页，清了清嗓子，开始朗读。

---

"Tired?"  "累了？"

"Stop rubbing it in," Namika grumbled, rubbing her eyes. However, all that served was to fog them up, and she muttered darkly as she removed her glasses and wiped them on the hem of her shirt.  
"别再说了，" 奈美卡咕哝着，揉了揉眼睛。然而这只会让镜片蒙上雾气，她低声抱怨着摘下眼镜，用衣角擦拭。

"You know I'm not trying to," Ritsuko countered, taking a seat and sliding the phone book over to her. "Are you really calling them up one by one, trying to find Misato a relative?"  
"你知道我不是那个意思，" 律子反驳道，坐了下来，把电话簿推给她。"你真的要一个个打电话，试图为美里找到一个亲戚吗？"

"Somebody's gotta be alive," Namika muttered cryptically. "Damn people won't admit it."  
"总得有人活着吧，" 美里含糊地嘀咕着。"该死的人就是不肯承认。"

Ritsuko glanced at the massive microfuge, spinning along merrily and making its faint whirring sound without pause before suddenly coming to a stop.  
律子瞥了一眼那台巨大的微量离心机，它愉快地旋转着，发出微弱的嗡嗡声，不停地运转，然后突然停了下来。

"Can you put those on ice and shove it in the freezer?"  
"你能把这些冷冻起来，然后放进冰箱吗？"

Ritsuko obeyed. "How are the results coming?" she asked, although she already knew the answers.  
律子遵从了。“结果怎么样了？”她问道，尽管她已经知道答案。

"The Second's not a match."  
"二号机不匹配。"

"She's German," Ritsuko said, as if that settled the situation.  
"她是德国人，" 律子说，仿佛这就能解决问题了。

"Well, I couldn't help but hope. Yours came back negative too. So did mine. As did that of your bespectacled technician."  
"嗯，我忍不住抱有希望。你的结果也是阴性。我的也是。还有你那位戴眼镜的技术员的。"

"Makoto was here?" "真琴在这里？"

"Yeah, at like five in the morning…"  
"是啊，大概早上五点钟……"

Ritsuko groaned. It was going to kill Makoto to find out that he wouldn't be able to protect the woman he cared so deeply for, even if he had never voiced his feelings. "Who else showed up?"  
律子叹了口气。要让真琴知道他无法保护他深爱着的女人，哪怕他从未表露过自己的感情，这简直是要了他的命。“还有谁来了？”

"The Commander." "指挥官。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Yeah, he came down here at lunch and didn't say anything. It took me about ten minutes to notice he was standing in the doorway, and when I finally got around to addressing him, all he did was stick out his arm."  
"是啊，他午饭时下来了，一句话也没说。我花了大约十分钟才注意到他站在门口，当我终于注意到他时，他只是伸出了手臂。"

"Interesting…" "有意思……"

Namika snorted. "Believe it or not, he's got the closest match to Misato so far. If all else fails we're going to have to use him."  
Namika 嗤之以鼻。"信不信由你，他是目前为止最接近 Misato 的人选。如果其他方法都不行，我们就得用他了。"

She pulled the phone book back over and picked up the telephone. Ritsuko snatched it away from her.  
她将电话簿重新拉近，拿起电话。律子一把从她手中夺了过去。

"I'll call for a few hours," she said, silently wondering how many Katsuragis there could possibly be in the phone book. "You go onto sleep."  
“我来打几个小时，”她说，暗自思忖着电话簿里究竟会有多少个姓桂的。“你去睡吧。”

---

"It's going to be a long healing process."  
“这将是一个漫长的恢复过程。”

"She's only a primary student. How difficult for her."  
"她只是个小学生，对她来说真不容易。"

"Has that boy come today?"  
"那男孩今天来了吗？"

"Yes, he's still coming twice a week. Such good brothers are hard to find nowadays.  
"是的，他每周还是来两次。现在这样的好兄弟可难找了。"

"Excuse me," Shinji muttered dully. The nurses immediately stopped chatting and wheeled the cart aside so that they could pass. Asuka glanced at it briefly. The girl lying upon it was perhaps six or seven years old. Her face was turned away from them.  
"劳驾，" 真嗣含糊地嘟囔了一声。护士们立刻停止了闲聊，将推车挪到一旁，让他们通过。明日香瞥了一眼推车。躺在上面的小女孩大约六七岁。她的脸转向另一边，没有看向他们。

"I didn't know they treated regular kids in here," she remarked, as the doors slid open and allowed them to leave.  
"我没想到这里还治疗普通孩子，" 她一边说，一边随着门的滑动，他们得以离开。

"Maybe she's somebody's daughter?" Shinji wondered.  
"也许她是某人的女儿？" 真嗣猜测道。

"I don't know anybody at NERV with a daughter that age."  
"我在 NERV 里不认识任何有那个年纪女儿的人。"

"One of the workers that we haven't met, maybe."  
"可能是我们还没见过的某个工作人员吧。"

Asuka thought it over and conceded. "Maybe."  
明日香思考了一下，同意道：""也许吧。"

The elevator door shut behind them. Asuka punched the appropriate button, and the car immediately began to sink.  
电梯门在他们身后关闭。明日香按下相应的按钮，电梯随即开始下降。

"I hope Touji and Hikari aren't there already."  
“希望真嗣和光还没到。”

Asuka remembered with a jolt that the two were coming over to collaborate on a school project, but didn't let on that she had forgotten. "I don't understand why we're doing a group project. It's so much easier to work on one's own—you're in charge of what you're doing, and nobody argues with you."  
明日香心头一震，想起两人是来合作学校项目的，但她没有表露出自己忘记了这件事。“我不明白为什么要做小组项目。独自工作容易多了——你自己负责自己的部分，没人跟你争论。”

"Sensei thinks it'll be better if we learn from each other," reminded Shinji, recalling that each group would prepare a presentation for the class.  
"老师认为我们互相学习会更好，" 真嗣提醒道，回想起每个小组都要为班级准备一个报告。

"I can learn on my own," Asuka muttered. "Though I don't understand why I got paired with that stooge and you with Hikari. It would be much better if it was the other way around."  
"我可以自学，" 明日香嘟囔着。"虽然我不明白为什么我和那个呆子一组，而你和光一组。要是反过来就好了。"

"You would rather work with me?"  
"你宁愿和我一起工作？"

"Obviously, since—HEY! I meant that it would be wonderful for Hikari and the stooge to have a chance together, not that—that I'd enjoy working with you!"  
“显然，因为——嘿！我的意思是，光和那个跟班有机会在一起会很美好，不是说我——我会喜欢和你一起工作！”

Shinji didn't say anything.  
真嗣没有说话。

Hikari brought pastries with a variety of fruit fillings to share. Touji was already munching away, but Hikari's cheeks were pink with pride, and she did not hurry to lecture him.  
光带来了各种水果馅的点心分享。东治已经在狼吞虎咽了，但光的脸上带着自豪的红晕，并没有急着去训斥他。

"My dad gave me this book last night when I mentioned that we were studying nuclear chemistry," she explained, holding it up so that Shinji could see the large illustration of the Bohr model splashed across the cover.  
"昨晚我提到我们在学核化学时，我爸给了我这本书，"她解释道，举起书让真嗣能看到封面上的玻尔模型大图。

"That's great…" Shinji eyed the thick volume with apprehension. "Do you want to sit down? We can work on the table."  
"那太好了……" 真嗣带着几分忧虑地看着那本厚厚的书。"你想坐下来吗？我们可以用桌子。

"Then where are we going to work?" Asuka demanded.  
"那我们到底要在哪儿工作？" 明日香质问道。

"You can have the other side of the table," Hikari offered, graciously moving her platter of pastries. "Would you like one, Ikari-kun?"  
"你可以坐桌子另一边，"光主动移开她的糕点盘，优雅地说道，"想尝一块吗，一成君？"

"Thank you…" "谢谢你……"

Asuka growled under her breath, still unhappy with the situation. "All right, stooge, you sit there, and I'm going to go get my books. And don't…"  
明日香低声咆哮，对现状仍感不满。"好吧，跟班，你坐那儿，我去拿我的书。还有别……"

The sound of mechanical laughter made her turn. Her partner had settled himself comfortably on the couch with his feet resting on the coffee table, and was lazily flipping through the channels.  
机械般的笑声让她转过头去。她的搭档已经舒舒服服地坐在沙发上，脚搁在茶几上，懒洋洋地切换着电视频道。

Oblivious to Asuka and Touji, Shinji hoisted a large sheet of posterboard onto the table, while Hikari flipped through her book.  
未察觉到明日香和真嗣的存在，碇真嗣将一张巨大的海报板举到桌子上，而光则翻阅着她的书。

"I think we ought to have an image of Rutherford's experiment with the gold foil," she suggested. "There's a nice picture of it here, we could just draw that."  
"我认为我们应该展示卢瑟福的金箔实验图像，"她提议道。"这里有一张很好的图片，我们可以照着画。"

"I'll write out his conclusions," Shinji agreed. "Green or red words?"  
"我来写他的结论，"真嗣同意道。"用绿色还是红色字？"

"Umm… red. Do you mind if the electrons are blue?"  
"嗯……红色。电子是蓝色的，你介意吗？"

"That's fine." "那没问题。"

Asuka stomped over to her uncooperative partner. "What do you think you're doing?"  
明日香气冲冲地走向她那不合作的搭档。“你以为你在干什么？”

Touji pressed the "Channel up" button.  
冬二按下了“频道上”按钮。

She tried to wrestle the remote control from his hand, with no luck.  
她试图从他手中夺过遥控器，但未能成功。

"I don't know about you, but I want to do well on this project!" she shouted. "And like it or not, you're going to help me!"  
“我不知道你怎么想，但我想在这个项目上表现出色！”她喊道，“不管你喜不喜欢，你都得帮我！”

Touji changed his mind and pressed the "Channel down" button.  
冬二改变了主意，按下了“频道下调”按钮。

Asuka sighed and decided that she would rather work alone than lower herself to trying to drag him off of the couch. Shinji's voice followed her around the corner as she stalked off to her room to find paper.  
明日香叹了口气，决定宁愿独自工作也不愿降低身份试图把他从沙发上拽下来。她蹑手蹑脚地走向自己的房间找纸时，真嗣的声音跟在她身后转过拐角。

"What else do we want to add?"  
“我们还想加些什么？”

"Millikan's oil experiment was pretty significant, the one where he determined the charge of an electron. Why don't you draw that one, and I'll write the facts this time?"  
密立根的油滴实验相当重要，就是他测定了电子电荷的那个实验。你来画那个吧，这次我来写事实。

"All right." "好的。"

Touji sighed and shut off the TV. He walked rigidly over to the door, put on his shoes, and muttered, "Sorry," before letting himself out.  
冬二叹了口气，关掉电视。他僵硬地走到门口，穿上鞋子，低声说了句“对不起”，然后自己出去了。

Shinji broke the silence.  
真嗣打破了沉默。

"Asuka will not be happy."  
"明日香不会高兴的。"

"I think something's really wrong with Suzuhara," Hikari whispered, a dark cloud settling over her eyes as she wrote. "He hasn't been himself lately at all. I wonder why?"  
"我觉得铃原真的有问题，"" 光轻声说道，眼中笼罩着一层阴霾，边写边说，""他最近完全不像他自己。不知道为什么？"

They silenced quickly as Asuka returned with a pad of paper and a fistful of colored markers, only to see that her partner had disappeared. Shinji braced himself mentally, hoping that Hikari would help to ease the disturbance that was soon to occur.  
随着明日香带着一叠纸和一把彩色马克笔回来，却发现她的搭档已经不见了，他们立刻安静下来。真嗣在心里做好了准备，希望光能帮忙缓和即将发生的骚动。

"Wow, this one?" “哇，这个吗？”

"We had no other choice," Ritsuko informed her glumly, recounting her earlier conversation with The Commander, who had originally wanted to use the dummy plug, then insisted that Fourth's core be prepared immediately upon learning that the dummy plug was still producing errors.  
“我们别无选择，”律子沮丧地告诉她，回忆起之前与司令的对话，司令原本想使用模拟插头，但在得知模拟插头仍在产生错误后，坚持要求立即准备四号的核心。

Misato contemplated this as she played with a fold of her hospital gown. Ritsuko had just broken the news to her, and she was not at all sure what to think of it.  
美里一边摆弄着医院病号服的一角，一边思考着这个消息。律子刚刚向她透露了这件事，她完全不确定该如何看待。

"Asuka's proud to be an Evangelion pilot. Rei, well, she doesn't have any problems with our work. But Shinji…he's been hurt enough as it is. I can't see Shinji being very happy about this; he's not super thrilled about piloting Eva in the first place and he wouldn't want anyone else to go through it. Asuka won't be happy either," she predicted. "She won't understand why someone of his caliber was selected."  
"明日香对自己的 EVA 驾驶员身份感到自豪。丽嘛，她对我们工作没什么不满。但真嗣……他已经受够了。我看真嗣不会对此感到高兴；他本来就不太热衷于驾驶 EVA，更不希望别人经历这些。明日香也不会高兴，"她预言道。"她不会明白为什么会选择像他那样的人。"

"The decision was beyond our hands," Ritsuko reminded quietly.  
"这个决定不是我们能左右的，"律子轻声提醒道。"

"I know that." "我知道。"

"Will you tell him?" "你会告诉他吗？"

"Why just him? What about Asuka and Rei?"  
"为什么只告诉他？那明日香和绫波呢？"

"Asuka, unfortunately, found out by accident this morning, through interrupting Kaji at work. Rei, I believe, has already been informed by The Commander." There was a strong stigma of annoyance in her tone.  
""明日香，不幸的是，今早无意中发现的，她在工作中打断了加持。至于绫波，我相信已经被司令告知了。"" 她的语气中带着明显的恼怒。

"And Shinji has been left in the dark. It doesn't seem quite fair, does it?"  
"而真嗣一直被蒙在鼓里。这似乎不太公平，不是吗？"

Ritsuko didn't know how to reply and chose to ignore the comment. "His only request was that his younger sister be placed in NERV's hospital."  
律子不知道该如何回应，于是选择忽略这句话。“他唯一的请求就是让他的妹妹被安置在 NERV 的医院里。”

"Maybe he'll tell Shinji himself."  
“也许他会亲自告诉真嗣。”

"I doubt it. He didn't look happy at all when he found out. He'll be doing his first actual test in a few days, so we'll have the TV monitor hooked up again."  
"我怀疑。他发现时看起来一点也不高兴。几天后他就要进行第一次真正的测试了，所以我们又要重新连接电视监控器。"

"Looking forward to it," Misato commented dryly.  
"期待着呢，"美里干巴巴地评论道。"

The conversation ended there.  
对话就此结束。

---

"Now I understand why you said your arm hurt," Shinji remarked, lifting his free hand up again to look at his left elbow. The bruise had developed a two inch-long diameter and was quickly spreading. He was getting stares from nearby passengers on the train. Next to him, Asuka tapped her foot impatiently as if she had some important information that she could not quite conceal. She masked it by maintaining a firm hold on the topic at hand.  
"“现在我明白你为什么说你的手臂疼了，”真嗣说道，再次举起空着的手查看左肘。瘀伤已经扩展到两英寸长，并且还在迅速蔓延。他引起了火车上附近乘客的注意。在他旁边，明日香不耐烦地跺着脚，仿佛她有一些重要的信息无法完全隐藏。她通过紧紧抓住当前的话题来掩饰这一点。”

"I still don't understand why they wanted you to do it immediately. They already knew you'd agreed to it, so what was the rush?"  
“我还是不明白他们为什么非要你立刻去做。他们已经知道你同意了，那么急什么呢？”

"Because Father wants me to do some sort of testing the day after tomorrow," Shinji mumbled miserably, hanging his head. Asuka looked up at him, surprised that he didn't know, then quickly composed her face and spoke in a calm voice.  
"“因为父亲想让我后天做某种测试，”真嗣痛苦地咕哝着，垂下了头。明日香抬头看着他，惊讶于他竟然不知道，然后迅速恢复了表情，用平静的声音说道。”

"Oh yeah—damn, my memory's getting short nowadays."  
"哦对——该死，我最近记忆力越来越差了。"

When Shinji still didn't respond, she placed an arm briefly around his shoulder. "It's all worth it if you turn out to be the one who can save Misato, right?"  
当真嗣仍然没有回应时，她短暂地用一只手臂搂住他的肩膀。“只要你能成为拯救美里的人，这一切都值得，对吧？”

"Of course. I'm not a wimp… I don't mind the pain."  
“当然。我不是懦夫……我不介意疼痛。”

_There may be more coming than you can handle_, Asuka thought grimly.  
可能会有更多你应付不来的事情，明日香阴沉地想。

---

Rei heard voices as she walked up the stairs, but didn't let it disturb her. Many nights her neighbors held raucous parties that lasted into the early hours of the day, and she had learned from a young age to live in whichever place NERV chose to delegate her. However, by the time she reached the fourth floor, she was quite certain that the voices were coming from her room.  
绫波丽上楼时听到了说话声，但她没有让这打扰到自己。许多夜晚，她的邻居们会举办喧闹的派对，持续到凌晨时分，而她从小就学会了在 NERV 分配给她的任何地方生活。然而，当她到达四楼时，她非常确定这些声音是从她的房间传来的。

"…changed a lot…" “……改变了很多……”

"What?" "什么？"

"You, Shinji. When you first came, I thought you were a jerk. You didn't seem like the kind of person who would do something for the sake of other people. I guess it's just that you're so quiet."  
"你，真嗣。你刚来的时候，我觉得你是个混蛋。你看起来不像是那种会为了别人做事的人。我想，可能只是因为你太沉默了吧。"

_Suzuhara-kun_, Rei thought, hesitating outside her room. Her gaze fell on the many envelopes that occupied the slender opening in her door designed for mail, but the sight did not penetrate her mind. _The Fourth Child._  
铃原君，绫心想，站在她房间外犹豫不决。她的目光落在门上那个专门用来投递邮件的狭小缝隙里的许多信封上，但这一景象并未引起她的注意。第四适格者。

She hesitated for a moment, trying to decide what to do. It would not be polite to intrude on their conversation, nor would it be feasible to simply stand outside her own room and eavesdrop. Rei settled on the first choice.  
她犹豫了一会儿，试图决定该怎么做。打扰他们的对话是不礼貌的，而站在自己房间外偷听也不可行。绫波最终选择了前者。

Both boys turned to look at her as she came inside and shut the door behind her without the faintest trace of surprise flickering across her face.  
两个男孩在她进屋并随手关上门时转头看向她，她的脸上没有一丝惊讶的痕迹。

Suzuhara-kun bowed to her and gestured toward her bed, on which lay a large stack of papers. "Excuse us. These are your printouts from class."  
铃原君向她鞠了一躬，并指向她的床，上面堆着一大叠纸张。"打扰了。这些是您课堂上的打印资料。"

Rei was silent, pondering what to do next. A sound from her left roused her, and she turned to see Ikari picking up wadded bandages from the floor.  
丽沉默着，思考下一步该做什么。左侧传来的声音唤醒了她，她转头看到碇正在捡起地板上揉成团的绷带。

For a moment, Rei was angry… she had come home after a grueling day at NERV, accentuated by the fact that Dr. Akagi had told her she wasn't needed as far as finding Misato a match was concerned; they could use a clone at any time. That line alone would have come as a slap in the face from anybody, but at this moment Rei could only see the blonde doctor's face, glowering at her over the rim of her glasses. She had wanted only a warm shower… she did not care to have Ikari touching her things.  
有那么一刻，丽感到愤怒……她在 NERV 度过了一个艰难的日子后回到家，尤其是赤城博士告诉她，在为美里寻找匹配者方面她并不被需要；他们随时可以使用克隆体。这句话本身就如同任何人的一记耳光，但此刻丽只能看到金发博士的脸，透过眼镜边缘怒视着她。她只想要一个温暖的淋浴……她并不希望碇去触碰她的东西。

"Sorry, I was cleaning up," Shinji explained, a hint of a smile on his boyish face. "I didn't touch anything except the trash."  
“对不起，我在打扫，”真嗣解释道，他那稚气的脸上带着一丝微笑。“除了垃圾，我什么都没碰。”

_He was only trying to help…  
他只是想帮忙……_

Rei felt the heat of embarrassment creeping into her face.  
丽感觉到羞愧的热度正悄悄爬上她的脸颊。

For some time, she did not know what to say…but when she finally responded, neither boy found her reply as strange as she herself did.  
有好一会儿，她不知道该说什么……但当她终于回应时，两个男孩都觉得她的回答并不像她自己感觉的那样奇怪。

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

---

Some time after the boys had left her room, Rei heard their voice outside her window and watched them as they made their way up the road.  
在男孩们离开她的房间一段时间后，丽听到他们在外面的声音，并看着他们沿着道路前行。

"Well, I guess all Eva pilots are strange," Suzuhara commented.  
“嗯，我想所有 EVA 驾驶员都很奇怪，”铃原评论道。

She remembered her initial encounter with Pilot Sorhyu, in which the Second had also informed her that she was strange.  
她记得自己初次遇见驾驶员惣流时，第二适格者也曾告诉她，她很奇怪。

Well, Rei had had enough strangeness for one day. She closed the window and walked to the bathroom, her socks making almost no sound on the carpet-less floor. Her own red eyes gazed back at her from her reflection in the mirror.  
好吧，绫波今天已经受够了这些奇怪的事。她关上窗户，走向浴室，赤脚在地毯缺失的地板上几乎没发出任何声响。镜中，她自己的红眼睛回望着她。

_Ikari does not know_, she recalled. _He will be the last to find out._  
碇并不知情，她回忆道。他将是最后一个得知的。

She did not know why this thought bothered her as she stepped into the shower and twisted the faucet, allowing the icy cold droplets to sprinkle over her skin while she waited for it to warm.  
她不明白为什么这个念头困扰着她，当她走进淋浴间，扭开水龙头，任由冰冷的水珠洒在皮肤上，等待水温变暖。

_I have not been told to inform Ikari of the Fourth Child's identity… that is for Misato to decide_.  
我没有被指示要告知碇第四适格者的身份……这是美里决定的。

Rei held her eyes open under the showerhead, hardly noticing the water in her eyes.  
丽在淋浴头下睁大眼睛，几乎没注意到水珠在她的眼眶中。

_Ikari went to the trouble of doing something for me… not because he was ordered to; he simply did it for me._ _It is not fair for him not to know…_ _perhaps I ought to…_  
碇真嗣特意为我做了些什么……不是因为被命令；他只是为了我而做。不让他知道对他不公平……也许我应该……

_No, it is not my place_.  
不，这不是我该插手的事。

Rei shut off the faucet. She removed a white towel from an overhead shelf and draped it over herself before disappearing back into her main room.  
丽关闭了水龙头。她从头顶的架子上取下一条白色毛巾，披在身上，然后消失在她的主房间里。

---

"Presentations for your group projects will begin tomorrow, as previously decided. I trust that you all will be very prepared to teach us an informative lesson."  
“如先前所定，你们小组项目的展示将于明天开始。我相信你们都会准备充分，为我们上一堂富有信息量的课。”

Hikari looked to Shinji and gave him a thumbs-up sign. Shinji smiled back, remembering that their poster was stored safely at school, in the teacher's closet. Behind him, Asuka growled menacingly at Touji, who appeared to pay no attention.  
光看向真嗣，向他竖起大拇指。真嗣回以微笑，记起他们的海报安全存放在学校的教师储物柜里。在他身后，明日香对冬二发出威胁的低吼，而冬二似乎并未在意。

"I'll help you when we get home," Shinji whispered out of the corner of his mouth.  
"回家后我会帮你，" 真嗣从嘴角低声说道。

"I'll do it myself," Asuka grumbled, "I don't need your help."  
"我自己能行，" 明日香咕哝着，"我不需要你的帮助。"

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Shinji ducked his head over his paper again, wondering miserably what he had done this time. It was disappointing, he thought, that Asuka's good moods so rarely lasted.  
真嗣再次埋头于他的作业，痛苦地思索着这次他又做错了什么。他想，明日香的好心情如此短暂，真是令人失望。

Two rows ahead of him, Hikari looked back at the class but focused in particular on the boy she liked. There was no doubt that something was wrong; he had either not been in school or had been spacing out during class. And come to think of it, he hadn't been eating lunch either—and Hikari knew very well just how much Touji Suzuhara liked food.  
在他前面两排，光回头看向全班，特别关注了她喜欢的那个男孩。毫无疑问，他一定出了什么问题；他要么没来学校，要么就是在课堂上走神。而且，说到这个，他连午餐都没吃——光非常清楚铃原东治有多么喜欢食物。

_Maybe I should prepare lunch for him tomorrow_, Hikari thought. _I've always got things left over from cooking for Nozomi and Kodama… no, maybe that would be too obvious. But it is my duty to look after my classmates—and if one of them is having problems, I should help, right?_  
也许我明天应该给他准备午餐，光想。我总是有多余的食物，因为要给望和儿玉做饭……不，也许那样太明显了。但照顾同学是我的责任——如果他们中有谁遇到问题，我应该帮忙，对吧？

"Miss Horaki." “堀木老师。”

"Yes!" Hikari snapped out of her daze. The teacher barely blinked as he extended a ceramic mug toward her. Not quite understanding what she was supposed to do, Hikari placed her hand into the cup and pulled out a folded piece of paper.  
"太好了！" 光从恍惚中回过神来。老师几乎没眨眼，将一个陶瓷杯递向她。光不太明白自己该做什么，便把手伸进杯子里，取出了一张折叠的纸条。

_7._

"What did you get?" she hissed to Asuka.  
"你抽到了什么？" 她低声问明日香。

"ONE!" Asuka shouted. "And obviously we won't be ready to present first, since HE isn't doing anything!"  
"一号！" 明日香喊道。"显然我们不会第一个展示，因为他什么都没做！"

The entire class turned as one to look at Touji, who had no reaction.  
全班同学齐刷刷地转向了东治，而他毫无反应。

Hikari gulped, waiting for Asuka to continue her tirade, but none followed. Instead the intercom came on, and they all listened intently.  
光咽了咽口水，等待着明日香继续她的责骂，但没有下文。取而代之的是，广播突然响起，所有人都专注地听着。

"Suzuhara Touji, of class 2A, please come to the principal's office immediately."  
“二年级 A 班的铃原东治，请立即到校长办公室来。”

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Suzuhara, you are excused," the teacher pronounced, extending his mug to the next pairing. Touji dragged his feet to the door and disappeared around the corner just as the student cried out, "Oh no! Ayami, we have to present second!"  
“铃原，你可以走了，”老师宣布道，将他的马克杯递给下一组。东治拖着脚步走向门口，就在他消失在转角时，一名学生惊呼道：“不好了！绫美，我们得第二个上台！”

Hikari kept her eyes firmly glued to the paper she held in her hand and away from the door, finally giving in to glance at her friends. Shinji looked plainly confused, while Asuka was frowning with her eyes closed and her arms crossed.  
光牢牢地将目光锁定在她手中的纸上，避免看向门口，最终还是忍不住瞥了一眼她的朋友们。真嗣看起来一脸困惑，而明日香则皱着眉头，闭着眼睛，双臂交叉。

_I'll stop by the market on the way home and buy some fresh tomatoes…  
我回家路上会顺便去市场买些新鲜的西红柿……_

---

"He still doesn't know?"  
“他还不知道？”

Misato sighed. "I just can't find a chance to tell him. I can't figure out what he's thinking. I don't know. I'm getting worried."  
美里叹了口气。“我就是找不到机会告诉他。我猜不透他在想什么。我不知道。我开始担心了。”

"You're the one who wanted to be his guardian," Ritsuko reminded.  
“是你自己想当他的监护人，”律子提醒道。

"I know… so the testing will be done at Matsushiro tomorrow?"  
"我知道……所以明天的测试将在松代进行？"

"Yes, speaking of which – have you discussed with Miki what you're going to do?"  
"是的，说到这个——你和美纪讨论过你们打算怎么做吗？"

"I'm definitely going," Misato said firmly. When Ritsuko's mouth opened, she quickly added, "with accommodations."  
"我肯定要去，"美里坚定地说。看到律子的嘴张开，她迅速补充道，"会安排住宿的。"

"What does Miki have to say about that?"  
"美纪对这事有什么看法？"

Misato chuckled mirthlessly. "Well, she's not happy about it, not that I'm really giving her any chance. Don't worry about me." Her face clouded over as her thoughts returned to Shinji. "Maybe the pilot will tell him about it himself."  
美里苦笑了一下。“她对此并不高兴，不过我也没给她什么机会。别担心我。”她的脸色阴沉下来，思绪回到了真嗣身上。“也许驾驶员会亲自告诉他吧。”

"That won't happen. He wasn't happy enough to brag about it. The only thing he was concerned about was having his younger sister transferred to the medical unit."  
"那不会发生的。他还没高兴到要炫耀的地步。他唯一关心的是他妹妹被调到医疗单位的事。"

"I should go see her sometime."  
"我应该找个时间去看看她。"

Silence. 沉默。

"You don't have any more news on a match for me, do you?" Misato whispered, only a faint wisp of hope in her voice.  
"你没再有适合我的匹配消息了，对吧？" 美里低声说道，声音中仅存一丝微弱的希望。

"I don't," Ritsuko apologized. "Maya's results haven't come out yet though, and neither have Shinji's. Miki is busy working on reinstating a program for donors."  
"我没有，" 律子道歉道。"不过真耶的结果还没出来，真嗣的也是。美纪正在忙着恢复捐助者计划。"

"Shinji, huh?" "真嗣，是吧？"

"Well, it's worth a try…"  
"嗯，值得一试……"

"I guess." She lay back down and focused on the pattern of the ceiling. "I wonder how many of those little dots there are? I've been trying to count for several days now but I keep losing count."  
"我想也是。她又躺了回去，专注地盯着天花板上的图案。"我在想那上面有多少个小点呢？我已经数了好几天了，但总是数着数着就忘了数到哪儿了。"

Ritsuko privately reminded herself to procure permission from Namika to allow Misato to go out more often.  
律子私下提醒自己要征得美香同意，让美里更常外出。

"Take care of yourself," she insisted. "I'll be seeing you tomorrow."  
“照顾好自己，”她坚持道，“明天见。”

She had just shut the door to Misato's room when somebody came running up behind her, breathing heavily. Ritsuko turned to see Miki, waving her clipboard as usual. A faint glimmer of hope found its way into Ritsuko's mind—Miki looked _happy_, for the first time in weeks—but she hardly dared hope—  
她刚关上美里的房门，就有人从后面跑来，气喘吁吁。律子转身一看，是美希，像往常一样挥舞着她的文件夹。一丝微弱的希望涌入律子的心头——美希看起来很高兴，这是几周以来的第一次——但她几乎不敢抱有希望——

"Into my office," were Namika's first words, and Ritsuko followed the doctor into her room and closed the door behind her.  
“到我办公室来。”这是摩耶的第一句话，律子跟着医生走进她的房间，并随手关上了门。

"We have a match!" “我们找到了匹配的！”

"Maya?" “麻耶？”

"No, the Third Child—Shinji Ikari!"  
"不，是第三适格者——碇真嗣！"

"What…?" "什么…？"

Ritsuko could scarcely believe it; _Shinji a match…_  
律子几乎无法相信；真嗣居然是匹配的…

"Look." Namika reached over to her desk and pulled over a large stack of documents, apparently brimming with excitement. "Look at the HLAs…this one's Misato's, this one's Shinji's…" She spoke so quickly that Ritsuko had hardly a moment to look at the page before she had moved on to another diagram. "Her antigen pattern and his share—"  
“看。” 奈美香伸手到她的桌上，拉过一大叠文件，显然是兴奋不已。“看看这些 HLAs……这个是美里小姐的，这个是真嗣的……” 她说话快得让律子几乎没时间看一眼页面，她就已经翻到了另一张图表。“她的抗原模式和他的共享——”

"Spare me the medical lecture; chances are I won't understand half of it anyway," Ritsuko begged. Namika pulled the stack back over to her, looking concerned at Ritsuko's grim face. "Just tell me, how likely do you think this will give Misato another chance at life?"  
“别跟我讲医学课了；反正我多半也听不懂一半，”律子恳求道。奈美香把那叠文件拉回自己面前，担忧地看着律子阴沉的脸。“直接告诉我，你觉得这给美里再活一次的机会有多大？”

"I can't be one-hundred percent sure, obviously, but it's pretty darn likely." Namika breathed again at seeing Ritsuko's tension dissipate. "Now, do you want to inform Shinji, or should I do it?"  
“我当然不能百分百确定，但可能性相当大。” 看到律子的紧张情绪有所缓解，奈美香松了口气。“现在，你想通知真嗣吗，还是我来？”

"I'll tell Shinji. You can tell Misato."  
"我会告诉真嗣的。你可以告诉美里。"

"All right." "好的。"

Ritsuko pulled her old college friend into a hug as she stood up; Miki, who was not used to such casualness from Dr. Akagi, was taken aback at first, then warmly returned the gesture before hurrying out of the room.  
理津子站起身来，将她大学时代的老朋友紧紧拥入怀中；美纪从未习惯过赤木博士如此随意的举动，一开始有些惊讶，随后便热情地回应了这个拥抱，然后匆匆离开了房间。

_We always refer to the Evangelion as a miracle_, Ritsuko thought, _but the biggest miracles are those that happen in the medical field…_  
我们总是将福音战士称为奇迹，理津子心想，但最大的奇迹其实发生在医疗领域……

She had a fleeting moment in which she wished she had become a medical doctor instead of one that worked with giant biomechanical monsters. Ritsuko reached for the phone, then decided she would rather inform the Third face-to-face. She picked up her purse and strode out of the office, her heels clanking on the polished floor.  
有那么一瞬，她希望自己成为一名内科医生，而不是与巨大生物机械怪物打交道的专家。律子伸手去拿电话，随即决定还是亲自去通知第三适任者。她拿起手提包，大步走出办公室，高跟鞋在光亮的地板上发出清脆的声响。

For the first time that winter, snow was something beautiful to be enjoyed, and Ritsuko took her time getting to her car through the thick snowdrifts. In that moment she knew nothing of NERV or Evangelions; her mind was filled only with Misato's life, that she was going to be all right, that everything would be fine…  
那是冬天里第一次，雪成了值得欣赏的美景，律子在厚厚的雪堆中慢慢走向自己的车。那一刻，她对 NERV 或福音战士一无所知；她的心中只充满了美里生命的希望，她会安然无恙，一切都会好起来的……

"Unit 3 activation Test: T minus 30 minutes."  
"三号机启动测试：倒计时 30 分钟。"

"Refrigeration systems in all sections functioning at standard levels."  
各区域制冷系统均正常运行。

"Pressure lock on left arm secured in place."  
左臂压力锁已固定到位。

"Misato-san?" "美里小姐？"

Misato's haggard face broke into a smile upon seeing him upon the screen in front of her. Shinji was already in Unit 01, awaiting further directions. As for Misato, she was seated inside a cozy piece of shelter, surrounded by various TV screens, showing her what was going on in various areas around the testing site.  
看到屏幕上的他，美里憔悴的脸上露出了笑容。真嗣已经进入初号机，等待进一步指示。至于美里，她坐在一个舒适的避难所内，周围是各种电视屏幕，显示着测试场地各区域的实时情况。

"I'm so happy, Misato-san," Shinji broke out breathlessly. "I was so glad when Ritsuko told me last night…"  
"我太高兴了，美里小姐，" 真嗣喘着气说道。"昨晚听到律子告诉我的时候，我真的很开心……"

She let him talk. He was rarely this happy, and she was determined to let it last as long as it could. Her thoughts wandered back to the Fourth and her smile waned.  
她让他继续说下去。他很少这么开心，她决心让这份喜悦尽可能地延续下去。她的思绪飘回到第四次冲击，笑容渐渐淡去。

"Misato-san?" "美里小姐？"

"I'm really happy too," she told him. "Shinji, I—"  
"我也很高兴，" 她对他说。"真嗣，我——"

"The Fourth Child has arrived. Squad 2, begin entry preparations immediately."  
"第四个孩子已经抵达。第二小队，立即开始进入准备。"

Misato frowned. "I'll talk to you later," she promised Shinji, and a moment later his worried face disappeared from view.  
美里皱了皱眉。“我稍后再和你谈，”她向真嗣承诺道，随即他担忧的面孔便从视线中消失了。

"Did you tell him?" Ritsuko asked as she entered.  
"你告诉他了吗？" 律子走进来问道。

"I'll tell him after this test," she answered decisively before stretching her arms out as far as they would reach above her head. "Exclusive possession of four EVAs… if we wanted to, we could destroy the world."  
"我会在这次测试后告诉他，" 她果断地回答，然后尽可能高地伸展双臂。"四台 EVA 的专属使用权……如果我们愿意，可以毁灭世界。"

"You don't sound too happy. This unit will be under your direct command, you know."  
"你听起来不太高兴。这个单位将直接由你指挥，你知道的。"

"Entry plug secured," the operator's voice announced, and both ladies quickly turned their attention back to the panels. "Begin Phase One connection. Transmitting pulses… graph displace within norms. List clear through 1-3-5-0."  
"插入栓已固定，" 操作员的声音宣布，两位女士迅速将注意力转回面板。"开始第一阶段连接。传输脉冲……图表显示在正常范围内。清单已清除至 1-3-5-0。"

"Transfer the operation to Phase Two," Ritsuko responded.  
"将行动转入第二阶段," 律子回应道。

"Full nerve link established. List clear through 2-5-5-0. Harmonics all reading standard."  
"完全神经连接已建立。清单清晰至 2-5-5-0。谐波读数均为标准。"

"Approaching absolute threshold."  
"接近绝对阈值。"

"There's a huge power surge coming from inside the unit," Ritsuko groaned, worry etching itself into lines across her face. "Abort the test! Cut the circuits!"  
"从单元内部传来一股巨大的能量波动，" 律子皱着眉头，忧虑在她脸上刻下了深深的皱纹。"中止测试！切断电路！"

---

"He hasn't come yet, Asuka."  
"他还没来，明日香。"

"Maybe he won't come today," Asuka muttered. She was seated at her desk, her head propped up with one fist, while Hikari lingered near the door with a neatly wrapped bento in hand.  
"也许他今天不会来了，" 明日香低声嘟囔着。她坐在桌前，头靠在一只手上，而光子则站在门口，手里拿着一个包装整齐的便当。"

Asuka was furious. Touji had been "unreachable" during the previous night, and she had stayed up until four finishing the project on her own. Now Hikari was busy fawning over the boy, and all she wanted to do was to lie down and sleep—yet her cell phone chose just that moment to go off.  
明日香气得要命。昨晚东治一直“联系不上”，她独自熬夜到四点才完成项目。现在光忙着讨好那家伙，而她只想躺下睡觉——可偏偏就在这时，她的手机响了起来。

Asuka jumped to her feet and ran for the door, along with the rest of the students who were attempting to get into a shelter.  
明日香一跃而起，和其他试图进入避难所的学生们一起冲向门口。

---

"There's been an accident involving an explosion at Matsushiro!"  
“松代发生了一起涉及爆炸的事故！”

"What about Misato-san?" Shinji yelled, but his voice was drowned out by the technicians':  
"美里小姐呢？" 真嗣喊道，但他的声音被技术人员们的声音淹没了：

"Unidentified moving object detected as the site."  
"检测到现场有不明移动物体。"

"Pattern orange, can't be confirmed as an angel."  
"橙色模式，无法确认为使徒。"

A tiny panel popped up on the side of Shinji's screen. Rei appeared in it, looking calm and composed as always, as she informed him, "They can't establish contact yet."  
一个微小的窗口弹出在真嗣屏幕的一侧。零出现在其中，一如既往地平静自若，她告诉他：“他们还无法建立联系。”

"Oh no… what should I do?"  
“哦不……我该怎么办？”

A second panel appeared, this time featuring an angry Asuka who had been hurried into Unit 02. "What are you whining about? We can't do anything but worry now!  
第二个窗口出现，这次是愤怒的明日香，她匆忙进入了 02 号机。“你在抱怨什么？我们现在除了担心什么也做不了！”

Rei's panel disappeared as Shigeru announced, "The target is approaching… All units, stand by for ground battle. We've got a visual on the main screen."  
随着四郎宣布，“目标正在接近…所有单位，准备地面战斗。主屏幕上已经捕捉到图像。”

---

In most situations, Asuka liked to think that nothing could rattle her, but her jaw dropped and her eyes widened upon seeing this image. She heard Shinji's mechanically modified voice protesting, "No way… an Angel? _That's_ the angel? That's an EVA, isn't it?"  
在大多数情况下，明日香喜欢认为自己无所畏惧，但看到这个图像时，她的下巴掉了下来，眼睛瞪得大大的。她听到真嗣经过机械改造的声音抗议道，“不可能…是使徒？那是使徒吗？那不是 EVA 吗？”

"I can't believe it," she whispered to no one in particular. "Was it taken over by an angel?"  
“我简直不敢相信，”她喃喃自语，并非针对任何人。“是被使徒控制了吗？”

"Is it piloted by a kid, like the other units? A child my age?"  
"是由一个孩子驾驶的吗，就像其他单位一样？和我同龄的孩子？"

_He doesn't know_, Asuka thought. Her heart thudded in her chest. _He's going to kill him…_ but for a few minutes she did not know which boy was 'he' and which boy was 'him', and she did not like to think of the consequences that would follow either situation.  
他不知道，明日香心想。她的心跳在胸腔中怦怦作响。他打算杀了他……但在几分钟内，她不知道哪个男孩是‘他’，哪个男孩是‘他’，她也不愿意去想任何一种情况会带来的后果。

_I have to tell him… I have to stop this…  
我必须告诉他……我必须阻止这一切……_

"Don't you know yet? Evangelion Unit 03 is—"  
"你还不明白吗？EVA 三号机是——"

Her screen blacked out and she screamed in fury. Someone had knowingly cut off her connection in an attempt to keep her from informing Shinji of the pilot's wasted precious time shouting her name, while The Commander announced smoothly, "From this time, Evangelion Unit 03 is abandoned, and the target is identified as the 13th angel."  
她的屏幕突然黑屏，她愤怒地尖叫起来。有人故意切断了她的连接，试图阻止她告知真嗣，而指挥官却平静地宣布：“从现在起，EVA 三号机被废弃，目标被确认为第 13 使徒。”

---

Rei had heard everything, yet remained silent. Still, she flinched visibly as she was forced to watch Asuka's Eva being crushed by Unit 03.  
绫波听到了一切，却保持沉默。尽管如此，当她被迫目睹明日香的 EVA 被三号机碾压时，她明显地颤抖了一下。

_The Angel,_ she corrected herself mentally.  
天使，她在心中默默纠正了自己。

"Pilot has ejected. Salvage crew is on the way."  
“驾驶员已弹射。救援队正在赶来。”

"The target is moving toward you, Rei—avoid close combat, and stop the target. I'll send Unit 01 soon."  
“目标正向你移动，丽——避免近战，阻止目标。我很快会派出 01 号机。”

Rei braced herself, readying the gun. Yet she hesitated just a fraction of a second too long.  
丽做好了准备，紧握着枪。然而，她犹豫的时间仅仅多了一刹那。

The amount of time it took to think "_He's in there._"  
那短短一瞬，她心中闪过念头：“他在里面。”

---

_Two Evas out in less than five minutes_, Shinji thought desperately. As Unit 03 neared him, he caught a glimpse of the entry plug.  
不到五分钟内两台 EVA 被击倒，真嗣绝望地想。当 03 号机接近他时，他瞥见了插入栓。

_There's somebody inside! 里面有人！_

Amidst all the shouting about Rei's injuries, Shinji heard his father announcing, "The target is approaching. You will contact it within twenty… take care of it."  
在关于零受伤的嘈杂声中，真嗣听到他的父亲宣布：“目标正在接近。你将在二十秒内接触到它……处理好它。”

His fingers tightened on the controls.  
他的手指紧紧握住操纵杆。

---

"Misato?"  "美里？"

With effort, Misato willed herself back to consciousness. Somebody was tugging on her hand, and she squeezed back lightly. The next thing she knew, somebody was helping her to sit up and she leaned against him.  
美里费力地让自己恢复意识。有人正拉着她的手，她轻轻地回握了一下。紧接着，有人扶她坐起来，她便靠在了他身上。

"Kaji," she muttered. “加持，”她喃喃道。

"You're bleeding." He examined the wound, then took off his shirt and pressed it against her head to staunch the bleeding. Misato turned away, but he held the wadded material tightly in place.  
"你在流血。" 他检查了伤口，然后脱下衬衫，按在她的头上止血。美里转过头去，但他紧紧地按住那团布料。

"Damn you," she cursed. "Where are we?"  
"该死的，" 她咒骂道。"我们在哪儿？"

Her feet were numb from the January cold; apparently they were no longer inside the warm little room she recalled. She opened her eyes with a creditable effort to see a large crater in front of them. Her fingers scrabbled across the ground. She felt dried leaves. A few inches further, and they touched concrete.  
她的双脚因一月的寒冷而麻木；显然，他们已不在她记忆中温暖的小房间里。她费力地睁开眼睛，看到前方有一个巨大的弹坑。她的手指在地上摸索，触到了枯叶。再往前几英寸，它们碰到了混凝土。

Kaji sighed. "Well, we're somewhere in the middle of the forest around the ex-testing site." Misato tried to sit up further, but he held her in place, saying, "We can't go anywhere, Katsuragi, they're still battling it out."  
加持叹了口气。“好吧，我们现在位于前试验场地周围的森林某处。”美里试图坐起来，但他按住了她，说道：“我们哪儿也去不了，葛城，他们还在激战。”

"Battle what out?" she muttered angrily. Misato felt as if she were trying to put together a puzzle in which the pieces kept disappearing just as she nearly had her fingers locked around it. A thundering crash shook the ground and she cried out from the pain. Kaji tightened his arms around her.  
“激战什么？”她愤怒地低声说道。美里感觉自己像是在拼一个拼图，每当她快要抓住一块时，那块拼图就消失了。一声雷鸣般的撞击震动了地面，她因疼痛而叫出声来。加持紧紧地抱住了她。

"Unit 01 has been ordered to regard Unit 03 as the thirteenth angel," he explained somberly.  
“零号机被命令将三号机视为第十三使徒，”他严肃地解释道。

"What about Asuka? Rei?" “那明日香呢？丽呢？”

He glanced toward their left, and Misato followed his gaze to see Evangelion Unit 00's large severed arm resting by their side. But the scene that awaited her in the distance was far worse: Evangelion Unit 03, hovering over 01 as the former attempted to strangle the latter, pounding it mercilessly into the mountain.  
他朝左边瞥了一眼，美里顺着他的目光看去，只见零号机的巨大断臂静静躺在他们身旁。但远处等待她的景象更为惨烈：三号机悬停在初号机上方，试图掐住后者，无情地将其猛击入山体。

"_Shinji-kun_!" "真嗣君！"

She struggled to get up, but Kaji held her down.  
她挣扎着想要起身，但加持按住了她。

"I haven't told him," she whispered. "He doesn't know…"  
"我还没告诉他，" 她低声说，"他还不知道…"

"He must know something; he's not fighting back," Kaji muttered. He increased the force on his wadded shirt and frowned at the scene.  
"他肯定察觉到了什么；他并没有反击，" 加持喃喃道。他加大了手中揉皱的衬衫的力度，皱眉看着这一幕。"

"Well, if it goes on like this, he'll die! Cut the synchronization to sixty percent!"  
"这样下去，他会死的！把同步率降到百分之六十！"

"Katsuragi… this is out of your hands now."  
"葛城…现在这事已不在你掌控之中了。"

She hated it, not being at the head of the operation. For now, Major Misato Katsuragi was an outsider to the world of NERV; she had no control, she was not even privy to what information was being exchanged between NERV headquarters and the Eva. For the first time, she could only watch as a horrified civilian.  
她讨厌这样，无法主导行动。眼下，葛城美里少校在 NERV 的世界里成了局外人；她无法掌控局面，甚至连 NERV 总部与 EVA 之间的信息交流也无从得知。这是她第一次只能作为一个惊恐的平民旁观。

Her head throbbed; she put up a hand to her temple and pulled it away, sticky with blood.  
她的头阵阵作痛；她抬起手按在太阳穴上，收回时手上沾满了血。

"Kaji…" "加持…"

"Something's changed." His voice was tense, drawing her back to the ongoing battle. "Look, Katsuragi… he's fighting back."  
"有些事情变了。" 他的声音紧张，将她拉回到正在进行的战斗中。"看，葛城…他在反击。"

_Shinji wouldn't fight back_, Misato thought desperately, _he wouldn't hurt a fly…_ yet then the memories of the Fourth angel came back to haunt her. _Shinji will do what it takes to kill an angel… if he doesn't know…_  
真嗣不会反击的，美里绝望地想，他连只苍蝇都不会伤害…然而，第四使徒的记忆又回来困扰她。真嗣会不惜一切杀死使徒…如果他不知道…

She winced instinctively as Unit 01 threw its opponent to the ground and began ripping furiously at the back. Part of her hoped desperately that Shinji would win the battle and defeat the angel, but her other half reminded her that it was not quite fair to hope for the Fourth's death either. Once again Misato felt her hopelessness amplify, and she wanted to scream with frustration.  
她本能地皱眉，当零号机将对手摔倒在地并开始狂暴地撕扯背部时。一部分的她迫切希望真嗣能赢得战斗，击败使徒，但另一半却提醒她，同样不公平地希望四号机的死亡。米莎托再次感到绝望加剧，她想要尖叫以宣泄挫败感。

Kaji muttered something incomprehensible as Unit 01 towered over the broken 03, clutching it's entry plug in its massive hand.  
加持喃喃自语，零号机高耸在破碎的 03 号机上方，用其巨大的手掌紧握着插入栓。

Misato could have sworn she heard Shinji's scream, but under her current conditions she attributed it to hallucinations. Nevertheless, the _crunch_ that came with the scream was most certainly audible, and it lingered in her head for several moments afterwards.  
米莎托发誓她听到了真嗣的尖叫，但在她目前的状况下，她将其归咎于幻觉。尽管如此，伴随着尖叫的碎裂声确实清晰可闻，并在她脑海中萦绕了许久。

"He doesn't know… " Misato whispered, as if it made all the difference in the world. She cried silently instead, tears mingling with the blood. She knew now that the duty of informing Shinji of the Fourth's identity would also involve informing him of his subsequent death.  
"他不知道…" 美里低语，仿佛这改变了一切。她无声地哭泣，泪水与血混合。她现在明白，告知真嗣第四适格者身份的同时，也必须告诉他随之而来的死亡。

_How cruel life is… 生活是多么残酷…_

She let herself fade into oblivion as Kaji watched on helplessly.  
她让自己逐渐陷入昏迷，而加持无助地旁观。

NERV's hospital was being swarmed. Namika was kept on her toes, running from room to room, prepping for surgery and taking x-rays. Twenty minutes earlier she had seen the Major into the hospital and begun transferring fluids to her dehydrated body, but for now three of her top assistants were handling the Major alone, and she was needed elsewhere.  
NERV 的医院正被蜂拥而至的患者挤满。Namika 忙得脚不沾地，穿梭于各个房间之间，准备手术和拍摄 X 光片。二十分钟前，她将 Major 送进医院并开始为她脱水的身体输送液体，但目前她的三名顶级助手正在单独处理 Major 的情况，她则需要前往其他地方支援。

"You've got a comminuted fracture," she told the worker grimly as she fiddled with the X-ray machine. "Hold still now… done."  
“你这是粉碎性骨折，”她一边调整 X 光机一边严肃地对工人说，“现在别动……好了。”

The man swore intensely as he tried to move his hand.  
男人试图移动他的手，嘴里咒骂连连。

Things had quickly gone from bad to worse. The explosion that had nearly killed Misato and Ritsuko, along with several hundred others, would have been enough on its own to warrant an emergency, but three of out of NERV's four viable pilots were now physically injured, and the fourth… Namika knew that emotional injuries were much harder and took longer to heal. Misato herself was a prime example of that.  
情况迅速从糟糕恶化到了更糟。那场几乎夺走美里和律子以及数百人性命的爆炸，本身就足以构成紧急状况，但如今 NERV 的四名可用驾驶员中，有三名身体受伤，而第四名……美里自己就是个典型例子，直美知道情感创伤更难愈合，且需要更长时间。

The Second Child, Sorhyu Asuka Langley, had fortunately been extricated from her entry plug before suffering any serious injuries—a broken arm and a grade-3 concussion.  
二号适格者，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，幸运地在遭受严重伤害前被从插入栓中救出——仅有一条手臂骨折和三级脑震荡。

The First Child, Ayanami Rei, had not been so fortunate. She had been nearly unconscious by the time rescuers reached her entry plug and for the time being, remained comatose but stable.  
一号适格者，绫波零，就没那么幸运了。救援人员到达她的插入栓时，她已近乎昏迷，目前仍处于昏迷但稳定的状态。

The Fourth Child… Namika shivered. She had heard of him previously from Misato and Ritsuko, yet the first time she met him he was near death and had to be told that he was going to have an arm and a leg amputated. He was asleep now, and for that Namika was grateful; she was not looking forward to telling him that his dreams of being a star basketball player were now galaxies away.  
第四个孩子……娜美卡颤抖了一下。她之前从美里和律子那里听说过他，但第一次见到他时，他已濒临死亡，不得不被告知将失去一条胳膊和一条腿。他现在睡着了，对此娜美卡感到庆幸；她并不期待告诉他，他成为篮球明星的梦想如今已遥不可及。

She returned to Misato's room.  
她回到了美里的房间。

"We're almost finished, Dr. Ishiyama," one of her assistants informed her breathlessly from behind her blue mask.  
“我们快完成了，石山博士，”她的一位戴着蓝色口罩的助手在她身后气喘吁吁地通知她。

"Let me see." Namika crossed the room and tipped Misato's head gently. "It looks pretty good. Put a sterilized bandage over it, and keep me updated."  
"让我看看。" 娜美卡穿过房间，轻轻托起美里头。"看起来还不错。贴上消毒纱布，有情况随时告诉我。"

"Yes, Dr. Ishiyama." "好的，石山医生。"

---

It took Asuka longer than she would have liked to recover—almost three weeks before the neck stiffness, headache, and confusion went away. She spent most of the twenty-one days in bed, but during the few hours that she felt well enough to stand on both feet, she visited Misato or Rei. The latter had been much harder, seeing as Asuka usually had little to say to the First Child, but she felt somehow that this fight had tied them all together.  
对于明日香来说，恢复的时间比她预期的要长——几乎三周后，颈部僵硬、头痛和混乱才消失。她大部分时间都躺在床上，但在感觉足够好、能双脚站立的几个小时里，她会去看望美里或丽。后者要困难得多，因为明日香通常和第一适格者没什么话可说，但她觉得这场战斗不知怎的将她们紧密联系在了一起。

She cried upon hearing that Touji was alive, and cried again when she learned that he had lost two limbs in the fight. The redhead no longer knew why she cried; she wasn't sure if it was out of relief, sadness, or guilt that she had treated him so over a stupid chemistry project. Now, three weeks after the incident, she still could not find the courage to enter his hospital room. Shinji had done it several times, and things had apparently not gone well.  
得知真人还活着，她哭了；得知他在战斗中失去了两条肢体，她又哭了。红发女孩已不知自己为何哭泣；她不确定是因为松了口气、悲伤，还是因为对一个愚蠢的化学项目过于苛责他而感到内疚。如今，事件过去三周了，她仍鼓不起勇气走进他的病房。真嗣已经去过几次，显然情况并不顺利。

_Shinji_. Asuka sighed as she wandered down the hallway. He was a completely different story; he had been hospitalized briefly as a result of the battle, then escaped from his room (Section II agents later discovered him in one of the obscure back hallways of NERV, curled up against the wall and sobbing). They had not wanted to send him back to the Katsuragi apartment, seeing as nobody occupied it now. Ritsuko had offered to take him in once she herself was discharged from the hospital, but that day had not yet come to pass, and everybody was privately against sending him to live with his father, who appeared (once again) to be completely indifferent to the feelings of his only son.  
真嗣。明日香叹息着在走廊上徘徊。他的情况截然不同；他在战斗后短暂住院，随后逃离了病房（第二部队的特工后来在 NERV 一处偏僻的后走廊发现他，蜷缩在墙边哭泣）。他们本不想送他回葛城公寓，毕竟现在那里无人居住。律子曾提出等自己出院后收留他，但那一天尚未到来，而且私下里大家都反对让他去和父亲同住，那位父亲再次显得对独子漠不关心。

So they kept him at NERV. And nobody dared mention the transplant.  
于是他们将他留在 NERV。而没有人敢提及移植的事。

The entire situation was a considerable, unexpected setback.  
整个情况是一次相当大的、出乎意料的挫折。

Misato took the blame for the incident onto her shoulders, despite the fact that Ritsuko continually assured her that it would not have made any difference whether or not Shinji had known that Touji was the one inside the entry plug. Shinji himself had said so, in one of his calmer moods. The Major's wounds had healed well, but she paid little attention to her health these days—there were more pressing issues on the horizon.  
尽管律子一再向她保证，无论真嗣是否知道是东治在插入栓内，都不会有任何区别，美里还是将这次事件的责任揽到了自己肩上。真嗣本人也在他较为平静的时候这样说过。美里少校的伤势愈合得很好，但她现在很少关注自己的健康——眼前有更紧迫的问题。

Asuka passed Shinji's room and knocked lightly on his door with her good hand. No response. She inched it open and saw that it was empty.  
明日香经过真嗣的房间，用她那只好手轻轻敲了敲门。没有回应。她轻轻推开门，发现里面空无一人。

_Maybe he went to the bathroom.  
也许他去洗手间了。_

But when he still hadn't shown up four hours later, Misato began to worry, and the Section II agents were dispatched once again. Asuka watched them leave through her hospital window.  
但四个小时过去了，他仍未出现，美里开始担心，第二部门的特工再次被派了出去。明日香透过医院的窗户看着他们离开。

Hikari preferred to shop in the mornings, but today was so cold that she had held off until the afternoon. She frowned upon reaching the market. Suzuhara-kun had not come to school for a few weeks now, and she had instead been forced to distribute his lunch out to other classmates.  
光喜欢在早晨购物，但今天实在太冷，她一直拖到下午才出门。到达市场时，她皱起了眉头。铃原君已经好几周没来学校了，她不得不将他的午餐分发给其他同学。

She examined the variously sized bags of rice, picked the largest that she could possibly carry, and enlisted the help of the clerk in loading it into her cart. Hikari jerked a plastic bag from the roll hanging over her head and placed three ripe cucumbers into it. The bag of rice began to worry her – what if she could not get it all the way home? The roads were wet and slushy, and she did not wish to be completely soaked. She plucked a bag of pre-packaged carrots from the stack and wheeled her cart toward the cashier.  
她仔细查看了各种大小的米袋，选了能搬动的最大的那袋，并请店员帮忙装进购物车。光从头顶悬挂的卷筒上扯下一个塑料袋，放了三根成熟的黄瓜进去。那袋米开始让她担心——万一她搬不回家怎么办？道路湿滑泥泞，她可不想全身湿透。她从堆里拿了一袋预包装的胡萝卜，推着购物车向收银台走去。

"Are you sure you can handle it, miss?"  
“小姐，你确定能行吗？”

"I certainly hope so," Hikari replied, trying to keep the strain out of her voice. The bag was so large that she could barely see over the top when it was safely nestled in her arms, the other vegetables hanging in a bag from her wrist.  
“我当然希望如此，”光回答道，努力不让声音中流露出紧张。这个袋子太大了，她抱着它时几乎看不到前方，其他蔬菜则挂在她手腕上的另一个袋子里。

Just as she made her way out onto the sidewalk, a car splashed through a puddle and drenched her in muddy water. Hikari sighed helplessly and kept walking, forced to determine her location by looking out at either side instead of in front of her. Fortunately, she did not have to worry about bumping into others since few people were out due to the cold.  
正当她走上人行道时，一辆车溅起水坑中的泥水，将她淋了个透。光无奈地叹了口气，继续前行，只能通过两侧的景象来判断位置，而不是正前方。幸运的是，她不必担心撞到别人，因为寒冷的天气里行人稀少。

For that reason, she noticed someone coming in her direction on the opposite side of the road. He was tall and lanky, wearing only thin clothes, and Hikari felt a twinge of pity as she watched him make his way down the road slowly, against the wind. The pity, however, soon turned to fright as he tripped and fell facefirst into the snow, where he lay immobile.  
正因为如此，她注意到有人从马路对面朝她走来。他高大而瘦削，只穿着单薄的衣服，光看着他逆风缓慢前行，心中不禁涌起一丝同情。然而，这份同情很快变成了惊恐，因为他绊倒了，脸朝下摔进了雪地里，躺在那里一动不动。

Hikari dropped her groceries and ran across the street. She dropped to her knees next to him and shook his shoulder vigorously, while shouting, "Are you all right, sir?"  
光里丢下购物袋，跑过街道。她跪在他身边，用力摇晃他的肩膀，同时大声喊道：“先生，你还好吗？”

"done… terrible…" “完了……糟糕透顶……”

Hikari could not make out his words, but his voice was vaguely familiar. She paused, scarcely daring to believe it. "Ikari?"  
光里听不清他的话，但他的声音却隐约熟悉。她停顿了一下，几乎不敢相信。“碇？”

"…terrible… things…" "…可怕…的事情…"

_Where is this NERV security that Asuka always talks about?_ Hikari mused angrily. She tugged at Shinji's arm, but he made no effort to get up.  
阿斯卡总是提到的 NERV 安保在哪里？光愤怒地想着。她拉了拉真嗣的手臂，但他丝毫没有起身的意思。

"Please, Shinji!" she found herself shouting. A car drove past them, the driver taking no notice of the children in the snow. "Please get up!"  
"求你了，真嗣！"她发现自己在大声喊叫。一辆车从他们身边驶过，司机没有注意到雪地里的孩子们。"求你站起来！"

His eyes fluttered open briefly. "Class Rep?"  
他的眼睛微微睁开。“班长？”

"Yes, it's me." Hikari breathed a sigh of relief. _So he's not completely delirious or frozen, but he will be soon if he stays like this!_ "Please get up… you can come to my house and get warm! Just don't stay in the snow like this!"  
“是的，是我。”光松了一口气。看来他并没有完全神志不清或冻僵，但如果他继续这样下去，很快就会了！“请站起来……你可以来我家取暖！千万别再待在雪地里了！”

After what seemed like an eternity and much straining of Hikari's muscles, the boy got slowly to his feet. The Class Representative led him cautiously across the road over to her fallen groceries, which she picked up before continuing the journey home.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，光费了好大力气，男孩才慢慢站起身来。班长小心翼翼地领着他穿过马路，走到她散落的杂货旁，她捡起它们后继续往家走去。

Shinji leaned on her for support. Hikari began to tell him not to do that, as she was covered in mud and would ruin his clothes, but one glance at him reminded her that he, too, was soaked. He didn't speak all the way home, and she said nothing either. The weight of the rice was forgotten.  
真嗣靠在她身上寻求支撑。光一开始想告诉他别这样，因为她浑身是泥，会弄脏他的衣服，但看他一眼就让她想起，他也全身湿透了。回家的路上他一言不发，她也没有说话。米袋的重量已被遗忘。

Nozomi opened the door for them. Her eyes widened and she shouted, "I knew it! I knew it! Hikari's got a boyfriend!"  
望为他们开了门。她的眼睛睁得大大的，喊道：“我就知道！我就知道！光有男朋友了！”

"Shut up," Hikari hissed. Shinji, however, didn't react at all, so Hikari took the opportunity to throw her groceries into her younger sister's arms and lead her classmate into the house.  
“闭嘴，”光低声呵斥。然而，真嗣毫无反应，于是光趁机把买的东西塞到妹妹怀里，领着同学进了屋。

"Hik—" "咳——"

"Look," Hikari whispered fiercely, "I don't know what's wrong with him, but it's pretty darn obvious he needs some help. Now go put the rice away."  
"听着，"光严厉地低声说道，"我不知道他怎么了，但他显然需要帮助。现在去把米收好。"

Nozomi, surprised at this attitude, nodded and began lugging the rice toward the kitchen. Shinji's shoes were caked with snow and his fingers were much too stiff to untie them, so Hikari got them off for him and with effort, managed to coax him up the stairs.  
望美对这种态度感到惊讶，点了点头，开始把米搬向厨房。真嗣的鞋子上沾满了雪，手指僵硬得无法解开鞋带，于是光帮他脱下鞋子，费力地扶他上了楼梯。

_I'll sweep away the snow we tracked in later,_ she thought, _but where am I going to put Shinji? Nozomi and Kodama won't think of having him in their beds—and Dad will go crazy if he finds a guy in my bed—I guess he can stay in Dad's bed for the time being, and I'll get new sheets and blankets on there tonight—_  
我稍后再清理我们带进来的雪，她想，但我要把真嗣放在哪儿呢？望和儿玉不会想到让他睡她们的床——而爸爸要是发现有个男生在我床上会发疯的——我想暂时让他睡爸爸的床，今晚我再去铺上新床单和毯子——

But no sooner had Hikari entered the room than she realized she had another problem on her hands, one that was much worse than deciding where he would rest. She could not allow Shinji to sleep in his wet clothes, and she—well, she was not about to redress him. Hikari compromised by finding some of her father's old clothes, handing them to him, and excusing herself out of the room.  
但光刚进房间就意识到她还有另一个更棘手的问题，那就是不能让真嗣穿着湿衣服睡觉。而她——好吧，她可不打算再给他换衣服。光妥协了一下，找来一些她父亲的旧衣服递给他，然后自己离开了房间。

"Who is he?" Nozomi pressed as her older sister appeared in the kitchen doorway. "And before you ask, yes I put the rice in the pantry, and yes I put the cucumbers and carrots in the refrigerator."  
“他是谁？”望追问着，当她姐姐出现在厨房门口时。“在你问之前，是的，我把米放进了食品储藏室，是的，我把黄瓜和胡萝卜放进了冰箱。”

"He's a classmate." Hikari set some water on to boil and removed a small vial of tealeaves from an overhead cabinet. She waited for the water to heat, then steeped the tea in a ceramic cup. "Where's Kodama?"  
"他是我的同学。" 光在炉子上烧了些水，并从头顶的橱柜里取出一小瓶茶叶。她等待水加热，然后将茶叶泡在陶瓷杯中。"小玉去哪儿了？"

"She went out shopping with her friends."  
"她和朋友出去购物了。"

_Typical,_ Hikari thought. She opened the refrigerator and wished that she had some muffins to heat up, but she hadn't thought to make any that morning. Well, she could start that now. Hikari poured out some cornmeal, broke in an egg, and carried the bowl upstairs with her, mixing as she climbed the stairs.  
典型的，光心想。她打开冰箱，希望自己有些松饼可以加热，但那天早上她没想到要做。好吧，她现在可以开始做了。光倒了一些玉米面，打了一个鸡蛋，端着碗上楼，边走边搅拌。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

No answer. 没有回答。

_Well, changing shouldn't have taken him more than ten minutes. Or maybe he's still standing there in wet clothes.  
嗯，换衣服应该不会超过十分钟。或者他可能还站在那里，衣服湿漉漉的。_

_At any rate, if he started putting on dry clothes, he should be done now, so I won't have to see him… naked…  
无论如何，如果他开始穿干衣服，现在应该已经穿好了，这样我就不会看到他……裸着……_

"I'm coming in, Shinji." “我进来了，真嗣。”

Hikari took a deep breath and pushed open the door.  
光莉深吸一口气，推开了门。

Shinji was wearing the dry clothes, all right, but his wet clothes had been awkwardly wadded into a pile as if he had not known what to do with him. He himself was huddled on the ground, against the wall, with his knees to his chest. He was muttering unintelligibly again.  
真嗣确实穿上了干衣服，但他湿漉漉的衣服却被笨拙地揉成一团，仿佛不知道该怎么处理。他自己则蜷缩在地上，靠着墙，双膝紧贴胸前。他又开始含糊不清地喃喃自语。

After much tugging and pleading, Shinji got to his feet and Hikari helped him into the bed.  
经过一番拉扯和恳求，真嗣终于站起身，光帮忙把他扶到床上。

"I've done… terrible things," he muttered thickly.  
“我做了……可怕的事，”他含糊不清地喃喃道。

"Shh, it will be all right," she promised, pulling the covers up to his chin. He did not speak again, and she left him as he was, trusting that he would stay.  
“嘘，一切都会好起来的，”她承诺着，把被子拉到他的下巴。他没有再说话，她便让他那样躺着，相信他会安然无恙。

Downstairs, Nozomi asked compassionately, "How is he?"  
楼下，希美关切地问道：“他怎么样了？”

"Confused," Hikari murmured vaguely. She set the bowl on the table and preheated the oven—_I should have done that earlier_, she thought, mentally chastising herself. _Well, if Shinji falls asleep, there'll be plenty of time._  
“有些困惑，”光含糊地低声说。她把碗放在桌上，预热了烤箱——我本该早点做的，她心想，暗自责备自己。好吧，如果真嗣睡着了，时间还很充裕。

She made her way to the phone and dialed Asuka's number from memory.  
她走到电话旁，凭记忆拨打了明日香的号码。

Two rings… 两枚戒指……

Three… 三枚……

Hikari's heart sank. Perhaps they were out looking for him?  
光的心沉了下去。或许他们正在找他？

Five…

She wished she knew Asuka's cell phone number, but she had never needed to contact Asuka so urgently.  
她希望自己知道明日香的电话号码，但她从未如此迫切地需要联系明日香。

Nine…

Hikari hung up. Nozomi watched her from the kitchen table, where she had finished her snack of cookies and was already pouring the batter into the pan. Her eyes followed her older sister as she searched through Shinji's soaked jacket in narrow hopes of finding his cell phone.  
光挂断了电话。望从厨房桌旁看着她，她已经吃完了饼干，正将面糊倒入平底锅中。她的目光随着姐姐在真嗣湿透的夹克里搜寻，抱着一线希望找到他的手机。

Nothing. 什么都没有。

_Well, I guess I'll have to wait until Asuka comes home.  
好吧，看来我得等到明日香回家了。_

"Thank you, Nozomi," she said quietly, slipping the tray into the oven. Now there was nothing to do besides wait.  
“谢谢你，望美，”她轻声说道，将托盘滑入烤箱。现在除了等待，别无他事。

---

Shinji awoke in the dark, still shaking from the dream that robbed him nightly of tranquil sleep. He was screaming… Touji was screaming… His father was ordering him to kill his friend… Misato was crying…  
真嗣在黑暗中醒来，仍因那个每晚夺走他安宁睡眠的梦而颤抖。他在尖叫……阿薰也在尖叫……他的父亲命令他杀死朋友……美里在哭泣……

He shook his head to clear out the voices and focused instead on his current situation. He was in a warm bed, one which he did not deserve, and wearing dry clothes that he did not particularly deserve either. He could not remember why he was here, but he remembered leaving NERV. Out of anger, despair, or guilt, he did not know which. Perhaps a mixture of the three.  
他摇摇头，试图驱散那些声音，转而专注于自己当前的处境。他躺在一张温暖的床上，这张床他并不配拥有，穿着干燥的衣服，这些衣服他也同样不配。他不记得自己为何会在这里，但他记得离开了 NERV。出于愤怒、绝望还是内疚，他不知道是哪一种。或许是三者的混合。

Shinji put both feet on the carpeted floor and slowly got to his feet. The clothes were several sizes too large for him, but kept him sufficiently warm as he opened the door to his room. There was no light in the hallway either, so he felt his way down the stairs. The railing was smooth and cool in his warm hand.  
真嗣将双脚放在铺有地毯的地板上，缓缓站起身来。衣服对他来说大了好几个码，但足够保暖，他打开房门。走廊里也没有灯光，于是他摸索着下楼。扶手在他温暖的手中显得光滑而凉爽。

Hikari was sitting at the table reading, a steaming cup of tea in front of her. Without meaning to, Shinji sneezed, and Hikari jumped up.  
光坐在桌前阅读，面前是一杯冒着热气的茶。真嗣无意中打了个喷嚏，光立刻跳了起来。

"S-sorry…" “对-对不起……”

"Don't be," Hikari assured him, hastening to pour him a cup of tea. She popped two corn muffins into the microwave and leaned against the counter while she waited for them to warm. "Shinji… you look awfully red…have you got a fever?"  
"别担心，" 光安慰他，急忙为他倒了一杯茶。她把两个玉米松饼放进微波炉，然后靠在柜台上等待它们加热。"真嗣…你看起来脸很红…是不是发烧了？"

"I don't th-th-think—" Shinji's sentence was interrupted by a sneeze.  
"我不觉——" 真嗣的话被一个喷嚏打断了。

Hikari found a quilt to drape around his shoulders while he drank the tea and found a thermometer, instructing him to hold it under his arm for ten minutes.  
光找了一条毯子披在他的肩上，让他喝茶，并找来体温计，指导他夹在腋下十分钟。

"Thanks," he muttered thickly as Hikari took a seat opposite him.  
“谢谢，”他含糊地咕哝着，光坐在他对面。

"You don't need to be thanking me, Shinji," Hikari insisted. She warmed her hands around her cup. "By the way, I've called … and Asuka wasn't home. Do you know her cell phone number?"  
“你不必谢我，真嗣，”光坚持道。她双手捧着杯子取暖。“对了，我打过电话……但明日香不在家。你知道她的手机号码吗？”

Shinji's hand slowly began to quaver. The mug fell from his hand and sank to the table, where it continued to roll until its handle brought it to a stop, spilling its contents all over the wooden table. Hikari grabbed a towel and began wiping it up  
真嗣的手慢慢开始颤抖。杯子从他手中滑落，沉到桌上，继续滚动直到把手让它停下，里面的液体洒满了木桌。光抓起一条毛巾开始擦拭。

"I've… I've done something…" he whispered, not bothering to hide his tears as they streamed unchecked down his cheeks.  
"我……我做了一些事……" 他低声说道，任由泪水毫无遮掩地顺着脸颊流下。

"Why don't you tell me about it?" Hikari urged gently. "You'll feel better once you get it out."  
"为什么不告诉我呢？" 光温柔地鼓励道，"说出来你会感觉好些的。"

"I've… I've…" "我……我……"

The door burst open behind them and Hikari, albeit usually calm in any situation, let out a shriek. Several men in black entered the house, followed by a weary-looking Mr. Horaki.  
门在他们身后猛地被撞开，尽管平时无论何种情况都能保持镇定的光，还是发出了一声尖叫。几个身穿黑衣的男人闯进了屋子，随后是一位看起来疲惫不堪的碇先生。

"Hikari…" “光…”

The agents came to Shinji's side and handcuffed him, then led him out of the house. As he was being brought through the doorway, the Third Child looked to the Class Representative with deeply troubled eyes and murmured, "Touji…"  
特工们来到真嗣身边，给他戴上手铐，然后将他带出屋子。当他被押过门口时，第三适格者用充满深深忧虑的眼神看向班长，低声说道：“东治…”

Hikari could only mumble, "What?"  
光只能含糊地应了一声，“什么？”

Mr. Horaki closed the door behind him and focused on his middle child. "Hikari… what's going on?"  
碇先生关上门，目光转向他的二女儿。“光……发生了什么事？”

She could only reply, "I don't know."  
她只能回答，“我不知道。”

Author's Notes: Either three shorter chapters or two long ones left to go (I haven't quite decided yet). I'm sorry this one ended up dragging a bit – I might split the next chapter into two shorter parts to avoid having that happen again.  
作者的话：还剩下三章较短的或两章较长的（我还没完全决定）。很抱歉这一章拖得有点长——我可能会把下一章分成两个较短的部分，以避免再次发生这种情况。

I fiddled a lot with this Angel attack, much more than the last one – several scenes have been rearranged and no longer occur when they do in the series, and I've completely changed others to fit the scheme of this story. I decided to cut out everything relating to the mystery behind the Marduk Institute, etc. because as important as it is in the series, it doesn't quite relate to this story. Oh, and the chemistry project—I really have no good reason for putting that in here besides the fact that I was working on some chem before I turned to this chapter (same with DeMoivre's Theorem).  
我对这次天使袭击的描写做了很多调整，比上次多得多——有几个场景被重新排列，不再按照剧集中的时间发生，还有一些我完全改变了，以适应这个故事的框架。我决定删去所有与马杜克研究所背后的谜团相关的内容，因为在系列中虽然很重要，但与这个故事关系不大。哦，还有化学项目——我真的没有很好的理由把它加进来，除了我在写这一章之前正好在做一些化学实验（德莫瓦夫定理也是同样的情况）。

Again, my apologies for any biological inaccuracies.  
再次为任何生物学上的不准确之处道歉。

### Chapter 6: assiduity 勤奋不懈

"Don't push him." “别逼他。”

These were words that Misato repeated at least twice daily, usually with her eyes closed.  
这些话美里每天至少重复两遍，通常是闭着眼睛说的。

"We don't have time." “我们没时间了。”

Those were words that Namika growled at least twice daily, usually with a face lined with frustration.  
那是波多野每天至少咆哮两遍的话，通常脸上还带着沮丧的皱纹。

And Ritsuko was on the receiving end of both.  
而这一切的后果都落在了律子身上。

_Don't push him_—well, that was excellent advice, as they certainly didn't want him to run off again, but the consequences were not at all feasible. _We don't have time_—well, that too was growing increasingly clear, but strapping Shinji down on a table by force and drawing out his bone marrow was not appealing either.  
别逼他——这确实是好建议，毕竟他们当然不想他再次逃跑，但后果完全不可行。我们没时间——这一点也愈发明显，但强行将真嗣绑在桌上抽取骨髓同样不吸引人。

She passed her few moments of spare time in the Japanese garden of the NERV hospital, which was beginning to show some furry buds despite the bitterly cold weather. Ritsuko squatted on a dry rock beside the frozen waterfall, tucking a stray tendril of hair behind her ear.  
她在 NERV 医院内的日式花园里度过片刻闲暇，尽管天气严寒，园中已开始冒出毛茸茸的嫩芽。律子蹲在冻结的瀑布旁一块干石上，将一缕散乱的发丝别到耳后。

She didn't know what Gendo had said to his son. Ritsuko remembered the first time that Shinji had run away, after his initial piloting experiences. He was an eccentric one, that was for sure; nevertheless, he had come far in the last half year. To think that it all might have been a waste, that he would run away again…  
她不知道源堂对儿子说了什么。律子记得真嗣第一次逃跑是在他初次驾驶之后。他确实是个古怪的孩子，这一点毋庸置疑；尽管如此，在过去半年里他已经取得了长足的进步。想到这一切可能都白费了，他又要再次逃跑……

"Ritsuko." “律子。”

Namika was bundled up in a large brown overcoat, almost all of her face hidden beneath the fake-fur lined hood. Her eyes were downcast, her dark eyelashes coated with frosted moisture, and Ritsuko could only think of one word to describe them; bleak, devoid of any happiness.  
奈美卡裹在一件宽大的棕色大衣里，几乎整张脸都藏在人造毛皮衬里的兜帽下。她的眼睛低垂着，深色的睫毛上沾满了霜冻的水汽，律子只能想到一个词来形容它们；黯淡，毫无喜悦之色。

"He's staying," she informed the blonde doctor. The coat muffled her voice and the wind snatched away at the remaining sound.  
"他留下," 她告诉那位金发医生。外套闷住了她的声音，风又夺走了剩余的声响。

"He doesn't _want_ to stay."  
"他不想留下。"

Namika said nothing. They both knew it was true.  
Namika 没有说话。他们俩都知道这是真的。

"Sometimes—" Ritsuko broke off, looking into the distance beyond the trees. There was a loud screech as somebody slammed on their brakes on the road, then a series of angry beeps. She blinked and looked at her feet, clad in the usual black heels. "…I wish I could just take him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him."  
"有时候——" 律子突然停下，目光越过树木望向远方。公路上传来一阵急促的刹车声，紧接着是一连串愤怒的喇叭声。她眨了眨眼，低头看着自己脚上那双惯常的黑色高跟鞋。"…我真希望我能抓住他的肩膀，狠狠地摇醒他。"

Namika reached up with a gloved hand and drew her hood down a bit so that she could speak audibly.  
美香子用戴着手套的手向上拉了拉兜帽，以便能清楚地说话。

"Did you know Misato went to visit the Fourth's sister?"  
"你知道美里去拜访了第四适格者的妹妹吗？"

"No."

Namika recounted the story as she had watched from the doorway.  
纳美卡从门口旁观的角度讲述了这个故事。

---

"_You're Sorhyu Asuka Langley. My brother told me about you."  
你是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我哥哥跟我提起过你。_

_Misato tugged consciously at her hair and laughed at the girl's condescending tone. "No, I'm not Asuka. This is a wig, see?"  
美里下意识地拽了拽自己的头发，对女孩的傲慢语气笑了笑。“不，我不是明日香。这是个假发，你看？”_

"_Oh." Michika Suzuhara's eyes widened as if she were suddenly terrified of being in the presence of a stranger. "Who are you, then?"_  
"哦。" 铃原 Michika 的眼睛睁大了，仿佛突然对陌生人的存在感到恐惧。"那么，你是谁？"

"_I'm Misato Katsuragi. Did your brother tell you about me too?"_  
"我是葛城美里。你哥哥也跟你提起过我吗？"

"_He said you had pretty purple hair. Where is it?"_  
"他说你有漂亮的紫色头发。头发在哪儿呢？"

"_Well, it's all gone now," Misato told her, and she could not keep the note of wistfulness out of her voice. "I'm getting treatment for cancer. It makes your hair fall out."_  
"唉，现在都没了，"美里告诉她，声音中不自觉地带上了几分惆怅。"我正在接受癌症治疗。这会让你的头发掉光。"

_Michika considered this. "So you're a patient here too?"  
Michika 思索着。"那么你也是这里的病人吗？"_

"_Yes."_ "是的。"

"_Like me?"_ "像我一样？"

"_Yes."_ "是的。"

_The little girl smiled, immediately warming up. She plucked an old faded stuffed animal from beneath her blanket and held it up to Misato proudly. "This is Mai!"  
小女孩笑了，立刻变得热情起来。她从毯子下抽出一个旧旧的、颜色褪去的毛绒玩具，自豪地举到美里面前。“这是麻衣！”_

"_She's beautiful," Misato told her, reaching over to stroke the bear's head affectionately. "When I was your age I didn't have any stuffed animals. I liked to play with paper dolls."_  
“她真漂亮，”美里告诉她，伸手过去温柔地抚摸着小熊的头。“我像你这么大的时候，没有毛绒玩具。我喜欢玩纸娃娃。”

"_I don't like paper dolls," Michika said candidly, and then in a grown-up tone added, "They tear very easily."_  
“我不喜欢纸娃娃，”美智香直率地说，然后用一种大人的口吻补充道，“它们很容易撕破。”

"_That's true. Where did you get Mai?"_  
“确实。你是从哪儿得到小舞的？”

_Michika held the bear close to her, burying her face in its fur. She did not look at Misato as she said quietly, "My mommy bought her for me."  
美智香紧紧抱着那只熊，将脸埋进它的毛里。她没有看美里，只是轻声说：“我妈妈给我买的。”_

_Misato remembered the Fourth Child file that Ritsuko had shown her and felt guilty for instigating the memory of their mother.  
美里想起了律子给她看过的第四适格者档案，为自己勾起了关于母亲的回忆而感到内疚。_

"_Do you know Shinji?" Michika asked, steering the subject away. "Shinji Ikari?"_  
"你知道真嗣吗？" 美知香转移了话题，"碇真嗣？"

"_Yes, he lives with me."_  
"是的，他和我住在一起。"

"_Touji said he could save your life," Mika whispered with large eyes, as if she were telling Misato a poignant secret. "Is that true?"_  
"托基说他能救你的命，" 美香低声说道，眼睛睁得大大的，仿佛在向美里透露一个感人的秘密。"这是真的吗？"

"_Well…yes…it is."_  “嗯……是的……确实是这样。”

_She thought quickly, trying to find a way to simplify the complicated biology behind it all to a point where the little girl would be neither confused nor bored, but Michika was satisfied with that answer. She hugged her bear again and proclaimed proudly, "Someday I want to be a doctor, so I can save people too."  
她迅速思考，试图将背后复杂的生物学原理简化到小女孩既不会感到困惑也不会觉得无聊的程度，但 Michika 对这个回答感到满意。她再次抱紧了她的熊，自豪地宣布：“将来我想成为一名医生，这样我也能救人了。”_

Valentine's Day. 情人节。

It was lunchtime. Asuka discovered a large stack of valentines in her box from boys—some she knew, some she didn't, but it made no difference—she threw them all away without a glance. Only one piece of paper held her attention, the one she clenched in her hand now, and it had not come from her mailbox.  
正值午餐时间。明日香在她的盒子里发现了一大堆来自男孩的情人节卡片——有些她认识，有些则不认识，但这都无关紧要——她一眼都没看就全扔掉了。只有一张纸吸引了她的注意，就是她现在紧握在手中的那张，而且它并非来自她的邮箱。

She opened her hand. The red ink had stained her palm. Gingerly she unfolded it.  
她张开手。红色的墨水已染红了她的手掌。她小心翼翼地展开它。

Names: Sorhyu Asuka Langley, Suzuhara Touji  
姓名：惣流·明日香·兰格雷，铃原东治

Project: Nuclear Chemistry  
项目：核化学

Grade: 105 成绩：105 分

Despite the grade, she felt absolutely no elation at seeing it.  
尽管成绩优异，她看到分数时却丝毫没有感到喜悦。

"Miss Sorhyu." "索希尤小姐。"

Asuka crushed the paper in her hand and composed herself as she whirled around to face the speaker. She didn't recognize him. He reached out and took her hand, placing in it a large heart-shaped chocolate wrapped with pink tin foil. Asuka was temporarily too shocked to reply, as none of the boys had been so bold.  
明日香将手中的纸捏成一团，转身面对说话者，努力平复情绪。她并不认识他。他伸出手，将一个用粉色锡箔纸包裹的大心形巧克力放在她手中。明日香一时震惊得说不出话来，因为从未有男孩如此大胆。

"I… I don't want it… I've…"  
"我…我不想要…我…"

He simply bowed and left her standing there.  
他只是鞠了一躬，留下她站在那里。

"GAHH!" "啊！"

Asuka smashed the rounded part of the chocolate at the metal locker. Apparently the candy was solid throughout, as it developed hardly a dent. Asuka tossed it into her bag and returned to her desk, removing a standard gray lunchbox with the word NERV stamped across the front. She missed Shinji's lunches, but food was the last thing on Shinji's mind nowadays.  
明日香用力将巧克力的圆头部分砸向金属储物柜。显然，糖果是实心的，因为它几乎没有留下凹痕。明日香把它扔进包里，回到自己的桌子前，拿出一个印有 NERV 字样的标准灰色午餐盒。她怀念真嗣做的午餐，但如今食物是真嗣心中最不重要的事情。

Hikari sat beside her, eating in conscious little bites. She kept her eyes focused on her bento and did not speak. Asuka glanced at her and noticed that her lower lip wavered hesitantly before each bite.  
光坐在她旁边，小心翼翼地吃着。她始终盯着便当，一言不发。明日香瞥了她一眼，注意到她每次咬下之前，下唇都会犹豫地颤抖。

"Eat this," she ordered, pushing the heart-shaped chocolate at her friend. "It'll make you feel better."  
“吃这个，”她命令道，将心形的巧克力推给朋友，“会让你感觉好些。”

Hikari laid down her chopsticks and touched her napkin to her lips, but left the chocolate.  
光放下筷子，用餐巾轻触嘴唇，却留下了巧克力。

"He doesn't like me, Asuka. He never will now. He… he doesn't think he's worth anything anymore." Her eyes filled dangerously. "He wanted to me to tell his sister that he was fine. He—" Hikari's voice broke and she fumbled for words. Asuka, in a moment of humane compassion, reached out and let the Class Representative cry on her shoulder.  
"他不喜欢我，明日香。他现在永远不会了。他……他觉得自己一无是处了。" 她的眼睛危险地充满了泪水。"他希望我告诉他妹妹他没事。他——" 光的声音哽咽了，她慌乱地寻找着词语。明日香，在这一刻的人性同情中，伸出手让班长靠在她的肩膀上哭泣。

"They'll be able to sort him out," she said bracingly. "Think about all the injuries Shinji and Wonderg—Rei's gone through."  
"他们会帮他解决的，" 她鼓励地说。"想想真嗣和奇迹——绫波经历过的那些伤。"

"Shinji's never lost a leg, has he?" Hikari whispered savagely. A moment later she quickly added, "I don't care if he never plays basketball again, if he never wins another race—he's still… Suzuhara…" Tears leaked from both eyes and she blotted at them with the back of her hand. "But I can't make him see that…"  
"真嗣从未失去过一条腿，对吧？" 光野蛮地低声说。片刻后她迅速补充道，"我不在乎他是否再也不能打篮球，是否再也赢不了比赛——他仍然是……铃原……" 泪水从两只眼睛中流出，她用手背擦拭着。"但我无法让他明白这一点……"

Asuka didn't know what to say, so she remained silent. Hikari picked up the broken conversation again, quietly venturing, "Speaking of Shinji, how's he doing?"  
明日香不知道该说什么，于是保持沉默。光子再次拾起破碎的对话，轻声试探道：“说到真嗣，他最近怎么样？”

"He's—" Asuka broke off abruptly, having been about to call him the usual names. "He's doing fine. He would probably have wandered into some alley and frozen to death if you didn't take him in that day…thanks..."  
“他——”明日香突然打住，差点又像往常那样称呼他。“他挺好的。要不是那天你收留了他，他可能早就迷路在某条小巷里冻死了……谢谢你……”

Hikari's head moved ever so slightly. Asuka took it to be a small chuckle.  
光子的头微微一动。明日香将其视为一声轻笑。

When the bell rang again to signal the start of class, Asuka was still quietly stroking Hikari's hair. The latter held back a sniffle, quickly sat up and announced, "Rise… bow… sit!"  
当铃声再次响起，标志着上课开始时，Asuka 仍在静静地抚摸着 Hikari 的头发。后者忍住抽泣，迅速坐直并宣布：“起立……鞠躬……坐下！”

She sat back down and smiled bravely at Asuka, who returned the gesture, feeling oddly grateful that Shinji had not been injured nearly as badly as Touji.  
她坐回原位，勇敢地对 Asuka 微笑，后者也回以微笑，心中莫名感激 Shinji 没有像 Touji 那样受重伤。

"Unfamiliar ceiling…"

Shinji grasped a wad of white bedsheet tightly in his fist, then let it fall. There was no point in giving him a stereotypical hospital room when he wasn't physically ill; he had instead been placed in a small windowless room just off the main hospital corridor. It was simple—bed, toilet, bare walls and floor. Shinji could not understand why such a room had been built into the building, except for the purposes of keeping runaway pilots such as himself within NERV control.  
Shinji 紧紧抓住一团白色床单，随后又松开。既然他没有身体上的疾病，给他一个典型的医院病房就没有意义；相反，他被安置在主医院走廊旁一个没有窗户的小房间里。房间简单至极——床、厕所、光秃秃的墙壁和地板。Shinji 无法理解为何这样的房间会建在建筑物内，除了用于将像他这样的逃跑驾驶员控制在 NERV 的掌控之中。

_Runaway pilot_. 逃跑的驾驶员。

_That's what you are_. 你就是那样。

"So what if I ran away?" Shinji muttered dully to himself. "I'm back, aren't I? I'm back to be exploited by my father."  
“就算我逃跑了又怎样？”真嗣闷闷不乐地自言自语，“我回来了，不是吗？回来被我父亲利用。”

…_but you ran away again…_  
…但你又逃跑了…

Shinji held his forehead in his hands as Asuka's face swam into view.  
真嗣双手捂着额头，明日香的面容浮现在眼前。

_Baka! You're always running away from things! Why don't you act like a man and learn to face them?  
笨蛋！你总是逃避！为什么不像个男人一样学会面对呢？_

Her angry expression, accented by the jabbing finger, melted into Rei'scalm, emotionless face. She uttered only one word.  
她愤怒的表情，因那戳动的手指而更显生动，逐渐融化成丽平静无波的面容。她只吐出了一个词。

_Ikari… 碇…_

Her face disappeared in turn and was replaced by Kensuke's, one eye hidden behind the camera.  
接着她的脸被健司的取代，相机遮住了他的一只眼睛。

_Hey, Shinji! Do you think Misato-san will let me pilot it? I'd be a good pilot! Will you ask her for me?  
嘿，真嗣！你觉得美里小姐会让我驾驶它吗？我会是个好驾驶员的！你能帮我问问她吗？_

"You don't understand," Shinji raged through clenched teeth at the Kensuke in his mind. "You have absolutely… no … damn idea… what it's like… to have your hands manipulated, to kill your best friend!"  
“你不明白，”真嗣在心中对健介咬牙切齿地说道，“你完全……没有……该死的……概念……那是什么感觉……被操控双手，杀死最好的朋友！”

He was shouting now, tears streaming down his face, but he no longer cared. Shinji slammed his fist against the wall, half hoping that it would give way to his anger, but the granite absorbed it and remained silent. He punched it again, this time the knuckles making direct contact. The crack resounded around the room.  
他现在大声喊叫，泪水顺着脸颊流下，但他已经不在乎了。真嗣一拳砸在墙上，一半希望这愤怒能让墙崩塌，但花岗岩吸收了冲击，依旧沉默。他又打了一拳，这次指节直接接触。裂开的声音在房间里回响。

"Don't tell me… you _want_ to pilot that… that thing…"  
"别告诉我……你想驾驶那个……那个东西……"

Breathing heavily, Shinji backed away from the wall, rubbing his sore hand. Unfortunately, he was none too aware of the lamp nearby, and a moment later crashed into it. The lamp toppled to the ground and smashed, its dim lightbulb breaking into glass shards on the floor and draping Shinji in darkness.  
呼吸沉重，真嗣从墙边退开，揉着酸痛的手。不幸的是，他并未注意到附近的台灯，片刻后便撞上了它。台灯倒地破碎，昏暗的灯泡在地板上碎成玻璃渣，将真嗣笼罩在黑暗中。

"Dammit…" "该死……"

He felt his way to the bed, still angry, and turned away from the broken lamp. He was suddenly cold; the shouting had taken the energy out of him. Shinji drew the thin blanket over himself and curled up into a ball, unable to desist shivering, forcibly reminding himself of the wretched hours he had spent at Hikari's house before NERV agents had overtaken him.  
他摸索着走到床边，依旧怒气未消，转身背对着破碎的台灯。他突然感到寒冷；喊叫耗尽了他的力气。真嗣拉过薄薄的毯子盖在身上，蜷缩成一团，止不住地颤抖，强迫自己回想起在光家里度过的悲惨时光，直到 NERV 特工将他带走。

_Why don't you tell me about it? You'll feel better once you get it out.  
为什么不告诉我呢？说出来你会感觉好些。_

"Liar," Shinji whispered, his fists clenched. Even as he did so, he knew it wasn't fair of him to say such things; Hikari had clearly done her best by him.  
“骗子，”真嗣低声说道，双拳紧握。尽管如此，他知道自己这么说并不公平；光显然已经尽力对他好了。

He lay there in silence and darkness, unaware of time. When somebody opened the door and cautiously called out his name, he chose to remain motionless and pretended to be asleep.  
他躺在寂静与黑暗中，对时间毫无知觉。当有人打开门，小心翼翼地呼唤他的名字时，他选择保持不动，假装睡着了。

Rei had been largely ignored in the last few weeks. She did not mind, of course; for much of her life, she had been treated so, and she welcomed the chance to simply observe.

Pilot Sorhyu was not happy. She knew this from the nightly walks that she took to clear her mind whenever sleep did not come to her. She knew what the girl had allowed few others to know; she had heard the Second's tearful mumblings as she dreamt of her mother. Nowadays, however, her talk took on other tones and subjects—she worried in her sleep over topics that she did not discuss in consciousness; many times Rei had heard Misato and Pilot Ikari's names mentioned. She was also perfectly aware that there seemed to be a budding relationship between Pilot Sorhyu and Pilot Ikari that was never able to develop due to circumstances beyond their control.  
索尔希驾驶员并不开心。她从每晚为了清醒头脑而散步的时候就知道了。她知道这个女孩只让少数人知道的事情；她听到了第二驾驶员在梦中对母亲的哭泣低语。然而，如今她的梦话转向了其他语调和话题——她在睡梦中担忧那些清醒时未曾讨论的话题；许多次，丽听到过美里和碇驾驶员的名字被提及。她也完全清楚，索尔希驾驶员和碇驾驶员之间似乎有一段因无法控制的情况而未能发展的关系。

_He is not Pilot Ikari now,_ Rei reminded herself placidly, as she walked slowly down the hallway. She stripped away the title.  
他现在不是碇驾驶员，丽平静地提醒自己，她缓缓走在走廊上。她剥离了这个头衔。

_Ikari. Just Ikari. 碇。只是碇。_

A nurse passed her in the hallways, hurrying, always hurrying; she paid the blue-haired girl no attention and Rei did the same to her. The nurses did not mind her nightly walks, as long as she was in bed and ready for her daily checkup and bath.  
一名护士在走廊里匆匆经过她，总是匆匆忙忙；她对蓝发女孩视而不见，绫波也对护士同样漠然。护士们并不介意她每晚的散步，只要她能按时回到床上，准备好每天的检查和洗澡。

Rei looked at her left hand. It bore no bandages now and showed no signs of damage unless she tried to move it. She had still not regained full function in her left arm and the therapists continued to insist upon physical exercises, performed on a daily basis. Rei found them repetitive and tedious, but she did them, as she was ordered to.  
绫波看着她的左手。现在没有绷带，也没有任何损伤的迹象，除非她试图移动它。她的左臂功能仍未完全恢复，理疗师们继续坚持每天进行物理锻炼。绫波觉得这些锻炼重复而乏味，但她还是照做了，因为这是命令。

She came to the miniscule waiting room. NERV liked to keep its functions secret and therefore did not encourage large numbers of family members to crowd its hospital while a relative underwent an operation. However, it had an enormous glass window that made up all of one side, and Rei had often liked to look outside and think to herself over her daily observations. She preferred to come at night, when the lights were turned off and there were no glares from the light bulbs on the glass panes. Tonight she pressed her good hand against the window and instinctively flexed her other hand. It tired after only two repetitions, and she was uncomfortably aware that some fingers were more sensitive than others. It occurred to her that as long as these symptoms remained, she would stay in the NERV hospital. Normally The Commander would not have ordered it so, but as the Second and—Ikari—were already staying, there would be no harm in keeping the First as well.  
她走进了那间狭小的等候室。NERV 喜欢保持其职能的隐秘性，因此不鼓励大量家属在亲人手术时挤满医院。然而，这里有一面巨大的玻璃窗，占据了整面墙，丽常常喜欢透过它向外望去，沉思自己的日常观察。她更喜欢在夜间来此，那时灯光已熄，玻璃窗上没有灯泡的反光。今晚，她用那只完好的手按在窗上，本能地弯曲另一只手。仅两次重复动作后，手便感到疲惫，她不安地意识到有些手指比其他更为敏感。她意识到，只要这些症状持续，她就会留在 NERV 医院。通常情况下，司令不会如此命令，但由于二号机驾驶员——碇——已经在此，留下初号机驾驶员也无妨。

She heard voices outside but did not move. They would not come to chase her out. Rei looked through the open door and saw from the lady's silhouette that it was the doctor in charge of Misato's case.  
她听到外面的说话声，但没有动。他们不会来赶她走。丽透过敞开的门，从那位女士的轮廓认出是负责美里病例的医生。

She knew, of course, that Ikari had become somewhat of a recluse since being retrieved from Class Representative Horaki's home. What she had observed, however, was that the doctor appeared to have abandoned hope for Ikari and resorted instead to The Commander. Rei assumed that this was due to the fact that time was rapidly running out, and she felt a burning knot of misery and annoyance in her stomach that she could not be the one to save Misato.  
她当然知道，自从在班长洞木光家里被救出后，碇已经变得有些隐居了。然而，她观察到的是，医生似乎已经对碇失去了希望，转而求助于指挥官。绫波推测这可能是因为时间正在迅速流逝，她感到一种痛苦和恼怒的纠结在胃里燃烧，因为她不能成为拯救美里的人。

The glass was cold. Rei pulled her hand away. It was mid-March, she remembered. The days would start to grow soon.  
玻璃杯冰冷。绫波缩回了手。她记得现在是三月中旬。白昼即将开始变长。

But hope for Misato did not.  
但对美里的希望并未随之而来。

And then there was the everlasting threat of an impending Angel attack.  
然后是永恒的威胁，天使即将来袭。

Rei sat down beside the glass and pulled her legs to her chest. Her left arm ached dully and she massaged the shoulder joint with her other hand, glancing sideways through the window as she did so. In the darkness there was nothing except for a dark smudge of treetops and above that, a few glimmering stars.  
丽坐在玻璃旁，将双腿蜷缩至胸前。她的左臂隐隐作痛，便用另一只手按摩肩关节，同时侧目透过窗户望去。黑暗中除了树梢的暗影外，只有几颗闪烁的星星悬挂其上。

Water. He'd forgotten to fill up his water bottle, dammit. Not that he didn't forget a lot of things recently.

Shinji climbed sideways out of his bed and swiped the plastic bottle off the bedside table. It was gray and wrapped in a standard sheet of gray foam with the letters NERV stamped across it horizontally in darker gray. Shinji covered the word with his hand, then ambled over to the fountain on the other side of the room. It was broken and made churning sounds when he pressed the button. He sighed, turned, and decided that his only alternative was the water fountain on the other end of the hallway.  
真嗣侧身爬下床，从床头柜上抓起塑料瓶。瓶子是灰色的，裹着一张标准的灰色泡沫纸，上面横向印着深灰色的 NERV 字样。真嗣用手遮住那个词，然后踱步到房间另一侧的喷泉处。喷泉坏了，按下按钮时发出咕噜咕噜的声音。他叹了口气，转身决定只能去走廊另一端的饮水机了。

He had taken only a few steps when he heard it—  
他只走了几步，就听到了那个声音——

"Ikari Shinji!" “碇真嗣！”

Shinji whirled around, the high-pitched feminine voice taking him by surprise. It couldn't be Misato – her room was in the other hallway, and Asuka would never call him in such a format manner.  
真嗣猛地转过身，那尖锐的女性声音让他吃了一惊。不可能是美里——她的房间在另一条走廊，而明日香绝不会用这种正式的方式叫他。

Who else then? 那还会有谁呢？

He was still standing in the hallway, perplexed, when the voice called out again, this time tentatively—"Shinji-kun?"  
他仍站在走廊里，困惑不解，这时那声音再次响起，这次带着些许试探——“真嗣君？”

Shinji held his breath and poked his head into the nearest room. A little girl of no more than six waved back eagerly at him.  
真嗣屏住呼吸，探头望向最近的房间。一个不超过六岁的小女孩急切地向他挥手。

"Shinji-kun! I knew it was you! My brother told me all about you!"  
"真嗣君！我就知道是你！我哥哥跟我提起过你！"

"Y-your brother?" "你-你哥哥？"

And then it hit him. This was _Touji's sister_. Touji's dark hair, his brown eyes, his thick eyebrows, softened to fit a young female face.  
然后他恍然大悟。这是东治的妹妹。东治的黑发，他的棕色眼睛，他浓密的眉毛，都柔和地融入了一张年轻女性的面庞。

"Sit," Michika pointed commandingly to the bench, but quickly added, "please?"  
"坐下，" 美里卡命令式地指向长椅，但随即迅速补充道，"请？"

Something told Shinji that she just might start crying if he didn't, so he did—albeit reluctantly.  
某种直觉告诉真嗣，如果他不照做，她可能真的会哭出来，所以他坐下了——尽管有些不情愿。

"You go to school with my brother."  
"你和我哥哥在同一所学校。"

"Err…yeah…" "呃…是啊…"

"And you work with him."  
"而且你还和他一起工作。"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Michika lapsed into silence. Shinji waited, already dreading her next question. He knew that Touji had asked Hikari not to tell his sister of his circumstances…_if she asks me_, Shinji thought desperately, _I won't tell her either…_  
美里卡陷入了沉默。真嗣等待着，已经对她的下一个问题感到害怕。他知道，托吉曾要求光不要告诉他的妹妹他的情况…如果她问我，真嗣绝望地想，我也不会告诉她…

"I have a question." "我有个问题。"

"Go ahead…" "请说……"

Michika leaned close. "Is—" she paused to make sure the words rolled off her tongue properly: "—Sorhyu Asuka Langley as mean as Touji says she is?"  
美智香靠近了些。“那个——”她停顿了一下，确保话语能恰当地从舌尖滑出：“——惣流·明日香·兰格雷，真的像东治说的那么刻薄吗？”

"No," Shinji said impulsively. "Well…"  
"不，" 真嗣冲动地说道。"嗯…"

"Touji says she hit him!" Michika whispered, her eyes wide as saucers.  
"托基说她打了他！" 美智香低声说，眼睛瞪得像铜铃一样大。

"Well, yes… she hit me too…"  
"嗯，是的…她也打了我…"

"Then she _must_ be mean!" Michika crossed her arms, ending the discussion.  
“那她一定很刻薄！”美智香交叉双臂，结束了讨论。

Shinji, who was fervently hoping that Asuka wouldn't happen to pass by and hear the conversation, felt that he ought to defend the Second—but he couldn't find anything to say, so he remained silent.  
真嗣热切地希望明日香不会恰好路过并听到这段对话，他觉得应该为二号机辩护——但他找不到任何话可说，只好保持沉默。

Michika, sensing his reluctance, quickly piped up, "Misato came to visit me yesterday!"  
美智香察觉到他的犹豫，迅速插话道：“美里昨天来看我了！”

_Misato. 美里。_

The word sent an uncomfortable shiver throughout Shinji's body.  
这个词让真嗣全身不由自主地打了个寒颤。

_Misato— 美里——_

—_leukemia—_ —白血病—

—_blood testing—_  —血液检测—

—_bone marrow—_ —骨髓—

—_d—_

"I heard you're the only one that can save her," Michika said matter-of-factly.  
"我听说只有你能救她，"美智香直截了当地说。

—_save her—_ —救她—

"You haven't changed your mind, have you? My brother says—"  
"你还没改变主意，对吧？我哥哥说——"

—_her life_— ——她的生活——

"—a good boy who always tried to help others—"  
"——一个总是尽力帮助别人的好孩子——"

_Touji. 冬二。_

"_Misato-san sure is pretty, huh?"_  
“美里小姐真的很漂亮，对吧？”

"_I bought this cap just for today, Misato-san!"_  
“我为了今天特意买了这顶帽子，美里小姐！”

"Shinji-kun?"  "真嗣君？"

Shinji looked up into Michika's big, round brown eyes, filled with worry.  
真嗣抬头望进美智香那双大大的、圆溜溜的棕色眼睛，里面满是担忧。

"Yeah," he muttered, "I have to go."  
"嗯，"他咕哝道，"我得走了。"

Namika was testing samples with the help of an assistant when the door burst open. The assistant screamed, and Namika scolded her for losing her head.

"You could've lost the samples," she reprimanded. "Yes, …Pilot Ikari."  
"你差点就丢了样本，"她责备道。"是的，……碇驾驶员。"

"I'm not the Third Child anymore," Shinji ground out through clenched teeth. "Don't address me like that—"  
"我已经不是第三适格者了，"真嗣咬牙切齿地说。"别那样称呼我——"

The curtain behind the doctor rustled, and The Commander stepped out, robed only loosely in a blue-and-white hospital gown. The classic gloves and glasses were gone, yet his stare remained; the scene would have almost been comical had the situation not been so tense.  
医生身后的帘子沙沙作响，指挥官走了出来，只随意披着一件蓝白相间的病号服。标志性的手套和眼镜不见了，但他的目光依旧锐利；若非情势如此紧张，这一幕几乎有些滑稽。

"Why are you here?" "你为什么在这里？"

"Because—because I have to save Misato," Shinji breathed hurriedly. He was suddenly very panicked; he was sure that time was running out—already he had wasted several weeks. _What a stupid question!_ He wanted to push his father aside and plead his case instead with the doctor, but she hovered behind The Commander, afraid to interfere—  
"因为——因为我必须救美里，" 真嗣急促地喘息着。他突然感到非常恐慌；他确信时间正在流逝——他已经浪费了好几周。多么愚蠢的问题！他想把父亲推开，转而向医生恳求，但她躲在指挥官身后，不敢插手——

"And your piloting duties?"  
"那你的驾驶任务呢？"

It took a moment for the question to register in Shinji's mind, but his response came automatically, as if everything besides the transplant was controlled by autopilot.  
问题在碇真嗣的脑海中停留了一会儿才被理解，但他的回答几乎是自动的，仿佛除了移植手术外的一切都被自动导航控制着。

"I'm _not_ piloting anymore."  
“我不再驾驶了。”

Pause. 暂停。

It was apparent to Namika that The Commander was clearly displeased with his son, and it seemed that he was weighing two consequences in his mind—allowing his son to stay solely for the purpose of rescuing his prized Major, and sending him away in order to concentrate all NERV authority in finding a replacement pilot. Misato herself had said that pilots were replaceable, after all… but good Majors were not. A muscle tensed in his cheek, and Namika prepared herself for his proclamation.  
奈美香明显看出司令对其儿子显然不满，他似乎在权衡两种后果——为了救他珍视的少校而让儿子留下，以及为了集中 NERV 的全部权力寻找替代驾驶员而将他送走。毕竟，美里自己也曾说过，驾驶员是可以替代的……但优秀的少校却不是。他脸颊上的肌肉紧绷，奈美香准备好迎接他的宣判。

None came. He simply nodded to her and stepped out of the room.  
无人应答。他只是向她点了点头，随即走出了房间。

"Dr. Ishiyama?" Her assistant broke the silence tentatively. "The samples—they need to be refrigerated—"  
"石山博士？" 她的助手试探性地打破了沉默。"样本——它们需要冷藏——"

Namika looked down and realized that she had tightened her grip considerably on the vial, bringing up its temperature. She sighed and tossed it into the biohazard box.  
奈美香低头一看，发现自己已经紧紧握住了试管，使其温度升高。她叹了口气，将其扔进了生物危害箱。

"Now that he's here, we won't need that sample anyway. Shinji—"  
"既然他已经来了，我们反正也不需要那个样本了。真嗣——"

"Yes?" "是的？"

His words were tripping over hers in hastened desperation. Namika breathed, thanking the Lord for this unexpected good fortune, and forced herself to calm down. There was a calendar posted just behind Shinji's left ear and she focused on one block of the page, labeled March 26.  
他的话语急切地与她的交织在一起，充满了绝望的迫切。Namika 深呼吸，感谢上帝这意外的好运，并强迫自己冷静下来。在真嗣左耳后方贴着一张日历，她专注于其中一块，标记着 3 月 26 日的那一格。

"We can't do it right now?" Shinji asked, looking crestfallen as he read her mind.  
"我们现在不能做吗？" 真嗣问道，看起来很失望，仿佛读懂了她的心思。

Namika shook her head. "We need to get Misato restarted on a chemotherapy course first—_crisantaspase_ or _mercaptopurine_, Misumi—" the assistant hurried away into the back room: "—for at least a week. Let's set the date of the transplant for March 26."  
Namika 摇了摇头。“我们得先让 Misato 重新开始化疗——crisantaspase 或 mercaptopurine，Misumi——”助手匆匆走进后面的房间：“——至少持续一周。我们把移植日期定在 3 月 26 日吧。”

"That's…nine days away," Shinji said. "You think she'll last that long?"  
“那……还有九天，”Shinji 说。“你觉得她能撑那么久吗？”

The assistant returned and placed a small package into Namika's outstretched hand.  
助手回来，将一个小包裹放入 Namika 伸出的手中。

"Yes, I do." "是的，我愿意。"

Shinji turned to leave, but paused just beside the door.  
真嗣转身准备离开，但在门口停顿了一下。

"Please… hurry." "请……快点。"

---

"I'm proud of you, Third."

Shinji didn't feel like telling her to drop the Third. They were gathered in Asuka's room, sitting on her bed. Her room was smaller than his and didn't have a water fountain, functioning or not. He traced a pattern on the bed sheet.  
真嗣并不想让她放弃第三适格者这个称呼。他们聚在明日香的房间里，坐在她的床上。她的房间比他的小，也没有水池，不管能不能用。他在床单上画着图案。

"It is I, Sorhyu Asuka Langley, who is speaking to you—why aren't you acting more happy?" Asuka asked, a weak attempt to humor the statement that had before drawn fear and shame from the boy sitting in front of her. Instead of shying away, Shinji smiled, and Asuka did so in return.  
"是我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，在跟你说话——你怎么不显得更高兴些？"明日香问道，试图用一句玩笑缓和之前那句曾让坐在她面前的男孩感到恐惧和羞愧的话。真嗣没有退缩，反而笑了，明日香也回以微笑。

"You know that I'm not going to pilot again," he said, without meeting her eyes.  
"你知道我不会再去驾驶了，"他说，没有直视她的眼睛。

"Suit yourself." She looked away. "Do whatever pleases you, Third—I mean, Shinji." Asuka paused. "You've done enough for others."  
"随你便。" 她转过头去。"做任何让你开心的事吧，三——我是说，真嗣。" 明日香停顿了一下。"你已经为别人做得够多了。"

"I haven't done anything," Shinji mumbled, confused by this statement.  
"我什么都没做，" 真嗣喃喃自语，对这番话感到困惑。"

"Yes you have. You tutored me in Japanese. You cooked and cleaned after us without complaint. And you're going to save Misato. Think of yourself, for once."  
"不，你做了。你辅导我日语。你无怨无悔地为我们做饭和打扫。而且你还要救美里。就这一次，为自己想想吧。"

"Er… okay…" “呃……好吧……”

Asuka sighed, took him by the shoulders, and wheeled him around to face her. "Shinji—no, look at me—now, tell me: after Misato's well again, what's the first thing you want to do?"  
明日香叹了口气，抓住他的肩膀，将他转过来面对自己。“真嗣——不，看着我——现在，告诉我：再次回到美里小姐那里之后，你最想做的是什么？”

Shinji looked at the depth of her blue eyes and blushed.  
真嗣凝视着她深邃的蓝眼睛，脸红了。

Asuka shook him. "Tell me, dammit!"  
明日香摇晃着他。“快告诉我，该死的！”

He took a gamble. "I-I want to go somewhere with you."  
他孤注一掷。“我，我想和你去某个地方。”

Her hands dropped from his shoulders.  
她的双手从他的肩膀上滑落。

"I-It's not like that!" Shinji's hands flew up in protest. "Well, maybe it is… but you don't have to go if you don't want to, really! Forget I said—"  
"我-我不是那个意思！" 真嗣的手急忙举起抗议。"嗯，也许是的… 但如果你不想去，真的可以不去！忘了我说过——"

"Don't be like that," she cut him off. "Of course I'm going—now where do you want to go?"  
"别这样，" 她打断了他。"我当然要去——现在你想去哪儿？"

"I don't know…" "我不知道…"

She shook him again. 她又摇了摇他。

"Uh, maybe out to dinner? Or a movie?"  
"呃，也许出去吃晚饭？或者看场电影？"

"That sounds nice." She relaxed her grip. "Okay, now you've promised—no backing out!"  
"听起来不错。" 她放松了手上的力道。"好了，现在你已经答应了——不许反悔！"

"Okay…" "好吧……"

There was a brief pause, and she changed the subject. "I want to go home, don't you?" Her tone became nostalgic as she folded her feet beneath her legs Indian-style. "I want to play that training game… I even miss Pen-pen, that damned penguin."  
她短暂地停顿了一下，然后改变了话题。“我想回家，你不想吗？”她的语气变得怀旧，双腿盘坐，脚藏在腿下。“我想玩那个训练游戏……我甚至想念那只该死的企鹅，Pen-pen。”

"Who's taking care of him now?"  
“现在谁在照顾他？”

"Hikari. By the way, she dropped by yesterday and brought you this." Asuka reached into the small leather purse she kept on her bedside table and pulled out Shinji's SDAT. Shinji took it gratefully from her and quickly turned it on. Asuka took one of the earphones from him while requesting, "Mind if I listen?"  
"光。对了，她昨天来过，给你带了这个。" 明日香从她床头柜上的小皮包里拿出真嗣的 SDAT。真嗣感激地从她手中接过，迅速打开。明日香从他那里拿过一个耳机，问道："介意我一起听吗？"

"No."

Asuka lay back, forcing Shinji to mimic her motions as the headphones were connected—she wore one in her right ear, and Shinji the other in his left. The sound was mellow and made her ache for Germany. She snuggled closer to Shinji and placed her head against his shoulder. If he noticed or minded, he had no reaction.  
明日香躺下，迫使真嗣模仿她的动作，耳机连接起来——她右耳戴一个，真嗣左耳戴另一个。音乐柔和，让她怀念起德国。她更靠近真嗣，把头靠在他的肩膀上。如果他注意到了或介意，他没有任何反应。

_Du weißt, ich werde immer ehrlich zu dir sein  
你知道，我会永远对你坦诚_

_Und du weißt, ich bin derjenige  
而你知道，我就是那个人_

_An den du dich wenden kannst  
你随时可以依靠的人_

_Jederzeit, überall und irgendwo  
任何时间，任何地点，无论何处_

_Du weißt, ich werde immer da sein  
你知道，我会一直在那里_

"Please sit down." “请坐。”

Namika had not expected him to bring the girl, and for some reason this annoyed her. Of course, her own experiences and Ritsuko's descriptions had left a firm impression in her mind that the Second was nothing short of, well, irritating.  
纳米卡没想到他会带那个女孩来，不知为何这让她感到恼火。当然，她自己的经历和律子的描述已经在她心中留下了深刻的印象，第二人除了令人讨厌之外，别无其他。

She took a seat beside him and focused intently on the doctor.  
她在他的旁边坐下，专注地看着医生。

"I'd like to begin by first asking you if you have any questions, Shinji."  
“我想先问你有没有什么问题，真嗣。”

He shook his head, but the Second took the initiative, laying her hand on the table.  
他摇了摇头，但明日香主动出击，将手放在桌子上。

"What are the chances of success?"  
“成功的几率有多大？”

Namika reined her frustration and made eye contact with Shinji instead. "Given the fact that you're not related to Misato, your HLA markings are remarkably similar and indicate a good chance of success. However, there are many other factors that can affect Misato's post-surgical recovery—for example, her immune system will be completely eliminated in order to impede rejection of your bone marrow, so for those days she'll be very susceptible to disease."  
“考虑到你与美里并非亲属关系，你们的 HLA 标记却异常相似，这表明成功的可能性很高。然而，还有许多其他因素可能影响美里术后恢复——例如，为了防止骨髓排斥，她的免疫系统将被完全清除，因此在那些日子里她将极易感染疾病。”

Shinji nodded, but the girl frowned and said, "You haven't really answered my question, Doctor."  
“医生，你并没有真正回答我的问题。”女孩皱眉说道，而真嗣点了点头。

Namika glared at her. "60."  
奈美香瞪着她。“60。”

She nodded. 她点点头。

Deciding that she would only elicit more questions from the Second if she allowed them to voice their concerns, Namika swept into a general explanation of the allogeneic transplant. Her hands moved rapidly in abstract gestures; Shinji nodded repeatedly, but the girl had no expression on her face. Namika plowed on. It was Shinji, not her, after all, who was going to be the donor.  
奈美香决定，如果她允许他们表达担忧，只会引来更多问题。于是她开始概括解释异基因移植的过程。她的手快速地做出抽象的手势；真嗣频频点头，但女孩脸上毫无表情。奈美香继续说下去。毕竟，将要成为捐赠者的是真嗣，而不是她。

"The procedure will be the same as the one Misato had, right?"  
"这个过程会和美里做的一样，对吧？"

"Yes," Namika said matter-of-factly, pleased now that Shinji was saying something. "There's no surgery involved—just a few punctures, and you'll be under general anesthesia. You'll probably be sore for a few days. We'll have pain medication on hand."  
"是的，" 奈美香实事求是地说道，现在因为真嗣开口说话而感到高兴。"不需要手术——只是几个穿刺，你会接受全身麻醉。可能会有几天感到酸痛。我们会准备好止痛药。"

Shinji nodded again. "I remember."  
真嗣再次点头。"我记得。"

"Good." The doctor glanced at her watch. "It's March 20 today. I want you to stay in the hospital, Shinji, while I run a couple of tests to make sure that everything's in order."  
"好。" 医生瞥了一眼手表。"今天是 3 月 20 日。我要你留在医院里，真嗣，我需要做一些检查，确保一切正常。"

"Yes ma'am." “是，长官。”

"That's all, if you have no more questions."  
"就这样，如果你没有其他问题的话。"

Namika voiced her last comment with apprehension, expecting the Second to respond. Instead, the two pilots—no, Shinji was no longer a pilot, she reminded herself—rose in unison from their chairs. Shinji thanked her. Namika said it was no problem. She watched as they slipped unnoticed into the quiet hallway and watched with surprise as Asuka leaned over and gently took Shinji's hand into her own.  
美里带着忧虑说出了她的最后一句话，期待着明日香回应。然而，两位驾驶员——不，真嗣不再是驾驶员了，她提醒自己——同时从椅子上站了起来。真嗣向她道谢。美里说没关系。她看着他们悄无声息地走进安静的走廊，惊讶地看到明日香倾身过去，温柔地将真嗣的手握在自己手中。

---

Rei was elated.

It didn't show in her steps as she climbed evenly up the stairs to her room. Her left fingers locked tightly over her schoolbag, and her sensible shoes made hardly a sound on the granite surface, but she allowed the faintest of smiles to grace the curve of her lips.  
她上楼的步伐依旧平稳，丝毫未显露内心的波澜。左手紧紧扣住书包，脚下的平底鞋在花岗岩地面上几乎不发出声响，但她嘴角却微微上扬，露出一丝几乎难以察觉的微笑。

She had been officially discharged from the hospital—but they were keeping Ikari in order to run a battery of tests on him.  
她已经正式出院了——但他们仍将碇留在医院，对他进行一系列的检查。

_Ikari,_ Rei thought. _Not Pilot Ikari anymore. Just Ikari_.  
碇，丽心想。不再是驾驶员碇了。只是碇。

But it didn't matter, because it was all going to work out. He was going to save Misato after all.  
但这些都无关紧要，因为一切都会顺利解决。他终究会救出美里。

Tomorrow. 明天。

Rei turned her doorknob and entered, ignoring the various envelopes with "Postmarked March 25" stamped on them as they fell from her cluttered box to the floor. Nothing but advertisements—nobody sent her mail. She headed straight for her bed and removed her shoes, then stretched on the faded sheets.  
绫波转动门把手走了进去，无视那些从她杂乱的信箱中掉落到地上、盖着“3 月 25 日邮戳”的各式信封。不过是些广告——没人给她寄信。她径直走向床铺，脱下鞋子，然后伸展身体躺在褪色的床单上。

_I am lucky to be home. Ikari does not have that pleasure_.  
我算是幸运的，能回到家中。而碇却没有这份福气。

She lay on her back for some time, listening to the traffic through her open window.  
她仰躺了一会儿，透过敞开的窗户听着外面的车流声。

Her gaze fell eventually on the clock—it was nearly six, so Rei clambered off the bed and headed to the kitchen to begin the process of making dinner. She was used to cooking simple meals for herself, but she had not done it many days, and tonight she was not particularly hungry…  
她的目光最终落在了时钟上——快六点了，于是丽从床上爬起来，走向厨房开始准备晚餐。她习惯了自己简单地做饭，但这样的日子并不多，而且今晚她并不怎么饿……

She decided instead that Ikari did not deserve the miserable hospital meals he would be getting tomorrow after the transplant.  
她转念一想，认为碇不应该在移植手术后遭受医院那糟糕的餐食。

So she cooked for him.  
于是她为他下厨。

There was nothing unspoiled in the refrigerator besides potatoes and rice. She peeled potatoes while standing at the sink, sweeping the dark peel away from the white flesh in long strips. Her hand slipped on the handle of the potato peeler and it fell to the ceramic floor with a clatter; Rei picked it up and washed it, feeling eerily as if someone were watching her.  
冰箱里除了土豆和米饭，没有什么未变质的食物。她站在水槽边削土豆皮，长长的黑皮从白嫩的土豆上剥落。她的手在削皮器柄上滑了一下，削皮器哐当一声掉在陶瓷地板上；绫波捡起来清洗，感觉诡异地像是有人在盯着她。

"So you can actually cook. I'm impressed."  
"原来你真的会做饭，我挺惊讶的。"

Rei knew who it was before she turned around, but it was still a surprise to see Pilot Sorhyu standing in her doorway, leaning casually against the soiled wall.  
丽在转身之前就知道是谁了，但看到索尔修飞行员站在她门口，随意地靠在脏兮兮的墙上，还是感到意外。

"I forgot to close the door," Rei muttered. It was not an apology or a greeting; Rei did not really know what it was—just a comment made to fill the silence.  
"我忘了关门，""丽喃喃自语。这既不是道歉也不是问候；丽并不清楚这算什么——只是为了填补沉默而说的一句话。

The Second came closer and inspected the various pots and pans laid over her counter. "Interesting… I couldn't really see you cooking so elaborately…"  
第二位走近了些，仔细打量着她台面上摆放的各种锅碗瓢盆。“有意思……我真没想到你会这么精心地烹饪……”

Rei bit her lip. "I am cooking for Ikari."  
丽咬了咬嘴唇。“我这是为碇做的。”

"For Shinji?" “给真嗣？”

"Yes," Rei said, a faint heat creeping up into her cheeks. She did not like being put on the spot in this fashion—she knew that there were mutual feelings between the girl in front of her and her ex-fellow pilot, but she did not know how to make it clear that she did not like him in that way. Meekly she added, "I did not want for him to have to eat the hospital food."  
“是的，”丽说道，一丝微热悄悄爬上她的脸颊。她不喜欢以这种方式被逼问——她知道眼前这位女孩和她曾经的战友之间有着相互的感情，但她不知道如何明确表示自己对他没有那种感觉。她怯生生地补充道：“我不希望他不得不吃医院的饭菜。”

Asuka's features softened. "Hey, I want to help… have you got any flour? Eggs? Fresh apples?"  
明日香的表情柔和了下来。“嘿，我想帮忙……你有面粉吗？鸡蛋？新鲜的苹果？”

Rei had none of any of the necessary ingredients, having not lived at home for over a month. Asuka picked up her bag and announced that she was going shopping.  
丽没有任何必需的食材，因为她已经一个多月没有在家生活了。明日香拿起她的包，宣布她要去购物。

_It is interesting…to have Pilot Sorhyu working in the kitchen as we prepare food for Ikari_, Rei thought as Asuka reentered her home only ten minutes later, laden down with two grocery sacks.  
真有意思……让驾驶员索吕在厨房里为我们准备给碇的食物，丽心想，因为明日香十分钟后就带着两个购物袋重新回到了家中。

"Hey, your oven does work, right?"  
“嘿，你的烤箱能用吧？”

Rei opened it for her, and Asuka peered suspiciously into its depths. It had apparently never been used, but she didn't see any reason why it wouldn't function properly. She took one of Rei's bowls and poured white flour into it, then mixed in a few spoonfuls of melted butter and an egg.  
丽为她打开了烤箱，明日香怀疑地往里面看了看。显然，它从未被使用过，但她看不出有什么理由它不能正常工作。她拿了一个丽的碗，倒进一些白面粉，然后加入几勺融化的黄油和一个鸡蛋。

"Will the nurses not question your absence?" Rei asked gently. She placed her potatoes onto a cutting-board and cut slices of identical thickness.  
"护士们不会质疑你的缺席吗？" 丽温柔地问道。她将土豆放在切菜板上，切出厚度相同的片。

Asuka shrugged. "I've been discharged too."  
明日香耸了耸肩。"我也已经出院了。"

"I see." "原来如此。"

Rei worked silently; while the potatoes simmered on the stove, she soaked a small pot of rice and set it to boil as well. It occurred to her that even if she herself was not hungry, Pilot Sorhyu would almost certainly expect to stay for a meal; and so she added some more rice to the pot.  
丽默默地工作着；当土豆在炉子上炖煮时，她浸泡了一小锅米饭并将其也置于炉上煮沸。她突然想到，即使她自己并不饿，驾驶员索尔希几乎肯定会期望留下来用餐；因此她又在锅中多加了一些米饭。

Asuka raised her eyebrows. "I wasn't planning to eat here."  
明日香挑了挑眉。"我本来没打算在这里吃饭。"

"Oh. I'm sorry." “哦。对不起。”

"Don't apologize. You sound like Shinji, pre—pre—" Asuka gave up and let the comment hang as she reached for a napkin. "I'm making enough turnovers for all three of us."  
"别道歉。你听起来像真嗣，之前——之前——" 明日香放弃了，让这句话悬在空中，伸手去拿餐巾。"我做的酥皮点心足够我们三个人吃的。"

Rei stood frozen to the spot. She had not expected Pilot Sorhyu to feed her—in her own kitchen!  
绫波丽僵在原地。她没想到惣流·明日香会亲自在厨房里给她喂食！

"Pilot Sorhyu—" "惣流·明日香——"

Asuka whirled around. "Asuka. Just Asuka, okay? Ouch! Damn—"  
明日香猛地转过身。“就叫我明日香，好吗？哎哟！该死——”

She had cut her finger. Rei, who had no shortage of bandages, wrapped it up for her. Asuka thanked her meekly, and seeing that she was standing idle while her food cooked, mentioned the asparagus she had purchased and asked if Rei would like to help her with it.  
她不小心割伤了手指。绫波丽，从不缺绷带，为她包扎起来。明日香怯生生地向她道谢，看到她在食物烹饪时无所事事，便提起了自己买的芦笋，问绫波是否愿意帮忙处理。

Obediently, Rei cut the spears while Asuka fussed over her apple filling—and finally satisfied, slipped the pan into the preheated oven.  
绫波顺从地切着芦笋，而明日香则忙着摆弄她的苹果馅——终于满意了，将烤盘滑入预热好的烤箱中。

"You care about Shinji a lot, don't you?" Asuka asked, measuring out teaspoons of olive oil. "Or you wouldn't be going to all this trouble for him."  
"你对真嗣很关心，不是吗？" 明日香问道，一边量着茶匙的橄榄油。"否则你也不会为他费这么多心思。"

Flustered, Rei replied, "I care for him, yes… but not in the way that you do, Asuka…"  
慌乱中，绫波回答道："我确实关心他，是的……但不像你那样，明日香……"

Asuka blinked. "I see." She paused, blinking again as if she were deep in thought—then returned to the oil, blushing and muttering softly to herself, "Yes, I guess I do care…" Her expression changed again as she quickly pulled over a plate. "Put the asparagus on here…and I think your potatoes are done."  
明日香眨了眨眼。"我明白了。"她停顿了一下，再次眨眼，仿佛陷入了沉思——然后回到油旁，脸颊泛红，轻声自语道："是的，我想我确实在乎……"她的表情再次变化，迅速拉过一个盘子。"把芦笋放在这儿……我想你的土豆已经好了。"

Twenty minutes later, the two girls settled down to their meal. Rei was unused to what seemed such a lavish affair and did not know how to begin until Asuka reached into her grocery bag and pulled out a pack of disposable plastic containers. She filled one with asparagus and potatoes; following her example, Rei filled two more with rice and apple turnovers. The crisp crust crumbled under her fingertips. Asuka put the four containers in the refrigerator.  
二十分钟后，两个女孩坐下来享用她们的晚餐。丽不习惯这种看似奢华的场合，不知如何开始，直到明日香从她的购物袋里拿出了一包一次性塑料容器。她装了一盒芦笋和土豆；照着她的样子，丽又装了两盒米饭和苹果酥。酥脆的外皮在她指尖下碎裂。明日香把四个容器放进了冰箱。

They sat on Rei's bed to eat, as the only table was dusty and covered with bloody bandages. Each balanced a plate on her lap, and neither spoke. Slowly, the sun lowered itself until it was no longer visible behind the edifices of Tokyo-3.  
她们坐在丽的床上吃饭，因为唯一的桌子布满灰尘，上面还堆着带血的绷带。每人腿上放着一个盘子，两人都沉默不语。慢慢地，太阳下沉，直到被第三新东京市的建筑群完全遮住，不再可见。

Asuka stood up reluctantly. "I should go."  
明日香不情愿地站起身来。“我该走了。”

Rei rose as well. "I will accompany you home."  
丽也站了起来。“我会陪你回家。”

"Don't—I'll be fine. Just don't forget Shinji's food tomorrow. And thanks for the meal."  
“不用——我会没事的。只是别忘了明天给真嗣带吃的。还有，谢谢你的饭。”

"You're welcome." “不客气。”

The words were out of her mouth before she knew it. Rei was surprised at herself. _Had she really said it? 'You're welcome'?_  
话不自觉地脱口而出。丽自己都感到惊讶。她真的说了吗？'不客气'？

"So I'll see you first thing at the hospital tomorrow?"  
“那我明天一早就去医院找你？”

"Yes, I will be there."  
“是的，我会到的。”

"See you then." “到时候见。”

Rei waited until Asuka's footsteps were no longer audible on the steps. She closed the door slowly and locked it, then did the same with her windows. The room was suddenly devoid of excitement. Feeling as if she had just experienced a real treat which was now coming to an end, Rei made her way slowly to the bed, picked up the two empty plates, and headed for the kitchen.  
丽等阿斯卡的脚步声在楼梯上消失后，才缓缓关上门并上锁，接着又同样锁上了窗户。房间突然间失去了活力。感觉就像刚刚经历了一场真实的盛宴，现在即将落幕，丽慢慢走向床边，拿起两个空盘子，向厨房走去。

Author's Note: Short chapter. I'm posting the rest of this story now, so not much to say in this note—just one thing: I know the summary has been bothersome in that it gives away a good part of the story, and I've gotten a good number of reviews asking me to change it. I've held out because I haven't wanted to hint at all at what would be coming in the last chapter(s), but the next part will be somewhat unpredictable—or so I hope. Anyway, I've added a small edit to the summary, hopefully not giving too much away.

The song that I used in this chapter is the German version of "The Gift" by Brosis. Having absolutely no knowledge of the German language other than the fact that "Seele" means "soul", I randomly selected a song and a stanza and had a German-speaking friend translate it for me. It comes out to something along the lines of "You know, I will always be honest with you, and you know, I am the one you can turn to, anytime, all over, anywhere, you know I will always be there…"  
本章使用的歌曲是 Brosis 演唱的德语版《The Gift》。除了知道“Seele”意为“灵魂”外，我对德语一窍不通，于是随机选了一首歌和一个诗节，请一位会讲德语的朋友帮我翻译。大意是“你知道，我会永远对你诚实，你也知道，我是你可以随时依靠的人，无论何时，无论何地，你知道我会一直在那里……”

(I really did intend, once upon a time, to get the rest of this story churned out by March 26—my apologies, yet again.)  
(曾经有一段时间，我真的打算在 3 月 26 日前完成这个故事的其余部分——再次表示歉意。)

### Chapter 7: demise

Namika had scheduled the transplant for eight, hoping to be completed by noon at the latest. She glanced at her watch again. It was seven forty-six.  
纳米卡安排了八次移植手术，希望最晚在中午之前完成。她又看了一眼手表。当时是七点四十六分。

Shinji was already being prepped by the nurses. Misato was in an isolated room, which contained its own air filter and was shut off from the world except for medical staff and equipment that had been thoroughly sterilized. She anticipated the extracting of Shinji's bone marrow to take no more than an hour, and less than two hours after that it would already be at work replacing Misato's.  
真嗣已经被护士们做好了准备。美里在一个隔离的房间里，房间里有自己的空气过滤器，除了经过彻底消毒的医护人员和设备外，与世隔绝。她预计提取真嗣的骨髓不会超过一个小时，不到两小时后，它就会代替美里的骨髓开始工作。

She picked up her clipboard, frowning at it as she made some last-minute decisions, and headed down to Shinji's room. On the way, her cell phone rang, and she picked it up to hear Ritsuko's anxious voice.  
她拿起写字板，皱着眉头做出一些最后的决定，然后走向真嗣的房间。半路上，她的手机响了，她接起电话，就听见律子焦急的声音。

"It's all going according to schedule," she assured her friend, who was staying within the Geofront. Namika knew that Ritsuko would have liked very much to have been in the hospital, but as she was not part of the medical staff there was not much that she could do. Besides, The Commander would not have NERV roll to a stop because of a bone marrow transplant.  
“一切都按计划进行，”她向住在 Geofront 的朋友保证。纳米卡知道律子很想留在医院，但由于她不是医务人员，所以她无能为力。而且，指挥官不会因为骨髓移植而让NERV停止运转。

The remaining two pilots were sitting in the waiting room as she passed. Asuka nodded in greeting, but the blue-haired girl wore no expression on her face. Four identical plastic containers sat on the coffee table in front of them.  
当她经过时，剩下的两名飞行员正坐在候机室里。明日香点头打招呼，但蓝发少女却毫无表情。他们面前的咖啡桌上放着四个一模一样的塑料容器。

Namika hurried on. 娜美卡急忙前行。

---

Seven forty-nine. 七点四十九分。

Ritsuko was expecting The Commander to lecture her for repeatedly glancing at her watch, but all the technicians were doing the same, and he chose today to ignore it.  
律子本以为指挥官会因为她反复看手表而教训她，但所有技术人员都在这样做，他今天选择了无视。

Maya poured herself another cup of coffee and, without thinking, poured one for Ritsuko as well. The blonde doctor thanked her absentmindedly and took a sip. It was hotter than she had expected.  
玛雅又给自己倒了一杯咖啡，想也没想也给律子倒了一杯。金发医生心不在焉地道谢，喝了一口。天气比她预想的还要热。

Seven fifty. 七点五十。

Makoto had pulled up the data from Asuka's last synchronization test and was repeatedly typing and deleting things so that no actual changes were made to the file. Maya sipped her coffee. Only Shigeru was doing anything of particular use—moving Shinji's files to a storage folder in the depths of the Magi, separate from those of Asuka and Rei.  
Makoto 从明日香上次同步测试中提取了数据，并反复输入和删除内容，因此没有对文件进行任何实际更改。玛雅喝了一口咖啡。只有茂在做一些有特殊用途的事情——将真嗣的文件移到魔法师深处的一个存储文件夹中，与明日香和丽的文件分开。

Ritsuko could not resist the temptation to glance at the clock again. Seven fifty-two. She sipped her coffee.  
律子忍不住又看了一眼时钟。七点五十二分。她喝了一口咖啡。

Seven fifty-three. 七点五十三分。

"Sempai…" “直到…”

"What?" “什么？”

Maya beckoned her over. "Look at this…"  
玛雅招呼她过去。 “看这个…”

Ritsuko frowned, trying to decipher the blurry form behind the sketchy lines that restructured themselves each second based on the newest data. Makoto and Shigeru hurried over, crowding around Maya's computer for a glance at the screen. Ritsuko withdrew a pencil and pointed it at the indistinct shape.  
律子皱起眉头，试图解读那些根据最新数据每秒重组的粗略线条背后​​的模糊形式。 Makoto 和 Shigeru 急忙跑了过来，围在 Maya 的电脑前，想看一眼屏幕。律子抽出一支铅笔，指着那个模糊的形状。

"That can't be…" “那不可能……”

But then the solemn, knowing screech cut through the Geofront, and NERV went into action.  
但随后，庄严的、会意的尖叫声穿过了 Geofront，NERV 开始行动。

Ritsuko closed her eyes, temporarily isolating herself from the world as she raged as the ridiculousness of the situation. There was no need to see the words "Pattern Blue" upon the Magi screen; she reached towards the pre-programmed button that would fire off automatic phone calls to their pilots—but never made it. A thundering blow shook the Geofront and knocked Ritsuko to the ground; Maya shrieked as her chair upturned. Glass smashed; for a moment all could be heard was static in the darkness; then, slowly, a dim yellow light filtered back into the room. Some sort of emergency system had kicked in.  
律子闭上眼睛，暂时与世隔绝，对这种荒谬的情况感到愤怒。不需要在魔法师屏幕上看到“蓝色图案”的字样；她把手伸向预先编程的按钮，该按钮会自动给飞行员打电话，但她从未成功。一声雷鸣般的打击震动了地面，将律子击倒在地；当玛雅的椅子翻转时，她尖叫起来。玻璃被打碎；一时间黑暗中一切都静悄悄的。然后，慢慢地，一道暗黄色的光重新射入房间。某种紧急系统已经启动。

The technicians scrambled to their places; Makoto slammed his palm down on the button. Maya typed furiously on her temporarily unresponsive keyboard, and Ritsuko hurried to her place behind her assistant as the Magi's mechanic voice issued reports.  
技术人员争先恐后地就位。诚将手掌按在了按钮上。玛雅在暂时没有反应的键盘上疯狂地打字，律子急忙回到助手身后的位置，魔法师的机械声音发出报告。

For now, within the Geofront, the transplant was forgotten.  
目前，在 Geofront 内，移植手术被遗忘了。

Shinji had managed to stay on the bed, but Dr. Ishiyama's nurses and assistants had not been so lucky; most the medical staff had been thrown against the wall and their equipment was scattered across the floor.  
真嗣设法留在了床上，但石山医生的护士和助手就没那么幸运了。大多数医务人员被扔到墙上，他们的设备散落在地板上。

Namika cursed violently, searching the floor on hands and knees for her equipment. No luck.  
纳米卡猛烈地咒骂着，手脚并用地在地板上寻找她的装备。没有运气。

"Dr. Ishiyama, perhaps we should cancel," one of the assistants voiced nervously.  
“石山博士，也许我们应该取消，”一名助手紧张地说道。

"We're going to have to. We haven't got any electricity; without the machines we aren't going to be able monitor his body functions. We—"  
“我们必须这么做。我们没有电；没有机器，我们就无法监测他的身体功能。我们——”

Her cell phone rang. 她的手机响了。

Surprised, Namika plucked it off of the belt loop from which it hung and flicked open the cover. Nurses, assistants, and Shinji listened in dead silence as The Commander's voice echoed through the room.  
纳米卡惊讶地把它从挂在上面的皮带环上拔下来，然后打开了盖子。当指挥官的声音在房间里回响时，护士、助手和真嗣陷入死一般的寂静。

"Continue the operation."  
“继续手术。”

"But, Commander," Namika pressed, "we can't—"  
“但是，指挥官，”纳米卡追问，“我们不能——”

"Continue." “继续。”

There was a click, and Namika slowly lowered the phone.  
“咔哒”一声，纳米卡慢慢放下了手机。

"Dr. Ishiyama?" “石山博士？”

It was hard enough to meet his eyes, but she was shocked to see them pleading with her. "Please, can we keep going with it?"  
直视他的眼睛已经够困难的了，但看到他们恳求她的眼神，她感到很震惊。 “请问，我们可以继续这样吗？”

"You have to understand, Shinji, that if anything goes wrong—we won't have any medical technology to help you, just our hands," Namika said. It was against her doctor's intuition to let this happen; but the Commander had ordered it, and Shinji wanted it…  
“你必须明白，真嗣，如果出现任何问题，我们不会有任何医疗技术来帮助你，只有我们的双手，”纳米卡说。让这种事发生有违医生的直觉。但指挥官已经下令了，真嗣也想要……

"I don't want Misato to have to wait any longer. Please?"  
“我不想让美里再等下去。可以吗？”

Namika breathed in and out, knowing her staff and patient were watching and depending on her.  
纳米卡深呼吸，知道她的工作人员和病人正在注视着她并依赖她。

"All right. Misumi, I want you to go check on Misato—Kameko, I'll need a couple of battery-powered flashlights." Namika tore off her surgical gloves, soiled from crawling on the floor in search of her tools. Another nurse was piling equipment on the cart. Namika tugged on a sterile pair of gloves and instructed the nurse to sterilize each piece of metallic equipment. The nurse nodded and went off in search of the necessary chemicals.  
“好吧。美澄，我想让你去看看美里——龟子，我需要几个电池供电的手电筒。”纳米卡撕下她的手术手套，因为她爬在地板上寻找工具而弄脏了手套。另一名护士正在把设备堆放在推车上。纳米卡戴上无菌手套，指示护士对每件金属设备进行消毒。护士点点头，然后去寻找必要的化学药品。

"I trust the IV will work just fine without electricity," Namika muttered, mostly to herself. The IV infusion pump, however, which controlled the dosage of anesthesia, would need batteries, and the doctor wasted a few frustrated moments rummaging through drawers to find some of the proper size. She pulled the contraption nearer to Shinji and held out the needle at the end of a long, flexible plastic tube. "I'm going to put this into your arm, and you'll be asleep in a few minutes. It'll last about an hour."  
“我相信IV在没有电的情况下也能正常工作，”纳米卡嘀咕道，主要是自言自语。然而，控制麻醉剂量的静脉输液泵需要电池，医生浪费了一些沮丧的时间在抽屉里翻找合适尺寸的电池。她把这个装置拉近真嗣，并伸出一根长而柔软的塑料管末端的针。 “我会把这个放进你的手臂里，几分钟后你就会睡着。大约会持续一个小时。”

"All right." “好的。”

She sat on the bedside and waited for her staff to return, not wanting to put in the line until everyone was ready with the proper equipment. That would take time, she knew—every piece of equipment would have to be manually sterilized not only to remove dirt and grime, but also to inactivate any pieces of nucleic acid or protein material that might have been picked up. In the meantime, she instructed Shinji to turn on his back so that they would have easy access to the iliac crest of his hip.  
她坐在床边等待工作人员回来，直到每个人都准备好适当的设备后才排队。她知道，这需要时间——每台设备都必须进行手动消毒，不仅要去除污垢和污垢，还要灭活可能被拾取的任何核酸或蛋白质材料。与此同时，她指示真嗣翻身，以便他们可以轻松接触到他臀部的髂嵴。

Namika worried. She worried about the safety of this procedure, when there would be no machines to monitor Shinji's body functions. She worried about Misato, who was surely fretting in her room—and whether or not she would be all right. She worried for Tokyo-3. And each worry brought her back to where she began: that there was nothing she could do but focus on saving her friend's life.  
纳米卡担心。她担心这个手术的安全性，因为没有机器来监测真嗣的身体功能。她担心美里，她肯定在她的房间里焦躁不安——也担心她是否会没事。她担心第三东京。每一次担忧都让她回到了最初的起点：除了集中精力拯救朋友的生命之外，她无能为力。

"Are you scared?" she asked Shinji. Hardly any light streamed in through the window, and a moment later both heard the clanking and characteristic _whoosh_ that signaled the deployment of an Evangelion half a mile away.  
“你怕了吗？”她问真嗣。几乎没有任何光线从窗户射进来，过了一会儿，两人都听到了叮当声和特有的呼啸声，这标志着半英里外新世纪福音战士的部署。

"No." As an afterthought, he added, "And I trust in Asuka and Rei."  
“不。”事后他又补充道：“我信任明日香和丽。”

Namika nodded, pleased, and patted his shoulder. "I'm proud of you."  
纳米卡满意地点点头，拍拍他的肩膀。 “我以你为荣。”

Shinji nodded and blinked, unsure of how to react. He decided to stay quiet, and Namika did the same until her staff returned.  
真嗣点点头，眨了眨眼睛，不知道该如何反应。他决定保持安静，纳米卡也做了同样的事情，直到她的员工回来。

"We're ready, Dr. Ishiyama."  
“我们准备好了，石山博士。”

"Shinji, I'm going to put the IV in now," Namika informed him. Standard protocol required that she inform the patient of everything she was doing. "You'll probably feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in, so I'm going to numb the area first. Can you hold out your arm for me?"  
“真嗣，我现在要把静脉注射进去，”纳米卡告诉他。标准协议要求她告知患者她所做的一切。 “针扎进去的时候，你可能会感到轻微的挤压，所以我要先麻醉一下这个地方。你能帮我伸出你的手臂吗？”

She felt as if she were working in a third-world hospital, with one assistant handing her equipment and another holding the flashlight for her so that she could locate a vein. Shinji did not have hard-to-find veins, fortunately. The needle slid in deftly under the yellow glare of the flashlight. Shinji mumbled something, but it was not quite audible, and a moment later he was fast asleep.  
她感觉自己好像在一家第三世界医院工作，一名助手递给她设备，另一名助手为她举着手电筒，以便她找到静脉。幸运的是，真嗣并没有很难找到的矿脉。在手电筒的黄色强光照射下，针灵巧地滑了进去。真嗣咕哝了一句什么，但声音不大，过了一会儿就睡着了。

Namika reached out a hand behind her. Someone tucked the correct piece of equipment into her hand, and she brought it under the light to make a few final adjustments. Satisfied, she placed a hand on Shinji's waist and positioned the needle.  
纳米卡向身后伸出一只手。有人把正确的设备塞到她手里，她把它放在灯光下进行一些最后的调整。她满意地把手放在真嗣的腰上，将针固定好。

She hesitated. Something didn't feel right.  
她犹豫了。感觉有些不对劲。

"Doctor?" “医生？”

She didn't know why—but something told her that she should not go on with the transplant, that something was not quite right. Her hand quivered and she turned abruptly to examine the IV. It was functioning properly, and in the dead silence, under the stares of her assistants, Namika suddenly felt very stupid. She bit her lip and did what she was there to do, ignoring the unpredictable quaking of Tokyo-3 as best as she could. It went smoothly, and less than five minutes later she was transferring the one and a half quarts of crimson marrow to a sterile bag—from there it would be transplanted into Misato's chest via a catheter.  
她不知道为什么，但有件事告诉她，她不应该继续进行移植手术，有些事情不太对劲。她的手颤抖着，突然转身检查静脉注射。运转正常，在死一般的寂静中，在助手们的注视下，纳米卡突然觉得自己很愚蠢。她咬着嘴唇，做了她该做的事，尽可能无视第三东京不可预测的震动。一切都很顺利，不到五分钟，她就将一夸脱半的深红骨髓转移到了一个无菌袋中——从那里通过导管将其移植到美里的胸腔中。

She sealed the bag firmly and glanced at Shinji. Again, her staff was waiting for her to direct them. Unable to shake off the feeling that something was wrong, she ordered them to hook the patient up to the necessary machines as soon as the power came back on—which she hoped would happen soon.  
她将袋子封紧，看了一眼真嗣。她的员工再次等待着她的指挥。由于无法摆脱出问题的感觉，她命令他们在电源恢复后立即将病人连接到必要的机器上——她希望这很快就会发生。

"Come and get me in case anything happens," she instructed, "make sure Shinji's hooked up to the monitors as soon as the power comes back on; Misumi, get a small bandage to cover the puncture spot—"  
“万一发生什么情况，过来接我，”她指示道，“确保电源一恢复，真嗣就连接到监视器；美澄，拿一块小绷带包住刺破的地方——”

There was a chorus of "Yes, Doctor"s from the room. Again Namika felt uncomfortable. They knew protocol—she did not need to remind them. She shook her head and hurried to Misato's.  
房间里传来一阵齐声“是的，医生”的声音。纳米卡再次感到不舒服。他们知道礼仪——她不需要提醒他们。她摇摇头，快步往美里家走去。

---

Asuka was mad—mad because the Angel had picked a crummy time to attack, mad because she wouldn't be able to be there when Shinji and Misato woke up, and mad that the carefully designed plan for the day had just gone to hell. At that moment she didn't care about the fact that Angels did not operate on a schedule that suited humans—she intended only to slaughter it.  
明日香很生气——生气是因为天使选择了一个糟糕的攻击时间，生气是因为当真嗣和美里醒来时她无法在场，生气是因为今天精心设计的计划完全泡汤了。此刻她并不在乎天使并不按照适合人类的时间表运作——她只想屠杀它。

She glanced into the distance where Rei was waiting, in the damaged Unit 00. Neither said a word.  
她看了一眼远处，丽正在受损的 00 号单元里等待。两人都没有说话。

Asuka slapped the dashboard with her palm.  
明日香用手掌拍打仪表板。

Ritsuko's face appeared in a mini electronic panel on her side. "Asuka, that won't help. Don't worry about Shinji now. We need you to concentrate on defeating the angel."  
律子的脸出现在她身边的一个迷你电子面板上。 “明日香，那没用的。现在别担心真嗣。我们需要你集中精力打败天使。”

"What do you think I'm doing?" she seethed angrily.  
“你觉得我在做什么？”她怒火中烧。

Ritsuko ignored her, shutting off the control window instead, and this made her all the angrier; Asuka's fingers tightened into a fist and she grumbled under her breath.  
律子没有理会她，而是关闭了控制窗口，这让她更生气了；明日香的手指紧握成拳，低声抱怨道。

It was coming. She braced herself and replaced her hands on the red controls of Evangelion Unit 02. Her eyes narrowed. Several hundred meters away, Rei watched in silence… with a tinge of fear.  
它来了。她做好了心理准备，将双手放回了新世纪福音战士02号机的红色控制器上。她的眼睛眯了起来。数百米外，雷默默地看着……带着一丝恐惧。

_I will not fail_, Asuka thought. _Even if Shinji isn't here_.  
我不会失败，明日香想。即使真嗣不在。

But that was not how things were to be.  
但事情并非如此。

---

It was ridiculous, trying to carry out a transplant under such conditions—the ground shook again as Namika ran down the hallway, grateful that she was not wearing heels as Ritsuko always did—nevertheless, she slipped to the ground and broke the fall with her shoulder. The doctor scrambled to her feet and examined the bag. Fortunately, there were no leaks.  
在这种情况下尝试进行移植手术真是太可笑了——地面再次震动，纳米卡跑过走廊，庆幸自己没有像律子那样穿高跟鞋——然而，她滑倒在地，用她的力气避免了摔倒。肩膀。医生爬起来检查袋子。幸运的是，没有发生泄漏。

Her heart sank as she neared Misato's room. No electricity meant no machines, and no such machines meant that they could not filter the marrow to remove T-cells, a process which would greatly decrease the risk of rejection. Modern medicine was hopelessly dependent on electricity and machines. She would have to hope that rejection could be suppressed in the imminent future using powerful drugs.  
当她靠近美里的房间时，她的心沉了下去。没有电就意味着没有机器，没有这样的机器意味着他们无法过滤骨髓以去除 T 细胞，这一过程将大大降低排斥的风险。现代医学无可救药地依赖于电力和机器。她不得不希望在不久的将来可以使用强效药物来抑制排斥反应。

Her assistant arrived momentarily, and both re-scrubbed and donned clean surgical gloves. Neither spoke; both were too busy focusing on the task at hand. Upon entering the room, the first thing that Namika noticed was that Misato's curtains were wide open and she was sitting in bed with her neck strained, attempting to catch a glimpse of what was going on. Dim light filtered in and a second assistant quickly arrived with a flashlight.  
她的助手很快就到了，两人重新擦洗并戴上干净的手术手套。两人都没说话；两人都太忙于专注于手头的任务。进入房间后，纳米卡首先注意到的是美里的窗帘大开，她坐在床上，脖子绷得紧紧的，试图看清发生的事情。昏暗的光线透进来，第二个助手很快就拿着手电筒赶了过来。

"We don't know either, but he wanted us to keep going with the transplant," Namika informed her. They made a small incision in her chest to insert the catheter (unlike Shinji's, Misato's procedure involved a bit of surgery but required only local anesthesia). Both doctor and assistant breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the red liquid slowly dripping into Misato's chest. Misato herself remained distraught, muttering all the while to herself with a glazed look in her eyes.  
“我们也不知道，但他希望我们继续进行移植手术，”纳米卡告诉她。他们在她的胸部做了一个小切口以插入导管（与真嗣的手术不同，美里的手术涉及一些手术，但只需要局部麻醉）。看到红色的液体缓缓滴入美里的胸口，医生和助手都松了口气。美里自己也心烦意乱，眼神呆滞地自言自语。

"They'll have deployed Units 02 and 00… except that reconstruction on Unit 00 hasn't been completed yet, but 01 will reject her… and with no electricity they'll be operating on that inconsistent backup system …"  
“他们将部署 02 号和 00 号机组……除了 00 号机组的重建尚未完成，但 01 号将拒绝她……并且在没有电力的情况下，他们将在不一致的备份系统上运行……”

"Misato," Namika begged, watching the catheter nervously, "please calm down."  
“美里，”纳米卡紧张地看着导管，恳求道，“请冷静一点。”

But that was not to happen, as the ground shook again and Namika fought to keep the IV system and bed in place. Her assistant screamed, and a moment later Namika realized why; the windowpanes had shattered, and they were now face-to-face with none other than the head of Unit 02.  
但这并没有发生，因为地面再次震动，纳米卡努力保持静脉注射系统和床位。她的助手尖叫起来，过了一会儿，纳米卡意识到了原因；窗玻璃碎了，他们现在面对面的不是别人，正是02部队的队长。

Just the head. 只是头部。

"Misumi, close the curtains," Namika ordered.  
“美澄，把窗帘拉上。”纳米卡命令道。

The girl cowered and Namika, driven over the edge, lost her patience.  
女孩畏缩了，纳米卡被逼到了边缘，失去了耐心。

"CLOSE THE CURTAINS!" “关上窗帘！”

Trembling, the assistant half-crawled to the window and pulled the draperies together, not daring to look at the severed head. It did not block out the sound of horrified screams and shattering buildings, but it did prevent them from having to view the damage. The doctor scanned the incision, satisfied that the quake did not appear to have done any damage. Misato's fingers were scrabbling across the surface of her bedside table for her cell phone, with no success.  
助理颤抖着半爬到窗边，拉起窗帘，不敢看那颗被砍下的头颅。它并没有阻止恐怖的尖叫声和建筑物破碎的声音，但它确实阻止了他们看到损坏的情况。医生扫描了切口，确信地震似乎没有造成任何损害。美里的手指在床头柜上摸索着寻找手机，但没有成功。

Namika breathed, tried to reassure her. "I'm sure they ejected the entrance plug."  
纳米卡呼吸着，试图让她放心。 “我确信他们弹出了入口塞。”

"_Entry_ plug. I hope they did."  
“入口插头。我希望他们做到了。”

"I'm sure they did." “我确信他们做到了。”

But Misato shot her a warning look and Namika refrained from making any other ignorant comments. She was reminded uncomfortably that despite all the years she had worked at NERV, she knew very little about its functions. They simply delivered the injured to her and she was to treat them and return them to work.  
但美里警告地看了她一眼，并香没有做出任何其他无知的评论。她不舒服地想起，尽管她在NERV工作了这么多年，但她对其职能却知之甚少。他们只是将伤者交给她，她负责治疗他们并让他们重返工作岗位。

"Does anything hurt?" “有什么疼吗？”

"Not really." “并不真地。”

"No chills? Fever?" “没有发冷吗？发烧吗？”

"No."

"Good." “好的。”

Without warning, the lights flickered back on. Namika saw with relief that everything was functioning well. She nodded to her assistant, and the girl sank into a chair, holding a shaking hand over her eyes. Namika met Misato's eyes and they grinned shakily; under normal circumstances the doctor would have scolded her assistant for such a bad case of nerves, but today's circumstances were certainly not normal. She shook her hands, trying to bring feeling back into her numbed fingers, and reached for the monitoring machines; Misato certainly appeared to be alive and well, but the human eye was imperfect at detecting tiny changes…  
没有任何警告，灯光又闪烁起来。纳米卡欣慰地看到一切都运转良好。她向助手点了点头，然后女孩就坐到了椅子上，用颤抖的手捂住了眼睛。纳米卡与美里的目光相遇，他们颤抖地笑了。如果是在正常情况下，医生肯定会因为她的助手如此神经质而责骂她，但今天的情况肯定不正常。她摇晃着双手，试图让麻木的手指恢复知觉，然后伸手去够监控设备。美里看起来确实还活着，而且活得很好，但人眼在察觉微小变化方面并不完美……

Then the door burst open, and the assistant let out a little shriek.  
然后门突然打开了，助理发出一声尖叫。

"Dr. Ishiyama!" “石山博士！”

Namika burst out, "You're not allowed in here without being fully sterilized! Get out!"  
娜美卡大声喊道：“没有彻底消毒，你不准进来！滚出去！”

"We need you now," the nurse insisted. She was breathing quickly and unevenly, and there were patches of red in her cheeks visible even in the dim light.  
“我们现在需要你，”护士坚持说。她的呼吸急促而不均匀，脸颊上即使在昏暗的灯光下也能看到一片片红晕。

"Stay here," Namika ordered her assistant, and to Misato, "I'll be back soon." She said not a word to the nurse, breaking into a run once she exited Misato's room. There was a dreadful feeling in her stomach that she knew already…  
“留在这儿，”纳米卡命令她的助手，然后对美里说，“我很快就会回来。”她没有对护士说一句话，一走出美里的房间就开始奔跑。她的胃里有一种她已经知道的可怕的感觉……

She threw open the door to Shinji's room, where the medical personnel were gathered around the patient but scattered quickly in her presence. Namika strode to the patient and in doing so, noticed the display of flat green lines on the electrically illuminated panels around him.  
她推开真嗣房间的门，医务人员聚集在病人周围，但在她面前却迅速散开。纳米卡大步走到病人身边，注意到他周围的电照明面板上显示出平坦的绿线。

Flat lines. 平坦的线条。

_Flat lines…! 扁平的线条……！_

"Shinji," she whispered, taking firm hold by the shoulder and shaking him first gently and then harder, "Shinji!"  
“真嗣，”她轻声说道，紧紧抓住他的肩膀，先是轻轻地摇动他，然后又用力摇晃，“真嗣！”

Nothing. 没有什么。

She turned him over so that he was lying on his back, pulled back his eyelids, and shone her light into them. She listened desperately for a heartbeat, moving her stethoscope over his chest in rapid, panicked motions. She watched him desperately, praying that she would see his chest rising and falling as he breathed. Around her, the staff stood motionless, heads bowed, waiting for her to conclude what they already knew.  
她把他翻过来，让他仰面躺着，拉开他的眼睑，用灯光照射他的眼睑。她拼命地听着心跳，用听诊器在他胸前快速、惊慌地移动。她绝望地看着他，祈祷自己能看到他的胸口随着他的呼吸而起伏。在她周围，工作人员一动不动地站着，低着头，等待她总结他们已经知道的事情。

The doctor tossed her hair back and threw a painstaking, stricken stare at the monitor, but was greeted again with flat lines.Nothing had changed.  
医生把头发向后一甩，痛苦而震惊地盯着监视器，但迎接她的却是平淡的线条。一切都没有改变。

Forced to accept the bitter truth, Namika backed away slowly from the bed and tripped over the metal contraption that maintained the IV line. One of the nurses reached to help her up, but she slapped away her hand and remained sitting on the cold tiles.  
纳米卡被迫接受这个痛苦的事实，她慢慢地从床上后退，被维持静脉输液管的金属装置绊倒。一名护士伸手扶她起来，但她拍开手，继续坐在冰冷的瓷砖上。

As a doctor, she had learned early on to accept the harsh realities of medicine. But now… this time…  
作为一名医生，她很早就学会了接受医学的严酷现实。但现在……这一次……

She gripped the cold metal bar of the metal structure beside her and held it tight, feeling the coldness sink into the flesh of her palm. Her arm quivered uncontrollably, and the almost-empty IV bag above her moved in response. She looked up at it with miserable eyes, and suddenly the answer dawned on her.  
她握住身边金属结构冰冷的金属棒，紧紧握着，感觉冰冷渗入掌心的肉里。她的手臂不受控制地颤抖着，头顶上几乎空了的输液袋也跟着动了动。她抬起头，用悲惨的眼神看着它，突然间她明白了答案。

Yet nobody had ever anticipated that it would be a problem.  
然而，没有人预料到这会成为一个问题。

Statistics from graduate-school textbooks were hurling themselves at her now, and Namika felt the numbers ricocheting in her mind; less than one in 800,000 deaths were attributable to the use of general anesthesia, and most of those were due to other complications.  
研究生院教科书上的统计数据现在向她扑来，纳米卡感觉到这些数字在她的脑海中跳动。不到八十万例死亡中的一人是由于使用全身麻醉而导致的，其中大多数是由于其他并发症造成的。

_Other complications. 其他并发症。_

She recalled the symptoms prior to anesthesia-related deaths exactly as they had been written in her college textbook: _medullary paralysis occurs if the respiratory centers of the brain that control breathing and other vital functions cease to function death results if the patient cannot be revived quickly careful control of the amounts of anesthetics and monitoring of the patient's vital signs should prevent this from occurring—_  
她回忆起麻醉相关死亡前的症状，与她大学教科书上写的一模一样：如果大脑中控制呼吸和其他重要功能的呼吸中枢停止运作，就会发生髓麻痹，如果患者不能迅速苏醒，就会导致死亡。仔细控制麻醉剂的用量并监测患者的生命体征应该可以防止这种情况发生——

Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics—they had done that—she had checked and rechecked them. But they had not been able to monitor his vital signs, or somebody would surely have noticed.  
仔细控制麻醉剂的用量——他们已经做到了——她检查了一遍又一遍。但他们无法监测他的生命体征，否则肯定有人会注意到。

_Shinji's death could have been preventable.  
真嗣的死本来是可以避免的。_

_Shinji's death… 慎二的死……_

Namika let out a little cry of pure misery. Somebody reached down again to help her; again she slapped them away and instead clutched tightly to the wooden table leg behind her, letting her world fade to blackness as she scrunched her eyes and struggled not to cry.  
纳米卡发出一声纯粹痛苦的哭声。有人再次伸手去帮助她。她再次把它们拍开，紧紧抓住身后的木桌腿，让她的世界逐渐陷入黑暗，她皱起眼睛，努力不让自己哭出来。

The last thing she remembered was regretting the fact that she had shouted at her assistant for showing weakness.  
她记得的最后一件事是后悔自己对助理的示弱大喊大叫。

It fell to Rei to dispose of the food they had prepared. She was surely not about to eat it, and Asuka was still hospitalized. Minor injuries, she had been told. The Second would be out of the hospital in a few days.  
丽负责处理他们准备的食物。她肯定不打算吃它，而且明日香还在住院。有人告诉她，受了轻伤。几天后，二号就可以出院了。

They had defeated the Angel. Rei did not remember how she had done it. It didn't matter. She vaguely remembered the NERV technicians mentioning that it was a miracle that she had survived the battle at all, much less emerging unscathed. That Asuka had survived with only minor injuries. It didn't matter.  
他们已经打败了天使。丽不记得自己是怎么做到的。没关系。她依稀记得NERV技术人员说过，她能在这场战斗中幸存下来已经是一个奇迹，更不用说毫发无伤了。明日香只受了轻伤，幸免于难。没关系。

She neared the waiting room slowly, hoping not to see the four plastic containers stacked on the coffee table as they had been that morning. Perhaps they had spoiled in the lack of refrigeration and someone had thrown them out. Perhaps someone had been hungry and eaten them. Perhaps—  
她慢慢地靠近候诊室，希望不要看到咖啡桌上堆放着四个塑料容器，就像早上那样。也许它们因缺乏冷藏而变质，然后有人把它们扔掉了。也许有人饿了，把它们吃掉了。也许-

But no, they were still there.  
但不，他们还在那里。

She picked them up and made her way woodenly to the nearest restroom. It was a small, private room designed for usage by only one person at a time; there were no stalls, and for that Rei was grateful. She entered and closed the door behind her. Rei opened her arms and the containers fell into the sink with a clatter. A ceramic, white sink unlike the metal sink at home where she and Asuka had prepared the meal.  
她拿起它们，木然地走向最近的洗手间。这是一间狭小的私人房间，一次只能供一个人使用。没有摊位，对此丽很感激。她走进去，关上了身后的门。丽张开双臂，容器哗啦一声掉进水槽里。一个白色的陶瓷水槽，与她和明日香准备饭菜的家里的金属水槽不同。

Rei peeled back the plastic lid of the first container and poured the potatoes into the toilet, then watched them disappear as she depressed the flush lever. Next came the rice. By the time she removed the lid of the asparagus, her eyes were filled with tears and her hands shaking such that she missed the toilet bowl completely and the vegetables scattered across the floor.  
丽揭开第一个容器的塑料盖，将土豆倒入马桶中，然后按下冲水杆，看着它们消失。接下来是米饭。当她揭开芦笋的盖子时，她的眼睛里充满了泪水，双手颤抖着，完全没有看到马桶，蔬菜散落在地板上。

She cleaned it up without focusing on the task, and tossed the container of apple turnovers into the trash can without opening it.  
她没有专心做事，就把它清理干净，没有打开，就把装苹果馅饼的容器扔进了垃圾桶。

Rei grasped the edge of the sink with her white hands, still trembling. The yellow light cast a dim glow on her blue hair, and in the mirror she saw her red eyes teeming with tears. She blinked, allowing a single tear to escape and make its way down her cheek.  
丽用白皙的双手抓住了水槽的边缘，仍然在颤抖。黄色的灯光在她蓝色的头发上投射出暗淡的光芒，镜子里她看到她红色的眼睛里充满了泪水。她眨了眨眼睛，一滴泪水夺眶而出，顺着脸颊滑落。

She tore a paper towel from the rack and held it to her closed eyes, allowing the soft paper to soak up the moisture that leaked from beneath her eyelids. In the midst of her grief Rei mused ironically that a few weeks ago she would have been shocked with her behavior today. The First could not remember crying; she could count on one hand the number of times in which she had shown true emotion—but today it did not matter.  
她从架子上撕下一张纸巾，把它放在闭上的眼睛上，让柔软的纸巾吸收从眼睑下漏出的水分。在悲伤之中，丽讽刺地想，如果是在几周前，她一定会对自己今天的行为感到震惊。第一号不记得哭过；她流露出真情的次数一只手就能数得过来——但今天已经不重要了。

It did not matter at all.  
这根本不重要。

"Hey." “嘿。”

"Hey." Misato lowered the newspaper and giggled girlishly. "I see you brought me flowers."  
“嘿。”美里放下报纸，少女般地咯咯笑起来。 “我看到你给我带来了花。”

"Yeah, but they're plastic. I remembered you liked hyacinths."  
“是的，但它们是塑料的。我记得你喜欢风信子。”

Misato smiled. The strain of her illness had etched deep lines into her face, but she was smiling again. She held the newspaper out for him to see the headline. "The last angel did some pretty bad damage, huh?"  
美里笑了。疾病的压力在她的脸上刻下了深深的皱纹，但她又微笑了。她把报纸递给他看标题。 “最后一位天使造成了相当严重的伤害，是吧？”

Kaji's mouth formed a thin line. "Probably one of the worst. A lot of reconstruction's going to follow this one."  
梶的嘴抿成一条细线。 “可能是最糟糕的情况之一。紧随其后的是大量重建工作。”

"I see." Anxious to change the subject, she chided, "Hey, how'd you get them to let you in here? I thought you had to be medical staff."  
“我懂了。”她急于转移话题，斥责道：“嘿，你怎么让他们让你进来的？我以为你一定是医务人员。”

"I have excellent persuading skills," Kaji informed her. "Besides, do you know how much scrubbing they made me go through? Surely you don't think I'm wearing this blue gown for _fun_." He picked morosely at it.  
“我有出色的说服技巧，”梶告诉她。 “再说了，你知道他们让我擦了多少遍吗？你肯定不会以为我穿这件蓝色长袍是为了好玩吧。”他闷闷不乐地挑着它。

Misato laughed weakly and coughed. Kaji waited for it to pass, then asked, "So how did you convince them to give you a newspaper?"  
美里虚弱地笑了一声，咳嗽了一声。加治等它过去，然后问道：“那你是怎么说服他们给你一份报纸的？”

"Ritsuko said it was sterilized. Some sort of new radiation process."  
“律子说它已经被消毒了。某种新的辐射过程。”

"I see." “我懂了。”

Misato pursed her lips. " 'I see' again? Nothing else to say? Hey," she pressed, her voice becoming serious again, "I haven't talked to Shinji since the day of the transplant. How's he doing?"  
美里抿起嘴唇。 “又‘我明白了’？没什么可说的？嘿，”她追问，声音又变得严肃起来，“自从移植那天起我就没有和真嗣说过话了。他怎么样？”

"Fine…just fine." “好吧……就好了。”

Misato closed her eyes. "I'm glad…"  
美里闭上了眼睛。 “我很高兴…”

Kaji watched her apprehensively for any signs of suspicion. There were none—she had believed him. The doctors had jointly decided that it would not be a good idea to inform her of Shinji's death while her own life was in such jeopardy, but it was a secret that could not be kept forever. He lowered his head and looked away, reliving memories that he would rather have not occurred at all.  
加治警惕地看着她，寻找任何可疑的迹象。没有——她相信他。医生们一致认为，在她自己的生命处于如此危险的情况下，告诉她真嗣的死讯并不是一个好主意，但这是一个不能永远保守的秘密。他低下头，移开视线，重温那些他宁愿根本不发生的记忆。

Two days after the foiled transplant that ended his life, Shinji Ikari was laid to rest beside his mother. Almost all of Shinji's class had attended the simple funeral, led by Hikari, whose face was streaked with tears as she slowly made her way toward him. Rei was there as well, standing a short distance off from her classmates. She did not cry, but the pain in her red eyes remained a fresh image in Kaji's mind; beside her had been Kensuke, pushing the wheelchair of his best friend. Touji had gestured impatiently for him to stop a short distance from Shinji's casket. Bit by bit, he inched over to Shinji's side on his new prosthetics—the first steps he had taken since the day his Eva had been forcibly crushed. Ritsuko stood alone uncomfortably for a good part of the ceremony, but was later joined by Maya, who sobbed quietly through the rest. Asuka had refused to attend, choosing instead to grieve alone.  
移植失败并结束了他的生命两天后，碇真司被安葬在他母亲身边。真嗣班上几乎所有同学都参加了这场简单的葬礼，由光带领，她的脸上挂着泪痕，慢慢地走向他。丽也在那里，站在离同学不远的地方。她没有哭，但她红红的眼睛里的痛苦却在加持的脑海中历历在目。她旁边是健介，推着他最好朋友的轮椅。东次不耐烦地示意他停在离真嗣的棺材不远的地方。他戴着新假肢一点一点地挪到真嗣身边——自从他的伊娃被强行压碎那天以来，这是他迈出的第一步。在仪式的大部分时间里，律子都不安地独自站着，但后来玛雅也加入了进来，在剩下的时间里，玛雅静静地抽泣着。明日香拒绝出席，而是选择独自悲伤。

Also absent was the doctor who had coordinated the entire transplant. Namika Ishiyama had been promptly fired by The Commander himself on March 27. The actual circumstances were rather sketchy; all they knew was that she had disappeared after leaving behind three lengthy notes—one to her assistant, one to Ritsuko, and one to Misato. Neither Ritsuko nor her assistant had shown their messages to Kaji, and the third was being kept for Misato's eyes only. The Major did not know why her doctor and old college friend had not come to see her for four days; she had simply been told that Dr. Ishiyama was unavailable and was sending her best wishes.  
协调整个移植手术的医生也缺席。石山纳米香于3月27日被指挥官本人立即解雇。实际情况相当粗略；他们只知道她在留下三张长纸条后就消失了——一张给她的助手，一张给律子，一张给美里。律子和她的助手都没有向加持展示她们的信息，第三条信息只留给美里看。少校不知道为什么她的医生和老大学朋友已经四天没有来看望她了。她只是被告知石山博士不在，只是向她致以最美好的祝愿。

Now the medical team's foremost focus was on NERV's own Major Katsuragi's recovery. Although exhausted and weak from the chemotherapy and multitude of drugs she was being given to prevent rejection and suppress infection, she claimed to be feeling better; looking at her today, Kaji would have had to agree. Nevertheless, there were still no fruits, vegetables, or flowers allowed in her room, and the hospital continued to maintain very stringent policies on who could and couldn't enter her room. He had heard through the NERV grapevine that both Ritsuko and Rei had visited; both had been told not to disclose any "excess information"—the code words for Shinji's death. For now, she accepted without question the fact that Shinji, like herself, was recovering and would not be able to visit her for some days.  
现在医疗队的首要任务就是NERV自己的葛城少校的康复情况。尽管由于化疗和服用多种药物来预防排斥反应和抑制感染，她已经筋疲力尽、虚弱不堪，但她声称感觉好多了。看看今天的她，梶也不得不同意。尽管如此，她的房间仍然不允许携带水果、蔬菜或鲜花，医院对谁可以或不能进入她的房间仍然保持着非常严格的政策。他通过 NERV 的小道消息听说律子和丽都来过；两人都被告知不要透露任何“多余信息”——真嗣之死的暗语。现在，她毫无疑问地接受了这样一个事实：真嗣和她自己一样，正在康复中，并且在几天之内无法探望她。

"I'm so tired," Misato muttered, her eyes still closed.  
“我好累。”美里嘟哝着，眼睛仍然闭着。

Kaji sat with her until she was asleep again, smoothing aside the tendrils of red hair that framed her face. He couldn't wait until her own dark hair was long again. He'd ask her never to cut it again.  
加持坐在她身边，直到她再次入睡，并抚平她脸上的红发卷须。他等不及她自己的黑发又长起来了。他会要求她永远不要再剪它了。

---

Asuka watched the man she had once loved pass through the tiny window in her closed door. He didn't look at her, as he didn't know which room she was in. Her fingers tightened around the SDAT until she forcefully pried them away, afraid that she would break the mechanism.  
明日香看着她曾经爱过的男人穿过她紧闭的门上的小窗户。他没有看她，因为他不知道她在哪个房间。她的手指紧紧地握住SDAT，直到她用力将它们撬开，生怕她会破坏机械装置。

He'd asked her to hold on to it for him until he was out of the hospital.  
他请她帮他保留它，直到他出院。

She had considered giving it to Kaji to bury with him, but decided instead in an act of selfishness to keep it.  
她曾考虑过把它送给加持一起埋葬，但出于自私，她决定保留它。

The sweet soprano of the girl's voice filled her ears.  
耳边充满了少女甜美的女高音。

She hadn't gone to his funeral. She didn't have anything to say to him or to anyone. Maybe later. Maybe sometime in the future. The far-off future.  
她没有去参加他的葬礼。她没有什么话要对他或任何人说。也许以后吧。也许在未来的某个时候。遥远的未来。

She wondered briefly what had happened to the food she and Rei had prepared. She recalled without emotion that night that they had sat in Rei's apartment and shared dinner on her bed. She recalled the feeling of crisp crust on her fingertips, of smooth ceramic plates balanced in her lap, of tender asparagus spears giving way under her fork.  
她短暂地想知道她和丽准备的食物去了哪里。她平静地回忆起那天晚上他们坐在丽的公寓里，在她的床上共进晚餐。她回忆起指尖上酥脆的外皮的感觉、膝盖上平衡的光滑陶瓷盘的感觉、叉子下嫩嫩的芦笋矛的感觉。

She listened as the tape came to an end.  
当磁带结束时，她听着。

---

They waited, each day hurrying to the hospital to mark her daily white blood cell count—cheering when it went up, consoling one another when it went down. Then, finally, there came a happy day in late April when the flowers were blooming, her cell count had maintained itself for some time above 1000, and Misato was officially discharged from the hospital.  
他们等待着，每天赶往医院记录她每天的白细胞计数——当白细胞计数上升时欢呼，当下降时互相安慰。然后，终于在四月下旬迎来了鲜花盛开的幸福日子，她的细胞计数在一段时间内保持在1000以上，美里正式出院了。

She had been permitted out of her room a few times in the last week, usually for only a short walk down the hallway, but today she was going home. Home today meant not the usual disheveled Katsuragi apartment, but Kaji's house instead, where she would stay for an undetermined amount of time. Ritsuko and Maya had been over and hand-scrubbed the entire house over, then proceeded to throw out all the beer they could find. She was looking forward to seeing his serene watermelon patches again, away from the traffic and congestion of the urban Tokyo-3.  
上周她被允许离开她的房间几次，通常只是沿着走廊走一小段路，但今天她要回家了。今天的家不是通常那种凌乱的葛城公寓，而是加持的家，她将在那里待上一段不确定的时间。律子和玛雅已经结束了，用手擦洗了整个房子，然后扔掉了他们能找到的所有啤酒。她期待着再次看到他那片宁静的西瓜田，远离东京第三大城市的交通和拥堵。

They had bought her a new outfit for this occasion, a simple sleeveless cotton dress with a matching hairtie. A nurse helped her to fasten back the red curls of her wig with it, but she slipped into the dress herself. It was nice to wear something other than a hospital gown for once, and she planned to dump the wig before long, too—already Kaji had discovered fresh hair sprouting anew from her head.  
他们为这个场合给她买了一套新衣服，一件简单的无袖棉质连衣裙，配上配套的发带。一名护士帮她把假发上的红色卷发固定在后面，但她自己穿上了裙子。能穿一次病号服以外的衣服真是太好了，她也打算不久之后就把假发扔掉——卡吉已经发现她的头上又长出了新的头发。

"You look lovely," the nurse told her.  
“你看起来很可爱，”护士告诉她。

"Thank you," Misato replied.  
“谢谢你。”美里回答道。

She left her bedroom with a cheery wave, pleased to be rid of it—she brought nothing out of it except for her cell phone (the lamp had been carefully packaged and taken home already by Ritsuko). The nurse waved to her and turned back to stripping the sheets and laying on new ones for the next patient. Misato felt a twinge of pity for whomever would be staying there next, but let that feeling dissipate as she half-walked, half-ran to the elevators.  
她高兴地挥手离开了卧室，很高兴能摆脱它——除了手机之外，她什么也没带出来（灯已经被律子仔细地包装好并带回家了）。护士向她挥手，然后转身剥去床单，为下一个病人换上新的床单。美里对下一个住在那里的人感到一阵怜悯，但当她半走半跑地走向电梯时，这种感觉就消失了。

They were waiting for her when she came out of the lobby; Kaji was carrying real flowers, and Ritsuko hurried forward to take pictures of her. Rei waited off to the side, carrying a large bouquet of colored balloons. Misato came down the stairs into the warm sunlight smiling, laughing, and finally crying as she landed in Kaji's arms.  
当她走出大厅时，他们正在等她。梶拿着真花，律子赶紧上前给她拍照。雷拿着一大束彩色气球在一旁等着。美里走下楼梯，沐浴在温暖的阳光下，微笑着，大笑着，最后落在加持的怀里，哭了。

"Welcome back," he whispered. Misato took the flowers from him and inhaled their soft scent. She hugged Rei, who handed her the balloons without speaking, and thanked her for everything.  
“欢迎回来，”他低声说道。美里接过他手中的花，闻着它们柔和的香味。她拥抱了雷，雷伊一言不发地将气球递给她，并感谢她所做的一切。

"And you, Ritsuko," she added.  
“还有你，律子，”她补充道。

The blonde doctor smiled and looped an arm over her shoulders. They needed no words to express their relief.  
金发医生微笑着，将一只手臂搭在她的肩膀上。他们不需要言语来表达他们的宽慰。

"Ritsuko's brought over all the medication you'll need—_and_ she cleaned out my house from top to bottom, so we're all ready for you," Kaji informed her.  
“律子已经把你需要的所有药物都带来了——她把我的房子从上到下清理干净了，所以我们已经为你做好了准备，”梶告诉她。

"I want a watermelon," Misato demanded.  
“我想要一个西瓜，”美里要求道。

"It's too early for watermelons. You can have a watermelon flower instead."  
“现在吃西瓜还太早了，你可以吃一朵西瓜花来代替。”

"But no beer," Ritsuko cautioned.  
“但是不能喝啤酒，”律子警告道。

All three of them escorted Misato to Kaji's car, where she slid into the passenger seat and fastened her seat belt, then let her balloons float free in the backseat.  
他们三人护送美里到梶的车上，她坐进乘客座位并系好安全带，然后让她的气球在后座上自由漂浮。

"You realize that I won't be able to look in the rearview mirror if you do that," Kaji warned. He turned the keys in the ignition. "But then again, you've never used yours, and you always lived to tell the tale."  
“你知道，如果你这样做，我将无法看后视镜，”卡吉警告说。他转动钥匙点火。 “但话又说回来，你从来没有用过你的，而且你总是活着讲述这个故事。”

"I use it," she protested.  
“我用它，”她抗议道。

"Not the way it's intended to be used," he countered. They backed out of the parking lot, waving and calling to Rei and Ritsuko. "The rearview mirror was not intended so that one could apply makeup and keep the occupants of the backseat from fighting."  
“这不是它的预期用途，”他反驳道。他们从停车场倒出来，向丽和律子挥手并喊道。 “后视镜的目的不是为了让人们化妆并防止后座的乘客打架。”

"Very true. All right, all right, I concede," she acknowledged with a knowing smile.  
“非常正确。好吧，好吧，我承认，”她带着会心的微笑承认道。

Kaji wove his car in and out of traffic while Misato was content with simply admiring the scenery of Tokyo-3 after having seen nothing but the small garden outside her hospital room for months. She touched her hand to her neck, finding first the cross, then the rose. The glass rose he'd given her. The same one he'd given to another girl.  
梶治的车在车流中穿行，而美里在几个月来只看到病房外的小花园之后，只满足于简单地欣赏第三东京的风景。她把手放在脖子上，首先找到了十字架，然后找到了玫瑰。他送给她的玻璃玫瑰。和他送给另一个女孩的一样。

"Hey," she said quietly, breaking the silence, "how's Asuka doing?"  
“嘿，”她轻声说道，打破了沉默，“明日香怎么样了？”

"She's staying at your apartment for now. It was decided that I could probably do a better job of taking care of you than she could."  
“她现在住在你的公寓里。我们决定，我可能会比她更好地照顾你。”

"I see." “我懂了。”

Kaji attempted a joke. "It was all actually because Ritsuko decided it would take too long to sterilize your apartment after you've been letting all that mold and fungus grow for years."  
梶尝试开个玩笑。 “这实际上是因为律子认为在你让霉菌和真菌生长多年后，对你的公寓进行消毒需要太长时间。”

She slapped him lightly. 她轻轻地打了他一巴掌。

He pulled up into his driveway.  
他把车停进车道。

"We're home." “我们到家了。”

Author's note: I hope you didn't see that coming, although there was a very subtle hint in the last chapter, perhaps a bit too subtle (I seem to have a habit of making my hints too hard). This was the original ending I came up with when I first planned this story over a year ago, and it's perhaps the only thing that hasn't evolved as the story developed.  
作者注：我希望你没有看到这一点，尽管在最后一章中有一个非常微妙的暗示，也许有点太微妙了（我似乎有一个习惯，让我的暗示太难）。这是我一年多前第一次策划这个故事时想到的最初结局，这可能是唯一没有随着故事发展而演变的事情。

Just a short epilogue to follow…  
接下来只是一个简短的尾声……

### Chapter 8: aftermath
后果

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

The name left her dead lips as a whisper.  
这个名字从她死气沉沉的嘴唇上留下，如同低语。

The shiny wrapping paper crackled in her hands as she sank to her knees, feeling the warmth of the packed soil seep through the thin fabric of her skirt. Her shadow covered a good part of his tombstone, and she quickly moved a few inches aside. He'd spent enough time in darkness while he was alive. Misato leaned forward just enough to place the bouquet of day lilies at the head of the grave.  
当她跪倒在地时，闪亮的包装纸在她手中发出噼啪声，感觉到包装的土壤的温暖渗透到她薄薄的裙子上。她的影子遮住了他墓碑的一大半，她赶紧往旁边挪了几寸。他活着的时候已经在黑暗中度过了足够多的时间。美里向前倾身，刚好将那束黄花菜放在坟墓的顶端。

There was too much to say and she didn't know how to say any of it. Her thoughts drifted to Asuka.  
有太多的话要说，但她又不知道该怎么说。她的思绪飘到了明日香身上。

_I don't hate you,_ _Misato__... but please, just understand that it's too hard for me to see you right now._  
我不恨你，美里……但是请你理解，现在见到你对我来说太难了。

And Misato had responded brokenly, "I understand."  
美里断断续续地回答道：“我明白了。”

No, she didn't really understand, now that she thought about it. There was so much that she didn't understand. Why she, of all people, had been the only one to survive the Katsuragi expedition. Why the fate of mankind lay in the hands of a group of fourteen-year-olds. Why Shinji had to die so that she could live.  
不，现在想想，她还不太明白。有太多的事情让她无法理解。为什么她是所有人中唯一在葛城探险中幸存下来的人。为什么人类的命运掌握在一群十四岁的孩子手中。为什么真嗣必须死才能活下去。

The remaining doctors at NERV, though not nearly as skilled as Namika, had given her an excellent prognosis. Her cell count had reached safe levels and had remained for several months now. The effects of chemotherapy were wearing off; her deep purple hair was slowly regenerating, and beer tasted like beer again (at least the few sips that she had been permitted did). There had been several beautiful nights in which Misato and Kaji sat in his backyard on old logs and ate freshly sliced watermelon without a thought about cancer and death.  
NERV 剩下的医生虽然技术不如纳米卡，但给了她很好的预后。她的细胞计数已达到安全水平，并已保持数月之久。化疗的效果逐渐减弱；她深紫色的头发正在慢慢再生，啤酒的味道又像啤酒了（至少她被允许喝的那几口是这样的）。有几个美好的夜晚，美里和梶坐在自家后院的旧木头上，吃着刚切好的西瓜，没有想到癌症和死亡。

Kaji had asked her to marry him and she had said yes without hesitation. Though they were now legally man and wife, the wedding ceremony had been postponed indefinitely. Perhaps they would never have one; nevertheless, now was certainly not the time.  
加治向她求婚，她毫不犹豫地答应了。尽管他们现在是合法的夫妻，但婚礼却无限期推迟了。也许他们永远不会拥有一个；尽管如此，现在肯定还不是时候。

As for Namika, no one knew where she was or what had happened to her. Misato pictured her as a Shinto nun in the mountains. She smiled humorlessly to herself.  
至于纳米卡，没有人知道她在哪里，也没有人知道她发生了什么事。美里把她想象成山里的神道尼姑。她毫无幽默感地对自己笑了笑。

Her gaze traveled slowly to the marker beside Shinji's, the one that bore the name Yui Ikari. His mother. It occurred to her that over the last year she had come to think of herself as a sort of motherly figure to him.  
她的目光缓缓移到真嗣旁边的记号笔上，那个记号笔上写着碇唯的名字。他的母亲。她突然意识到，在过去的一年里，她开始将自己视为他的母亲般的人物。

_I failed,_ she thought, a grim aura caressing her features. _I failed to protect him. I didn't really have any right to think of myself as his mother_.  
我失败了，她想，一种严峻的气氛抚摸着她的脸。我没能保护他。我真的没有任何权利将自己视为他的母亲。

"Sorry," she whispered to the boy and his mother.  
“对不起，”她低声对男孩和他的母亲说。

How long had it been since his funeral now? Misato counted the months. She'd been discharged in April. It was now mid-August, a blistering Tokyo-3 August where the rays of the sun beat down mercilessly on the city's inhabitants. He was buried at the end of March.  
距离他的葬礼已经过去多久了？美里数着月份。她于四月出院。现在是八月中旬，东京八月三日酷热难当，阳光无情地照射在这座城市的居民身上。他于三月底被安葬。

Four months. 四个月。

Misato suddenly felt very old, so old that her body could no longer bear her weight. She fell forwards onto the parched soil, her head clashing with the bouquet of lilies. The paper crinkled under the weight and a stem broke.  
美里突然觉得自己很老，老到身体已经无法承受自己的重量了。她向前倒在干涸的土地上，头撞到了那束百合花。纸张在重压下起皱，茎折断了。

"_Why?_" “为什么？”

She relived the events of the year, beginning with the initial onset of symptoms in the summer heat. She remembered the crushing shock of being told of her diagnosis, the brutal onslaught of chemotherapy drugs, the low days when she had almost lost the will to live. She remembered learning that Shinji had the power to save her life. And she remembered, painfully clearly, that he had died trying to achieve that very goal.  
她重温了这一年的事件，从夏季炎热时最初出现的症状开始。她记得被告知自己的诊断结果时的巨大震惊，化疗药物的残酷攻击，以及她几乎失去生存意志的低落日子。她记得得知真嗣有能力拯救她的生命。她痛苦地清楚地记得，他为了实现这个目标而死了。

She regretted the times she'd yelled at him. She regretted not protecting him against the exploits of The Commander.  
她后悔自己曾经对他大喊大叫。她后悔没有保护他免受指挥官的侵害。

_The Commander…_ her thoughts shifted direction. Kaji had mentioned that he had not attended his own son's funeral. Misato thought back to the time that Shinji had been so preoccupied about visiting his mother's grave with his father. She imagined his father visiting alone with two bouquets of flowers, one for each grave.  
指挥官……她的思绪转移了方向。加治提到他没有参加自己儿子的葬礼。美里回想起当时真嗣正全神贯注地和父亲一起去给母亲扫墓。她想象着他的父亲带着两束鲜花独自拜访，每个坟墓一束。

She reached up to touch the smooth granite surface of the tombstone. Her sensitive fingertips found the numbers that recorded Shinji's date of birth and date of death. There was a tiny overlap between his date of birth and his mother's date of death. That, she thought sadly, must have been the happiest year of his life.  
她伸手触摸墓碑光滑的花岗岩表面。她敏感的指尖找到了记录真嗣出生日期和死亡日期的数字。他的出生日期和他母亲的死亡日期之间有一点重叠。她悲伤地想，那一定是他一生中最快乐的一年。

Had he been happy living with her, overshadowed by Asuka, challenged by Touji, pressured by Kensuke? Would it have been better if he had stayed with his teacher away from Tokyo-3—if he had never learned to pilot an Eva and been sent repeatedly into battle?  
他和她一起生活是否幸福，受到明日香的影响，受到东司的挑战，受到健介的压力？如果他和老师一起远离第三东京——如果他从未学会驾驶 Eva 并多次被派往战场，会不会更好？

She hoped he had been happy, at least for a little while.  
她希望他能幸福，至少有一段时间。

It took Misato some time to gather the energy and mental strength to lift herself up again. She felt awkward upon leaving, as if she ought to say something… but there was nothing to say. She settled for a nod and a wistful smile before heading towards the parking lot.  
美里花了一些时间才聚集起能量和精神力，才重新站起来。离开的时候她感觉很尴尬，似乎应该说点什么……但又无话可说。她点点头，露出渴望的微笑，然后朝停车场走去。

"You didn't have to come with me, you know. I wouldn't have made you."  
“你不必跟我一起来，你知道。我不会强迫你的。”

She glared at his tombstone with defiance, squeezing the branch tightly in her hands. She'd torn it roughly off of the tree earlier and consequently hadn't made a clean break; there were splinters of wood and bark sticking out in every direction.  
她挑衅地瞪着他的墓碑，手里紧紧地握着树枝。她早些时候把它从树上粗暴地撕下来，因此没有彻底撕下来；到处都是木头和树皮的碎片。

"I'm staying at Misato's now," she told him, her voice calming now, "but that's only temporary. I'm going back to Berlin as soon as possible, so…"  
“我现在住在美里家，”她告诉他，她的声音现在平静下来，“但这只是暂时的。我要尽快返回柏林，所以……”

Her voice quavered, and she had to stop to regain control.  
她的声音有些颤抖，她必须停下来才能恢复控制。

"…so I won't be seeing you again."  
“……所以我不会再见到你了。”

She threw her head back and sniffled hard before continuing. "Maybe I'll go back to school and get another degree. I think I'd like to study engineering. Or maybe chemistry."  
她把头向后仰，用力吸了吸鼻子，然后继续说道。 “也许我会回到学校并获得另一个学位。我想我想学习工程学。或者也许是化学。”

A bird twittered overhead.  
一只鸟在头顶上叽叽喳喳地叫着。

Her hair was growing, reaching almost her shoulders now in tousled locks. She drew them into a scattered ponytail with one hand, then let go again. "I wish you were still here to look after Misato. But there's Kaji to do that now—they're getting married, did you know that? After all that bickering, Kaji-kun is getting married. And I won't be here for the wedding.  
她的头发越来越长，凌乱的头发几乎齐肩了。她用一只手将它们扎成散乱的马尾辫，然后又松开。 “我希望你还在这里照顾美里。但是现在加持要做这件事——他们要结婚了，你知道吗？经过那么多争吵，加持君要结婚了。而我不会在这里。”为婚礼。

"I'll be okay on my own in Germany. Hikari's promised to visit me once she finishes school."  
“我一个人在德国会没事的。Hikari 答应她完成学业后会来看我。”

She paused, realizing that she was talking more to herself than him. _Him_. In that moment, his silence reminded her of the First Child, whom she had not seen nor spoken to in weeks. She had spoken to no one in weeks.  
她停顿了一下，意识到自己更多的是自言自语，而不是他。他。在那一刻，他的沉默让她想起了第一个孩子，她已经好几个星期没有见到他，也没有和他说过话了。她已经好几个星期没有跟任何人说过话了。

"I came out of that mold-coated apartment just to speak to you, baka. I hope you feel special."  
“我从那间发霉的公寓出来只是为了和你说话，巴卡。我希望你感到很特别。”

Silence. 安静。

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the SDAT. The tape was at its end, and she listened to its whirring mechanisms while it rewound. When it clicked to a stop, she gently depressed the play button, and listened to the soft tones of her favorite song.  
她把手伸进口袋，掏出SDAT。磁带已经播完，她在倒带时聆听着磁带的嗡嗡声。当它停止时，她轻轻按下播放按钮，聆听她最喜欢的歌曲的柔和音调。

_Du weißt, ich werde immer ehrlich zu dir sein  
你知道我会永远对你诚实_

_Und du weißt, ich bin derjenige  
你知道我就是那个人_

_An den du dich wenden kannst  
您可以联系谁_

_Jederzeit, überall und irgendwo  
随时随地_

_Du weißt, ich werde immer da sein  
你知道我会永远在那里_

Author's Note: I'd like to thank all of you who took the time to read this story, especially those of you who left me so many wonderful reviews—thank you for all of your encouragement and constructive criticism. I apologize again for the lateness of the last three chapters, and I'd especially like to thank joedoebell for reminding me that it desperately needed updating!  
作者注：我要感谢所有花时间阅读这个故事的人，特别是那些给我留下如此多精彩评论的人——感谢你们所有的鼓励和建设性的批评。我再次为最后三章的迟到表示歉意，我特别要感谢 joedoebell 提醒我它迫切需要更新！

I'm not planning to write again for some time. For awhile I had a plan to write a funny fic which would center on Gendo and the "real" reasons why he so deeply disliked his son—he was to be jealous that Shinji got the chance to pilot and he didn't, something along those lines, but the plot (was there ever one?) hasn't developed at all. Perhaps sometime in the future.  
我有一段时间不打算再写了。有一段时间，我计划写一部有趣的小说，以源堂为中心，以及他如此不喜欢他儿子的“真正”原因——他嫉妒真嗣获得了飞行员的机会，而他却没有，类似的事情这些台词，但情节（有过吗？）根本没有发展。也许在未来的某个时候。

It's now 12:23 AM – so I'll leave it here; goodnight, and thank you again!  
现在是中午 12:23 – 所以我把它留在这里；晚安，再次感谢您！
