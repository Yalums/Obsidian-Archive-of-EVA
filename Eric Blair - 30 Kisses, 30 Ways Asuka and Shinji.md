### Chapter 01 Themes: K#10 (#10), W#09 (Oops!)
主题：K#10 (#10)，W#09 (哎呀！)
Title: The Hustle 标题：《奋斗》
A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like. I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly. Ohh...and about the setting, this thing is definitely AU, read further down and you'll see... The whole thing came to my mind as I was watching an old movie "The Hustler" with Paul Newman…man is it cool…
A.N.: 我打算利用这个空间来保护自己：不是我的。我正试图摆脱写作障碍，所以我要同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式融入一个故事。希望你喜欢。如果我仍然受阻，我会更新另一个短篇，否则，期待其他chapter个简短的 10 件事。哦……关于背景设定，这绝对是 AU（平行宇宙），继续往下读你就会明白……这一切都是我在看一部老电影《江湖浪子》时想到的，保罗·纽曼主演……真是酷毙了……
Maybe if I get the inspiration I'll give Shinji a backbone and turn him into Steve McQueen
如果我能获得灵感，或许会让真嗣变得有骨气，把他变成史蒂夫·麦奎因那样的人物
Yeah I'm that old… 是啊，我这么老了……
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
Outside, the wind was howling, sounding like a wild hurt animal, raking leaves and scarves and coats and dresses.
外面，风在呼啸，声音像一头受伤的野兽，卷起落叶、围巾、外套和裙子。
Inside, the bar was almost empty, impregnated with a musky odor, an offending mixture of smoke, ashes and bourbon. The young girl made her way inside, in part to save herself of the cold that was starting to pick up this late in the evening, in part to get herself a drink.
酒吧内几乎空无一人，弥漫着一股麝香味，是烟雾、灰烬和波旁威士忌混合的刺鼻气息。年轻女孩走了进来，一方面是为了躲避夜晚渐起的寒意，另一方面是为了喝上一杯。
This wasn't the first time she had entered this particular establishment; she was a natural born killer, a predator. As she made her way to the bar, he saw the usual couple already there.
这不是她第一次踏入这家店；她天生就是个杀手，一个捕食者。当她走向吧台时，他看到了那对常客已经坐在那里。
The bar man, a man rather older than her, with his hair tied in a messy ponytail at the base of his neck, a 5o'clock shadow adorning his rugged features, and a roguish grin that could just as easily turn from a lady killer smile to an impish smirk was chatting up a mauve haired meter maid, who spent half her time rebutting him (if calling him a callous idiot could count as a rebuttal) and the other half smiling at him when he though he couldn't see her.
酒吧老板比她年长不少，头发在后颈处扎成凌乱的马尾，下巴上留着 5 点钟的胡茬，粗犷的五官上挂着一副浪子般的笑容，这笑容既能瞬间从迷人的微笑转为顽皮的坏笑。他正在与一位紫发女交警调情，后者一半时间在反驳他（如果称他为无情的白痴也算反驳的话），另一半时间则在他以为她看不见时对他微笑。
"Hey Kaji, Hey Misato..." The girl waved happily, surprising both of them. Kaji smiled warmly at her, winking. "Hey Asuka, how ya doing..?" He smiled at them, and the purple haired woman, having caught sight of him smiled and waved.
"嘿，卡吉，嘿，美里……" 女孩开心地挥手，让他们俩都感到惊讶。卡吉对她温暖地微笑，眨了眨眼。"嘿，明日香，最近怎么样？" 他对着他们微笑，那位紫发女子看到他后也微笑着挥手。
"Hey you...long time no see..." She said in a rather loud voice, clashing completely against the somber background of the bar. Asuka simply smiled and made her way to them, greeting both, telling Kaji to give her the College Special and sat on a table next to Misato, next to the pool tables.
"嘿，好久不见……" 她用相当大的声音说道，与酒吧沉闷的背景完全不搭。明日香只是微笑着走向他们，向两人打招呼，让卡吉给她来一份大学特调，然后坐在美里旁边的桌子上，旁边是台球桌。
"Kaji." Asuka smirked, but her eyes were warm. "You still trying to hook up with Misato..?"
"加持。"明日香坏笑道，但她的眼神却很温暖。"你还在试图和美里搭上线吗？"
"Always..." 总是...
"When are you gonna dump her and date me instead..?" Asuka asked, pouting like a little girl denied her favorite toy. Misato stuck her tongue good naturedly at her, making Kaji laugh. He had a hearty, throaty laughter.
"Asuka, I'm not worthy of the honor of dating you..."
"明日香，我配不上与你交往的这份荣耀……"
"You're right..." 你是对的...
"Besides Katsuragi here will always have my heart."
除了这里的葛城，我的心永远属于她。
"Kaji..." The aforementioned Misato swatted his hand away smiling. She gestured to her mug. Kaji wordlessly refilled her mug, placing Asuka's glass in front of her.
"加治……" 如前所述，葛城微笑着拍开了他的手，示意自己的杯子。加治默默地为她续满了杯子，并将明日香的玻璃杯放在她面前。
"You should never let a girl like me stay so long without a drink."
你绝不应该让像我这样的女孩这么久都没喝上一口。
Asuka smiled at that and turned towards the almost empty hall, catching sight of three young men in a table; the tallest one was dressed in a track suit, the one playing against him with sandy blonde hair, freckles and glasses trying to play.
明日香微笑着，转向几乎空荡的大厅，目光落在一张桌子上的三个年轻人身上；其中最高的一位穿着运动服，与他对抗的是一个金发沙色、脸上有雀斑、戴着眼镜的年轻人，正努力尝试着玩。
Trying being the operative word.
尝试是关键动词。
The last one was trying very hard to not be noticed. He was tall, of thin build, somber dark blue eyes, a polite shy smile that never quite reached his face, and the unruly hair which made him look significantly younger.
最后那位正努力不引人注意。他身材瘦高，有着深邃的暗蓝色眼睛，礼貌而羞涩的微笑未曾真正触及面庞，一头凌乱的头发让他看起来年轻许多。
Some would say it even made him look like a choir boy.
有人说这甚至让他看起来像个唱诗班男孩。
Asuka's rather sharp people instincts made an immediate assessment; a little timid, a little shy and prone to weasel his way away from trouble. Always trying to appease the others, choosing the easier way; to run away from his troubles.
明日香的敏锐直觉立刻做出了判断：他有些胆怯，有些害羞，且倾向于巧妙地逃避麻烦。总是试图取悦他人，选择更轻松的方式——逃离自己的困境。
"Hey Kaji..." Asuka asked absentmindedly, sipping at her drink. "Do you think any of those boys is a hustler..?"
"嘿，加持……"明日香心不在焉地啜饮着饮料问道，"你觉得那些男生中有谁是骗子吗……？"
Kaji saw them and shrugged. "Dunno...never seen them..." He motioned to the tallest one with his head. "The uniform is from the college varsity team...my guess..." He finished smirking at her.
加治看到他们，耸了耸肩。“不知道……从没见过他们……”他用头示意了一下最高的那个人。“那制服是大学校队的……我猜的……”他最后对她笑了笑。
"They're pigeons." Asuka smirked at that. "Get me another College Special." She turned to Kaji. "Bring it to the table the second you see me grab the cue."
"那是鸽子。"明日香对此嗤之以鼻。"再给我来一份大学特餐。"她转向卡吉。"你一看到我拿起球杆，就立刻把餐送到桌上来。"
Slowly Asuka made her way to their table.
慢慢地，明日香走向了他们的桌子。
"Hey idiots..." In a single motion she downed her drink and grabbed the cue. "Wanna shoot some pool..?"
"嘿，傻瓜们……" 她一气呵成地喝完了饮料，抓起球杆，"想打几局台球吗？"
"Oops..!" 哎呀..！
Asuka made her way to the bar chuckling to herself. Ignoring the angry yells of Tracksuit demanding his money, insisting she had hustled them. Glasses simply moaned, looking at his thin wallet.
明日香一边暗自窃笑，一边走向酒吧。她无视了运动服男愤怒的叫喊，他坚称她耍了他们，要求还钱。而眼镜男只是哀叹着，望着自己干瘪的钱包。
"Better luck next time chumps…"
下次运气好点吧，蠢货们……
As the three of them made their way out, she felt one of them sizing her up. Dark blue eyes locked against clear ones. No words were exchanged, but She knew a challenge had been made.
当他们三人离开时，她感觉到其中一人在打量她。深蓝色的眼睛与清澈的目光相对。虽然没有言语交流，但她知道一场挑战已经发出。
Bring it on. 放马过来。
The next day after the following found Asuka making her way to Kaji's again. She entered and said hi, and went to sit at the bar.
次日，阿苏卡再次前往加持的住处。她进门打了个招呼，然后走到吧台坐下。
"Good hustle..?" Kaji said as he effortlessly gave her a College Special.
"干得不错..?" 加濑说着，轻松地给了她一份大学特餐。
Asuka simply whistled a happy tune, counting off the bills in front of him. Kaji chuckled at that.
明日香只是吹着欢快的口哨，在他面前数着钞票。加持对此轻声笑了笑。
"I've never seen you work it…" He began conversationally.
"我从未见过你操作它……" 他以闲聊的口吻开始说道。
"What about last Tuesday..?" She asked.
"那上个星期二呢？" 她问道。
"That was a lightweight…" Kaji smirked. "I want to see you work it for real…"
那只是轻量级的……”卡吉冷笑道，“我想看你真正操作它……”
"Maybe someday Kaji…" 或许有一天，卡吉……
"Well…" Kaji sighed, walking towards the back of the bar, grabbing a bottle from where they all were. "Some one's here to see you…" He said, motioning to her back.
"嗯……" 卡吉叹了口气，走向酒吧后面，从那里拿起一瓶酒。"有人来找你了……" 他说着，向她的背后示意。
Frowning she turned and came face to face with blue eyes.
她皱着眉头转身，迎面撞上了那双蓝眼睛。
"Hey." 嘿。
Asuka smiled at him.
明日香对他微笑。
"Hey." 嘿。
Blue eyes stuttered. "U-uhmm…do you play professionally..?"
蓝眼睛结巴着说：“呃……你是职业选手吗……？”
"No, I just spend my days here." She said leaning on her elbows against the railing, showing of her figure, enjoying how he blushed and looked away.
"不，我就在这儿消磨时光。" 她肘撑栏杆，身姿尽显，欣赏着他脸红转头的模样。
"I'm a college girl. Two days a week - Tuesdays and Thursdays - I go to college."
我是一名大学生。每周两天——周二和周四——我去上学。
"You don't look like a college girl."
你看起来不像个大学生。
"I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated."
我是那种真正自由的人，非常自由。
He paled. "No, I didn't mean that..." He said quickly seeing Asuka's lips turn down with a scowl. "I mean you just look very young."
他脸色一白，急忙说道：“不，我不是那个意思……”看到明日香皱起眉头，嘴唇下垂，他赶紧补充：“我是说你看起来很年轻。”
"Well…" Asuka said smiling; a girl always loved it when they told her she appeared younger than what she really was. "I'm not."
"嗯……" 明日香微笑着说；女孩们总是喜欢听别人说她看起来比实际年龄更年轻。"我不是。"
"So I see..." Shinji said reflexively. "So why go to college..?"
"所以我是这么想的……" 真嗣不自觉地说道，"那为什么要上大学呢……？"
"Got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
周二和周四无事可做。
"What do you do on the other days..?"
"在其他日子里你都做些什么呢？"
"I drink..." She said, taking her glass with nimble fingers and downing it in one gulp. "And I shoot pool."
"我喝酒……" 她说着，用灵巧的手指拿起酒杯，一饮而尽。"我还打台球。"
Not caring for his answer, she turned towards Kaji, grumbling when she caught sight of him chatting Misato again. Sighing, she turned and looked at the kid, still standing there in front of her. Not paying him any attention, she made her way to her favorite table, racking the balls and making her move.
她并不在意他的回答，转身面向卡吉，一看到他又在和美里聊天就嘟囔起来。叹了口气，她转头看向那个孩子，他依旧站在她面前。她没理会他，径直走向自己最喜欢的桌子，摆好球并开始行动。
Crack. 裂缝。
A glorious sound, an unmistakable sound, and for one of them, the sound that would become the beginning of the end.
一种辉煌的声音，一种不容置疑的声音，对其中一人而言，这声音将成为终结的开始。
As Asuka circled the table she was aware of blue eyes.
当明日香绕着桌子走时，她察觉到了那双蓝眼睛。
"What's your name..?" He said in slow, modulated tones.
"你叫什么名字？" 他以缓慢而有节奏的语调问道。
"Asuka, Asuka Langley Sohryu." She finished curtly.
“明日香，明日香·兰格雷·惣流。”她简短地回答道。
"I'm Shinji...Shinji…" Before he could say his last name, Asuka cut him off.
“我是真嗣……真嗣……”在他还没来得及说出自己的姓氏之前，明日香打断了他。
Again. 再来一次。
"Nice to meet you." Asuka said with a sweet smile and saccharine tone, only to let her smile settle in a scowl and emit a low growl. "Now move. You're next to my table."
"很高兴见到你。" 明日香带着甜美的微笑和甜腻的语气说道，随即笑容凝固成皱眉，发出低沉的咆哮。"现在让开，你挡到我的桌子了。"
She circled around him and made her shoots in a deliberately show off way. In time she came again against him.
她绕着他转圈，故意以炫耀的方式拍摄。不久，她再次与他相遇。
"Hey idiot." She said in an impossible sweet, sweet, voice.
"嘿，傻瓜。" 她用一种甜得不可思议的声音说道。
"Move it, you blocking my shot."
挪一下，你挡住我的镜头了。
She pushed him away with her body, making him stumble against the bar.
她用身体将他推开，使他踉跄地撞到了吧台。
"I'm not doing anything." He said defensively.
"我什么也没做。" 他辩解道。
"I'm shooting pool, idiot. You're not allowed to do nothing when I'm shooting pool."
我在打台球，傻瓜。我打台球的时候，你不许闲着。
Before she could continue, Shinji withdrew something from within his coat.
在她继续之前，真嗣从他的外套里掏出了某样东西。
"Do you like to gamble, Asuka..?" He said in a serious voice. "Gamble money on pool games..?"
"你喜欢赌博吗，明日香..?" 他用严肃的语气问道。"在台球游戏上赌钱..?"
Her demeanor changed when she saw Shinji roll out a thick was of bills from his coat pocket and place it on his table.
当她看到真嗣从外套口袋里掏出一叠厚厚的钞票，并将其放在桌上时，她的态度发生了变化。
"Listen idiot..." She began in a tired voice. "I just hustled some poor salaryman of his hard earned money." She placed the cue on the table and turned to him, crossing her arms under her breast, pushing them up and together.
"听着，蠢货……" 她用疲惫的声音开口道，"我刚从某个可怜的上班族那里骗走了他辛苦赚来的钱。" 她把球杆放在桌上，转身面向他，双臂交叉在胸前，将胸部挤得更加突出。
"Do you think I'll blink twice before taking your money…Preppy..?"
你以为我会在拿你钱之前眨两次眼吗…预科生…？
Shinji immediately recognized her for what she was. Asuka was a hustler; a girl who made her living duping people, taking their money, betting against them, making them play their best, as she took dive after dive, only to do a last call; an all-in bet at the end, pulling all the stops to win.
真嗣立刻认出了她的真面目。明日香是个骗子；一个靠欺骗他人、夺取钱财、与人对赌、诱使他们全力以赴，而她则一次又一次地假装失败，只为最后一刻的全押；在终局时全力以赴，不择手段地取胜的女孩。
"So..." He continued. "You any good..?"
“所以……”他接着说，“你擅长吗？”
The familiar smirk in Asuka's face was back with force. "I'm the best you ever seen, idiot..." She said, pointing arrogantly to herself. "I'm the best there is. And even if you beat me, I'm still the best."
明日香脸上那熟悉的嘲讽笑容又回来了，她带着一股力量说道：“我是你见过的最棒的，傻瓜……”她傲慢地指着自己，“我就是最顶尖的。就算你赢了我，我依然是最棒的。”
Shinji flipped the wad on the table.
真嗣将一叠东西翻倒在桌上。
"Prove it." 证明它。
Asuka scratched the back of her neck, smiling. "It's your funeral, idiot."
明日香挠了挠后颈，笑着说：“这是你的葬礼，傻瓜。”
"I don't believe it…" 我不相信……
"I'm sorry…" 对不起…
"How did you do it..?" Asuka asked shocked, once Shinji straightened up after sinking the last ball on the pocket. Shinji simply picked up the money in silence and shrugged.
"你怎么做到的..?" 阿苏卡震惊地问道，当真嗣在将最后一球打入袋中后挺直身子时。真嗣只是默默地拿起钱，耸了耸肩。
"Just lucky I guess…"
“可能只是运气好吧……”
Asuka scoffed at that. "Beginners luck..."
明日香对此嗤之以鼻。“新手的好运罢了……”
Shinji stood there, staring directly at her. "Asuka…" Shinji began but was cut of by her.
真嗣站在那里，直直地盯着她。“明日香……”真嗣刚开口，却被她打断了。
"Is it alright if I get personal..?"
"我谈点私人的事情可以吗？"
"I-I guess… " Shinji said shuffling his feet. Asuka crossed her arms and looking at him petulantly.
"Shinji…you're a born loser."
"真嗣……你天生就是个失败者。"
He stood there, shocked at what she heard. "B-but I…won…"
他站在那里，对她所听到的消息感到震惊。“但……但是我赢了……”
"What the hell is that supposed to mean..?"
那到底是什么意思啊？
Shinji frowned. "Uh…W-well, I did win and…" he began, changing slightly, standing straighter, his shoulders not as slumped as before, and somehow, he reminded Asuka in some way of Kaji.
真嗣皱了皱眉。“呃…嗯，我确实赢了，而且…”他开始说道，语气稍有变化，站得更直了，肩膀也不像之前那样耷拉着，不知怎的，他让明日香在某种程度上想起了加持。
"Listen Shinji, this was the first time in years I was ever hooked... really hooked." Asuka said, grabbing her cue, unscrewing the top half to put it away.
听着，真嗣，这是我多年来第一次真正着迷……真的着迷了。"明日香说着，拿起她的球杆，拧开上半部分准备收起来。
"…But you let me off. You let me off easy, Shinji."
……但你放过了我。你轻易地放过了我，真嗣。
Shinji stood there, not knowing what to say to the strange red head in front of him.
真嗣站在那里，不知道该对面前这个奇怪的红发人说些什么。
"I told you; you got lucky. "
我告诉过你，你很幸运。
"Sure… I got lucky." Shinji said, waving his hand in the air.
"当然…我运气不错。" 真嗣说着，在空中挥了挥手。
"You have the best excuse in the world for losing…" Asuka continued, picking up the balls, juggling them with ease.
"你拥有世界上最好的输球借口……" 明日香继续说着，一边轻松地捡起球，熟练地抛接着。
"No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. Winning... that can be heavy on your back, too, like a stone." She punctuated the sentence by making the balls come back to him into the rack, aligning them perfectly, still juggling 3 balls; number 8, number 1, number 15 and number 10.
当你有个好借口时，输掉比赛并不麻烦。而赢，那也会像背负重石一样压在你背上。她通过让球回到他的球杆架上，完美地排列它们，同时还在耍弄着 3 个球；8 号、1 号、15 号和 10 号，以此强调了这句话。
"You'll drop that stone too when you get an excuse." She let number 1 fall in it's place, followed by 15, juggling numbers 8 and 10 still.
"你也会找个借口放下那块石头的。" 她让 1 号石头落回原位，接着是 15 号，同时还在抛接着 8 号和 10 号石头。
"All you have to do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. One of the best indoor sports is feeling sorry for yourself. A sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers."
你所需要做的就是学会自怜。自怜是最佳的室内运动之一，这项运动人人皆宜，尤其是那些天生的失败者。
She finished placing number 10 on the rack.
她完成了将 10 号放置在架子上的工作。
"Thanks for the game." Shinji said as he picked his winnings and made his way to the door.
"谢谢游戏。" 新治说着，拿起赢来的钱，向门口走去。
Asuka watched him walk away before snorting. "Ok…" She said, making Shinji stop and turn at her.
明日香看着他走远后，不屑地哼了一声。“好吧…”她说道，让真嗣停下脚步，转身面向她。
"You won…but you owe me…you owe me a rematch…"
你赢了……但你欠我……你欠我一场复赛……
Shinji looked at her, not knowing where she was going with that. "What do you mean I owe you..?"
真嗣看着她，不知道她这话是什么意思。“你说的我欠你什么……？”
"One last game…winner takes all…"
最后一局……赢家通吃……
"You don't have anything left to bet…" Shinji pointed out, not looking at her.
"你已经没有什么可以下注的了……" 真嗣指出，并没有看向她。
"Wrong…" Asuka said as she closed the distance between them, facing him. "I bet myself…."
"错了…" 明日香一边说着，一边拉近了与他的距离，面对着他。"我打赌自己…."
"Huh..?" "嗯..?"
"If I win, I get the money back…"
如果我赢了，我会把钱拿回来……
"And if I win..?"
如果我赢了呢？
"Not gonna happen…" She crossed her arms arrogantly. "But if by some freak chance you managed to win, or I managed to lose, I'll let you do whatever you want with me…"
"不会发生的……"她傲慢地交叉双臂，"但如果真有什么离奇的机会让你赢了，或者我输了，我就任你处置……"
"Wha…but I…" "什…但是…我…"
"C'mon…admit it Shinji…" Asuka continued, circling him, sizing him. "I could tell ever since you saw me that you wanted me. So I'll give you a shot."
“来吧…承认吧，真嗣…”明日香继续说着，绕着他转，打量着他。“从你看到我的那一刻起，我就知道你对我有意思。所以，我给你个机会。”
Shinji stood there, not knowing what to say, letting the silence drip in.
真嗣站在那里，不知该说什么好，任由沉默渗透。
"Ok…let's do it." 好的……我们开始吧。
Silently they raked the balls again. And Shinji allowed Asuka have first crack.
他们默默地重新摆好球，而真嗣让明日香先开球。
Asuka leaned slowly, painfully, flaunting her assets in an obvious manner.
明日香缓缓地、痛苦地倾斜着身体，明显地炫耀着自己的资本。
"How should I play that one, Shinji..?" She asked, wiggling her behind for greater effect, her voice becoming like that of a 14 year old, sweet and tempting and everything in-between.
"我该怎么演那一段呢，真嗣？" 她问道，扭动着臀部以增强效果，声音变得像 14 岁少女般甜美诱人，充满了各种魅力。
"Should I play it safe? That's the way you always seem to play it: safe..." She sunk the first ball. Shinji remained silent.
我应该稳妥行事吗？你似乎总是这样：稳妥行事……"她打进了第一个球。真嗣保持沉默。
"You always play the percentage. Well, here we go: fast and loose." She sunk another ball, but her rival still remained stoic.
你总是算计着概率。好吧，这次我们速战速决。她又进了一个球，但对手依旧面无表情。
"Another ball, corner pocket…" She said, lightly tapping the ball, gloating.
"再来一球，角袋…" 她轻敲着球，得意地说道。
"Problem is…percentage players die broke, too, don't they, Shinji..?" She turned to look at him, flipping her red tresses. However a deafening Thud made her turn around shocked and swearing at what she saw.
问题是……百分比的选手也会破产，不是吗，真嗣？她转头看向他，甩动着她的红色长发。然而，一声震耳欲聋的巨响让她震惊地转过身，并对着眼前的一幕咒骂起来。
The ball had hit the corner at an odd angle, sliding down the rail, not going inside.
球以一个奇怪的角度击中角落，沿着轨道滑下，没有进入内部。
Shinji stood there, his hands cupping the top of the cue, almost as if his hands were stapled in front of him, obscuring his mouth, not making it possible to see if he was serious or smirking.
真嗣站在那里，双手握着球杆顶端，仿佛双手被钉在身前，遮住了嘴巴，让人无法看出他是认真的还是带着一丝笑意。
Finally, he walked towards the table, leaned down and lined his sight. Before he made his shot, however he spoke.
最终，他走向桌子，俯身瞄准。然而，在出杆之前，他开口说话了。
"If I win…I get to keep my money and my friend's as well. You can keep the rest."
如果我赢了……我不仅能保住自己的钱，还能保住我朋友的钱。剩下的你可以留着。
Shinji was quietly pulling out bills from the wad before giving it to Asuka who swiped it from his hand. Something wasn't right, but she couldn't place her finger on it.
真嗣正悄悄地从一叠钞票中抽出几张，准备递给明日香，却被她一把夺走。感觉有些不对劲，但她又说不出个所以然来。
Until Kaji came by.
直到加濑出现。
"You're Ikari's kid…right..?"
你是碇的儿子…对吧…？
Shinji said nothing, but his hand became fist, clenching and unclenching.
真嗣一言不发，但他的手握成了拳头，紧了又松，松了又紧。
"I'm nothing like him…" He said in a low, grave voice.
"我一点也不像他……" 他低沉而严肃地说道。
"Wait a minute…Ikari…Gendo Ikari..? Gendo The Shark Ikari..?" Asuka asked shocked. "He…He hustled me..?" She turned to Kaji.
"等一下……碇……碇源堂？鲨鱼碇源堂？" 明日香震惊地问道，"他……他骗了我？" 她转向加持。
"You just realized..?" Kaji supplied between laughter.
"你才意识到..?" 卡吉在笑声中补充道。
Shinji stood there, looking towards his feet.
真嗣站在那里，目光投向自己的脚。
"I have to go…"
我得走了……
"Like hell…" Asuka roared before Kaji placed his hand on her shoulder.
"见鬼去吧…" 明日香咆哮着，就在这时，加持将手放在了她的肩上。
"Let it go Asuka, he won fair and square." Kaji said, taking her arm gently but firmly, even though Shinji never looked up.
"放手吧，明日香，他是光明正大赢的。" 加持说着，温和而坚定地握住她的手臂，尽管真嗣始终没有抬头。
"Go Kid…" Kaji gestured to the exit smiling. "You got talent kid, better than your old man."
去吧，孩子……" 卡吉微笑着指向出口。"你有天赋，孩子，比你的父亲还要出色。
"But…" Asuka said, not willing to let go.
但……”明日香说道，不愿放手。
"Just go…." Kaji said easily, pushing Shinji towards the door.
“快去….” 加持轻松地说着，推着真嗣朝门口走去。
"Thank you." Shinji said, before turning towards Asuka. "Sorry."
"谢谢。" 真嗣说道，然后转向明日香。"对不起。"
Asuka watched Shinji exit the bar. She turned to Kaji, demanding an explanation.
明日香看着真嗣离开酒吧。她转向加持，要求一个解释。
"I don't get it…why did I lose..? Don't I have talent..?"
我不明白…为什么我会输…？难道我没有天赋吗…？
"I don't think there's a pool player alive that shoots better pool than I saw you shoot today." Kaji said calmly, giving Asuka another drink and lighting himself a cigarette.
“我不认为有哪个台球手能比你今天打的更好。” 加持平静地说道，又给明日香递了一杯饮料，并为自己点燃了一支烟。
"You got talent, kid…I'll give you that. But he's Ikari's heir, there nothing like that; it's on the blood, on the genes." He paused for a second, collecting his thoughts.
你确实有天赋，孩子……这点我承认。但他可是碇家的继承人，那种东西是天生的；流淌在血液里，根植于基因中。他停顿了一下，整理思绪。
"He was playing the game like a fine tuned instrument…like a cello…" Kaji exhaled the smoke and then continued.
他玩游戏的样子就像一架调校精良的乐器……宛如大提琴……" 加濑吐出烟雾，然后继续说道。
"Ikari was masterful…I saw him play once. Boy was he great..!" Kaji said with a far away look on his face.
碇真嗣的技艺真是高超……我曾见过他演奏一次。那真是太棒了！加持脸上带着遥远的神情说道。
"The old men; Keel and Fuyutsuki, they trained him, and he was the best. You could look at the way he moved, and it was like a dancer..." Kaji chuckled.
老人们，基尔和冬月，他们训练了他，而他是最出色的。你只需看他行动的方式，那就像一位舞者……" 加持轻笑道。
"And those fingers, those long fingers always enclosed in white gloves. That stroke...it was like he was, I don't know…like he was playing an instrument; a violin or something." He let the smoke billow off, going up toward the ceiling in various fantastic figures.
那些手指，总是戴着白手套的长手指。那抚摸……就像他在，我不知道……就像他在演奏一种乐器；小提琴或类似的东西。" 他让烟雾袅袅升起，向着天花板形成各种奇妙的形状。
"So I got talent. So why did I lose…? How did he won..?" Asuka asked still numbed after finally being beat.
“所以我有才华。那为什么我会输……？他是怎么赢的……？” 飞鸟在终于被打败后，仍然麻木地问道。
"Character." Kaji simply said, going back towards the bar.
"性格。" 加治简单地说了一句，便转身朝酒吧走去。
"I don't get it." Asuka said morosely.
"我不明白。" 明日香闷闷不乐地说。
Kaji smiled at that. "Some day you'll get it, kid…" He turned around the bar, noticing only Asuka and him were the only ones left. "Can you lock up..?"
加治笑了笑，“总有一天你会明白的，孩子……”他环顾酒吧，发现只剩下他和明日香两个人。“你能锁门吗？”
"Yeah, sure…" 当然，没问题…
Asuka watched Kaji go thru the back door. She waited for a couple of minutes, shooting idly with no real intention until a soft tingling announced her the front door had been opened.
明日香注视着加持从后门离开。她等待了几分钟，漫无目的地随意拍摄，直到一阵轻微的叮当声告诉她前门已被打开。
"Beat it dead beats, we're closed…" She said not turning around. The person behind her, however grabbed her by the shoulders turning her to face him.
"滚开，死皮赖脸的家伙们，我们已经关门了……" 她头也不回地说道。然而，站在她身后的人却抓住她的肩膀，将她转过来面对自己。
"ACK! PERVERT!" Asuka screamed, turning around in a flash, hand lashing out in a swift left cross.
"啊！变态！" 明日香尖叫着，迅速转身，手猛地挥出一记迅猛的左勾拳。
A hand caught her punch in midair, and lightly, slowly, almost reverently, the other person's finger were intertwined with hers.
一只手在半空中抓住了她的拳头，轻柔而缓慢地，几乎带着一种虔诚，对方的手指与她的交缠在一起。
Shinji stood there, looking directly at her.
真嗣站在那里，直视着她。
"I came to collect my debt."
我来收债了。
And without saying anything else, he leaned towards her and placed a soft chaste kiss on her lips.
他没再说什么，只是倾身向前，在她唇上轻轻地印下了一个纯洁的吻。
Well here it is, my first foray into the realm of Shinji/Asuka one shots, hope you like it, It's a load of crap, but it's MY load of crap.
好了，这就是我第一次尝试写关于真嗣/明日香的一篇短文，希望你喜欢。虽然它可能是一堆垃圾，但这是属于我的垃圾。
Like it..? Hate it..? Tell me why.
喜欢它吗？讨厌它吗？告诉我为什么。

### Chapter 02 Themes: K#03 (Jolt!), W#24 (Snowfall)
主题：K#03（电击！），W#24（雪落）
Title: Christmas Kiss 标题：圣诞之吻
A.N.:I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. Neither Shinji, nor Asuka, and certainly not the Pillsbury Dough Boy. Santa, being a world figure I'm tempted to say belongs to everyone, although I'm sure Miss Claus would like to object.
作者注：我在此声明免责：这些角色均非我所拥有。无论是真嗣、明日香，还是皮尔斯伯里面团男孩。至于圣诞老人，作为国际知名人物，我倾向于认为他属于所有人，尽管我确信克劳斯夫人会有异议。
BTW, I just found out that I can have the character's kissing other characters instead of the main pairing "so long as the have the other member of the main pair in their heart." Neat-o. Guess I'll use this story around to muck up the pairing.
顺便说一句，我刚发现可以让角色亲吻其他角色，而不是主要配对，“只要他们心中有主要配对的另一方。”真不错。我猜我会用这个故事来搅乱配对关系。
Or will I..? 还是我不会呢..？
I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like. I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly.
我正试图摆脱写作瓶颈，因此我打算同时接受两个挑战：在同一个故事中完成 30 个吻和 30 种方式。希望你喜欢。如果我仍然感到阻塞，我会再更新一篇短篇，否则，期待我接下来简述的 1001 种 10 件事中的其他内容。
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
"Thank you all for coming...Merry Christmas..."
感谢大家的到来...圣诞快乐...
The sound of the bell announcing the departure of the last costumer from the store was accompanied by the best wishes of the cashiers.
随着最后一位顾客离开商店，铃声响起，收银员们送上了最美好的祝愿。
"All right people...That's a wrap." Misato Katsuragi, store manager, notified her employees of the ending of the shift. "Now let's get everything cleaned an-"
好了各位...收工了。" 店长葛城美里通知员工们下班时间到了。"现在让我们把一切都打扫干净-
"Done..!" Before she had a chance to finish, her crack staff was already in line with various cleaning articles; mops brooms, dustpans. Misato stared wide-eyed at them, then turned to the cashier.
"完成了..!" 在她还没来得及说完之前，她的高效团队已经带着各种清洁工具——拖把、扫帚、簸箕——排好了队。碇真嗣瞪大了眼睛看着他们，然后转向收银员。
"Uhmmm..." Hikari Horaki began, twirling one of the pigtails that were sticking out of her Santa hat. "We took the liberty of starting to cleanup earlier."
嗯……" 光博美开始说道，一边旋转着从她的圣诞帽里伸出来的一个辫子。"我们自作主张提前开始了清理工作。
Misato smiled at that. "Great idea...now you know the drill gang, lets PAAR-TAAY..!" She gestured wildly, ushering the rest of the staff out and closing the store. All of them walked lively towards the closest bar, chatting and joking, looking at the bright lights, the Christmas displays, the men dressed as Santa Clauses carrying signs, urging people to purchase the fabled Christmas cake, or the buckets of chicken in preparation for Christmas dinners.
碇真嗣微笑着回应：“好主意……现在你们都知道流程了，让我们开派对吧！”她夸张地挥手，催促其他员工离开并关闭店铺。他们兴高采烈地走向最近的酒吧，边走边聊天开玩笑，欣赏着明亮的灯光、圣诞装饰，还有装扮成圣诞老人的人举着牌子，敦促人们购买传说中的圣诞蛋糕，或是为圣诞晚餐准备的一桶桶炸鸡。
"Christmas is such a great time, isn't it Asuka..?" Misato smiled wistfully as the young woman besides her looked with a quiet enthusiasm at the people swirling around, going from one store to another, like little ants scurrying and burrowing on their ant hill.
“圣诞节真是个美好的时光，不是吗，明日香？”碇真嗣带着一丝怀旧的微笑说道。她身边的少女静静地带着热情观察着周围穿梭于各个商店的人群，就像蚂蚁在蚁丘上忙碌地穿梭。
"Yeah...I guess..." She said, smiling sadly as memories, both wanted and unwanted came by.
"是啊...我想也是..." 她苦笑着说，回忆如潮水般涌来，有渴望的，也有不愿触及的。
Asuka Langley Soryu. College sophomore. Her life had been hard; her mother committed suicide, and her father remarried again.
惣流·明日香·兰格雷。大学二年级学生。她的生活一直很艰难；她的母亲自杀了，而她的父亲再次再婚。
"I noticed you seemed in a slump earlier today...what's the matter..? Getting the Christmas blues..?" Misato gasped and then smiled teasingly. "You're not thinking about stealing my husband, aren't ya..?"
我注意到你今天早些时候似乎有些消沉...怎么了？是得了圣诞忧郁症吗？" 美里惊讶地吸了口气，然后调皮地笑了。"你不会是在打我丈夫的主意吧？"
"M-Mistao...i-it's not like that..." Asuka blushed, more mortified about the crack about Misato's husband over anything else. Back when she had just started working at the Katsuragi store, Asuka had openly ogled Kaji, then Misato's fiancé and went so far as calling him a fox in front of said fiancé.
"不，不是那样的……" 明日香脸红了，对于拿美里丈夫开玩笑的事情感到更加尴尬。回想当初她刚在葛城商店工作时，明日香曾公然对美里的未婚夫加持投以艳羡的目光，甚至当着未婚夫的面称他为狐狸精。
"Yeah...I bet he's so good in bed..." Misato said teasingly as Asuka blushed and sputtered.
"是啊...我敢打赌他在床上一定很厉害..." 美里打趣地说，此时明日香脸红并结巴起来。
"Y-you Japanese are all perverts, Katsuragi..." She laughed blushing. "How can you say something like that about a complete stranger...?"
"你...你们日本人都是变态，桂..." 她红着脸笑道，"怎么能对一个完全陌生的人说这种话...？"
"Hey, I can introduce him to us if that makes it all right..." She said grinning widely just as she was about to wave at the pony tailed stranger. "Heyyy..."
"嘿，如果这样可以的话，我可以把他介绍给我们..." 她咧嘴笑着说道，正要向那位马尾辫的陌生人挥手。"嘿..."
"Stop it, Misato..." A now red-faced Asuka, almost as red as the shirt she was wearing pushed her arm down. "You're making a scene..." Asuka looked from side to side to make sure no one was watching the crazy dark haired woman and the exotic, auburn haired foreigner.
"别闹了，美里……" 此刻面红耳赤的明日香，几乎和她所穿的红色衬衫一样红，她用力压下手臂。"你这是在出洋相……" 明日香左右张望，确保没人注意到这个疯狂的黑发女人和那位异国情调的红褐色头发外国人。
"Besides, you wouldn't dare do it..." Asuka stated, looking over at her, turning her back on the stranger, hopping her blushing face hadn't been seen.
“再说，你也不敢这么做……”明日香说道，她瞥了一眼对方，背对陌生人，希望自己泛红的脸颊没被看见。
"Why not...? He is hot and sexy..." Misato began to recite her reasons, stopping on the last one, pulling Asuka closer to whisper in her ear. "But most importantly...He's my fiancé..."
"为什么不呢？他又帅又性感……" 碇真嗣开始列举理由，在最后一个理由上停顿，将明日香拉近耳语道："但最重要的是……他是我未婚夫……"
It was then that Asuka witnessed firsthand the incredible teasing skills Misato Katsuragi possessed, something she would still do every once in a while when business was slow.
就在那时，明日香亲眼目睹了葛城美里令人难以置信的调侃技巧，每当工作清闲时，她偶尔还会这么做。
Or whenever she felt like it.
或者每当她想这么做的时候。
"Look Asuka, I know your situation isn't easy, but I was wondering if you would like to come over for Christmas dinner; it'll just be the staff, Kaji and Me..." She finished by ruffling her bangs. "Nobody should be alone on Christmas." She finished softly.
“看啊，明日香，我知道你的处境不容易，但我想知道你是否愿意来参加圣诞晚餐；只有我们员工、加持和我……”她边说边拨弄着她的刘海。“圣诞节没人应该孤单。”她温柔地结束了话语。
"I don't know; Hikari might invite her stooge boyfriend..." Asuka motioned to the pigtailed girl, currently being accompanied by a bespectacled woman with reindeer ears on top of her head, and an azure haired young woman. "And Mayumi has been really chummy with the loser who works at the hobby store a few locals down the street."
"我不知道；光可能会邀请她的跟班男友……" 明日香指着那个扎着马尾辫的女孩，她正由一位头戴驯鹿耳朵的眼镜女士和一位蓝发年轻女子陪伴着。"而真由美最近和那个在街下几家本地爱好商店工作的失败者关系很亲密。"
"Well...Rei is coming solo...apparently her boyfriend is not going to be free since he has to play at some gala concert or something..."
嗯...丽要一个人来...显然她男朋友没空，因为他得在某个盛大音乐会上演出或者什么的...
Asuka simply mulled it over and over; on the one hand, she wasn't looking forwards to spending another Christmas all alone. She turned to Rei, and wondered if maybe, just maybe she should come with the blue haired woman who was currently sporting her Santa hat with faux elven ears, both clashing with her otherwise impassible neutral expression.
明日香只是反复思量着；一方面，她并不期待再次独自度过圣诞节。她转向绫波，心想或许，只是或许，她应该和那位蓝发女子一同前往，对方此刻正戴着圣诞帽，配上仿若精灵的耳朵，与她那原本无动于衷的中性表情形成鲜明对比。
"I'd love to...Misato..." Asuka smiled at her boss, who at times like this also doubled as a big sister she sometimes wished she had. "I'll even bring the Christmas cake."
我很愿意...美里..." 明日香对她上司微笑着，这种时候，上司也兼任了她有时希望拥有的姐姐角色。"我还会带上圣诞蛋糕。"
"That's the spirit." Misato cheered, laughing. "And if Rei's boyfriend does manage to make it, you're still welcomed to come along if you want to...Now..." Misato finished once she saw the girls had finally succeeded on renting a big enough karaoke room. "Let me call that no good husband of mine while the girls call their less-than-better halves and let's party..."
"就是这种精神！" 美里欢呼着笑道，"如果绫波的男朋友真的能来，你还是欢迎加入的，如果你想的话...现在..." 美里看到女孩们终于租到了足够大的卡拉 OK 房间后说道，"让我给那个没用的丈夫打个电话，女孩们也联系她们那些不怎么样的另一半，我们开派对吧..."
"C'mon Rei, we really need to get going." Asuka said, shivering and whining, putting on her wide opened white sweater over her sleeveless black turtle neck as they said goodbye to Touji and Hikari, as well as Kensuke and Mayumi. Readjusting her vibrantly red scarf, Asuka felt glad for the thinking ahead and bringing the dark wool trench coat, asking herself what she would have done if she hadn't.
“来吧，丽，我们真的得走了。”明日香说着，一边颤抖一边抱怨，她把那件敞开的白色大毛衣套在无袖的黑色高领衫上，与东治、光以及健介和真由美告别。她重新调整了一下鲜艳的红色围巾，庆幸自己有先见之明，带上了那件深色羊毛风衣，心里想着要是没带的话该怎么办。
She had insisted on wearing a skirt so short, that even after putting on her dark leggings she felt her legs were freezing. And the white boots were going to be a bitch to clean tomorrow. Deciding she was too drunk to worry about fashion emergencies, she placed the white earmuffs on her ears and turned at Rei.
她坚持要穿一条短裙，即便套上了深色打底裤，仍感觉双腿冰冷。而那双白色靴子明天清洗起来肯定是个麻烦。意识到自己醉得无暇顾及时尚危机，她将白色耳罩戴在耳朵上，转身面对着零。
Rei waved good bye to the couples before kneeling down. "Give me a second..." She muttered as she put on her brown boots and closed her tan wool pea coat, adjusting her olive green paperboy cap and lavender scarf. Her coat, although not as long as Asuka's did manage to cover her short pleated tan skirt.
绫挥手告别了那对情侣，随后跪下身来。“稍等一下……”她低声说着，穿上棕色靴子，扣好浅棕色羊毛短大衣，调整了一下橄榄绿的报童帽和淡紫色的围巾。尽管她的外套没有明日香的长，但足以遮住她那条短款的棕色百褶裙。
"Wow that was a hell of a party...good thing we don't have to work neither tomorrow nor the day after..." Asuka slurred drunkenly, using Rei as both support from her drunken haze, and giving support to her as well.
哇，那真是个疯狂的派对...幸好我们明天和后天都不用上班..." 明日香醉醺醺地含糊说道，一边借着绫波的支撑从醉意中站稳，一边也给予她支持。
All in all, if anyone would have walked by them at such an ungodly hour, they would have snickered at the sight of two young women huddling drunkenly together to stop themselves from falling.
总而言之，如果有人在这样不合时宜的时刻路过，看到两个年轻女子醉醺醺地挤在一起以防跌倒，他们肯定会窃笑。
"I don't feel well..." Rei hiccuped, closing her eyes and breathing heavily. "I think I'm gonna throw up..."
"我感觉不太舒服……" 绫闭上眼睛，重重地呼吸着，"我想我要吐了……"
"I thought Hikari would pop a vein when Touji began to sing that "fly me to the moon" piece..."
我以为光会气得血管爆裂，当透二开始唱那首《带我飞向月球》时……
"I can't believe I drank so much..."
我真不敢相信我喝了这么多……
"Besides, who would've thought Mayumi had this great singing voice..?"
而且，谁会想到真弓竟然有这么美妙的歌喉呢？
The rich, toned laughter emerging from their throats rang throughout the night, making the sound all the quainter. Finally, they reached their destination, Rei trying a few times to place the key in the right keyhole, until Asuka rolled her eyes and took the key from her hand, finally succeeding in opening the door.
他们喉咙中发出的富有磁性的笑声响彻夜空，显得愈发古怪。最终，他们抵达了目的地，绫尝试了几次才将钥匙对准锁孔，直到明日香翻了个白眼，从她手中接过钥匙，终于成功打开了门。
"Here ya go, M'lady..." An uncharacteristically drunken Asuka said, bowing down and giggling drunkenly. "Home safe home..."
“给您，小姐……”一贯不常醉酒的明日香说着，一边鞠躬一边醉醺醺地咯咯笑。“家，安全温馨的家……”
"You know Asuka..." Rei began just as she and the red-head shuffled their way towards the door. "You can stay here to spend the night..."
"你知道明日香……" 绫波丽刚开口，她和红发女孩便一起向门口挪去。"你可以留在这里过夜……"
"Thanks Rei, but my apartment is just a few streets down, I'll be okay…really..."
谢谢 Rei，但我的公寓就在几条街之外，我会没事的……真的……
"Okay..." Rei smiled drunkenly, groping around her coat for the key, realizing finally that the door was opened. Asuka was watching all this with a smile on her face. Silently, Rei sat down on the stairs leading towards the door, and Asuka followed her cue.
"好吧..." 绫波微笑着，醉醺醺地在她的大衣里摸索着钥匙，最终意识到门已经开了。明日香在一旁微笑着看着这一切。无声地，绫波坐在通往门口的楼梯上，明日香也跟着坐了下来。
"I've always wanted to learn how to smoke..."
我一直想学怎么抽烟……
"Get real, Rei...you're wonder girl, the prototype of the Yamato Nadeshico..." Asuka gestured, still smiling. Noticing Rei's frown Asuka tried to explain. "No offense, Rei, but you rarely go out to drink, and when you do, three beer's the limit for you... I seriously can't see you smoking..."
"现实点，绫……你是奇迹女孩，大和抚子的原型……" 明日香比划着，依旧微笑着。注意到绫的皱眉，明日香试图解释："别介意，绫，但你很少出去喝酒，即使去，三瓶啤酒就是你的极限了……我真的无法想象你抽烟的样子……"
"I...I can be..." Rei replied in a low tone, though it appeared she wanted to make herself believe do it, rather than stating it. "Y'know, I can be wild..."
"我...我可以是..." 绫以低沉的语气回答，尽管她似乎更想让自己相信这一点，而非陈述事实。"你知道，我可以很狂野..."
"Please, Rei...It's just like that dork Kensuke said: if this were a harem anime you would be the Yamato Nadeshico, Mayumi the Fujoshi and I'd be the Bokukko..."
拜托，绫……就像那个呆子健介说的：如果这是后宫动漫，那你就是大和抚子，真由美是腐女，而我会是中性少女……
Rei said nothing, instead she turned towards Asuka.
绫什么也没说，而是转向了明日香。
"Hey Asuka..." Rei began after a second or two of silence. "Did you believe in Santa Claus...when you were young..?"
"嘿，明日香……" 沉默了一两秒后，绫波丽开口问道，"你小时候相信过圣诞老人吗……？"
Asuka turned to Rei smiling, but stopped from laughing at her question when she saw the far away look on Rei's eyes, the glazed look one gets when they are remembering something precious to them. A beautiful memory; a peaceful memory.
明日香转向绫波微笑着，但当她看到绫波眼中那遥远的神情，那种当人们回忆起对他们珍贵的事物时所露出的朦胧眼神时，她止住了笑意。那是一段美好的记忆；一段宁静的记忆。
"I mean..." The petite, blue haired girl continued. "Were...were you disappointed to find out that Santa was really your mom and dad..?"
“我是说……”那个娇小、蓝发的女孩继续说道，“你……你发现圣诞老人其实是你的爸爸妈妈时，感到失望了吗？”
Asuka inhaled deeply at the mention of the parental units, and slowly let the willowy smoke from the condensation emerge from within her lips and nose.
一提到父母，明日香便深吸一口气，然后缓缓地从唇间和鼻孔中吐出如柳絮般轻盈的烟雾。
"Rei, you're really drunk...don't tell me you feel bad for working in a toy store during this time of year..."
零，你真的醉了……别告诉我你因为这段时间在玩具店工作而感到难过……
Rei sobered up, almost as if some one had taken her mind of a deep trance. "Huh-wha..?" She turned around in a hazy manner before looking up at Asuka's standing form. "Hey Asuka...I need you to come with me tomorrow..." Rei said as she clumsily withdrew her pocket book from her hand bag, opening it to a picture of a smiling Rei flanked by two guys.
绫波清醒过来，仿佛有人将她从深沉的恍惚中唤醒。“啊？什么…？”她迷迷糊糊地转过身，抬头望向站在那里的明日香。“嘿，明日香……我明天需要你陪我一起去……”绫波一边说着，一边笨拙地从手提包里抽出她的记事本，翻到一张照片，上面是微笑着的绫波，两侧站着两个男生。
"He is my brother, the other one is my boyfriend, he plays classical music." Rei said through half lidded eyes, smiling lazily, humming the first notes of a melody composed by a German musician.
“他是我哥哥，另一个是我男朋友，他弹古典音乐。” Rei 半闭着眼睛说道，懒洋洋地笑着，哼着一位德国音乐家创作的旋律的开头音符。
The one on her left was the same as Rei, fair skinned, milky white with red eyes, but while Rei dyed her hair blue, he chose a grey color instead. The one on her right had the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen; dark blue, like the stormy waters of the sea before a hurricane, like the cloudy sky during a storm, he had a sorrowful deep look in his eyes, like a poet trying to express in words the thousand feeling coursing thru his mind.
她左边的那位与丽一样，肤色白皙，乳白色肌肤配以红眸，但与丽染成蓝色头发不同，他选择了灰色。而她右边的那位，拥有她所见过的最美丽的眼睛；深蓝色，如同飓风来临前汹涌的海水，又似暴风雨中阴沉的天空，他的眼神深邃而哀伤，仿佛一位诗人正试图用言语表达脑海中涌动的千般情感。
Finally, Rei opened her eyes slowly, noticing her surroundings. "Hey Asuka..." Rei asked, breaking the red head from her daze. "What are we doing here..? I thought we were gonna party tonight...Misato-san said so..."
终于，绫波缓缓睁开双眼，注意到周围的环境。“嘿，明日香……”绫波问道，打断了红发少女的出神。“我们在这里做什么..？我以为我们今晚要去派对...美里小姐说的...”
Asuka chuckled, grabbing Rei by her arm and lifting her up, grunting at the force exerted. "She did, and we did...now let's get going...I need to go home and you..." Asuka said as she adjusted Rei's cap and scarf. "You need to go up...it's freezing..." Rei said nothing but made her way to the stairs.
明日香轻笑一声，抓住绫波的手臂将她提起，用力时发出一声闷哼。“她确实这么做了，我们也……现在我们走吧……我得回家，而你……”明日香边说边调整绫波的帽子和围巾。“你得上去……这里太冷了……”绫波没有说话，只是默默走向楼梯。
"Hey Asuka..." Rei turned from the stairs, before closing the door. "You're coming tomorrow to Misato's and Kaji's for the Christmas dinner, aren't ya..?"
"嘿，明日香……" 绫波丽在楼梯口转身，随后关上门，问道，"你明天会来美里和加持的圣诞晚餐吧？"
Asuka simply smiled at that. "Good night Rei..." She simply said, walking down the road.
明日香只是对着那微笑。“晚安，绫波……”她简单地说着，沿着路走去。
Rei smiled sadly, closing the door. "Why are you so sad, Asuka..?" She wondered out loud, before turning the front light off. "Why don't you ever talk about your parents..?"
绫波带着悲伤的微笑关上了门。“为什么你这么难过，明日香……？”她大声地自言自语，随后关掉了前灯。“为什么你从不谈起你的父母……？”
Asuka doesn't hate her parents; not her father, nor her stepmother. She simply feels like a hypocrite, because she can't love her stepmother fully since her stepmother could never replace her real mother.
明日香并不讨厌她的父母；既不讨厌父亲，也不讨厌继母。她只是觉得自己像个伪君子，因为她无法全心全意地爱继母，因为继母永远无法取代她的亲生母亲。
Maybe it was because she was drunk, but for Asuka, the walk from Rei's apartment building never took this long. She sighed, snuggling her coat closer to her body.
或许是因为她喝醉了，但对明日香来说，从绫波的公寓楼走出来从未花过这么长时间。她叹了口气，将外套更紧地裹在身上。
"I should've stayed at Rei's..." She muttered, glancing up. a brief flash of white caught the corner of her eyes. "Wha...is it the first snowfall..?" She said absentmindedly before she felt something cold make contact with her forehead.
"我本该留在零那里的……" 她喃喃自语，抬头望去。一抹白色在眼角闪过。"什……是初雪吗……？" 她心不在焉地说着，随即感到一丝冰凉触碰了她的额头。
For a snowflake, this was something cold but hard.
对于一片雪花而言，这是冰冷而坚硬的存在。
"OWWW..!" Asuka screamed at the impact, getting up and grabbing her throbbing forehead.
"哎哟！" 阿苏卡因撞击而尖叫，起身抓住她抽痛的额头。
"What the hell was that for..?" She screamed to no-one in particular, her hand still over her eyes. She finally got around to opening her eyes, seeing the white street lights dancing around her face.
"这到底是怎么回事啊..?" 她向着空无一人的四周尖叫，手仍遮在眼前。她终于鼓起勇气睁开眼睛，只见白色的路灯在她脸上摇曳。
"If I find out who did I'll shove my foot up your a..." Asuka trailed off as she caught sight of something silvery white and metallic glistening from the floor.
“如果我知道是谁干的，我会把脚踹进你的……”明日香话音未落，目光突然被地板上闪烁的银白色金属光泽吸引。
"What's this..?" She asked herself out loud, crouching to get a better look at it. It resembled a Christian cross, shiny and white but with the design of a snowflake across it's center. Curiously she picked it up.
"这是什么..?" 她自言自语地问道，蹲下身来以便更仔细地观察。它像是一个基督教十字架，闪亮而洁白，但中心却有着雪花图案的设计。好奇心驱使下，她伸手将它拾起。
"A MEDALLION..!" Asuka proceeded to scream, not caring the hour of the night. "WHO THE HELL THROWS A MEDALLION OUT THE WINDOW..?"
"一个勋章..!" 明日香不顾夜深人静大声尖叫起来。"谁他妈的会把勋章扔出窗外..?"
As she continued making her way to the apartment, nursing her head and grumbling about lousy presents someone hates so much they'd rather throw it at innocent bystanders than wear it, she felt a cold breeze. Deciding to hurry up to her apartment, she proceeded to open the door, place her keys on the table and make her way to her room, discarding the boots, the coat, the scarf and all other pieces of clothing in a sloppy and unsexy striptease. She put her pajamas on and went to bed.
她一边继续前往公寓，一边揉着头，嘟囔着关于那些糟糕的礼物，有人如此厌恶它们，宁愿将其扔向无辜旁观者也不愿穿戴。这时，她感到一阵冷风。决定加快脚步回到公寓，她打开门，将钥匙放在桌上，然后走向房间，随意地脱下靴子、外套、围巾以及所有其他衣物，进行了一场既不优雅也不性感的脱衣秀。换上睡衣后，她便上床睡觉了。
The dreams were, as always, disturbing.
梦，一如既往，令人不安。
"Papa, where is Mama going..?"
"爸爸，妈妈要去哪里呢？"
"Asuka, Mama is sick, she needs to go to the hospital for a little while so she could get better."
明日香，妈妈生病了，她需要去医院待一会儿以便康复。
It was Christmas Eve. The house was alive with the colors of the holiday; everywhere one could turn they saw green and red and white and golden and silver. The kitchen was filled with the spicy smell of cinnamon, and nutmeg, and everything was mixed with the ever-present pungent smell of fresh pine.
那是圣诞前夜，屋子里洋溢着节日的色彩；无论转向哪里，都能看到绿色、红色、白色、金色和银色。厨房里弥漫着肉桂和豆蔻的香料味，而这一切又与新鲜松树那无时不在的刺鼻气息交织在一起。
And outside, she heard as the carolers broke into laughter and singing as if to mock her laughing at her anguish, playing with her pain.
外面，她听到唱诗班突然爆发出笑声和歌唱，仿佛在嘲弄她的痛苦，戏谑她的伤痛。
Almost as if the entire world had gone completely deaf.
仿佛整个世界都彻底失聪了。
She felt her eyes sting and get hazy, the signs of tears to come. Sniffling the little red head made her way across the empty halls and towards the chimney, climbing into her father's favorite chair and snuffled into the blanket her mother had been wearing over her shoulders, still lingering with her distinctive smell; sugar and spice and pine and nutmeg, flour and bread and turkey and eggnog.
她感到眼睛刺痛，视线变得模糊，这是泪水即将涌出的征兆。那个红头发的小脑袋抽着鼻子，穿过空荡荡的走廊，向壁炉走去，爬进父亲最爱的椅子，把头埋进母亲曾披在肩上的毯子里，那上面还残留着她独特的气息：糖、香料、松树、肉豆蔻，还有面粉、面包、火鸡和蛋奶酒的味道。
Slowly, the trickle of tears began to form, and then the little girl was grown up, still trembling, still holding the blanket, the sound of ragged weeping coming from within.
慢慢地，泪水开始形成细流，然后小女孩长大了，依旧颤抖着，依旧抱着毯子，从里面传来断断续续的哭泣声。
"Merry Christmas, Asuka-chan…" She softly said through her sobbing, clutching the fabric closer to herself.
"圣诞快乐，明日香…" 她哽咽着轻声说道，紧紧抓住布料贴向自己。
"Uhmm...S-sorry..." She heard a distant and unmistakably male voice. Thinking this just a side effect of being in a deep slumber, Asuka turned around from to her side from her back.
"呃...对、对不起..."她听到一个遥远而无疑的男性声音。以为这只是深睡中的副作用，明日香从仰卧翻身转向侧卧。
"Uh...Miss...Miss Soryu..?" She felt someone prodding her shoulder and clumsily, sleepily opened her eyes, gradually becoming aware of her surroundings. Yawning, she turned to her back and stared ahead.
"呃...小姐...早海小姐？" 她感觉到有人在轻戳她的肩膀，笨拙地、睡眼惺忪地睁开眼睛，逐渐意识到周围的环境。打了个哈欠，她转过身，向前望去。
Into a pair of deep dark blue eyes.
陷入一双深邃的暗蓝色眼眸。
It took several seconds for Asuka's bedridden brain and it's higher functions to kick into gear, but when it did, and she became aware of what was going on she reacted as predictably as always.
过了好几秒，明日香卧床不起的大脑及其高级功能才启动起来，但一旦恢复意识，她对周围情况的反应依旧如往常一样可预测。
"AAACK...! PERVERT..!" Asuka screamed at the top of her lungs, scrambling frantically towards the door still in pajamas.
"啊啊啊...！变态..！" 明日香声嘶力竭地尖叫着，穿着睡衣拼命向门口逃去。
"I'm sorry...I didn't mean to scare you...it's just that a while ago I dropped something and I think you have it."
对不起……我不是故意要吓你的……只是刚才我掉了个东西，我想你那里有。
"STAY AWAY FROM ME YOU PERVERT!" Asuka screamed, holding a chair in front of her as if she were a lion tamer, putting it between herself and the young man in front of her. "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU..? SOME KIND OF BURGLAR..? A RAPIST..?" She screamed while throwing the chair at him.
"离我远点，你这个变态！" 明日香尖叫着，手里举着一把椅子，仿佛自己是驯狮师，将它置于自己与面前的年轻人之间。"你他妈是谁？...某种窃贼吗？...还是强奸犯？" 她边喊边将椅子朝他扔去。
Only to watch it stop a few inches from him, apparently colliding into an invisible wall, creating orange colored, octagon shaped ripples in thins air.
只见它在他面前几英寸处戛然而止，显然是撞上了一堵无形的墙，在稀薄的空气中激起橙色八角形的涟漪。
"No, actually I'm Santa Claus..."
不，其实我是圣诞老人……
Asuka then noticed several interesting things.
明日香随后注意到了几件有趣的事情。
The chair she had lunged was steadily floating, before coming down slowly to the place where she had taken it.
她猛扑过去的那把椅子正稳稳地漂浮着，随后缓缓降落回她取走它的地方。
The man was dressed in the typical red outfit of Santa Claus, and except for the thin frame and the lack of beard, he somehow was able to pull it off.
这位男士身着典型的圣诞老人红色装束，尽管身形瘦削且没有胡须，他却巧妙地驾驭了这一装扮。
But more importantly, he was floating. In the middle of her living room.
但更重要的是，他正漂浮着。就在她客厅的中央。
To Asuka's credit, she never stopped to think it through. As quickly as humanly possible, she ran to her door, screaming at the top of her lungs. In one swift move, she opened the door and ran down the stairs, not noticing or caring for the coldness she felt on her bare feet. All she could think was to run away, to get away.
值得称赞的是，明日香从未停下来仔细思考。她以人类最快的速度冲向门口，声嘶力竭地尖叫着。一个敏捷的动作，她打开门，冲下楼梯，丝毫不在意赤脚感受到的寒冷。她脑子里只有一个念头：逃跑，逃离这里。
Until somehow her feet got tangled and she saw the stairs up close and personal, falling down the stairs towards the ground. Before she made contact and broke her arm, or neck, however, she felt something much more warmer, much more softer and fuzzy against her cheeks. Blinking, she noticed she was also floating several inches above ground.
直到不知怎么的，她的脚缠在一起，她近距离地看到了楼梯，正朝地面跌落。但在她触地并摔断手臂或脖子之前，她感到脸颊上有一股温暖得多、柔软而毛茸茸的东西。她眨了眨眼，注意到自己还悬浮在离地面几英寸的空中。
She also noticed how her face was in his lap.
她还注意到自己的脸正贴在他的大腿上。
In an utter state of shock Asuka saw as his blue eyes danced merrily, looking at her with childish curiosity.
在极度震惊的状态下，明日香看到他的蓝眼睛欢快地跳动着，带着孩子般的好奇心望着她。
"Oh...I get it..." He said smiling warmly and openly at her. "It's my appearance right..? Maybe this would be better..." He said, just as his image began to change, Asuka could feel him become more round, more cushiony. His face and frame became rounder, the Santa suit bulging at his expanding girth. His face, before clean shaven and youthful, now full of wrinkles, with a long beard growing. Before his hair was a dark color, now it was as white as the snow.
"哦...我明白了..." 他微笑着温暖而坦诚地看着她，"是我的外表对吧...? 或许这样会更好..." 话音刚落，他的形象开始变化，明日香能感觉到他变得更加圆润，更加柔软。他的脸庞和身形变得圆润，圣诞装随着他膨胀的腰围鼓起。之前干净利落、年轻的脸庞，现在布满了皱纹，长长的胡须开始生长。原先乌黑的头发，如今变得像雪一样洁白。
All in all, the young thin man that only seconds ago had been supporting her in thin air, was now the spitting image of Santa Claus, going so far as to laugh in a rich, rumbly Ho-ho-ho, making his belly shook when he laughed.
总而言之，那个刚才还在空中支撑着她的瘦弱年轻人，此刻已变成了圣诞老人的翻版，甚至发出浑厚低沉的“呵呵呵”笑声，笑得他那肚子都跟着抖动起来。
"Just like a bowl full of jelly..." Asuka said in wonder, before blacking out.
"就像一碗满满的果冻..." 明日香惊叹道，随后便失去了意识。
They were back at the apartment, and Santa Claus had just placed a cup of hot tea in front of this Asuka. He sat in front of her and gave her a mischievous smile.
他们回到了公寓，圣诞老人刚刚在明日香面前放了一杯热茶。他在她对面坐下，向她露出了一个调皮的微笑。
"Well then...if you're done..." He straightened his cap. "I am Santa Claus..."
那么……如果你完成了……" 他正了正帽子，"我就是圣诞老人……"
Asuka simply nodded, her eyes glazed.
明日香只是点了点头，眼神迷离。
"Earlier today, I was a bit careless..." He said, blushing. "And I...I dropped something..."
今天早些时候，我有点粗心……”他说着，脸红了。“我……我弄丢了一样东西……”
Asuka stood with the same expression.
明日香保持着同样的表情站立着。
"Are you listening..?" Santa Claus asked, concerned, making Asuka come to her senses.
"你在听吗..?" 圣诞老人关切地问道，让明日香回过神来。
"Huh..? I m-mean yes... U-uhh...Santa Claus..?" She felt her tongue get tied, the feeling of saying Santa Claus to an actual being foreign, like wool on her mouth. When she was able to finally come to terms, she leaned over, and prodded his big belly, making him squeal with laughter like the dough boy from the commercials.
"呃...？我...我是说...呃...圣诞老人...？" 她感到自己的舌头打结了，对着一个真实存在的对象说出"圣诞老人"这个词，感觉陌生得就像嘴里塞了羊毛。当她终于能接受这个事实时，她倾身向前，戳了戳他那圆滚滚的大肚子，逗得他像广告里的面团宝宝一样咯咯笑起来。
"So…you really are Santa..." She said slowly, Santa simply nodding at that. "And this..." She said, as she placed the pendant that had clicked her earlier in the evening on the table. "Should be yours..."
"所以……你真的是圣诞老人……" 她缓缓说道，圣诞老人只是点了点头。"而这个……" 她说着，将当晚早些时候触动她的那枚吊坠放在桌上，"应该是你的……"
"Yes...Thank you Miss..." Santa said, smiling and chuckling, as he clasped the pendant in front of him. "I can't lose it...I can't get back to the North Pole without it."
"是的...谢谢你，小姐..." 圣诞老人说道，一边微笑着一边轻笑，同时紧握着面前的吊坠。"我不能失去它...没有它我无法回到北极。"
After finally placing it correctly, and putting it inside his redcoat, Santa turned to Asuka.
在终于正确地放置好之后，将其放入他的红外套里，圣诞老人转向了明日香。
"Now, to show my appreciation...I'd love to give you whatever you want as a token of my appreciation." Santa chuckled at Asuka's gasp of surprise. "How about that pony you wanted when you were 5 Asuka..?"
现在，为了表达我的感激之情……我愿意给你任何你想要的东西作为感谢的象征。"圣诞老人对明日香惊讶的吸气声轻笑道，"比如你五岁时想要的那个小马怎么样，明日香？"
"Y-you can do that..?"
"你...你能做到那个吗？"
"Well...There are limits to what I can do, although you are a bit grown up for a pony..." He chuckled. "Not to mention it would be kind of hard to explain his presence to the landlady..."
"嗯...虽然你对于一匹小马来说有点长大了，但我能做的也有限..." 他轻笑道，"更不用说，要向房东太太解释他的存在，恐怕有点困难..."
"Guess you are right..."
看来你是对的……
Santa's eyes glinted. Without a word he took her hand within his. "Let me see what you really want..." He said, closing his eye and concentrating, smiling softly. He sensed her thoughts.
圣诞老人的眼睛闪烁着光芒。他一言不发地握住她的手，“让我看看你真正想要的是什么……”他说着，闭上眼睛，专注地微笑着。他感受到了她的思绪。
Wow...Santa is in my house. Wonder if he can actually get me the pony...or maybe that Barbie doll...Nah! I'm a little older for dolls. Hmm...he looked really cute before he became all white and fat and wrinkly...wonder if he would go back to looking like that...No! Bad, bad Asuka...I've been hanging too much with Misato.
哇...圣诞老人在我家。不知道他能不能真的给我带来小马...或者那个芭比娃娃...算了！我已经过了玩娃娃的年纪。嗯...他以前看起来真的很可爱，后来变得又白又胖又皱...不知道他会不会变回那样...不！不行，不行，明日香...我跟美里混得太久了。
Santa Claus simply chuckled, noticing Asuka's thoughts.
圣诞老人只是轻声笑了笑，察觉到了明日香的思绪。
But he was really, really cute. I wished I...I wish I could spend Christmas with a guy as cute as that...
但他真的非常可爱。我真希望我能……我希望我能和一个像他那样可爱的男生一起过圣诞节……
"Well..." Santa was glad that his rosy cheeks were already red; it would be hard and embarrassing to explain to the red-head in front of him why he was blushing. "I think I know what you want..."
"嗯……" 圣诞老人庆幸自己红润的脸颊本就泛红；要向面前这位红发人解释自己为何脸红，既困难又尴尬。"我想我知道你想要什么……"
"Really..?" Asuka gulped, nervous.
"真的..?" 明日香紧张地咽了口口水。
"Yes. It is a common misconception that Santa Claus carries material presents, when in reality what I give is rarely material." He said a she made hand gestures, making different toys and gifts of all shapes and sizes appear from thin air.
是的，人们普遍误以为圣诞老人携带的是实物礼物，而实际上我送出的很少是物质性的。" 他说着，同时用手势比划，各种形状和大小的玩具及礼物凭空出现。
"The best gift I give good little kids are dreams..." He finished, making everything disappear with a snap of his fingers.
“我给乖巧小孩最好的礼物是梦想……”他说完，随着手指一弹，一切便消失无踪。
"Dreams..?" Asuka asked, feeling like a little kid, feeling the innocence she had long thought lost warming her heart.
"梦想……？" 明日香问道，感觉自己像个小孩，久违的纯真温暖了她的心。
Feeling, not for the first time, that she could really use a good cry.
她再次感到，真的需要好好哭一场。
"Yes. Dreams. Dreams being dreams are almost always forgotten; they're visions of things people enjoy, things that give them joy and happiness." He snapped his fingers and a small powder blue pony appeared in front of Asuka.
是的，梦境。梦之所以为梦，几乎总是被遗忘；它们是人们所喜爱的事物的幻象，给予他们欢乐和幸福。"他打了个响指，一只淡蓝色的小马驹便出现在明日香面前。
"When you wake up snap He's gone..." He snapped his fingers again, and this time a worn plush toy, resembling a super deformed monkey appeared in Asuka's hands.
当你醒来时，啪的一声，他不见了……"他再次打了个响指，这次，一个磨损的毛绒玩具出现在明日香手中，它酷似一只超级变形的猴子。
"But for that brief period of time, you felt a happiness unto itself so perfect, so precious, that it makes the giver happy...That's Christmas..." Santa Claus then placed his hands on either side of Asuka's temples and whispered to her in a calm, soothing voice, crisp and clear.
在那短暂的时刻，你感受到了一种纯粹至极、珍贵无比的幸福，它让给予者也感到快乐……这就是圣诞节……”圣诞老人随后将双手放在明日香的太阳穴两侧，用平静而舒缓、清晰而响亮的声音对她低语。
"Think about what would bring you joy. If you liked…some one..." Asuka blushed, knowing subconsciously what he was referring to. "You might just find him in your dreams."
想想什么能带给你快乐。如果你喜欢…某个人…" 明日香脸红了，潜意识里明白他在指什么。"你或许会在梦中找到他。"
Asuka felt something wet making contact with her forehead, and felt her eyelids get heavier, and heavier, feeling sleepier and sleepier.
明日香感觉到有什么湿漉漉的东西触碰到了她的额头，眼皮变得越来越沉重，感觉越来越困倦。
It was Christmas Eve. The house was alive with the colors of the holiday; everywhere one could turn they saw green and red and white and gold and silver. The kitchen was filled with the spicy smell of cinnamon, and nutmeg, and everything was mixed with the ever-present pungent smell of fresh pine.
那是圣诞夜，屋子里洋溢着节日的色彩；无论转向何处，都能看到绿、红、白、金、银交织的景象。厨房里弥漫着肉桂和豆蔻的香料味，而这一切又与新鲜松树那无时不在的浓郁气息交融在一起。
And outside, she heard as the carolers broke into laughter and singing, only this time she didn't feel that oppressive weight in her chest, didn't feel like they were mocking or laughing at her anguish, her pain.
外面，她听到唱诗班突然爆发出笑声和歌声，但这一次，她没有感到胸口那沉重的压迫感，没有觉得他们在嘲笑或取笑她的痛苦，她的悲伤。
She felt a brimming feeling of hope, making it foreboding for her to open her eyes from within the great recliner she had fallen asleep, the blanket her mother had been wearing over her shoulders, still lingering with her distinctive smell; sugar and spice and pine and nutmeg, flour and bread and turkey and eggnog.
她感到一种满溢的希望感，这让她在从那张大躺椅中醒来时，睁开眼睛前感到一种不祥的预感，那条她母亲曾披在肩上的毯子，依旧留有她独特的气味；糖与香料，松树与肉豆蔻，面粉与面包，火鸡与蛋奶酒。
Slowly, she felt the tears began to form, and then the little girl was grown up, still trembling, still holding the blanket, the sound of ragged weeping coming from within
渐渐地，她感觉到泪水开始涌出，随后小女孩长大了，依旧颤抖着，依旧紧抱着毯子，从里面传来断断续续的哭泣声
"Asuka-chan...Are you all right..?" She felt the blanket being taken away, and when she opened her eyes saw that her Mother an her Father were in front of her, just like they had before her mother...
"Asuka 酱...你还好吗..?" 她感觉到被子被掀开，睁开眼时，看到母亲和父亲正站在她面前，就像母亲之前那样...
Widening her eyes, and suckling a sniffle, Asuka stared and said nothing, it was until her mother and father extended their arms that Asuka leapt from the chair into their embrace, fusing in a tight group hug, her sniffing and crying being hushed by her father and mother, stroking her head, comforting her and promising everything would be all right.
睁大眼睛，吸了吸鼻子，明日香凝视着一言不发，直到父母伸出手臂，她才从椅子上跳起投入他们的怀抱，紧紧地团聚在一起。她的抽泣和哭泣被父母轻抚着头，安慰着，承诺一切都会好起来。
Making her feel warm and safe and secure once again.
再次让她感到温暖、安全和踏实。
And just as faintly, she saw the image of a thin, handsome young man with dark blue eyes smiling warmly at her. Just as faintly she could swear she heard him mutter something.
她依稀看见一个瘦削英俊、有着深蓝色眼睛的年轻男子正温暖地对她微笑。同样依稀地，她敢发誓听到了他低声说了些什么。
"Merry Christmas, Asuka-chan..."
"圣诞快乐，明日香小妹妹..."
Outside, Santa Claus held Asuka's head in his lap, smiling thoughtfully, seeing her eyes filled with tears. He knelt down and kissed her forehead lightly, washing away her tears.
外面，圣诞老人将明日香的头部放在自己腿上，若有所思地微笑着，看着她眼中噙满泪水。他跪下来，轻轻地吻了吻她的额头，拭去了她的泪水。
"Asuka...you're supposed to be having pleasant dreams...why are you crying..?"
明日香……你应该正在做美梦……为什么在哭呢？
Making up his mind, and deciding to give her what her heart desired the most; his image changed again before shimmering and disappearing like a bubble being burst, splashing Asuka with twinkling dust, covering her now calmed face; her eyes no longer shedding tears; her mouth forming a peaceful smile.
下定决心，决定给予她心中最渴望的东西；他的形象再次变化，随后如泡沫破裂般闪烁消失，洒向明日香的是闪耀的尘埃，覆盖在她已平静的面庞上；她的双眼不再流泪，嘴角勾勒出平和的微笑。
"Asuka-chan, hurry up, your friends will be here shortly." Her mother smiled, finally calming Asuka and convincing her to go upstairs and wash her hand.
"飞鸟酱，快点，你的朋友们马上就到了。" 她的母亲微笑着，终于让飞鸟平静下来，并说服她上楼去洗手。
"I'm ready Mamma..." Asuka smiled. She, like her mother, were dressed in a red felt-like Santa Claus long sleeve dress; her skirt coming down mid thigh, her red boots topped with faux white fur, just like her Santa hat and sleeves, top and bottom of the dress. She walked down and was greeted by her father, who smiled at her before shaking his head at her dress.
"我准备好了，妈妈..." 明日香微笑着。她和母亲一样，身着一件红色绒面质感的圣诞老人长袖连衣裙；裙摆垂至大腿中部，红色靴子顶部装饰着仿白色毛皮，与她的圣诞帽和袖口、裙子的上下边缘相得益彰。她走下楼，迎接她的是父亲，他微笑着看着她，然后对她这身装扮摇了摇头。
'"Asuka, cover yourself..." He said sternly, wagging his finger at her. Asuka smiled and placed the short cape, also of red felt and with the same white trimmings as her dress and boots.
"明日香，遮一下自己……" 他严肃地说，向她摇了摇手指。明日香微笑着，披上了那件短斗篷，也是红色毡料制成，边缘装饰着与她的裙子和靴子相同的白色滚边。
"Much better." Her father said smiling "But the skirt is much too short..."
好多了。"她父亲微笑着说，"但裙子实在太短了……"
"Papa, I wear this type of skirts all the time."
"爸爸，我总是穿这种裙子。"
"Yes, and you always end up punching some poor fellow and calling him a pervert."
是的，而你总是最终揍了某个可怜的家伙，还骂他是变态。
"Well..." Asuka huffed, still smiling "But that's how I met this guy."
"嗯..." 明日香哼了一声，依旧笑着说，"但那就是我遇到这家伙的方式。"
"Ah yes..." her father said absentmindedly, placing some tobacco in his pipe ."The mystery man you are going to finally introduce us to today." Mister Langley said, smirking at her daughter. "Your boyfriend right..?"
"啊，是的..." 她父亲心不在焉地说着，往烟斗里塞了些烟草。"今天你终于要向我们介绍的那位神秘男士。" 兰利先生说着，朝女儿露出一丝戏谑的微笑。"你的男朋友，对吧？"
"Papa..." Asuka blushed turning around. "H-he's not my boyfriend..." She bit her lip and finished softly. "At least not yet..."
"爸爸..." 明日香脸红着转过身来。"他...他不是我男朋友..." 她咬了咬嘴唇，轻声补充道，"至少现在还不是..."
Her father frowned, before smiling again. "Very well liebchein...I just hope they make it..."
她的父亲皱了皱眉，随即又微笑起来。“很好，亲爱的……我只希望他们能成功……”
DING DONG. 叮咚。
Before he could finish, the deep brass chimes of the doorbell signaled the arrival of the guest. Running towards the great oak doors, Asuka opened them to be greeted with Rei's smiling face, behind her Touji and Hikari, and Kensuke and Mayumi were standing with their arms full of gifts.
他还没来得及说完，深沉的黄铜门铃声便宣告了客人的到来。阿苏卡快步跑向那扇巨大的橡木门，打开门后，迎接她的是绫波微笑的面庞，在她身后，东治和光，以及健介和真由美正站在那里，怀里满是礼物。
"Merry Christmas..." All five shouted happily, making their way inside.
"圣诞快乐..." 五人齐声欢呼着，走进屋内。
"Rei..." Asuka pulled her friend aside. "I thought your family was driving you here..."
"零..." 明日香把她的朋友拉到一边，"我以为你家人会开车送你来..."
"They did..." Rei Answered. "My parents and my brother are coming; they're just parking the car."
他们确实来了……”Rei 回答道，“我父母和我弟弟正在过来，他们只是去停车了。”
Without a word, Rei parent came inside, She was the spitting image of her mother, except for the blue hair, since Rei's mother had short brown hair. Her father was almost as tall as Asuka's dad, with a short dark beard framing his jaw line, and tinted glasses. He looked intimidating until he saw her and smiled.
没有说一句话，绫的父母走了进来。她长得和她母亲一模一样，只是头发是蓝色的，因为绫的母亲留着短棕发。她的父亲几乎和明日香的爸爸一样高，下巴上留着短短的深色胡须，戴着有色眼镜。他看起来很吓人，但一看到她便露出了微笑。
"Rei has told me all about you..." He smiled, turning back. "This is Rei's brother."
"Rei 已经跟我详细介绍过你了……"他微笑着转过身来，"这位是 Rei 的哥哥。"
He was tall and thin, with a soft, gentle smile and quiet shy eyes. His hair was almost as white as Rei's, and his hair was gray, probably dyed. Rei had mentioned, after all he was a musician, just like her boyfriend.
他身材高挑瘦削，带着柔和温婉的微笑和略显羞涩的沉静眼神。他的头发几乎和绫一样白，而他的发色是灰的，可能是染过的。毕竟绫曾提到过，他也是一位音乐家，就像她的男友一样。
"How are you..?" He asked in quiet tones, almost as if he were too shy to even speak.
"你好吗……？"他轻声问道，几乎像是害羞到不敢开口。
"Fine, thank you." Asuka smiled at him. Behind her, Mr. Langley was already making good friends with Rei's dad, and she could hear both their mothers chatting away.
"好的，谢谢你。" 明日香对他微笑着。在她身后，兰格雷先生已经和绫波的父亲成为了好朋友，她还能听到两位母亲正聊得起劲。
"Well then I guess we can begin then..."Asuka told no one in particular, seeing all of them chatting away. Just as she was to close the door, some one held it open gently.
"那么我想我们可以开始了..." 明日香对着空气说道，看着大家都在聊天。正当她要关门时，有人轻轻地扶住了门。
Asuka turned to look into familiar dark blue eyes. A warm smile on his lips. "Hi, I'm..." The stranger paused, his eyebrows furrowing not sure of how to continue.
明日香转头望向那双熟悉的深蓝色眼睛，对方唇边挂着温暖的微笑。“嗨，我是……”陌生人停顿了一下，眉头微皱，不确定该如何继续。
"Oh. He's here with me..." Rei said suddenly, dragging him inside by his arm. Asuka felt something stir side but said nothing, focusing instead on the party.
"哦，他跟我在一起..." 丽突然说道，拉着他的胳膊把他拽了进来。明日香感觉到旁边有些动静，但什么也没说，而是专注于派对。
As with all things the party was ending; they had spend the morning riding horses, and the afternoon skating on the frozen pond. They had drank cup after cup of hot beverages, coca and cinnamon coffee, nutmeg and eggnog, gingerbread lattes and spicy chai tea. And all throughout the day, Asuka had felt, for the first time in many years, peace of heart. Deciding to spend some time by herself in the quiet stillness of the night, she opened one of the doors to the courtyard and walked outside, pulling on the long red cape her mother had been wearing before discarding it, saying the spiced rum was making her warm.
如同所有事物一样，派对即将结束；他们上午骑马，下午在结冰的池塘上滑冰。他们一杯接一杯地喝着热饮，有可可和肉桂咖啡，豆蔻和蛋酒，姜饼拿铁和香辣印度奶茶。一整天下来，明日香久违多年地感受到了内心的宁静。决定在夜晚的静谧中独处片刻，她打开通往庭院的一扇门，走了出去，披上了母亲之前穿着后因香料朗姆酒而感到温暖便丢弃的红色长斗篷。
"Are you enjoying yourself..?" A male voice questioned behind her, making her turn in surprise, the same stranger that had arrived with Rei was standing nest to her, admiring the night sky. She blushed when she felt the proximity of his skin next to her.
"你玩得开心吗？"一个男声在她身后问道，让她惊讶地转过身，正是和零一起来的那个陌生人站在她旁边，欣赏着夜空。当她感觉到他的皮肤紧挨着她时，她脸红了。
"Yes, it was a beautiful party."
是的，那是一场美丽的派对。
"It was thrown by a beautiful hostess..." He said quietly, not looking at her. "You got a ton of presents..." He said in a lighter tone, smiling dazzlingly at her in a manner it reminded her of Kaji.
"是一位美丽的女主人扔的……"他轻声说道，没有看她。"你收到了一大堆礼物……"他语气轻松地说，笑容灿烂地看着她，那神情让她想起了卡吉。
"Well...yes...thank you..." She said, blushing. "But you never got one..." Asuka said, noticing for the first time the stranger, although he had participated in the various daily activities had never received a present from anyone.
她红着脸说：“嗯……是的……谢谢你……”“但是你从来没有收到过……”明日香说，这是她第一次注意到这位陌生人，尽管他参与了各种日常活动，却从未从任何人那里收到过礼物。
"Well..." He began, shrugging. "It's not like I need anything, and besides, if everyone else is happy, then I am happy." He responded.
他开始说道，耸了耸肩：“嗯……其实我也没什么需要的，而且如果大家都开心，那我也就开心了。”他回答道。
"Well then...what if I told you it would make me happy to give you a present..?" Asuka asked smiling, making him stare at her strangely, as if considering her answer. When it all started to click in, his eyes widened to twice their size, and a pinkish hue began to cover his cheeks.
那么……如果我告诉你，送你礼物会让我感到快乐呢？" 明日香微笑着问道，这让他用一种奇怪的眼神盯着她，仿佛在考虑她的回答。当一切开始变得明朗时，他的眼睛瞪大到了原来的两倍，脸颊上泛起了淡淡的粉红色。
"W-well..." He stuttered, not knowing what to say or how to say it for the matter. "I-I've never considered what someone might give me..." he said, before smiling sadly and noticing the great clock planted firmly on the center of the courtyard.
"嗯...这个..." 他结巴着，不知道该说什么，也不知道怎么说。"我...我从未想过别人会给我什么..." 他说完，苦笑着注意到庭院中央那座巨大的钟。
The sounds of twelve chimes were heard, and he smiled sadly, turning towards her. "I'm sorry...but I..."
十二声钟响传来，他苦笑着转向她。“对不起……但是……”
"You have to leave..." Asuka finished for him sadly.
"你必须离开了……" 明日香悲伤地替他说完。
"Yes..." He said quietly, before placing his hands on her shoulders. "Asuka-chan...Christmas with you has been really unique...I thank you for that..." He leaned towards her, mere inches separating them.
"是的..." 他轻声说道，随后将双手放在她的肩上。"明日香...和你一起过圣诞真的很特别...谢谢你..." 他倾身靠近她，两人之间仅剩几寸距离。
"I know what you can give...but it's up to you to decide so..."
我知道你能给予什么...但决定权在你...
"Wh-what do you want me to give you..?" Asuka asked in equally quiet tones, looking directly into his eyes.
"你...你想要我给你什么？" 明日香同样轻声问道，直视着他的眼睛。
"Before I tell you...I have to give everyone else their presents…" He said, cupping his hands in front of her, a faint glow, diaphanous and shimmering at the same time emerging from within his palms, slowly he began to open them, a shiny black round object, similar to a pearl located inside.
“在我告诉你之前……我得先给其他人发礼物……”他说着，双手捧在她的面前，掌心透出一抹微弱的光芒，既透明又闪烁。他缓缓地张开手掌，里面躺着一颗闪亮的黑色圆形物体，酷似一颗珍珠。
"Have pleasant dreams everyone, and a merry Christmas to all..." He told the sphere, before releasing it into the night sky, a multitude of small firefly-like lights coming from within. As they left his hands and found his targets, he felt their yearns, their desires.
祝大家美梦成真，圣诞快乐...”他对球体说完，便将其释放到夜空中，球体内涌出众多如萤火虫般的小光点。当这些光点离开他的手，找到各自的目标时，他感受到了它们的渴望，它们的心愿。
He felt their hearts and their hopes, their dreams and their wishes. And he felt moisture in the corner of his eyes.
他感受到了他们的心、他们的希望、他们的梦想和他们的愿望。同时，他也感觉到眼角湿润了。
"So this is why you were crying..." He muttered, letting the tears flow freely. "When people remember their happiest moments, they can't help but cry..." He muttered softly. Wiping his tears with his sleeves, he turned to Asuka.
"所以这就是你哭泣的原因..." 他喃喃自语，任由泪水自由流淌。"当人们回忆起他们最幸福的时刻，他们忍不住会哭..." 他轻声低语。用袖子擦去泪水，他转向明日香。
"Asuka-chan...Before I go...can you give me my gift..?"
明日香酱……在我走之前……你能把礼物给我吗？
Asuka stood there, then, without thinking, she slowly closed the distance between them. She cupped his face in her hands and standing on her tipi-toes she inched his and her lips closer.
明日香站在那里，随后，未经思索，她缓缓拉近了彼此的距离。她双手捧起他的脸庞，踮起脚尖，一点一点地将两人的唇靠近。
It was a soft, tentative kiss. Like two people who barely knew each other shook their hands. Slowly, the kiss began to deepen, like two long lost friends enveloping the other into a hug, emotions so powerful, yet so pure words weren't the perfect medium for them to be explained.
那是一个轻柔而试探性的吻，宛如两个几乎不相识的人轻握对方的手。渐渐地，吻开始加深，如同久别重逢的朋友紧紧相拥，情感如此强烈却又纯净，以至于言语无法完美诠释。
Slowly, he began to shimmer, a low enveloping him from the inside, growing out towards the night. His figure began to grow faint against the night light, and Asuka felt a moist warm presence on her mouth, before that same presence changed from warm into cold.
渐渐地，他开始闪烁，一股低沉的力量从他体内涌出，向着夜色蔓延。他的身影在夜光中逐渐变得模糊，而明日香感到唇上有一股湿润的温暖，随后那股温暖又转变为寒冷。
It was mere days afterwards that Shinji Ikari came back to Tokyo to stay for good, and he and Asuka Langley Soryu were reunited in this world as well.
仅仅几天后，碇真嗣回到东京永久定居，他和惣流·明日香·兰格雷也在这个世界上重逢了。
"ACHOOO!" "阿嚏！"
With a start, Asuka woke up, scratching her nose and sniffling. Yawning, she noticed the sun was starting to go up, and saw her clock.
阿苏卡猛地醒来，挠了挠鼻子，吸了吸鼻子。她打着哈欠，注意到太阳开始升起，看到了自己的闹钟。
7.00 A.M. 12/26/2006 早上 7:00 2006 年 12 月 26 日
Yawning again, Asuka got up and walked towards her bathroom, feeling something pull at the back of her head. A distant memory, something that felt out of place, but held a non-threatening aura, making her feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Silently, she took a hot shower, and brushed her teeth. After several minutes, she got out the bathroom and padded to her room, toweling herself dry. She emerged putting on a black skirt and pulling an ivory turtle neck sweater over her head.
再次打了个哈欠，明日香起身走向浴室，感觉后脑勺有什么东西在拉扯。那是一段遥远的记忆，有些格格不入，却带着一种无害的气息，让她内心感到温暖而舒适。她默默地洗了个热水澡，刷了牙。几分钟后，她走出浴室，轻手轻脚地回到房间，用毛巾擦干身体。随后，她穿上一条黑色裙子，将一件象牙白的套头毛衣拉过头顶。
Just as she was finishing getting dressed, she heard her cell phone's ring tone with the familiar "Anta Baka..?" scream that had made her both feared and respected in high school and college.
就在她快要穿好衣服时，听到了自己手机铃声中那熟悉的“安踏笨蛋..？”尖叫声，这个声音曾在她的高中和大学时代让她既令人畏惧又受人尊敬。
"Hey Stooge..." She smiled, already in banter mode.
"嘿，跟班..." 她微笑着，已经进入了调侃模式。
"Asuka it's me Hikari..."
“Asuka，是我，Hikari……”
"Whaa...Hikari..? What are you doing talking from the stooge's phone..?"
哇...光..？你怎么会用小丑的电话说话..？
"Don't you remember..? Yesterday at the party we all said we'd accompany Rei to the train station..."
你难道不记得了吗？昨天在派对上，我们都说过要陪 Rei 去火车站的……
Hazily, the memories came back to Asuka, something that seemed doff, yet so right at the same time.
朦胧中，记忆涌回明日香心头，那感觉既陌生又无比正确。
"We were wondering if you were home so we could come by and grab a bite to eat..." Hikari's voice drew her to the real world again.
我们想知道你是否在家，这样我们就可以顺便过来吃点东西……"光的声音再次将她拉回了现实世界。
"But...you and Touji live on the other part of town, what gives..?"
但是...你和冬二住在镇子的另一边，这是怎么回事..？
"Asuka..." The red head could clearly hear the strain on her friend's voice. "We came here with Mayumi, Kensuke and Rei to pick up somebody, but the main road is closed 'cause of the snow We are about 5 minutes away from your apartment and Rei said she wasn't able to buy anything to eat, so..."
"明日香……"红发女孩清晰地听出了朋友声音中的紧张。"我们和真由美、健介还有丽一起来这里接人，但因为下雪，主干道封闭了。我们离你的公寓大概还有 5 分钟路程，丽说她买不到任何吃的，所以……"
"Well..." Asuka sighed as she cradled the phone on her shoulder and peered inside the fridge. "Hate to tell you, but all I have is..."
"嗯..." 明日香叹了口气，将电话夹在肩上，朝冰箱里望去。"不想告诉你，但我这里只有..."
Asuka blinked, closing the door and opening it gain to make sure she wasn't seeing things. In front of her, a good sized Christmas cake topped with whipped cream and strawberries with the familiar figure of Santa made from sugar greeted her. This Santa, however was not covered with a creamy beard, but was rather clean shaver, sporting chocolate hair under the red conical hat.
明日香眨了眨眼，关上门又重新打开，以确认自己没有看错。在她面前，一个大小适中的圣诞蛋糕映入眼帘，上面铺满了鲜奶油和草莓，还有用糖制成的熟悉的圣诞老人形象向她致意。然而，这位圣诞老人并没有奶油般的大胡子，而是一个干净利落的剃须形象，戴着红色圆锥帽，巧克力色的头发隐约可见。
"...cake..." "...蛋糕..."
He also had a pair of dark blue eyes painted with frosting.
他还有一双用糖霜绘制的深蓝色眼睛。
"That's great! So can we come..?"
太好了！那我们可以来吗？
"Y-yeah..." Asuka said, shakily, trying to remember when was she able to buy the cake if she came home directly after the party and had no memories of getting up earlier to buy it, or of any cake shop opening before 8.00 a.m.
"嗯...嗯..." 明日香颤抖着说，努力回忆如果她在派对结束后直接回家，何时能买到蛋糕，因为她既没有早起购买的记忆，也没有任何蛋糕店在早上 8 点前开门的印象。
"I guess you can come...I'll put on some tea and we can have the Christmas cake."
我想你可以来...我泡点茶，咱们一起吃圣诞蛋糕吧。
"Great...we'll see you in a couple..."
好的...过会儿见...
"Hey Asuka...how was Christmas morning...?" Hikari asked as she came into the small flat, taking of her beanie and gloves. Behind her Touji, Mayumi, and Kensuke walked saying their hellos.
"嘿，明日香……圣诞节的早晨怎么样？" 光一边走进小公寓，一边摘下她的无檐帽和手套问道。在她身后，徳和、真由美和大辅也跟着走了进来，纷纷打招呼。
"Ugh...I felt like I had slept for a couple of days straight..." She exited the kitchenette and gave each of them two cups of steaming hot tea. "Where's wonder girl..?"
"呃...我感觉自己好像连续睡了几天似的..." 她从厨房出来，给他们每人递上两杯热气腾腾的茶。"奇迹女孩去哪儿了？"
Just as she had finished asking about her, Rei walked inside; behind her was a young man their same age, with a quiet, shy smile, dark brown hair and dark blue eyes. Asuka felt something stir deep within herself. Silently she motioned Hikari to come with her to the kitchenette.
就在她刚问完关于她的事情时，丽走了进来；她身后跟着一个同龄的年轻男子，他带着安静、羞涩的微笑，有着深棕色的头发和深蓝色的眼睛。明日香感到内心深处有什么东西在涌动。她默默地示意光跟她一起去小厨房。
"Hey Hikari...who is that..? The musician boyfriend who plays classical music..?"
嘿，光……那是谁？那个演奏古典音乐的音乐家男友吗？
"Who..?" Hikari asked innocently, just as she motioned for Mayumi and Rei to come towards them.
"谁..?" 光天真地问道，同时示意真由美和丽向她们靠拢。
"Asuka..." Rei said as she held a quiet smile. "This is Shinji...Shinji Ikari..."
"明日香……" 绫波带着淡淡的微笑说道，"这是真嗣……碇真嗣……"
He held out his hand "Nice to meet you." He said with a faint smile, as if he remembered her from someplace.
他伸出手，“很高兴见到你。”他带着淡淡的微笑说道，仿佛在某个地方记得她。
"Like wise." Asuka quietly responded, feeling a jolt of electricity pass thru their fingertips when they touched. Just then, she heard both boys and the three girls gasp. In confusion, both she and Shinji looked upwards, following their smiling faces.
"同样如此。" 明日香轻声回应，当他们的手指触碰时，她感到一股电流穿过指尖。就在那时，她听到两个男孩和三个女孩同时倒吸一口气。困惑中，她和真嗣抬头望去，顺着他们微笑的面庞。
Directly on top of them a mistletoe branch was hanging form the tinsel covering the entrance to the kitchen area.
就在他们上方，一枝槲寄生枝条悬挂着，从厨房区域入口处覆盖的亮闪闪装饰物中垂下。
"Uh…" Shinji stuttered, not looking at Asuka. "you really don't have to if you don't want to…" He bean before a brief memory of something that felt like a dream flashed thru her mind.
"呃…" 真嗣结巴着，没有看明日香。"如果你真的不想，你真的不必…" 他开口说道，紧接着她的脑海中闪过一段仿佛梦境般的短暂记忆。
"Asuka-chan...Before I go...can you give me my gift..?"
明日香酱……在我走之前……你能把礼物给我吗？
Without thinking, Asuka slowly cupped his face within her hands. Standing on her tipi-toes, she inched his lips closer to hers.
未经思索，明日香缓缓地用手捧住了他的脸。她踮起脚尖，一点点地将他的唇靠近自己的唇。
And everyone else witnessed in surprise how this two complete strangers who had never seen each other before this day exchanged a kiss that made the current couples take notes for future references.
而其他人则惊讶地目睹了这一幕：两个此前从未谋面的完全陌生人在这一天交换了一个吻，让在场的情侣们纷纷记下以备将来参考。
"You see Rei…" Hikari began, once she was able to unhinge her mouth and close it. "And you doubted they would hit it off…"
"你看，零……" 光开始说道，一旦她能够张开嘴巴并合上它。"你还怀疑他们不会相处融洽……"
AN: Well...The whole idea was adapted from a short chapter from the Ai-Ao (Ai Yori Aoshi) Manga, vol. 5 from TOKYOPOP pgs. 105-146. At first, I though about making Asuka the Santa Claus and Shinji...well...Shinji. However, even though it would have been funny as hell to write Asuka as an anger-prone Santa ghost, I felt Shinji had a more "Santaness" about him.
AN：嗯...这个想法源自《爱相随（Ai Yori Aoshi）》漫画第 5 卷，由 TOKYOPOP 出版，第 105 至 146 页的短篇chapter。起初，我考虑让明日香扮演圣诞老人，而真嗣...就是真嗣。尽管将明日香写成一个易怒的圣诞幽灵会非常搞笑，但我感觉真嗣身上更有一种“圣诞气质”。
Immense thanks go to ERROR809 for his proofreading abilities; if this stinking pile of horse-crap is the least enjoyable he had a lot to do; other wise it would look like this:
深切感谢 ERROR809 的校对能力；如果这堆臭马粪还算得上是他校对中最不令人愉快的一次，那他功不可没；否则，它看起来会是这样：
"OMG Shinji I LAWD U"
天啊，真嗣，我太崇拜你了！
"OMG ASUKA I LUV U 2."
天啊，明日香我也爱你 2。
Brrrr… 哆嗦..
The thing I like about AU's such as these is that you can have some artistic liberties when dealing with the setting and the character dynamics, as well as their characteristics. I know that Asuka came as OOC on several parts of the story (including the dream sequence) but keep in mind that
我喜欢这类同人作品的地方在于，在处理背景设定、角色关系及其特征时，可以拥有一定的艺术自由度。我知道故事中有些部分明日香显得有些 OOC（包括梦境序列），但请记住，
They are older, hence more mature. And
他们年纪较大，因此更为成熟。
They were drunk, so the interaction between Asuka and Rei while OOC for them both, fall between the intoxicated "I-like-you-even-though-I-hate-you" drunken ramble.
他们喝醉了，因此明日香和绫波丽之间的互动虽然对于她们两人来说都有些出戏，却落入了那种醉酒后“尽管我讨厌你，但我还是喜欢你”的胡言乱语之中。
On a side note, Betcha everyone reading this thought Rei's musician boyfriend was Shinji. Heh. Sorry about the misleads and red herrings. The thing is, Rei never mentioned her brother's name or his appearance through out the story, as well as her father nor her mother. Asuka's dream made the assumption that Rei's brother should share her same genetic make up, hence Kaworu. I was thinking of introducing Yui and Gendo as Mr. and Mrs. Ayanami, but figured that would be a bit too much.
顺便一提，我敢打赌每个读到这里的人都以为绫波的男友是真嗣。呵。抱歉给大家带来了误导和烟雾弹。实际上，绫波在整个故事中从未提及她哥哥的名字或外貌，也没有提到她的父亲或母亲。明日香的梦境让我们误以为绫波的哥哥应该与她有相同的基因构成，因此才有了渚薰。我本想把碇唯和碇源堂设定为绫波夫妇，但觉得那样可能有点过头了。
Hope you liked it. A better story than this, so good that, on a subconscious level, I'm sure I probably based some of this story's scenes and phrases, is Christmas Cards or Riding Through Tokyo3 by Klaus. You should definitely check it out.
希望你喜欢。有一个比这更好的故事，好到在潜意识层面，我确信我可能借鉴了这个故事中的一些场景和语句，那就是 Klaus 的《圣诞卡片》或《穿越东京 3》。你绝对应该去看看。
Also, this was made before Zentrodi's posting of his Omake for What We Make of It. No intention to double team on the setting or the concept.
此外，这是在 Zentrodi 发布他为《我们所创造的一切》创作的番外篇之前完成的。无意在设定或概念上进行双重合作。
Like it..? Hate it..? Tell me why...meanwhile...
喜欢它吗？讨厌它吗？告诉我为什么……与此同时……
Mr. Blair has left the building.
布莱尔先生已经离开了大楼。

### Chapter 03 Themes: K#23 (Candy), W#15 (I'll protect you)
主题：K#23（糖果），W#15（我会保护你）
Title: Groping in the Darkness
标题：在黑暗中摸索
A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like.
作者注：我在这里为自己辩解一下：这不是我的作品。我正试图摆脱写作瓶颈，所以我会同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式，融入一个故事中。希望你喜欢。
I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly. The setting is…well…you know they'll end up kissing, so I'm not gonna spoil the ending.
如果我还被卡住，我会再更新一篇短文，如果没有，那就期待另外的chapter篇简述的 10 件事。背景设定嘛……嗯……你知道他们最终会接吻的，所以我就不剧透结局了。
Nyah! 喵哈！
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这就是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
"Stop it, Shinji! You're hurting me!"
住手，真嗣！你弄疼我了！
"Wait a minute. Let me move it a little to the left."
等一下。让我把它稍微往左移一点。
"OWWW-THAT HURT IDIOT." 哎哟，好痛，你个笨蛋。
"Sorry…" Shinji said meekly. "There. Is it better..?" His breath so close Asuka could feel the warm, moist caress of it in her cheek.
"对不起…" 真嗣怯懦地说道，"这样，好点了吗…？" 他的呼吸如此之近，明日香能感觉到那温暖而湿润的气息轻抚着她的脸颊。
Unfortunately, that was all she could do…feel. Seeing was out of the question as her world was currently plunged in darkness.
遗憾的是，她只能做到这些…感受。看见东西是不可能的，因为她的世界此刻正沉浸在黑暗之中。
"No. It's not better." Asuka grumbled, whishing he couldn't see her blush.
"不，并没有更好。" 明日香嘟囔着，希望他看不到自己脸红。
"Try backing up." 试试后退。
"I tried that already. I told you. IT'S STUCK..!" The red head shouted, making a fuss of the motion, hoping he could see it.
"我试过了，已经告诉你了。它卡住了！"红发女孩大声喊道，夸张地做着手势，希望他能看见。
"I'm sorry…" Shinji said, reeling back, swiftly evading the punch aimed at his shoulder. "Should I push on your shoulders?" He asked from a safe distance, happy that Asuka couldn't mover her arms farther than that.
"对不起…" 真嗣说着，迅速后退，躲开了朝他肩膀挥来的一拳。"我应该按住你的肩膀吗？" 他保持安全距离问道，庆幸明日香的手臂无法伸得更远。
Asuka whined, "I don't know. I'm just so tired. I want out of here and into my own warm bed."
明日香抱怨道：“我不知道，我只是太累了。我想离开这里，回到我那温暖的床上。”
"I promise," Shinji assured her, struggling again, strain clearly coating his voice. "As soon as we get home I'll draw you a hot bath. I'll even make those bratwursts you are so fond of."
“我保证，”真嗣向她保证，再次挣扎着，声音中明显带着紧张。“我们一回到家，我就给你放热水澡。我还会做你非常喜欢的那些德国香肠。”
But Asuka wasn't so easily moved. "You'll do that…for starters." She flashed a feral smile. "I think I might need a full body massage as well…"
但明日香可不是那么容易被感动的。“你就从那个开始吧……”她露出了野性的微笑，“我想我可能还需要一次全身按摩……”
Shinji knew he was being bullied around, but he also knew this whole fiasco, and Asuka's current plight was all is fault, so he did the wisest thing one could ever do when confronting Asuka Langley Soryu.
真嗣知道自己正在被欺负，但他也明白，这一切混乱以及明日香目前的困境都是他的错，所以在面对明日香·兰格雷·索西尔时，他做了最明智的选择。
He yielded. 他屈服了。
Besides, the prospect of being able to give Asuka a full body massage, and thus being able to watch her bare back and legs was always a bonus on his book.
此外，能够给明日香做全身按摩，从而得以欣赏她裸露的背部和双腿，对他来说始终是件美事。
"Yes, and I'll personally massage all your sore muscles. " Shinji tried to sound nonchalant, and failed miserably.
"是的，我会亲自为你按摩所有酸痛的肌肉。" 碇真嗣试图表现得漫不经心，却惨遭失败。
"And a foot massage…" Asuka wasn't about to let the opportunity slip by. She glared thru the darkness enveloping her eyes hoping her tone of voice could convey the message clearly.
"还有足部按摩……" 明日香不打算放过这个机会。她透过黑暗凝视着，希望自己的语气能清楚地传达信息。
"Yes. A foot massage as well."
是的，还有足部按摩。
Asuka scoffed, "That's a good thing. My right foot is beginning to cramp up."
明日香嗤笑道：“那倒是好事，我的右脚开始抽筋了。”
They remained quiet for a moment, both trying to fully understand the mess they were in and trying to come with a solution for it. Still sightless, Asuka could only focus on the rest of her senses. She could smell Shinji's scent, could feel his whole presence, the warmth emanating from his body,. She could hear his faint breathing, deep intakes of air followed by the quiet exhalation from his nose. She could also taste his sweat, intermingled with her own sweat. She slowly began to feel slightly aroused and prayed once again that Shinji wasn't able to see her forming blush.
他们沉默了一会儿，都在尽力理解自己所处的困境并寻找解决之道。阿苏卡依旧看不见，只能依赖其他感官。她能闻到真嗣的气味，感受到他的存在，以及他身体散发出的温暖。她能听见他微弱的呼吸，深吸一口气后从鼻孔轻轻呼出。她还能尝到他汗水与自己汗水的混合味道。渐渐地，她感到一丝兴奋，再次祈祷真嗣看不到她脸上泛起的红晕。
Or notice how she pressed her legs together.
或者注意到她如何将双腿紧紧并拢。
"I have an idea." His voice cut thru the tension and the stillness, shattering the quiet in the dark.
"我有一个想法。" 他的声音划破了紧张与静谧，打破了黑暗中的寂静。
"What?" She felt his hands softly, almost reverently enveloping her leg, almost afraid that it might break.
"什么？" 她感觉到他的双手轻柔地，几乎是虔诚地包裹着她的腿，几乎害怕它可能会碎裂。
"Trust me." Shinji simply whispered, making Asuka shudder; she felt her mouth go dry and attempted to reassert control with a quip.
"相信我。" 真嗣轻声低语，让明日香不禁颤抖；她感到口干舌燥，试图用一句俏皮话重新掌控局面。
"The last time I trusted you, you never said it would hurt this much."
上次我信任你时，你从未说过会这么痛。
"I'm sorry…" Shinji had the decency to sound flustered.
"对不起…" 真嗣还算有礼貌，声音显得有些慌乱。
"Okay. Point taken." Asuka sighed "I guess that was your idiot way of trying to be helpful." Asuka's voice trailed off. "But I have to say, next time, we try if without the harness first. I'm new to the whole scene, and I don't appreciate being suspended by my hands and arms. If you had thought it thru, then my hands would have been free. And we would have tried it first in the bedroom instead of outside."
"好吧，我明白了。" 明日香叹了口气，"我猜那是你笨拙的方式，试图帮忙。" 她的声音渐渐减弱，"但我得说，下次我们先试试不用安全带。我对这一切还很陌生，我不喜欢被双手吊着。如果你考虑周全，我的手本可以自由活动。而且我们应该先在卧室尝试，而不是在外面。"
"I don't think we could manage to pull this off in the bedroom." Shinji sounded perplexed, making Asuka realize that he didn't get the sexual pun. "Besides, I'm sure the RA's at the dorms would flip when she saw us like this."
"我觉得我们在卧室里恐怕搞不定这个。" 真嗣听起来很困惑，让明日香意识到他没听懂那个性暗示。"再说，宿舍的管理员要是看到我们这样，肯定会大发雷霆的。"
"Nah…Hikari's cool…" Asuka grunted offhandedly, twisting and attempting to get free again. Shinji gasped when he saw the ropes straining.
“嗯……光挺酷的……”明日香随口嘟囔着，扭动身体试图再次挣脱。当真嗣看到绳索紧绷时，他倒吸了一口凉气。
"Asuka, please stop I'm sure you'll only get it tighter if you continue to push it in."
明日香，请停下，我相信如果你继续推进，只会让它变得更紧。
Asuka's grunts turned into a snicker, and finally gave in to a giggle. "You're right, it's pretty tight. For the last three or four hours, I've been having to turn my head sideways just to make my neck rest. I wonder how low the ceiling is, anyway." She asked as she turned her sightless eyes to the top.
明日香的呻吟变成了窃笑，最终忍不住笑出声来。“你说得对，这里确实很挤。过去三四个小时，我不得不歪着头才能让脖子休息。真好奇这屋顶到底有多低。”她边说边将失明的双眼转向上方。
"How big is your foot..?"
你的脚有多大？
To say Shinji's question broke the intimate, trusting mood was an oxymoron. Asuka's nose and face scrunched as she attempted to understand the logic behind the moronic question.
要说真嗣的问题打破了亲密信任的氛围，这本身就是个矛盾。明日香皱起鼻子和脸，试图理解这个愚蠢问题背后的逻辑。
"My foot..?" 我的脚..？
"How long is your foot, in inches?" She could sense Shinji's face so close to her, the combination if senses; smell, feel, taste…all blurred themselves and where making her horn-wait…Shinji was speaking again.
"你的脚有多长，以英寸计？"她能感觉到真嗣的脸离她如此之近，各种感官交织在一起；气味、触感、味道……一切都变得模糊不清，让她感到一阵眩晕——等等……真嗣又开始说话了。
"…That way I can probably get you out of here."
那样我或许能把你从这里救出去。
Asuka attempted to gather the conversation but came out blank, so she did what was more asy for her.
明日香试图回忆起谈话内容，却一无所获，于是她选择了对她来说更简单的方式。
She exploded. 她爆发了。
"What kind of moronic question is that..? I don't know how big my foot is because I've never measured it..." Asuka forced herself calm as soon as she felt Shinji slowly inching away. Calm down, deep calming breathes, never mind the pressure she felt on her breast every time she took one of those deep calming breaths.
"这是什么蠢问题啊..？我不知道我的脚有多大，因为我从没量过它..." 明日香强迫自己冷静下来，当她感觉到真嗣正慢慢挪开时。冷静，深呼吸，不要在意每次深呼吸时胸口感受到的压力。
"How would I know..?" Asuka grumbled under her breath. "It's a size eleven. That would be a size ten in men's shoes."
"我怎么知道啊..." 明日香小声嘟囔着，"这是十一码的，换成男鞋就是十码了。"
"Your foot would literally be a foot long, then." Shinji pondered quietly, before a snicker escaped his mouth.
"你的脚真的会有一英尺长，那可真有意思。" 真嗣默默地思考着，随后忍不住轻声笑了出来。
"That's kinda funny, don't you think..?"
这有点好笑，你不觉得吗..？
"Yeah, Shinji; really funny…" Asuka blew the hair from her face before shouting in, what she hoped to be, Shinji's general direction. "Get your ass up here and help me down, idiot."
“是啊，真嗣；真搞笑…”明日香吹开脸上的头发，然后朝着她希望是真嗣的大致方向喊道：“快点上来帮我下去，笨蛋。”
Immediately after, she felt someone fidgeting with the rope circling her ankle.
紧接着，她感觉到有人在她脚踝上的绳圈上动来动去。
"What are you doing?" 你在做什么？
"I'm trying to untangle your foot. Maybe you can wiggle your foot out and then I can get the boot unstuck." Shinji explained. "There. Give it a try."
我正在尝试解开你的脚。也许你可以试着扭动脚踝，这样我就能把靴子弄松了。" 真嗣解释道，"好了，试试看吧。
"Ouch!" 哎哟！
"What's the matter?" 怎么了？
"Dammit dammit dammit," Asuka grumbled. "I hurt my knee. I can't bend my leg without digging my knee into the tree where we tied everything for support." She sighed. "It's no use. There's just no room to move."
"该死，该死，该死，"明日香嘟囔着。"我膝盖受伤了。我一弯腿膝盖就顶到我们绑东西支撑的那棵树上了。"她叹了口气。"没用的，根本就没地方挪动。"
After a long silence, Asuka said. "You're awfully quiet, Shinji. What are you thinking?"
长时间的沉默后，明日香开口道：“你今天特别安静，真嗣。你在想什么呢？”
"I'm thinking we need to get you out of here." He said in a quiet, and what he hoped sounded like a reassuring tone. "There's nothing left to do but for me to pound the back while you push as hard as you can backwards. It's the only way to untangle it."
“我在想，我们得让你离开这儿。”他轻声说道，尽量让自己的语气听起来令人安心。“现在唯一能做的就是我在后面敲打，而你则尽力向后推。这是解开这个结的唯一办法。”
Meekly, Asuka agreed. "Just don't break anything, please."
阿苏卡温顺地同意了。“只是请不要弄坏任何东西。”
"I promise." Shinji gently cupped her face in his hand, conveying as much resolve and sincerity as he could on his voice. "Don't worry; I'll protect you." Gently he placed his lips on hers for a brief butterfly-like kiss, earning a smile from the redhead.
"我保证。" 碇真嗣轻柔地用手捧起她的脸，尽力让自己的声音充满决心与真诚。"别担心，我会保护你。" 他温柔地将自己的唇贴上她的，犹如蝴蝶轻触般的短暂一吻，让红发女孩露出了微笑。
"Ready?" "准备好了吗？"
"Yes." Asuka said taking in a deep breath, resolve clearly in her voice. "I'm ready."
"是的。"明日香深吸一口气说道，语气中透着坚定。"我准备好了。"
"Push." Shinji simply commanded. "Again." He panted. "Again." He gasped.
"推。" 真嗣简单地命令道。"再来。" 他喘着气说。"再来。" 他喘息着说。
"Ow, ow, ow." Asuka grunted in rhythm.
"哎哟，哎哟，哎哟。" 明日香有节奏地哼哼着。
"Keep pushing. I'm going to pound it a little harder now."
继续推进。我现在要加大力度了。
"I am pushing! Ow ow! Stop..!"
我在推！哎哟哎哟！停下..！
"What's the matter..?" Shinji asked, breathless.
"怎么了..?" 真嗣喘着气问道。
"What do you think..? My ass hurts; I've been in the same position for almost an hour now…"
你觉得呢？我的屁股疼死了，我已经保持同一个姿势快一个小时了……
"Hey, this isn't doing me any good either." Shinji complained.
"嘿，这对我也没什么好处。" 真嗣抱怨道。
A soft whimper was all the answer he got from the usually outspoken redhead
平日里直言不讳的红发女子，此刻只传来了一声低低的呜咽，作为对他的回应
"I'm sorry, Asuka...Please don't cry."
对不起，明日香……请不要哭。
"I'm not crying." Asuka protested, in a whispering sob.
"我没在哭。" 明日香抗议道，声音带着哽咽的低语。
"Yes, you are. I can hear you." Shinji whispered back.
"是的，你能听见我。" 真嗣轻声回应道。
"Well, do you blame me..?" Asuka whimpered. "I'm tired, I'm sore and I'm stuck. Don't tell me not to cry." Under her breath, Asuka added. "Idiot."
"唉，你怪我吗？" 明日香抽泣着说，"我累了，我疼，我被困住了。别告诉我不要哭。" 她低声补充道，"傻瓜。"
"I heard that, too." 我也听说了。
"You wanna hear something else..? I'm scared!"
你想听点别的吗？我害怕！
"Scared..? There's nothing to be scared of." Shinji responded automatically. "We'll get you out."
"害怕吗？没什么好怕的。" 真嗣下意识地回应道，"我们会把你救出来的。"
"Before it rains..?" Asuka asked dully.
"下雨前……？"明日香无精打采地问道。
"Rain..? It's not supposed to rain today." Shinji said absentmindedly.
"下雨了..？今天应该不会下雨的。" 真嗣心不在焉地说道。
"Mein Gott..!" Asuka snorted. "Did you even check the weather report before you brought me here..? It could be raining right now. There could be a wall of water headed right for us!"
"我的天啊..!" 明日香哼了一声。"你带我来这里之前有没有查过天气预报..? 现在可能正在下雨。可能有一堵水墙正朝我们冲来！"
"Is it supposed to rain..?"
"会下雨吗？"
"You tell me," Asuka said sarcastically. "It was your job to find out, Mr. Lets-try-something-exciting."
"你告诉我吧，"明日香讽刺地说道，"这本来就是你的任务，去探个究竟，让我们尝试点刺激的先生。"
"No, I'm sure it wasn't." Shinji assured himself. "I'm pretty sure."
"不，我确信那不是。" 真嗣向自己保证道，"我很确定。"
Asuka doubted completely his ability of self-preservation, and she voiced her disapproval in a seething voice. Over their heads, a distant rumble could be heard.
明日香完全怀疑他的自我保护能力，她用激动的声音表达了她的不满。在他们头顶上方，可以听到远处传来的隆隆声。
This was quickly followed by the soft pit-pat made by the falling drizzle.
紧接着，细雨轻柔的滴答声随之而来。
"I'm pretty sure I hate you at this moment."
此刻我非常确定我讨厌你。
After another silence, Shinji asked, "Want me to go for help?"
又是一阵沉默后，真嗣问道：“需要我去寻求帮助吗？”
"And leave me here?" Asuka asked in a panic. "Not on your life! I want to berate you some more. Besides…" She added with a snarl, "'till death do us part and all that. If I'm going to drown down here, so are you."
"把我留在这儿？" 明日香惊慌地问道，"想都别想！我还要继续骂你呢。再说了……" 她咬牙切齿地补充道，"直到死亡将我们分开，还有那些鬼话。如果我要在这下面淹死，你也得陪葬。"
"How romantic." He muttered
"多么浪漫啊。" 他喃喃自语。
"You'd better think romantic, 'cause you know you're not getting any for a least a month after this." Asuka made a wide movement with her suspended body, legs and arms flailing around when suddenly…
你最好想点浪漫的事，因为你知道这次之后至少一个月你都别想了。" 明日香用她悬空的身体做了一个大幅度的动作，双腿和双臂在空中乱挥，突然间……
"Ouch." 哎哟。
"Now what..?" 现在怎么办..？
"My foot. It came loose."
我的脚，它松脱了。
"Just like that..?" Shinji asked, disbelief clear in his voice.
"就这样..?" 真嗣问道，声音中明显带着怀疑。
"Yeah; just like that." Easily Asuka began to untangle her body from the mess or coils of ropes, harness and pulleys. "Maybe you almost had it loose before."
"对，就像那样。" 轻松地，明日香开始从那一团乱麻般的绳索、安全带和滑轮中解脱出来。"或许你之前差点就解开了。"
"Maybe." Shinji didn't sound convinced. "Can you wiggle it?"
"或许吧。" 真嗣听起来并不信服。"你能动动它吗？"
"Yeah. It's sore, but it will work." Asuka grunted as she slowly began to lower herself. "Gott sie Danke. Now, let's get out of here."
“嗯，是挺疼的，但还能动。”明日香一边咕哝着，一边缓缓地开始下蹲。“感谢上帝。现在，我们离开这儿吧。”
"Wait," Shinji said brusquely. "I need to return all of the rented equipment." He grunted as he began to fumble about in the dark enclosed space. "Feel around to see if there's anything besides you."
"等等，" 真嗣粗声说道，"我得把租来的所有设备都还回去。" 他一边在黑暗的封闭空间里摸索，一边发出哼声，"摸摸看，除了你还有没有别的东西。"
"I don't feel anything." Asuka said in a clear I'm-not-moving-at-all mode.
"我什么感觉都没有。" 明日香以一种清晰的不动声色的模式说道。
"Hey…HEY..!" Her undignified squeal made Shinji stop. "Watch where you're groping!"
"嘿……嘿！" 她那有失体面的尖叫让真嗣停了下来。"注意你的手摸哪儿了！"
"Sorry." His response made Asuka chuckled.
他的回答让明日香忍不住笑了出来。
"Okay. You go first. Just be careful." Under his breath and trying to make sure Asuka didn't hear him, Shinji added a soft "Bigfoot."
"好的，你先走。小心点。" 他低声说着，尽量不让明日香听见，又轻声补了一句 "大脚怪。"
"That ended well…" Asuka began as she attempted to rub some feeling into her much abused appendages. "Considering I was wedged between the floor and ceiling of this stupid passageway." She dusted herself and flipped her red tresses into a messy high ponytail. "I can't believe I ended up stuck in a twelve-inch crawl space with a million tons of stone and limestone over my head. Don't ever ask me to go cave crawling with you again. You got that?"
"这结局还不错…" 明日香一边说着，一边试图揉搓她那饱受折磨的四肢，以恢复些许知觉。"考虑到我被卡在这愚蠢通道的地板和天花板之间。" 她掸去身上的灰尘，将红色长发随意扎成一个凌乱的高马尾。"真不敢相信我竟然被困在一个十二英寸的爬行空间里，头顶上压着数百万吨的石头和石灰岩。别再让我跟你去洞穴探险了，明白了吗？"
"I promise." Shinji agreed. "Never again." He decided to add his own smart-ass remark. "Although you were the one who said that you knew the whole mechanics and that it was called spelunking…"
"我保证。" 真嗣同意道。"再也不会了。" 他决定加上自己的俏皮话，"虽然是你说你知道全部技巧，还称之为洞穴探险的……"
"And that's the reason we came this late at night, not because we were doing it on the woods…" Shinji finished recounting his story to Toji as both young men shared the warmth of a cup of steaming whiskey and the fireplace from Kaji's cabin.
这就是我们深夜来此的原因，并非因为在树林里行事……" 真嗣向东治讲述完他的故事，两位年轻人共享着一杯热气腾腾的威士忌和来自卡吉小屋壁炉的温暖。
"Come on Man…" Toji laughed at Shinji's red face. "Like I was supposed to know it was an innocent trail outing."
“得了吧，伙计……”东治看着真嗣涨红的脸笑道，“我又怎么知道那只是个单纯的远足活动。”
"Yeah Shin-shin…" an obviously drunken Misato piped from the couch, snuggling next to Kaji. "the way you made it out, it sounded like you were more interested in pounding Asuka's back door in a kinky suspension stunt rather that spelunking…" She downed her own cup of hot whiskey.
"是啊，真真……"显然已经醉醺醺的葛城美里从沙发上探出头来，紧挨着加持说道，"你刚才那么一说，听起来你更想在一场变态的悬吊特技中猛攻明日香的'后门'，而不是去探险……"说完，她一口喝干了手中的热威士忌。
As the night progressed, the two couples and Shinji decided to make their ways to their respective bedrooms. As Shinji entered his and Asuka's room, he went towards the red head to check on her sleep. During the night, Asuka's blanket had somehow ended pooled at her feet, and her night shirt had ridden up showing Shinji a brief peek of her panties. Chuckling to himself, Shinji grabbed the blanket and tucked Asuka in, gently kissing her in the forehead.
随着夜色渐深，两对夫妇和真嗣决定各自回房。真嗣走进他和明日香的房间，走向红发少女查看她的睡姿。夜里，明日香的被子不知怎么滑到了脚边，睡衣也卷了起来，让真嗣瞥见了她的内裤。他轻笑一声，拾起被子为明日香盖好，并在她额头上温柔地吻了一下。
"Shinji…?" Asuka's sleepy voice echoed softly on the darkened room, into the stillness of the night. "Is that you..?"
"真嗣…？"明日香睡意朦胧的声音在昏暗的房间里轻轻回荡，融入夜的静谧中。"是你吗…？"
"Yes, everyone's asleep Asuka…"
是的，大家都睡了，明日香……
"Oh, Shinji..?" Asuka asked in the sweetest voice she could muster, sounding raw and gruff from her sleep and incredibly sexy in Shinji's ears. "Could you come here for a minute?" She asked a she reached for him in the dark.
"哦，真嗣...？"明日香用尽全力发出最甜美的声音问道，由于刚睡醒，她的声音显得有些沙哑，但在真嗣听来却格外性感。"你能过来一下吗？"她在黑暗中伸手向他探去。
"Sure, Asuka. What's the matter?" Shinji asked leaning on his elbow and inching his way closer to Asuka.
当然，明日香。怎么了？" 真嗣一边问，一边用手肘撑着身体，慢慢向明日香靠近。
"Are you close…?" She whispered in a sleepy voice.
"你靠近点……？" 她用困倦的声音低语道。
"Right beside you..." Shinji smiled.
"就在你身边……" 真嗣微笑着。
A loud slap echoed in the darkened room, breaking the stillness of the night.
一声响亮的耳光在昏暗的房间内回荡，打破了夜的静谧。
"Ow..!" Shinji cried in pain, holding the side of his head. "What was that for?"
"哎呀！" 真嗣痛苦地叫着，捂着头的侧面。"这是为什么啊？"
Instead of an immediate response, Asuka rolled to her side and snuggled into the blanket. The sweetness in Asuka's voice was gone as she answered.
没有立即回应，明日香侧身一滚，钻进了毯子里。她回答时，声音中的甜美已不复存在。
"A third date is not supposed to end in stone. Next time just buy me some candy…" She yawned. "A box of chocolates should be fine…" She turned to a pouting Shinji and winked at him.
"第三次约会不该以石头收场。下次就给我买点糖果吧……"她打了个哈欠，"一盒巧克力就挺好……"她转向噘着嘴的碇真嗣，朝他眨了眨眼。
"Or we could try some leather…"
或者我们可以尝试一些皮革……
Author's disconcerting rambles:
作者令人不安的漫谈：
I seriously have no clue where the hell this little piece came, although the basis for this is an actual incident that happened to me and my then girlfriend during a camping trip. Hope you liked it.
我真的一点头绪都没有这个小片段是从哪儿冒出来的，尽管它的基础是我和当时的女友在一次露营旅行中发生的真实事件。希望你喜欢。
Oh, and raise your hands who actually thought they were doing the nasty in a kinky bondage-y way…
哦，举起手来，谁真的以为他们在以一种变态的束缚方式做那事……
Yeah…thought so…go hit the showers…COLD showers, perverts.
是啊…早就料到了…去冲澡吧…冷水澡，变态们。

### Chapter 04 Themes: K#19 (Red), W#25 (Shut up and listen)
主题：K#19（红色），W#25（闭嘴听话）
Title: Colorblind 标题：色盲
A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like. I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly.
A.N.：我打算利用这个空间来为自己辩解：不是我的错。我正试图摆脱写作障碍，因此我决定同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式融入一个故事中。希望你喜欢。如果我仍然受阻，我会更新另一个短篇，否则，期待其他chapter个关于 10 件事的简述。
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
Red. 红色。
It was all red, as far as he could see, as long as he could see, everything since the day he met her became red, his field of vision becoming color blinded by her.
他所见之处，尽是一片红色，自他遇见她那天起，视野中的一切都染上了红色，他的视野因她而变得色彩单一。
It filled his senses, rising like a sweet perfume, emanating from roses redder than blood; so red they made him blind in his eyes, so blinding he could taste the essence in his mouth; a taste so rich he cold almost feel it with his hands, caressing his skin.
它充盈着他的感官，如同馥郁的香气升腾而起，源自比鲜血更红的玫瑰；红得令他目眩，以至于他能从口中尝到那精髓；味道如此浓郁，他几乎可以用手触摸到，轻抚着他的肌肤。
And the sounds, it felt like all the peaceful and fierce sounds one would expect, like the ocean, an ocean of red one minute coming towards with the force of a thousand storms, and the next going away, recoiling in terror at his touch.
而那些声音，仿佛所有平和与狂暴的声音都汇聚于此，就像海洋，一瞬间是红色的海洋带着千重风暴的力量涌来，下一刻又因他的触碰而惊恐退去。
Yeah, if he had to use a force of nature to describe her, it would be the ocean.
是啊，如果要用自然之力来形容她，那一定是海洋。
Oh, it would be very easy to use the most common terms and analogies; the red devil, the she-beast, the heinous, contemptuous bitch from hell. They all used the color that was her signature: the ever glowing, all encompassing red.
哦，用最常见的词汇和比喻来形容她太容易了；红魔女、女妖、可憎的、蔑视一切的来自地狱的恶毒女人。它们都用了她的标志性颜色：那永远闪耀、无所不包的红色。
But Shinji knew better. 但真嗣更明白。
She was no explosion, no raging fire; deep down she was a scared girl who used bravado and fierceness in the same way he used detachment and music.
她并非爆炸，亦非熊熊烈火；内心深处，她只是一个用虚张声势和凶猛来掩饰自己恐惧的女孩，正如他用超然和音乐来掩饰自己一样。
She was the ocean, stormy at night when the dreams became nightmares and she clutched her pillow and cried herself to sleep with those heart wrenching sobs that she forced herself to quiet down to mere whimpers in the night.
她是那片海洋，夜晚波涛汹涌，当梦境化为梦魇，她紧抓枕头，泣不成声，直至入睡，那撕心裂肺的啜泣在夜色中压抑成微弱的呜咽。
Ever since the day he had come inside trying to get himself dry from the ever pounding rain that had drenched him from head to toe.
自从那天他进屋，试图从那倾盆大雨中把自己弄干，雨水从头到脚将他淋了个透。
He had always hated using terms like logical and irrelevant for they stirred up memories he preferred to be asleep, and they left a bitter-sweet after taste, like ashes covered in syrup, but that seemed like the only way to explain his next actions; ordering something to get warm had been the next logical step.
他一直讨厌使用“逻辑”和“无关”这样的词汇，因为它们会激起他宁愿沉睡的回忆，留下一种苦乐参半的余味，就像覆盖在糖浆下的灰烬，但似乎只有这样才能解释他接下来的行为；为了取暖而点东西，是接下来合乎逻辑的一步。
And then she had walked into the stage as quiet as a whisper, but when the light had been trailed up on her, his whole world had changed from a color infused melancholy always painted in blue, into a fiery red, matching her hair, her long tight fitting dress.
然后她悄无声息地走上舞台，但当灯光追随着她亮起时，他的整个世界从总是涂满蓝色的忧郁色调，变成了与她头发相配的火红色，还有她那紧身的长裙。
Her very way of being.
她存在的独特方式。
Just for the brief moment he had stayed there nursing his drink, his world had been colorblind.
就在他短暂停留那里，品着饮料的片刻，他的世界曾是色盲的。
Afterwards she had come to the bar, sitting close to him, but not to close, warding of the fans that came by either smiling coquettishly and then letting them go, or by calling them perverted dirty old men in a voice that promised that, if they behaved she would do any and all they imagined with her.
之后她来到酒吧，坐在离他不远不近的位置，巧妙地挡开了那些凑过来的粉丝，要么妩媚一笑后让他们离开，要么用一种承诺般的语气称他们为变态的猥琐老头，暗示只要他们规矩点，她愿意满足他们所有的幻想。
But she never left. 但她从未离开。
After minutes of staring into the glass in front of them and exchanging furtive glances he decided to leave.
在凝视面前的玻璃并交换了几次偷偷摸摸的眼神后，他决定离开。
As he left, he could've sworn he heard her voice softly saying she played the whole week from 9 till 2.
当他离开时，他几乎可以肯定听到了她轻声说，她整个星期从 9 点演奏到 2 点。
He walked back to that place several more times, her voice and herself becoming like a drug, something he needed to soothe the pain he seemed to feel with every passing moment of the clock as it ticked the seconds away.
他多次重返那个地方，她的声音和她自己变得如同一种药物，他需要它们来缓解随着时钟每分每秒流逝而似乎感受到的痛苦。
She was many things: a glow; a light that made the darkness go away.
她是许多事物的化身：一抹光辉；一束驱散黑暗的光。
Warmth. She was a warm blanket that made the harsh cold truths melt away.
温暖。她就像一床温暖的毯子，让那些严酷冰冷的真相消融。
And then, she became someone who sat quietly next to him after every set she sang, not saying anything, just sitting there in silence, each contemplating their own life, their own fears, their own screw-ups.
然后，她变成了每次唱完一组歌曲后，静静坐在他旁边的人，不发一言，只是默默地坐在那里，各自沉思着自己的生活、自己的恐惧、自己的失误。
Their own sense of despair.
他们自身的绝望感。
And after that, words became a formality; a "Hello, how are you" exchanged softly while waiting for the next set or the next drink. A polite inquiry about the weather, the brief chit chat over the endless droning of the other peoples' voices.
之后，言语变成了一种形式；在等待下一轮或下一杯酒时，轻声交换一句“你好，最近怎么样”。礼貌地询问天气，在他人无休止的谈话声中进行短暂的闲聊。
He learned her name was Asuka and she was from abroad. She disliked dolls, and had a very quick temper, just short of a cannon fuse. She liked her coffee black and only ate the white of the eggs.
他得知她的名字叫明日香，来自国外。她不喜欢玩偶，脾气非常急躁，几乎就像炮仗的引线一样。她喜欢喝纯黑咖啡，只吃蛋白。
She learned his name and that he was from Japan. He was uptight, shy and timid; he would stutter and shake, and whenever he was in a tight spot, his fists would clench and unclench, and his tongue would feel like taffy getting stuck to the roof of his mouth and he would get tongue tied.
她得知了他的名字，知道他来自日本。他紧张、害羞且胆怯；说话会结巴，身体会颤抖，每当处于困境时，他的拳头会紧握又松开，舌头仿佛粘稠的太妃糖卡在口腔上颚，说话变得结结巴巴。
And they shared drinks more often afterwards.
之后他们更频繁地一起分享饮品。
He often fantasized that he was the same she was to her, because there were instants, brief moments in time when she would allow herself to be open, and be viewed in her natural state by him, and he felt a connection, a kindred soul.
他常幻想自己对她而言，如同她对他一样重要，因为在某些瞬间，短暂的时刻里，她会允许自己敞开心扉，以本真面貌呈现在他眼前，而他感受到了一种联系，一种灵魂的共鸣。
And other times, especially when they left for her or his apartment, she would cling to him as if he was a life line, as if her very existence had to be reaffirmed by the notion that someone acknowledged her, that some one needed her.
其他时候，尤其是当他们前往她的或他的公寓时，她会紧紧依附着他，仿佛他是救生索，似乎她的存在必须通过有人认可她、有人需要她的观念来重新确认。
That some one loved her.
有人爱着她。
It became an unspoken agreement; he would drop by any day of the week, or maybe not appear for the whole month; maybe he could see her next Tuesday after this Sunday.
这成了心照不宣的默契；他可能在任何一天顺道来访，也可能整个月都不见踪影；或许在这个周日之后，下周二他就能见到她。
He would walk and he would sit and he would shut up and listen to her sing.
他会走，会坐，会安静下来聆听她唱歌。
And he would feel all of his problems slowly fade away with her voice.
他会感觉到自己的所有问题随着她的声音慢慢消散。
She would sing lounge songs, she would make old rock songs into lounge songs, she would twist and turn the lyrics to suit her needs.
她会唱休闲歌曲，她会把老摇滚歌曲改编成休闲歌曲，她会根据需要调整歌词，使其适应自己的风格。
And then hours later, in the intimacy of their room, she would do the same to him.
几小时后，在他们房间的私密空间里，她也会对他做同样的事情。
But the unspoken agreement was there; this was something not described, something that shouldn't be classified.
但那份心照不宣的默契已然存在；这是不可言说之事，是不应归类之物。
He would leave for a month or two, doing whatever it was that he did on those times, but she would sometimes leave too; not for months but for days.
他会离开一两个月，去做那些他在这段时间里做的事情，但她有时也会离开；不是几个月，而是几天。
The agreement was never to ask what the other had done; they had never vocalized it, but it was explicit for them both.
协议中从未提及要询问对方所做之事；他们虽未明言，但对彼此而言这已是心照不宣。
Then suddenly she left, without saying a word, and Shinji became lost ever since.
然后她突然离开了，一句话也没说，从此真嗣便迷失了方向。
A part of Shinji had been missing Asuka all along. But it wasn't really an active feeling. And it wasn't really missing.
真嗣心中一直有一部分在想念明日香。但这并非一种强烈的情感，也并非真正的思念。
It was more like being incomplete, like walking around not wearing your watch or your glasses.
更像是处于不完整的状态，就像四处走动时没有佩戴手表或眼镜一样。
There was a bit of him that was never quite right since they had parted ways, a change in his very nature that was small and subtle, barely noticeable, but still there. He didn't have to be thinking about her to miss her. He was just different when she wasn't around.
自从他们分道扬镳后，他身上就有那么一点儿始终不太对劲，那是他本性中微妙而细微的变化，几乎难以察觉，却依然存在。他不必刻意去想她，也会感到对她的思念。当她不在身边时，他整个人都变得不同了。
But tonight…tonight he missed her. He missed her, in ordinary, less abstract ways.
但今晚……今晚他想念她。他想念她，以平凡而更具体的方式。
He missed her laugh and he missed the way she would get mad. He missed her ego and he missed the way she would cut of the yolk of her eggs and give it to him in his toast, and how she would pick at his fries while attempting not to, and how he would let her have them, pretending he didn't noticed.
他怀念她的笑声，怀念她生气的样子。他怀念她的自尊，怀念她如何切掉蛋黄，放在他的吐司上，还有她明明不想却忍不住挑拣他的薯条，而他则假装没注意到，任由她享用。
He missed her voice and her striking blue eyes and he missed her soft velvety red hair, her creamy alabaster skin, and her soft pink lips.
他想念她的声音，她那引人注目的蓝眼睛，还有她那柔软如丝绒般的红色秀发，她那奶油般洁白无瑕的肌肤，以及她那柔软粉嫩的双唇。
That was what he missed the most; he missed kissing her. He never considered himself a playboy, a Casanova of any sorts; because to be one you had to be cool and smooth and calm and basically everything he was not.
那正是他最怀念的；他怀念吻她的感觉。他从不认为自己是个花花公子，或任何类型的情场高手；因为要成为那样的人，你必须冷静、圆滑、镇定，基本上就是他完全不具备的特质。
But for some reason, everything went smoothly when he was with her. He couldn't make an awkward move if he wanted to. And when he did make one, she would just smile, call him an idiot and keep on walking. They just fit like pieces in a puzzle, like the letters in a game of scrabble.
但不知为何，有她在身边时，一切进展得异常顺利。他若想做出尴尬的举动都难。即便真有尴尬之举，她也只是微笑着称他一声傻瓜，然后继续前行。他们就像拼图中的碎片，恰似拼字游戏中的字母，完美契合。
They belonged. 他们属于。
And dammit, he missed belonging.
该死的，他怀念归属感。
It was really the first time in ages that he had a physical need to be near her, that his whole body ached with longing and helplessness. He hated it. He really hated it. He didn't need this now. He just didn't need it.
这真的是久违的一次，他身体上迫切需要靠近她，整个身体因渴望和无助而疼痛。他讨厌这种感觉。他真的讨厌。他现在不需要这个。他就是不需要。
But oddly…he wanted it. 但奇怪的是……他想要它。
He shuddered a bit as a gust of wind managed to swoop in through his coat and he hugged the cloth lamely around his body. He looked up and found he had wandered in front of the bar, his bar.
一阵风猛地钻进他的外套，让他不由得打了个寒颤，他无力地用布料紧裹身体。抬头一看，发现自己竟已漫步至酒吧前，他的酒吧。
Their bar. 他们的酒吧。
There was some music drifting softly out of it; "The Midnight Mass" she would call it because every night at midnight, the barman would give his towel to the mauve haired woman that was always rejecting his advances but would get red in the face if he went and lighted that blonde's cigarette. He would go to the piano and begin playing a soft, haunting tune and Asuka would unconsciously start to sing softly to it.
那里飘出一些轻柔的音乐；她会称之为“午夜弥撒”，因为每晚午夜时分，酒吧男侍会将毛巾递给那位总是拒绝他追求的紫发女子，但如果他去为那位金发女郎点烟，她又会脸红。他会走向钢琴，开始弹奏一首柔和而萦绕心头的曲调，而明日香则会不自觉地轻声跟唱起来。
The music had a ghostly quality he found appropriate to his mood. He sighed and sunk down on the steps. He was suddenly feeling very weak and very tired and just generally spent. He wasn't sure how long he was sitting on the steps of the bar before someone called his name.
那音乐带着一种幽灵般的特质，他觉得与自己的心境颇为契合。他叹了口气，颓然坐在台阶上。突然间，他感到极度虚弱和疲惫，整个人仿佛被掏空。他不确定自己在酒吧台阶上坐了多久，直到有人呼唤他的名字。
"Shinji…" "真嗣……"
He looked up and saw Asuka standing there.
他抬头一看，发现明日香正站在那里。
A.N:
Wow. 哇。
This is awkward; it feels redundant and done and clichéd and everything in between both inside and outside.
这很尴尬；感觉多余、陈腐、老套，无论内外都如此。
It feels like "The Hustle" all over again, but I just spent my birthday just like this; in a bar, feeling sorry for myself and wallowing in self pity and then the feelings became a fire in my stomach (no, it wasn't nausea, but it felt pretty damn close), and then the fire became words, and the words became this sharp tingling sensation that you feel in the tip of your fingers that is very much like when you feel the answer to a question and have in your brain, but it's just running around and you're unable to catch it.
感觉就像《骗徒》重演，但我的生日就是这样度过的；在酒吧里，自怨自艾，沉溺于自怜之中，随后这种情绪在胃里燃起了一把火（不，那不是恶心，但感觉也差不多了），接着火化作了言语，言语又变成了指尖那种尖锐的刺痛感，非常类似于当你脑中有了问题的答案，却四处奔走，难以捕捉到它。
And I just had to get up at 4.30 in the morning to get this piece done.
我不得不在清晨 4 点半起床，才能完成这篇作品。
And just as I was putting the finishing period, my cell phone went off and she was calling me and I had to go to her.
就在我刚要加上句号的时刻，我的手机响了，是她打来的电话，我不得不去找她。
I ask for the forgiveness of all the close people who have graciously accepted to review the pieces of guano filled in custard that I spew around pretending to be a literary accomplishment (you can tell I still haven't gotten over the wallowing in self pity part -_-'), but this piece feels so personal and so…well, me (for lacks of a better word) that I just had to edit it myself and post it, because it all happened as it was written (except for the ending, of course), and because sometimes, just sometimes I like drama more than comedy, and I know that Missouri is a state that loves company (dork!)
我请求所有亲近之人的原谅，他们慷慨地接受了审阅我那些充斥着鸟粪般内容的所谓文学作品（看得出我仍未摆脱自怨自艾的泥潭——_-')，但这一篇感觉如此个人化，如此……嗯，我（找不到更好的词），以至于我不得不亲自编辑并发布，因为它正如所写的那样发生（当然，除了结尾），而且有时候，只是有时候，我更喜欢戏剧而非喜剧，我知道密苏里州是个喜欢热闹的地方（书呆子！）
Keep it real, and keep it cool, and for God's sake all you out there keep the hope.
保持真实，保持冷静，看在上帝的份上，你们所有人都要保持希望。
I did, and it paid off; it's not the lottery, but it works for me.
我确实这么做了，而且得到了回报；虽然不是彩票那种，但它对我有效。
That's my story and I'm sticking to it
这就是我的故事，我坚持这么说
Cheers. 干杯。
01.13.07 Revised and further proofread, because it is after all a half-assed attempt at writing. Thanks to all that reviewed, and thanks to all for the words.
01.13.07 修订并进一步校对，毕竟这只是一次半吊子的写作尝试。感谢所有审阅者，也感谢大家的鼓励之词。

### Chapter 05 Themes: K#20 (The Road Home), W#23 (What You Say, What You Mean)
主题：K#20（归途），W#23（言为心声）
Title: After 标题：之后
A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like.
作者注：我在这里为自己辩解一下：这不是我的作品。我正试图摆脱写作瓶颈，所以我会同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式，融入一个故事中。希望你喜欢。
I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly.
如果我仍然卡住，我会更新另一篇短文，否则，期待关于 10 件事的另外chapter篇简述。
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
Somewhere in Berlin, past the colonial architecture, the buildings downtown that taste like centuries, that have an old, yet refined feeling to them, that have been the hideaway for years to every bohemian, every artist, every lost soul, lies a bench.
在柏林某处，穿过殖民风格的建筑，市中心那些仿佛历经世纪、古老而又不失精致的楼宇，多年来一直是每个波西米亚人、每位艺术家、每颗迷失灵魂的避风港，那里有一张长椅。
Past that bench, the road goes on, long and windy, between the green big pines, across small hills, into the countryside.
过了那张长椅，道路继续延伸，漫长而曲折，穿行于高大的松树间，越过小山丘，通向乡间。
Deep into the country side, in a city so small that its name doesn't evoke anything, lies a house.
深入乡间，在一个小到名字都引不起任何联想的城市里，有一座房子。
Inside that house, lies a girl.
在那座房子里，住着一个女孩。
She came to Berlin looking to escape the ghost that plagued her dreams, her very life.
她来到柏林，试图逃离困扰她梦境、她生活的幽灵。
She came from far east, where she used to room with a shy quiet boy and a young woman, who was sometimes more of a mother, more of a big sister, than a guardian.
她来自遥远的东方，曾与一个害羞寡言的男孩和一个时而更像母亲、更像大姐的年轻女子同住。
She would call her names, raging from "Drunk" to "Slob".
她会用各种称呼来叫她，从“醉鬼”到“邋遢鬼”。
And sometimes, depending on her mood she would mutter under her breath, coming with new and profane ways to mix and match her native German with English and Japanese.
有时，根据她的心情，她会低声嘀咕，用新颖且粗俗的方式将她的母语德语与英语和日语混合搭配。
The woman who was the head of the household would be all that and more, she would seldom clean, and her young charges would make sure she never cooked.
作为一家之主的女性，她几乎从不打扫，而她的年轻助手们也会确保她从不下厨。
In hindsight, it's funny how sometimes you grow up to be exactly what you point out as character flaws in others.
事后看来，有趣的是，有时你长大后会变成你曾指出他人性格缺陷的那种人。
She woke up with a sigh, not needing to open her eyes to know that her small room was in dire need of cleaning.
她叹了口气醒来，无需睁眼便知她的小房间急需打扫。
She decided to put that thought out of her mind because she never liked cleaning after herself.
她决定不去想这件事，因为她向来不喜欢收拾自己的烂摊子。
It also brought back memories, bitter sweet and painful; memories she had spent the better part of last year trying to out run.
它也唤起了回忆，苦甜交织且令人痛苦；那些回忆她去年大部分时间都在试图逃离。
However, sometimes, no matter how fast or how long you run away, these memories will never be at rest.
然而，有时候，无论你跑得多快或多远，这些记忆永远不会平息。
Mumbling, she got up from bed, her long nightgown brushing her feet.
她喃喃自语着从床上起身，长长的睡裙拂过她的脚面。
"It's already been three months..."
已经过去三个月了……
In front of her, in her kitchen table was a plate with her leftovers from the other night, a round piece of bitter bread and some sausages with a glass of water. In front of her was a framed piece of paper with some Japanese characters.
在她面前的厨房餐桌上，放着前一晚的剩菜：一块圆形的苦面包、几根香肠和一杯水。她面前还摆着一张装裱好的纸，上面写着几个日文汉字。
She glanced at it and again, fearing the memories it would betray, decided to focus on her meager breakfast instead; some sausages and a glass mil with a round loaf of bread.. Sighing, she took a bite out of the piece of bread.
她瞥了一眼，又因害怕它勾起回忆而决定转而专注于她那简陋的早餐：几根香肠和一杯牛奶，还有一块圆面包。叹了口气，她咬了一口面包。
"Tastes horrible." 味道很糟糕。
Seconds later, that piece of rock-hard bread flew out the window.
几秒钟后，那块硬如岩石的面包从窗户飞了出去。
She closed the window, and then threw a glance at the rest of the furniture that compromised her household.
她关上窗户，随后扫视了一眼那些构成她家装的剩余家具。
"Honestly..." she mumbled, noticing the mess." There's nothing wrong with her per se, but at this rate it'll be a long time before I ever get around to calling her mom." She mumbled, remembering that she was mere days away from going to eat as she had promised with her.
"老实说..." 她嘟囔着，注意到这一团糟。"她本身没什么问题，但照这样下去，我得过很久才能真正把她当作妈妈。" 她喃喃自语，想起自己离履行与她共餐的承诺仅剩几天。
The computer desk was cluttered with books, pages, essays and what not, but amidst it all, a small CD caught her eyes. It contained saved messages; e-mails and memos form the time she had lived in the fortress city in Tokyo-3, but on this particular day, a line kept replaying over and over in her head and her eyes with a simple set of characters:
电脑桌上堆满了书籍、纸张、论文等杂物，但就在这杂乱之中，一张小 CD 吸引了她的目光。里面保存着她曾在东京-3 堡垒城市生活时的信息、电子邮件和备忘录，然而就在这一天，一行简单的字符不断在她脑海和眼前回放：
シンジ
Curiously, she popped the disk inside and began to take a look at it's contents.
她好奇地放入光盘，开始查看其内容。
"I did mention that I would like my old status report so I could brush up on my Japanese..." she said softly. "I just never thought they'd take me up on that offer." She clicked aimlessly around the screen , skimming past the obvious girly babble.
"我确实提过想要我以前的状况报告，以便复习一下日语……"她轻声说道，"只是没想到他们真的会接受这个提议。"她漫无目的地点击着屏幕，匆匆浏览过那些显而易见的少女闲聊。
"I arrived safely into this joke of a city after a brief encounter with the angel, nothing someone of my greatness couldn't handle, of course. I even had a chance to show that idiot third child a thing or two, though I gotta admit he is no Kaji...Being able to be on a boat with manliest man among men, a veritable Cadillac among these mere sedans I-"
我在这座笑话般的城市安全抵达后，与天使短暂邂逅，当然，这点小事难不倒我这般伟大之人。我甚至有机会给那个蠢货老三露两手，不过得承认，他绝非卡吉之流……能与众多男子中最为阳刚的男子同船，在这些普通轿车中堪称凯迪拉克的我——
"But..." she sighed closing the page quickly as she imagined herself, a fresh 14 year old trying to get the attention of a man she could now only see as an older sibling. "I have to say, even for me these are pretty boring..."
但她叹了口气，迅速合上书页，想象着自己，一个刚满 14 岁的少女，试图吸引一个现在只能看作是兄长般的男人的注意。“我得说，即便是对我而言，这些也挺无聊的……”
-click- the sound of the mouse made the next screen appear. She smiled as she read each one of the reports, slowly at first, before all the knowledge she had of the language came back.
-点击- 鼠标的声响让下一屏显现。她逐篇阅读报告，起初缓慢，但随着对语言的熟悉感逐渐回归，她的笑容也愈发明显。
"-stupidest trio of stooges I have ever laid my eyes on...you know Curly, Larry and Moe? Well this trio is conformed by Jock, Nerd and a Wimp. The jock seems to think that he's in charge, but I know better. the leader is no other than Ikari. He's such a wimp and a pervert! How he ever became an Eva pilot is beyond me! His selection must have been a joke! I swe-"
我见过的最蠢的三人组……你们知道 Curly、Larry 和 Moe 吗？这个三人组由 Jock、Nerd 和一个 Wimp 组成。那个运动员似乎以为他是老大，但我心里清楚，真正的头儿是碇真嗣。他既懦弱又好色！他怎么可能成为 Eva 驾驶员，这简直让我无法理解！他的选拔肯定是个笑话！我真……
-click- She smiled in spite of herself remembering her life and times at Tokyo high.
-点击- 她情不自禁地微笑起来，回忆起在东京高中的生活和时光。
"-had no choice but to go live with that joke of a guardian. Kaji is not even here all the time, but I really wanted to let him know that I'm tired of living in these awful barracks! So now I'll be living with Shinji and Misato. Can you believe it? We had a little party because somehow Misato actually got promoted to Major. I invited Hikari and Kaji; we had a great time but Misato ended up taking all of Kaji's time and she did nothing besid-"
无奈之下，只能去和那个不靠谱的监护人同住。加持先生也不常在，但我真的很想让他知道，我厌倦了住在这些糟糕的营房里！现在我将和真嗣还有美里一起生活。你能相信吗？我们为此小小庆祝了一番，因为美里不知怎么居然晋升为少校了。我邀请了光和加持先生，我们玩得很开心，但美里最后把加持先生的时间全占了，她除了……
-click- The first time she saw him past the sync tests and as a normal boy, the mousy demeanor, how hard it was to make him smile and be him.
-点击- 她第一次在同步测试后见到他，作为一个普通男孩，那种胆怯的态度，让他微笑并展现真我有多么困难。
"-Today, Shinji made a big mistake. That idiot got all arrogant and en-"
今天，真嗣犯了个大错。那个笨蛋变得自大又傲慢，还-
Her eyed widened, remembering that day.
她睁大了眼睛，回忆起那一天。
How anxious she had been, how terrified and angry and how she just wanted to let it all out, how she just wanted to let herself open and scream and cry and shout and tell him and her and all of them how useless they all were.
她曾是多么焦虑，多么恐惧和愤怒，她只想把这一切发泄出来，只想让自己敞开，尖叫、哭泣、呐喊，告诉他、她以及他们所有人，他们有多么无用。
How useless that stupid idiot had been for allowing himself to get swallowed up by that huge black void, how useless that drunken slut had been for telling her to step down, how useless NERV was for actually thinking the only way for him to survive was to drop several thousand N-2's and pray and hope for the best.
那个愚蠢的白痴任由自己被那巨大的黑色虚空吞噬，是多么无用；那个醉酒的荡妇让她下台，又是多么无用；NERV 居然认为他唯一的生存之道是投下数千枚 N-2 炸弹，然后祈祷并寄希望于最好的结果，这又是多么无用。
-click- -点击-
"-Shinji came back today. Thanks to him, we all had to take another synchronization test. Of course, I won, but for a second there, Shinji was actually able to surpass me. It was a fluke, I'm sure of it because Shinji surely does not have the will or the responsibility t-"
"今天真嗣回来了。多亏了他，我们又得进行一次同步测试。当然，我赢了，但有那么一瞬间，真嗣居然能超过我。这肯定是侥幸，我确信，因为真嗣绝对没有那种意志或责任感去……"
"Th-these..." She muttered, scanning the screen again, trying to see if she had missed something, taking in all the details willing herself to-
"这...这些..." 她喃喃自语，再次审视屏幕，试图确认是否遗漏了什么，全神贯注地捕捉每一个细节，强迫自己集中注意力。
-click- -点击-
"-one of the pilots, Rei, has been behaving strange lately. Not that it's unexpected I guess it's hard to actually understand her. To tell the truth I can't believe what has been happening lately myself. It's already been several months and I still have to-"
其中一位飞行员，丽，最近行为异常。虽然这并不出乎意料，我想实际上很难真正理解她。说实话，我自己也无法相信最近发生的事情。已经过去好几个月了，我仍然不得不——
"Are my..." She was so close and it seemed so far, and it looked as though she was walking through the hazy fog, looking at everything through a broken glass pieces here, glimpses there but still nothing really defined.
"我的……"她如此接近，却又似乎遥不可及，仿佛她正穿行在朦胧的雾中，透过破碎的玻璃片窥视着一切，这里一瞥，那里一闪，但依旧没有真正清晰的事物。
-click- -点击-
"-I'm really, really, really really, really pissed at him! Damn that arrogant idiot, Ikari Shinji, the great third child! I would love to tear off his head I am supposed too be the best there is, but he easily surpassed me on his own not that is seemed like it was any difficult for him. I guess I'm not neede-"
我真是，真是，真是，真是，真是对他火大！该死的傲慢蠢货，碇真嗣，那个所谓的第三适格者！我真想把他的头拧下来，我本该是最强的，但他却轻而易举地超越了我，仿佛对他来说毫不费力。看来我并不被需要——
"These are..." She gasped, still looking in disbelief at the screen as the soft glow emanated from it, and with it the realization, the truth of it all.
"这些是……"她喘息着，仍然难以置信地盯着屏幕，那柔和的光芒从中散发出来，随之而来的是领悟，是这一切的真相。
"My lost memories..." 我失去的记忆...
In her mind, the fuzzy memories she had tried so hard to suppress became more defined, almost as if she had been watching them through waxed paper, suddenly shimmering together, forming a silhouette of herself. And she herself saw what she had wrote, and she herself spoke in the same voice she was sure she had used when dictating this, when she wrote this, such a long, long time ago.
在她心中，那些她曾努力压抑的模糊记忆变得愈发清晰，仿佛透过蜡纸观看，突然间闪烁交织，形成了一个自己的剪影。她亲眼看到了自己所写的内容，她亲耳听到了自己确信在口述、在书写这段文字时所用的声音，那是很久很久以前的事了。
Today, I promised him my future.
今天，我许诺了他我的未来。
And she did, really. One of the things she had always hated about not remembering was the feeling that, if she remembered, she would do it again. All of it, without a second thought.
她确实如此。她一直讨厌忘记的一件事就是那种感觉，如果她记得，她会再次去做。所有的一切，毫不犹豫。
Because... 因为...
She knew, she was linked…she felt it back when she saw him on the deck of the Over the Rainbow, and then it was cemented when they were both doing the training to battle the twin angel.
她知道，她与他有着某种联系……当她在“彩虹之上”号的甲板上看到他时，她便感受到了这种联系，而当他们一起接受训练，准备迎战双生天使时，这种联系更加牢固了。
This is the world I'm going to be living in.
这就是我将要生活的世界。
This was her choice; this was what she believed in.
这是她的选择；这是她所坚信的。
Not as the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02, but...
并非作为福音战士二号机的驾驶员，而是……
Herself, just as she had been back in those days, with that dreadful bluish green pinafore high school uniform, complete with the crisp white shirt and red string tie, white socks with a red band at the top and her black leather loafers. she turned and smile and approached her, still dressed in her frilly nightshirt, almost touching her toes…
她，一如往昔，身着那件令人畏惧的蓝绿色高中围裙式校服，搭配着挺括的白衬衫和红色细绳领带，脚踩带有红色条纹顶边的白袜和黑色皮制乐福鞋。她转身微笑，向她走来，依旧穿着那件带有褶边的睡裙，几乎触到了脚尖……
As Asuka Langley Sohryu. 作为碇真嗣的同班同学，明日香·兰格雷·索拉尔是第二适格者，也是 EVA 二号机的驾驶员。她是一个性格坚强、自信且有些傲慢的少女，总是追求完美和胜利。明日香在战斗中展现出极高的天赋和技巧，但她的过去和内心的脆弱也时常影响着她的表现。尽管如此，她仍然是 NERV 中不可或缺的一员，为保护人类免受使徒的威胁而战斗。
She smiled at herself, and reached for her own hand, mirroring her other self in actions, her fingers interlacing themselves, a brief content smile appearing in both their lips.
她对着自己微笑，伸手握住自己的手，动作中映照出另一个自己，手指交缠，两人的唇边都浮现出一抹短暂的满足微笑。
You see, I...up until now, there had been so many things I hated…
你看，我...直到现在，有那么多我讨厌的事情…
Her life. Her mother and father; her stepmother and NERV. She hated Germany, and Hated Japan and was really just a sad little girl, frail and scared and why did she have to be so strong? Why did she have to appear like that? And she hated Misato for taking Kaji from her, and she hated Kaji for not seeing her as she wanted. She hated the third and the first and-
她的生活。她的母亲和父亲；她的继母和 NERV。她讨厌德国，也讨厌日本，其实她只是一个悲伤的小女孩，脆弱、害怕，为什么她必须如此坚强？为什么她必须以那种方式出现？她恨美里夺走了她的加持，也恨加持没有像她希望的那样看待她。她恨第三适格者和第一适格者——
But... 但是...
But… 但是…
Now...I think to myself...
现在...我暗自思忖...
"I was so lucky to have been born here." She repeated softly to herself.
"我真幸运能在这里出生。" 她轻声地对自己重复道。
It was the flickery, warm touch of the computer screen what brought her out of her reverie, and when she opened her eyes, the picture staring back at her shocked her.
是电脑屏幕那闪烁而温暖的触感将她从沉思中唤醒，当她睁开眼睛时，映入眼帘的画面令她震惊不已。
She was there, smiling happily, her right hand forming a sideways victory sign poised over her right eye, almost like a mask.
她站在那里，幸福地微笑着，右手摆出横着的胜利手势，悬在右眼上方，几乎像一个面具。
The face to her left was smiling calmly back, even if her left arm was around that persons neck, pushing them both together, dark blue eyes, darker and bluer than any stormy nigh staring back at her.
她左边的那张脸正平静地微笑着回应，尽管她的左臂环绕着那人的脖子，将两人紧紧推在一起，深蓝色的眼睛，比任何暴风雨之夜都要深邃和湛蓝，正凝视着她。
"Ah...So that's it..." She sighed, painful realization coursing through her brain, but still blissful for finally being made aware of the void, of the blank space in her mind, in her memory. "I had already arrived at that place..."
"啊...原来如此..." 她叹息着，痛苦的领悟在脑海中蔓延，但仍因终于意识到那片空白、那段记忆中的空缺而感到一丝欣慰。"我早已抵达了那个地方..."
Slowly, she took back her hand, her fingers lingering on the screen for a touch more.
她缓缓地收回手，手指在屏幕上多停留了一会儿。
"I was weak...all the thinking and worrying that I did. All the things I threw away because of my pride..."
我曾软弱……所有那些我思考和担忧的事情。所有因我的骄傲而舍弃的东西……
And she began to feel.
她开始感受到。
"And now...Everything's ended up like this."
而现在...一切最终都变成了这样。
And she began to think.
她开始思考。
And against her better judgment, against her own self control, the memories came rushing back, like a damn breaking.
尽管违背了自己的判断力，也违背了自我控制，但记忆还是如决堤般汹涌而来。
Slowly, her hands came to her face and her head sun into her arms, two salty streams escaping from her eyes as she remembered what she had left behind, her still smiling face mocking her from behind the LCD screen.
渐渐地，她的双手抚上脸颊，头埋进臂弯，两行咸涩的泪水从眼角溢出，她回忆起自己所留下的，那张依旧微笑的面庞在液晶屏后嘲笑着她。
"I'm sorry." 对不起。
A sob. 一声抽泣。
"I'm sorry..." 对不起...
A heart wrenching, soul breaking little sob. Followed by another, and another, and another.
一声撕心裂肺、灵魂破碎的啜泣。紧接着又是一声，再一声，再一声。
"I'm so sorry..." 我真的很抱歉...
She stared back at herself, at her own smiling face and in that instant, in that moment she understood what she had done.
她凝视着镜中的自己，望着那张微笑的脸庞，就在那一刻，她明白了她所做的一切。
"I...took everything that you made...and threw it all away." And in that instant, the cold, emotionless thoughts were replaced by a voice laced with a quiet reminder, a small "don't go there" trying to tell her that-
我……拿走了你制作的一切……然后全部丢弃了。”就在那一刻，冰冷无情的思绪被一个带着轻声提醒的声音所取代，一个小小的“别去那里”试图告诉她——
You're going to regret this.
你会为此后悔的。
She sat there, not caring for the passage of time, softly sobbing by her self, all alone in her room. And when she stopped, she realized what those mails and that picture represented.
她坐在那里，不顾时间流逝，独自在房间里轻声啜泣。当她停止哭泣时，她意识到那些邮件和那张照片所代表的意义。
"I...erased every trace of myself...as if I'd never been there..."
我……抹去了自己的一切痕迹……仿佛我从未存在过……
Think. 思考。
What had Kaji said?
加治说了什么？
After you've cried as much as you think...
当你觉得已经哭够了之后...
And she was crying, and she didn't think she could cry anymore, she was crying with parched dry eyes and still her soul ached...
她哭泣着，以为自己再也无法流泪，她的双眼干涸如沙漠，但灵魂依旧痛苦不已……
Think about what you can do, given the circumstances you find yourself in.
思考在当前情况下你能做些什么。
And she rose. 她站了起来。
That way... 那样的话...
And she remembered it all...she remembered everything. The smile, the tears the sense of unbecoming. The feeling of becoming one and then becoming unwrapped; the longing and the need and the hunger for him, for all of him, for every little piece of whatever it was that made him who he was; those eyes and the sad smile, the hair and the gentle face...
她回忆起了所有的一切……她记得所有的事情。那微笑，那泪水，那不合时宜的感觉。那种融为一体后又逐渐剥离的感觉；对他的渴望、需求和饥饿，对构成他的一切，对每一个微小部分，无论是什么塑造了他；那双眼睛和悲伤的微笑，那头发和温柔的面庞……
THAT WAY... 那边...
Without a second thought, she grabbed her suitcase, and went to get her long coat; the air was still crisp and cold during this time of the year. She walked briskly to the door, making up her mind, and deciding on going to-
毫不犹豫地，她抓起行李箱，又去取了那件长外套；一年中的这个时候，空气依旧清冽寒冷。她快步走向门口，下定决心，决定前往——
All her previous thoughts came to a halt when she opened the door and found a familiar face, flustered and confused outside her boarding house.
当她打开门，看到一张熟悉的脸庞在她的寄宿屋外慌张而困惑时，她之前的所有思绪戛然而止。
They looked at each other and in that brief moment of silence, of uncertainty held in both their eyes, the whole world seemed to stop.
他们彼此对视，在那短暂的沉默瞬间，双方眼中都流露出不确定，仿佛整个世界都静止了。
As always, he began talking, stammering in polite tones, explaining why he was in her neck of the woods. The whole time she felt her face becoming redder and hotter.
一如既往，他开始说话，用礼貌的语气结结巴巴地解释他为何会出现在她的地盘。整个过程中，她感到自己的脸越来越红，越来越热。
"A-Asuka, is that you?"
"飞鸟，是你吗？"
And in that simple phrase in just under a minute she felt like she was back then, an emotionally vulnerable little red headed girl staring into the warm and confused and caring blue eyes of the boy she had somehow known all her life.
就在那短短不到一分钟的时间里，她感觉自己仿佛回到了过去，那个情感上脆弱、红发的小女孩，凝视着那双温暖、困惑而又充满关爱的蓝眼睛，那个她似乎一生都认识的男孩。
"...yeah..." "...嗯..."
The boy she hated to love.
她无法去爱的那个男孩。
"What a relief. I knew you lived around here, but I'm afraid I got a little lost."
真是松了口气。我知道你住在这附近，但恐怕我有点迷路了。
The boy that, even when she hated him, she loved him for all his worth.
那个男孩，即使在她恨他的时候，她依然全心全意地爱着他。
"If you hadn't just come out, I don't know what would have happened." And when he blinked, she blinked and then-
如果你刚才没有出来，我不知道会发生什么。"当他眨眼时，她也眨了眨眼，然后——
"Uh...are you...going anywhere?"
"呃...你要去...什么地方吗？"
She blamed her blush on the scolding cup of coffee she had just drank, even when her mind mocked her, telling her it had been tepid at best.
她将脸红归咎于刚喝的那杯烫嘴咖啡，尽管内心嘲笑自己，那咖啡充其量只是温热而已。
"W-well I was just on my way to the Hanover research facility. You see a genius as gifted as I am is busy no matter where she is."
嗯，我正要去汉诺威研究机构。你看，像我这样天赋异禀的天才，无论在哪里都是忙碌的。
It came to her as a natural defense; the posing, the tone of superiority as she explained to him her reasons for being outside and with all her current possession in her hand, until something caught her eyes.
这成了她一种本能的防御：摆出姿态，用一种优越的口吻向他解释自己为何在外面，手里还拿着所有当前的财物，直到有什么东西吸引了她的目光。
"So any way...what do you want?" She said finally, with as much of her old self back.
所以无论如何……你想要什么？”她终于说道，尽量恢复了往日的自己。
"So-sorry, I'll go back as soon as I finish what I came to do."
对不起，我一完成我来此要做的事情就立刻回去。
Da...She griped her suitcase fiercely, and pursed her lips more. Damn it...
她紧紧抓住行李箱，嘴唇抿得更紧了。该死...
DAMN IT! 该死！
Like I thought I don't have what it takes.
正如我所想，我并不具备所需的条件。
I... 我...
"Th-there's something I wanted to give you myself..." His voice was beckoning her back and just for a moment she thought-
"有样东西我想亲自给你……"他的声音在召唤她回来，有那么一刻，她想——
"Close your eyes for just a second."
闭上眼睛，只需一秒钟。
She smiled t herself and fell into the familiar routine.
她对着自己微笑，陷入了熟悉的日常。
"What!? If you do anything weird I'll kill you!"
"什么！？你要是敢做奇怪的事，我就杀了你！"
And she had missed that. She had missed being able to be with him, because she knew even if she didn't remember he had been able to get past her, he had been able to make her be who she really was.
她错过了那一切。她错过了能与他相伴的时光，因为她知道，即使她记不起来，他曾能够穿越她的心防，他曾能够让她成为真正的自己。
"I-I won't!" “我-我不干！”
She closed her eyes, but not her mind, and still her mind spoke.
她闭上了眼睛，却没有关闭心扉，心中依旧有声音在诉说。
I've been living like this my whole life, now It's already too...
我一生都这样生活，现在已经是太……
And then she felt it, the small pressure on the tip of her finger, something cold sliding down, stopping at the base of her knuckles, making her slowly open her eyes and-
接着她感受到了，指尖上轻微的压力，一股冰凉滑落，停在她的指关节底部，让她缓缓睁开眼睛，然后——
Too- 太-
There, glistening in the bright sunlight, sitting in her finger was a ring.
在那里，在明媚的阳光下闪闪发光，她的手指上戴着一枚戒指。
"Well it's really not that expensive for a gem...but I wanted to give you something that I had earned by myself not through my NERV salary, so it actually ended up taking a while..." Shinji said, smiling, nervously scratching his cheek. And all Asuka could do was stare in rapt fascination at the small simple ring she was wearing now.
“其实这宝石并不算贵，但我希望送你的是我自己挣来的，而不是 NERV 的薪水，所以实际上花了不少时间……” 碇真嗣说着，微笑中带着些许紧张，手指不自觉地挠着脸颊。而明日香只能目不转睛地凝视着此刻戴在手上的那枚简单小巧的戒指，满心惊喜。
"Lo-look...if you don't like it then I won't mind if you just throw it away right now."
“看，看……如果你不喜欢，那我现在扔掉也没关系。”
And how could she say no? How could she not want it?
她怎能拒绝呢？她怎能不渴望呢？
"Everybody told me to give up because you'd dump me in a heartbeat but..."
大家都劝我放弃，因为你随时可能甩了我，但是……
How could she turn her back again after all that had happened? After all she had been through? Was she really that proud? Was she really that stupid?
经历了这一切之后，她怎能再次转身离去？她所经历的一切难道都白费了吗？她真的那么骄傲吗？她真的那么愚蠢吗？
"I just wanted to give it to you..."
我只是想把它给你……
Curiously, she lifted her left hand into the sky and in that moment, as he stood transfixed, seeing her hand against the sun, almost as if she were attempting to reach for something high above her, her mind played the same trick on her.
她好奇地举起左手伸向天空，那一刻，他站在那里看得入迷，只见她的手映衬着太阳，仿佛她正试图触及高悬于头顶的某物，而她的心智也玩起了同样的把戏。
She saw her arm encased in a bright red jumpsuit with black trimmings for a brief moment, before her eyes focused back on the dark maroon of her coat.
她瞥见自己的手臂被一件亮红色连体衣包裹，边缘饰以黑色，但转瞬之间，她的目光又重新聚焦回她外套那深暗的酒红色上。
The wind was softly blowing, and they were the only ones standing on the dirt road, her back to his, her thoughts her own.
微风轻拂，他们独自站在泥土路上，她背对着他，思绪只属于自己。
And she made her mind right then and there.
她当即下定了决心。
And softly, she spoke. 她轻声细语地说。
"I promise you..." She began in her native tongue. "Until I die, I will touch no other man, except you."
"我向你承诺……" 她用母语开口道，"至死不渝，除你之外，我不会再触碰其他男人。"
She spoke almost in a daze, as if the words were an incantation, bringing back memories she had lost along the way.
她几乎是在恍惚中说话，仿佛那些话语是一种咒语，唤回了她沿途遗失的记忆。
"Until I die, I will speak with no other man except you. From now on, I'm yours. From the top of my head to the bottom of my feet; every single bit of me, without anything left out." She turned a little bit, watching him from the corner of her eyes.
直到我生命的尽头，除了你，我不会再与任何人交谈。从今往后，我属于你。从头到脚，每一寸肌肤，毫无保留。她微微侧身，用眼角余光注视着他。
"I can't remember the days I've spent with you, but that's not necessary anyway. I don't really know what love truly means, but..." She turned to stare at him, a quiet look of determination, and fierce resolve clearly on her face.
我记不清与你共度的时光，但那已无关紧要。我并不真正懂得爱的真谛，但……她转头凝视着他，脸上是平静的决然，以及坚定的决心。
"If love means not to break this promise until I die, then I promise to always love you, and no other man, as long as I live..."
如果爱意味着至死不渝地坚守这份承诺，那么我承诺将永远爱你，在我有生之年，心中再无他人...
She placed her right hand against her left breast, feeling the soft rhythmic beating of her heart before finally vowing. "By the honor of Asuka Langley Soryu."
她将右手放在左胸前，感受着心脏柔和而有节奏的跳动，最终宣誓道：“以飞鸟·兰利·索西乌的荣誉为誓。”
The silence stretched from seconds to minutes, the soft wind rustling the fallen leaves, making the silence grow and become a huge distance between them.
寂静从几秒延伸至数分钟，轻风拂动着落叶，使得沉默愈发深重，仿佛在他们之间拉开了一道巨大的距离。
Until Shinji decided to break it in his very own, natural way, fumbling for the small book that he had in his hands.
直到真嗣决定以他自己独特而自然的方式打破沉默，摸索着手中那本小书。
"I-I'm sorry Asuka..." He began as he flipped back and forth the pages. "I'm not that good at German...so could you say that one more ti-"
"我...我很抱歉，明日香..." 他一边翻来覆去地翻着书页，一边开口说道，"我的德语不太好...所以你能再说一遍吗？"
Before he had a chance to finish, he suddenly felt a light weight against his body, pushing him down.
他还没来得及说完，突然感到身上有一股轻微的重量压下来，将他推倒。
He felt the silky strands of her red hair brushing against his nose.
他感受到她那红色秀发如丝般柔滑的触感轻拂过他的鼻尖。
He tasted her tears and her breath in her lips, pressed tightly against his, even as he felt his whole world being swept from his feet, his back coming in close contact with the very same dirt road they had both been standing in mere seconds before.
他尝到了她泪水的味道，感受到了她唇间气息的交融，即便此刻他感到整个世界正从脚下被卷走，他的背紧贴着几秒前他们还并肩站立的同一条尘土路。
As the sky darkened slightly, and ice flakes began to fall towards the ground, the soft padding of a dog behind them mixed with the tears and the sobs, and the small laughter form them both.
随着天空略显暗淡，冰花开始飘落向地面，身后狗的轻柔脚步声与他们的泪水、啜泣以及两人间的小笑声交织在一起。
The dog made his way to the bread piece that was on the road, not paying any attention to anything else other than the promise of food in front of him.
那只狗径直走向路上那块面包，除了眼前预示的食物外，对其他一切都不予理会。
As his jaws closed against the bread and he turned to walk back the way he had come, his soft brown yes focused on the image before him.
当他咬住面包，转身沿着来时的路走回去时，他那双柔和的棕色眼睛聚焦在了眼前的景象上。
Halfway covered in snow, Asuka Langley Soryu was on top of Shinji Ikari, softly kissing him, for all that was worth; kissing him but at the same time clutching onto him; like a lifeline, like a castaway being pulled by a helicopter on top, she kissed and she pulled and she pushed and she was kissing him and never letting go. Her red hair obscuring his features, but a content sigh emerging from them both.
半身覆雪的明日香·兰格雷，正伏在真嗣身上，温柔地吻着他，倾尽所有；她吻着他，同时紧紧抓住他，如同抓住救命稻草，又似被直升机吊起的落难者，她吻着、拉着、推着，不断亲吻，绝不放手。她那红色的发丝遮住了他的面容，但两人间却传出了满足的叹息。

Epilogue 尾声
The fire was cracking peacefully in the chimney, and the little girl was snoring softly, calmly, from the couch; her red pigtails strewn around her; one was hanging on one of the couch's arms, the other brushing against the carpeted floor.
壁炉里的火噼啪作响，宁静安详，小女孩在沙发上轻轻地打着呼噜，平静地睡着；她的红色辫子散落四周，一条挂在沙发扶手上，另一条轻触着铺有地毯的地面。
Slowly, she opened her eyes and got up halfway, always being watched from behind by the grown up, a steaming cup of coffee sitting in the table in front.
她缓缓睁开双眼，半坐起身，始终被身后的大人注视着，面前桌上放着一杯热气腾腾的咖啡。
Behind the little girl, the Christmas tree was filled with light an spheres, tin foil going around it.
在小女孩身后，圣诞树上挂满了彩灯和球饰，周围还缠绕着锡箔。
"Hey! Why didn't you wake me up? I had a really weird dream..." She said, stifling a yawn and noticing a hot mug ready for her. "Mommy and daddy were still really young...and you had to fight with monsters to save everyone." She smiled.
"嘿！你怎么没叫醒我？我做了一个很奇怪的梦……" 她说着，忍住了一个哈欠，注意到一杯热腾腾的茶已经为她准备好了。"梦里爸爸妈妈还很年轻……而你不得不与怪兽战斗来拯救大家。" 她微笑着说。
"You were really cool!"
你真的很酷！
The little girl then blinked, noticing the small look and smile her mother exchanged with her father. "But daddy kept running away all the time, so you weren't that cool..." She noticed her Dad blush and mutter something, her mom's lips growing back into a playful smirk. "And mommy was always yelling at you." she added as an after thought.
小女孩眨了眨眼，注意到母亲与父亲交换了一个微妙的眼神和微笑。“但是爸爸总是跑掉，所以你也没那么酷……”她注意到爸爸脸红了，嘴里嘟囔着什么，而妈妈的嘴角又恢复了俏皮的笑意。“而且妈妈总是对你大喊大叫。”她补充道，像是事后想起。
Now both grown ups remained silent, shocked but happy, surprised but smiling at their little girl.
现在，两位成年人沉默着，既震惊又喜悦，惊讶之余却对着他们的小女儿微笑。
"Hey! Come to think of it...that how you are right now!" And then the grown ups began to laugh, her mother nuzzling into her father's neck, her father patting her long red hair.
嘿！想想看……你现在就是这样！"随后大人们开始笑起来，她的母亲依偎在父亲颈边，父亲则轻拍着她那头长长的红发。
"Hey! Really! I really did see it!"
嘿！真的！我真的看到了！
"Come on! Both of you stop laughing and believe me!"
快点！你们俩别笑了，相信我吧！
And as both her voice and the grownups floated through the cold night air, everything was right in this world.
当她的声音和成年人的谈话在寒冷的夜空中飘荡时，这个世界的一切都显得如此和谐。
And thus, a legend unfolds...
于是，一段传奇就此展开...
A tale of a small miracle that is about to take place.
即将发生的小奇迹的故事。
While taking place somewhere else, these events are real nonetheless...
尽管发生在别处，这些事件依然真实存在...
(Re-Take After) （重拍后）
Author's babble. 作者的胡言乱语。
This small story is mainly my feelings put to words, after reading the latest installment of the Re-Take story. My knowledge of Japanese is minimal (Which is a fancy way of saying I know jack) which is why the only words uttered come from the few pages that had been translated by yours truly at the RA and SAL image boards.
这个小故事主要是我读完《Re-Take》最新章节后的感受，用文字表达出来。我的日语知识非常有限（说白了就是一窍不通），因此我所引用的词句仅来自于我在 RA 和 SAL 图像板上亲自翻译的那几页内容。
If you read it so far and found it an acceptable homage, then go over there and get the whole dou.
若你读到这里，觉得这是可接受的致敬，那就过去把整部作品都拿来看看吧。
And keep your eyes opened for the translation done by the fantastic Anonymous Spore.
请留意由神奇的匿名孢子完成的翻译。
If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then get the whole series, if you look for it with enough interest, you will find it, if not, drop me a line and your e-mail and I'll send it your way.
如果你不知道我在说什么，那就去把整个系列找来，如果你带着足够的兴趣去寻找，你会找到的，如果找不到，给我留言并附上你的邮箱，我会发给你。
Again, no beta has pre-read this, because some things just come to you during the long sleepless nights.
再次声明，此文未经任何先行读者预读，因为有些灵感就是在那漫漫长夜无眠之时突然涌现的。
Author's Update. 作者更新。
How much do I suck? Nah, c'mon you can speak freely, pay no attention to the chainsaw and the pitchfork and all the other various torture instruments at my disposal, Tell me in all honestly how bad do I suck?
我有多糟糕？得了吧，你可以畅所欲言，别管我手边的电锯、干草叉和其他各种刑具，坦白告诉我，我到底有多差劲？
It's been…what? Nearly 3 or 4 months since Spore got out his version, circling around the ´net. One would have thought that I would make an update once it had hit the posting boards and updated this story with dialogue, right? As it is, in my defense I can honestly say I was busy, really, really busy...with what you ask? It SELEE, not SEREE! NEXT QUESTION!
已经……多久了？自从 Spore 发布他的版本以来，差不多 3 到 4 个月了，这个版本在网络上流传。你可能会以为，一旦它被发布到论坛上，我就会更新这个故事并加入对话，对吧？说实话，我得为自己辩解一下，我真的很忙，非常非常忙……忙什么呢？是 SELEE，不是 SEREE！下一个问题！
But really, I beg forgiveness, those who have read it, know it's hard to come with the exact words for something so...for lack of a better adjective...perfect...I am thinking in adding a special something something about this as well...interested? Yes? No? TOO BAD!
但说真的，我恳请谅解，那些读过的人知道，要找到形容如此……姑且用个更好的形容词吧……完美之事的准确词汇实属不易……我正考虑为此添加一些特别的东西……感兴趣吗？是吗？不是吗？太糟糕了！
I'm not sharing… 我不分享……
Yet. 然而。

### Chapter 06 Themes: K#09 (Dash), W#14 (Trees)
主题：K#09（破折号），W#14（树木）
Title: Of Keeping Secrets
标题：关于保守秘密
A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like.
作者注：我在这里为自己辩解一下：这不是我的作品。我正试图摆脱写作瓶颈，所以我会同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式，融入一个故事中。希望你喜欢。
I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly.
如果我仍然卡住，我会更新另一篇短文，否则，期待关于 10 件事的另外chapter篇简述。
During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在融合过程中，无数世界被创造出来；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。
But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇到的每一个世界中，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界里，我们都会无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。
And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。
Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心构建的世界。
That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）
"What are you doing..?" Asuka asked, her eyebrows twitching as she ran into the familiar back of Shinji exiting Misato's apartment. Shinji turned around with his hands grabbing several industrial strength type black plastic bags.
"你在做什么..?" 明日香问道，她的眉毛微微抽动，撞见了正从美里公寓出来的熟悉的真嗣背影。真嗣转过身来，手里抓着几个工业强度的黑色塑料袋。
"What does it look like I'm doing..?" He grumbled as he closed the door with his foot, the sounds of someone singing very off key muting instantly. "Does it look like I'm eating an ice cream cone..? No! I'm taking out the trash, shees!"
我这看起来像是在做什么呢？"他嘟囔着用脚关上门，那走调的歌声立刻被隔绝。"我看起来像是在吃冰淇淋吗？不！我在倒垃圾，真是的！
It wasn't normal for Shinji to grumble, so Asuka kept quiet for a moment, while Nozomi and Mari simply giggled when they heard the exchange, chanting 'Newlyweds' over and over.
真嗣平时不常抱怨，所以明日香一时沉默了，而望美和真理听到这番对话后只是咯咯笑，反复念叨着'新婚夫妇'。
"Ok, squirts, I told you already, We are not like that."
好的，小家伙们，我已经告诉过你们了，我们不是那样的。
"But my brother says you have him whipped." Mari giggled making a whipping motion with her hand, adding a "whap-ish!" sound effect.
"但我哥哥说你让他挨鞭子了。" Mari 咯咯笑着，用手做出鞭打的动作，并加上了一个"啪-ish！"的音效。
"Your brother is an idiot." Both Shinji and Asuka retorted perfectly synchronous.
"你哥哥是个白痴。" 碇真嗣和明日香异口同声地反驳道。
"He also says you do that weird thing when you speak at the same time with the same words all the time." Mari said as if both Shinji and Asuka had conceded the point. Nozomi simply nodded, and Shinji simply shook his head and rolled his eyes which made Mari stuck out her tongue at the older teen.
"他还说你们总是同时说同样的话，做那种奇怪的事。" 玛丽说道，仿佛碇真嗣和明日香已经默认了这一点。 冬二只是点了点头，而碇真嗣则摇了摇头，翻了个白眼，这让玛丽对着这位年长的少年吐了吐舌头。
"Hey Asuka, why are you with Mariko and Nozomi?" Shinji asked as both small girls began to race each other to the elevator, dashing across the hall.
"嘿，明日香，你为什么和真希波还有希一起呢？" 碇真嗣问道，这时两个小女孩开始比赛跑向电梯，穿过走廊。
"The Jock had to go to some practice of something, so he left her with Hikari." Asuka began bored. "And then Hikari said she would be back in a little while and she left."
那个运动员得去参加什么训练，所以把她留给了光。" 明日香开始无聊地说，"然后光说她一会儿就回来，结果也走了。
Shinji nodded, pausing and staying quiet for a moment. "So... they're making out?"
真嗣点了点头，停顿了一下，然后保持沉默。“那么……他们在接吻吗？”
Asuka ignored Mari's and Nozomi's grumbles of 'Eek!' and 'Gross, yuck!' before she shrugged."That would be my first guess."
明日香对玛丽和希美的“哎呀！”和“恶心，呸！”的抱怨置之不理，然后耸了耸肩。“那会是我的第一猜测。”
"Does it bother you?" 这让你困扰吗？
"What the hell are you on?" Asuka sputtered. "Why would it bother me?"
你到底是怎么了？" 明日香气急败坏地说。"为什么我会觉得困扰？
"Well, you've never been that much into Hikari dating Toji." Shinji pointed out while they both walked towards the back of the buildings, to where the garbage that was recyclable was thrown for the recycle crews to come and pick it up.
"嗯，你对光和东治的恋情一直不太感冒。" 碇真嗣指出，两人正朝着建筑后方的垃圾投放点走去，那里堆放着可回收垃圾，等待回收人员来收取。
"Hikari knows how I feel." Asuka said as she turned to tell the kids to wait. "And the jock knows that if he makes her cry, I'll make him cry." She finished, slamming her left fist into her right palm.
"光知道我的感受。" 明日香说着，转身告诉孩子们等待。"而那个运动员也知道，如果他让她哭了，我会让他哭。" 她说完，砰地一声将左拳砸进右掌。
"Yeah!" Below her, Mari shouted, doing the same thing. "If my idiot stooge of a brother makes Miss Hikari cry I'll kick him."
"耶！" 在她下方，玛丽也喊道，做着同样的事情。"如果我那蠢货弟弟让光小姐哭了，我一定踢他。"
"Atta girl." Asuka patted her on the head, proud of her new protege. "Now are you ready to leave?" She asked the both girls, who nodded as they held their backpacks closer to themselves.
"好样的，姑娘。" 明日香拍了拍她的头，为自己的新门生感到骄傲。"现在你们准备好离开了吗？" 她问两位女孩，她们点了点头，同时将背包更紧地抱在胸前。
"Oh...you're leaving already?" Shinji asked as he dusted his hands off after throwing the rest of the garbage into the furnace.
"哦...你已经要走了吗？" 真嗣在将剩余的垃圾扔进炉子后，拍了拍手上的灰尘问道。
"Yeah, I'm taking them to the station." Asuka gestured to the front door of the building complex. "Hikari and Toji will be waiting for them there."
"对，我正带他们去车站。" 明日香指了指建筑群的前门，"光和东治会在那里等他们。"
"Maybe I should go out with you…It's been getting dangerous around here lately." Shinji said as he walked next to Asuka. Perhaps too close to her, since her back tensed up and she jumped sideways, turning to glare at the confused boy.
"或许我该和你一起出去……最近这里越来越危险了。" 真嗣边走边对明日香说，或许离她太近了，因为她的背突然绷紧，向旁边一跳，转过身来瞪着一脸困惑的男孩。
"Stop doing that." She said hotly, and Shinji simply looked at her with confusion."And stop imagining things that aren't there." Asuka finished blushing, her latest outburst directed at the giggling girls several feet in front of her.
"别再那样做了。"她激动地说，而真嗣只是困惑地看着她。"还有，别再幻想不存在的东西了。"阿苏卡说完，脸颊泛红，她最近的爆发是针对前面几英尺外咯咯笑的女孩们。
"Doing what? What are you talking about?" Shinji asked finally after a long silence.
“做什么？你在说什么？”在长时间的沉默后，真嗣终于问道。
"Why do you insist on coming with me idiot…" Asuka shifted conversations, turning around. "I can handle any pervert with one hit…" she said, eliciting a shout of approval form Mari, again. Nozomi simply sighed, looking eerily like a mini version of Hikari, pigtails and freckles and all.
"你为什么非要跟来啊，笨蛋……" 明日香转换了话题，转过身去。"我能一击搞定任何色狼……" 她说道，再次引来了玛丽的赞同呼声。而心则只是叹了口气，看起来活脱脱一个小一号的光，连双马尾和雀斑都一模一样。
"That's what I'm worried about…" Shinji sighed, pinching the brdge of his nose. "You don't know how to hold back…someone's got to protect the poor criminals…" He said as Nozomi giggled and Mari did the same once she saw Asuka's look of disbelief.
“这就是我所担心的……”真嗣叹了口气，捏了捏鼻梁。“你不知道如何克制……总得有人保护那些可怜的罪犯……”他说道，此时望见明日香一脸难以置信的表情，希和玛丽也跟着笑了起来。
"Yeah…more like protect your fellow perverts." She grumbled but otherwise did nothing to prevent Shinji from coming with them.
"是啊……更像是保护你的同道中人。" 她嘟囔着，但并没有阻止真嗣跟他们一起走。
"Whatever…Besides, I have to buy food at the grocery store." Shinji said with a smile as Asuka shook her head but also smiled, both of them ignoring the chants of 'Newlyweds' that had begun once more from the younger kids.
“随便吧……再说，我还得去杂货店买吃的。” 真嗣笑着说，明日香虽然摇头但也笑了，两人都忽略了小孩子们再次起哄的“新婚夫妇”呼声。
"You know…" Asuka began as the walked the short distance towards the train station. "Thanks to you those two are going to be making a ruckus about us on school tomorrow…" Asuka said as she motioned with her head to the younger Suzuhara and Horaki girls running around while Shinnji grabbed a hold of her paper cup once she was done eating her ice cream and threw it in a trash can.
"你知道的…" 明日香边说边走向不远处的火车站。"多亏了你，那两个小家伙明天肯定会在学校里大肆宣扬我们的事…" 明日香说着，用头示意了一下正在四处奔跑的铃原和堀崎家的女孩们，而真治在她吃完冰淇淋后，接过她的纸杯扔进了垃圾桶。
"What do you mean..?" Shinji asked as he turned around to close the front door.
"你什么意思..?" 真嗣边问边转身去关前门。
"They think that you…you and I…" Asuka began lamely, a red hue coloring her cheeks.
"他们认为你……你和我……" 明日香尴尬地开口，脸颊染上了红晕。
"What? That we're dating..?" Shinji asked without concern.
"什么？我们是在约会吗？" 真嗣漫不经心地问道。
"Yes!" Asuka looked down, frowning and blushing and Shinji could only focus on her face and lips and how cute she looked right now.
"是的！"明日香低头皱眉，脸颊泛红，而真嗣只能专注于她的脸庞和嘴唇，以及她此刻看起来多么可爱。
"And I'm sure that you told them otherwise…" Shinji continued, after a while, looking in front of him, trying to seem like he was clearly not affected by any of this.
"我确信你已经告诉他们相反的情况了……" 过了一会儿，真嗣继续说道，他直视前方，试图表现出这一切对他显然没有任何影响的样子。
"They were obviously not paying attention to a word that I was saying…" Asuka answered back grumbling about 'Baka not being worried'.
他们显然没有注意我说的任何一个字……”明日香嘟囔着回答，抱怨着‘笨蛋不担心’。
"Well, give them time…" Shinji said, slowing his pace, Asuka unconsciously doing the same; they had always had a knack for doing so; one would do something and the other would react to it, almost as if there was a connection of sorts between them.
"嗯，给他们点时间……" 真嗣说着放慢了脚步，明日香也不自觉地跟着慢了下来；他们总是有这样的默契，一个人做什么，另一个人就会有所反应，仿佛彼此间存在着某种联系。
"As soon as they hear that you punched me with enough force to give me a concussion they'll realize their mistake…" Shinji said softly, with a smile directed at a flustered Asuka, as he saw the girls run towards the station once they saw their respective siblings waiting for them.
一听到你用力打我到让我脑震荡，他们就会意识到自己的错误……” 碇真嗣轻声说道，面带微笑地看着慌张的明日香，同时看到女孩们在看到各自的兄弟姐妹在车站等候后，纷纷向车站跑去。
"That's not funny…" Asuka said hotly, not expecting for Shinji to push her against the back of a tree.
"这一点也不好笑……" 明日香气愤地说，没料到真嗣会突然将她推到树干上。
"What are you-?" "你在干嘛？"
Asuka's surprised question was cut off as Shinji grabbed her by her arms and spun her around, staring into her eyes as he pushed her up against the trees and kissed her. Deeply.
明日香的惊讶疑问被真嗣打断，他抓住她的双臂，将她旋转过来，凝视着她的眼睛，将她推到树干上，深情地吻了上去。
Asuka remembered their first kiss; it had been sloppy, and quickly; her palms had been sweaty and she had been more worried about someone finding out than about the romance or the setting; she had seen Shinji walking towards her, with an umbrella limply held by his hand, and she had simply let herself go at the sight of him, dripping wet, drenched by the falling rain, a look of pessimism and disbelief and of being lost so big, it seemed like it would swallow him whole.
明日香回忆起他们的初吻；那次亲吻笨拙而仓促；她的手掌满是汗水，比起浪漫或场景，她更担心被人发现；她看到真嗣朝她走来，手中的伞无力地垂着，她一见到他，便情不自禁——他浑身湿透，被落下的雨水浸湿，脸上写满了悲观、难以置信和迷茫，那表情如此强烈，仿佛要将他整个人吞没。
He looked like a lost puppy, but not the barking, obnoxious kind; rather he looked like the ones who are too tired, to scared, or to numb to do anything, but stare at the car coming down the road, straight at them.
他看起来像只迷路的小狗，但并非那种狂吠、惹人厌的类型；相反，他看起来像是那些过于疲惫、过于害怕或过于麻木而无法做出任何反应，只能盯着那辆沿着道路直冲他们而来的汽车。
She had walked next to him, and involuntarily, her arm had reached out for his passing one, grabbing him by the fingers, turning him around, looking into his eyes.
她曾走在他身旁，不由自主地，她的手臂伸向了他经过的那只手，用手指紧紧抓住他，将他转过身来，凝视着他的眼睛。
And then, simply kissing him.
然后，只是轻轻地吻了他一下。
It had been something different, and special, it had also been quick and she had felt water slipping in through them; she had thought it would be romantic, but it felt like they couldn't control their spit from overflowing.
那原本是与众不同、特别的一刻，发生得迅速，她感觉到水从缝隙中渗入；她曾以为那会是浪漫的，但感觉上却像是他们无法控制唾液的溢出。
Afterwards, the kisses... the making out, became more and more constant, but always at secret, reserved places: in the back alleys of the city, or the sheds where they were supposed to put away the gym equipment at school. Sometimes it was at the roof of their school or of their apartment buildings but it always seemed different and new and exciting and it made her chest feel tight and her stomach flutter.
之后，亲吻和缠绵愈发频繁，却始终在隐秘之地：城市的背街小巷，或是学校里本该存放体育器材的库房。有时在校园或公寓楼的屋顶，每一次都仿佛别具新意，令人激动不已，让她胸口紧绷，胃里翻涌着悸动。
Now, he held her tight, pinning her hands to the side of her head, lacing fingers as she struggled, gently nibbling at her, sucking her bottom lip into his mouth.
此刻，他紧紧拥抱着她，将她的双手按在头的两侧，手指交缠，任她挣扎，轻咬着她，将她的下唇吸入口中。
Asuka did not trash around that much, but to her credit she still did put up a fight, although her own body had already decided the outcome for her in advance; like a match of Go, 10 movements ahead of her head; she felt herself go limp, her movements becoming slower and less urgent, her breathing growing agitated and hungry for more.
明日香并没有过多挣扎，但值得称赞的是，她仍然进行了抵抗，尽管她的身体早已预定了结局；就像围棋中的一局，她的思绪比身体快了十步；她感到自己逐渐瘫软，动作变得迟缓而不迫切，呼吸变得急促而渴望更多。
When he finally released her, sliding his hands around her slender waist, she took the opportunity to kiss him quickly; not a deep searing kiss like the one they had just shared, but a quick peek, looking behind her to where Toji and Hikari where entertaining Nozomi and Mari, who were assuring them both Shinji and Asuka had been behind them, while Toji said something about them probably going to buy stuff.
当他终于放开她，双手滑过她纤细的腰肢时，她趁机迅速吻了他一下；不像他们刚刚分享的那般深沉炽热，而是一个快速的轻吻，她回头望向正在逗弄 Nozomi 和 Mari 的 Toji 和 Hikari，他们正向两人保证 Shinji 和 Asuka 就在他们后面，而 Toji 则提到他们可能去买东西了。
Then, she turned and slapped him.
接着，她转身给了他一巴掌。
"This is supposed to be a secret." Asuka whispered, flushing, to Shinji who kept kissing her. "You know how crazy things will get if this goes out at school. And I'm sure your sister will probably frown and say something like 'Ikari-kun are you aware that you are sucking face with the same girl who has punched you and teased you since we were in elementary?' or whatever" Asuka said fighting to keep her face as emotionless as possible which was hard because staring at Shinji was making it a great deal more difficult.
"这本该是个秘密。" 明日香低声说道，脸颊泛红，而真嗣还在不断亲吻她。"你知道这事要是在学校传开，会闹得多疯。我敢肯定你姐姐可能会皱眉说些类似'真嗣，你意识到自己在和那个从小学起就打你、捉弄你的同一个女孩亲热吗？'之类的话" 明日香努力保持面无表情，这很难，因为凝视着真嗣让这变得更加困难。
"Please, Rei would never say that." Shinji smiled between kisses.
“拜托，丽绝不会说那种话。” 真嗣在亲吻间微笑着。
"You know she doesn't like me."
你知道她不喜欢我。
"I was referring more to the sucking face part."
我更多指的是亲吻脸颊的部分。
Before she could say anything else, Shinji dived forward, kissing her again. Asuka smiled and decided to go with it. Leaning towards him to kiss him, only this time slowly, savoring the time and his lips and his breath.
在她能再说什么之前，真嗣突然向前一跃，再次吻上了她。明日香微笑着，决定顺其自然。她倾身向他，这次缓缓地吻他，细细品味着这一刻和他的唇，还有他的呼吸。
"See…" Toji said in a good-natured, but grumpy way as she saw Asuka and Shinji coming to where they sat with various ice cream cones of assorted flavors. "They went to get you bratty kids ice cream."
“看……”当东治看到明日香和真嗣拿着各种口味的冰淇淋朝他们坐的地方走来时，他好脾气但又有些不耐烦地说，“他们去给你们这些小鬼买冰淇淋了。”
Hikari simply took notice of Asuka's outfit, her hair and how she looked flushed before wisely keeping quiet.
光只是注意到了明日香的装扮、发型以及她泛红的脸颊，然后明智地保持了沉默。
Sometimes it was a good thing your boyfriend was a dense brute.
有时候，你的男朋友是个迟钝的粗人反倒是件好事。
AN.
Wow, I gotta say Go Me!; a new story with enough chapters to say "Ahh to hell with it, I'll just let it go to the background and update whenever (which I won't) a new update for 10 things (short, but it got good reviews from the betas, so here's hopping) and a new update for 30 kisses (initially this was gonna be used on 10 things, but couldn't really fit in the kids, and Asuka doesn't seem like she would have friends or a clique to have over, so…)
哇，我得说，为自己喝彩！一个新故事，章节足够多，以至于想说“算了，随它去吧，我就让它退居幕后，想起来再更新（虽然我不会这么做）”。关于“10 件事”的新更新（虽短，但得到了测试读者的好评，所以期待一下），以及“30 个吻”的新进展（最初打算用在“10 件事”上，但实在难以融入孩子们的情节，而且明日香看起来也不像是会有朋友或小圈子的人，所以……）
Any way, as you can see all of the stories are still being worked with (among other projects) expect updates for Love and hate at least twice a day (yeah, you read correctly, TWICE) and a steady crap load of low budgeted writing crap in the near future.
无论如何，如您所见，所有故事仍在与其他项目一同推进中，预计《爱与恨》至少每天更新两次（没错，您没看错，是两次），不久的将来还会有大量低成本的劣质写作内容涌现。
Now let me go and pat myself in the back and pour myself a martini (shaken, not stirred), of course.
现在让我去拍拍自己的背，给自己倒一杯马提尼（当然，要摇匀，不要搅拌）。

### Chapter 07 Themes: K#27 (Overflow), W#22 (Beautiful)
主题：K#27（溢出），W#22（美丽）

Title: The music of Asuka Langley Sohryu.
标题：Asuka Langley Sohryu 的音乐

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like.
作者注：我在这里为自己辩解一下：这不是我的作品。我试图摆脱写作障碍，所以我要同时接受两个挑战：30 个吻和 30 种方式，融入一个故事中。希望你喜欢。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在人类补完计划期间，创造了无数个世界；从江户时代到千禧年末。每一个都不同，每一个都独一无二。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
但在我们遇见的每一个世界里，都有一个共同的规则；在每一个世界中，我们无一例外地坠入爱河。有时，我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此之间有着深刻的联系。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
这些世界都是以你我为中心构建的。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
这就是唯一的统一规则。（重拍 04）

"Are you ready?" Kaji asked with his eyes, in silence, not emitting a word lest he breaks the concentration that seemed to emanate in weaves from within the red head prodigy in front of him.
"你准备好了吗？" 加治用眼神问道，在沉默中，他一言不发，生怕打破从眼前这位红发天才身上散发出的专注氛围。

Asuka smiled and nodded, her auburn hair bouncing playfully, making a sharp contrast to her clipped, stern face.
明日香微笑着点头，她那赤褐色的头发俏皮地跳动着，与她那紧绷、严肃的面容形成鲜明对比。

Kaji exhaled slowly as he saw her walk towards the center stage, slowly nearing the center stage, walking towards into the light. She stood in the center of the light disc on the floor, looking straight into the eyes of each and every one of them, unflinching, unapologetic.
加治缓缓地呼出一口气，看着她走向舞台中央，逐渐接近舞台中心，步入灯光之中。她站在地板上的光盘中央，直视着每一个人的眼睛，毫不退缩，毫无歉意。

A beat, a heartbeat filled of silence and anticipation.
一拍，一颗充满寂静与期待的心跳。

Then, she curtsied, smiled a hollowed, wooden smile that did not reach her eyes, and bowed.
然后，她行了个屈膝礼，露出了一个空洞的、木然的微笑，那笑容并未触及她的眼眸，随后她鞠了一躬。

And her face became once again emotionless; she closed her eyes, rested the violin against her cheek, and began.
她的面容再次变得毫无表情；她闭上眼睛，将小提琴贴在脸颊上，开始演奏。

Slowly, the sounds began to fill the void; sluggishly, the intonation felt like it was being dragged through mud, a slow crescendo barely there, barely noticeable in every other revolution, almost as if it were a sluggish, hairy caterpillar slowly making its way, the passage of time not bothering the pace of the music at all.
渐渐地，声音开始填补这片空白；音调缓慢地，仿佛被拖过泥泞，一个缓慢的渐强几乎不存在，几乎在每一次旋转中都难以察觉，就像一只缓慢的、毛茸茸的毛毛虫在缓缓前行，时间的流逝丝毫没有影响到音乐的节奏。

Her face was still a stern, emotionless façade.
她的面容依旧是一副严肃、无表情的面具。

Suddenly, a transformation; slowly and small, the tune began to change, a metamorphosis taking place, faint, diluted sounds made way to clearer, sharper strings, more defined notes, more brisk allegro notes; small, gentle, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon, taking the first tentative flaps of her wings.
突然间，一场转变；缓慢而微小，旋律开始变化，一种蜕变正在发生，微弱、稀释的音符让位于更清晰、更尖锐的弦音，更明确的音符，更活泼的快板音符；微小而温柔，如同蝴蝶从茧中初现，尝试着第一次振翅。

But still, the music did not reach her face.
然而，音乐仍未触及她的面庞。

Slowly, the people attending the concert began to see that same small butterfly take flight, the repeating tones of the violin mimicking the flaps of it's wings, and then they became aware of the back ground sound of the full orchestra behind the redhead who was standing in the center stage, eyes closed, fingers dancing, flowing like solid water across the strings, swaying to the music emerging from within herself.
渐渐地，参加音乐会的人们开始看到那只小蝴蝶展翅飞翔，小提琴重复的音调模仿着它的翅膀拍打，随后他们意识到站在舞台中央的红发女子背后，整个管弦乐队的背景声。她闭着眼睛，手指如流水般在弦上舞动，随着从内心涌出的音乐摇摆。

And yet, if they watched with attention, they would see no smiles, just the forceful scrunching of her eyes, almost as if the force of the music was too much to bear, to carry on her own body.
然而，如果他们仔细观察，就会发现她脸上没有笑容，只有眼睛紧闭的强烈表情，仿佛音乐的力量太过沉重，难以独自承受。

The loud rich notes of several other strings, metals and wind instruments began to wave a rich tapestry, almost materializing the woods, the trees, the clear blue sky for the small, delicate butterfly to fly in them; the tempo quickened, and the butterfly became a bumblebee; buzzing, busy little bee, tracing a path, dodging webs and rain and wind.
其他几根弦、金属和管乐器发出的响亮而丰富的音符开始编织一幅丰富的织锦，几乎将森林、树木、清澈的蓝天具象化，供那只小巧精致的蝴蝶在其中飞翔；节奏加快，蝴蝶变成了蜜蜂；忙碌的嗡嗡小蜜蜂，描绘着路径，躲避着蛛网、雨水和风。

And still her face remained a mask of marble, impassive, detached.
而她的面容依旧如大理石面具般冷漠，超然。

But for the audience, that was never apparent.
但对于观众来说，这一点从未显露。

She played slow songs, and fast songs. She played grand noble themes, and tunes that were dripping with force, with an unbridled passion, like a wild stallion on the great, wide divide.
她演奏慢歌，也演奏快歌。她演奏宏伟高贵的主题，以及充满力量、激情四溢的曲调，就像一匹野马在大峡谷上狂奔。

Her face held on. 她的脸坚持着。

Her whole body trembled with the force of her won music, and if anyone would open their eyes and look carefully at the girl, they would notice the music was almost visibly sweating through her pores, a sense, a feeling so great, so undeniably strong it was overflowing her own self, like a big bright fire, consuming everything in it's wake.
她的整个身体随着她自己的音乐力量而颤抖，如果有人睁开眼睛仔细观察这个女孩，他们会注意到音乐几乎通过她的毛孔可见地渗出，一种感觉，一种如此强烈、如此不可否认的强烈感觉，它溢出了她自己的身体，就像一团明亮的大火，在其轨迹中吞噬一切。

She forced her own body not to react to the calling of her own music.
她强迫自己的身体不要对她的音乐召唤做出反应。

For hours and hours more, she graced them and dazzled them. She brought them to ecstasy and beyond. She made their eyes bleed tears of joy and pain as she expertly, methodically, efficiently plucked their souls in the same way she plucked the string of her violin.
她继续数小时地取悦他们，让他们眼花缭乱。她将他们带入狂喜，超越狂喜。她让他们眼中流出喜悦和痛苦的泪水，就像她熟练、有条不紊、高效地拨动小提琴弦一样，拨动他们的灵魂。

She held the music, her dazzling music at bay, bending it, forcing it to do her bidding.
她控制着音乐，她那耀眼的音乐，使其屈服，迫使它服从她的意志。

She made them bleed through their eyes what she bled through her fingertips. All the music held within, all the passion inside of her; all the feelings all the venom, all the bile and the happiness and the mirth. She used the small, wooden instrument like a medium, the thin, razor like strings as a way to convey all the flurry of emotions that were crashing inside of her.
她通过指尖流淌的情感，让他们的眼中涌出同样的血泪。她内心所有的音乐，所有的激情；所有的感受，所有的毒液，所有的苦楚，以及快乐和欢笑。她将那小小的木制乐器当作媒介，将那细如利刃的琴弦作为传达内心澎湃情感的途径。

She frowned as she felt the last drop of it seep away, flow from her tips to the bow, from her fingers to the strings; she felt it combine, lime an old, forgotten alchemical process and become something new, something unique; something that defied description and categorization.
她皱起眉头，感觉到最后一滴情感正从指尖渗出，流向弓弦，从手指传递到琴弦；她感觉到它们融合，就像古老的、被遗忘的炼金术过程，变成了某种新奇、独特的东西；某种难以描述和归类的东西。

For hours upon hours, she held their conscience, their very soul in her grasp, and she played with them all, and in the end, as always, they all got up and gave her an standing ovation.
数小时之久，她掌控着他们的意识，他们的灵魂，她与他们所有人嬉戏，最终，一如往常，他们都站起来为她鼓掌喝彩。

And still, her face never shifted fro the ever-present frown on her face.
尽管如此，她的表情始终没有从那副常挂的皱眉中移开。

"Nice going, Schatz." Kaji told her, as soon as she walked back to the stage. She sighed, but didn't say a word, instead going straight to her dressing room. Kaji saw her, for the second time today walk away, her back stiff, almost like a soldier marching to certain death, not even bothering to turn back.
"干得好，亲爱的。" 卡吉在她一回到舞台时就对她说。她叹了口气，但没说一句话，而是径直走向自己的化妆间。卡吉今天第二次看到她离开，她的背挺得笔直，几乎像一个走向必然死亡的士兵，甚至懒得回头。

He frowned; something had to be done about her. He knew the death of her mother had affected her deeply, but perhaps what affected her more was the choice of her father remarrying again, perhaps what affected her was the way her stepmother tried so hard.
他皱起眉头；必须得为她做点什么。他知道她母亲的去世对她影响很大，但也许更让她受影响的是她父亲再婚的选择，也许更让她受影响的是她的继母如此努力的方式。

Maybe it was all that and maybe it was nothing at all.
或许这一切都是原因，又或许根本什么都不是。

"Hey gorgeous." 嘿，美女。

Kaji smiled despite himself at the sound of the siren calling him. He turned to find the ever present playful smirk of the lovely face of Misato Katsuragi, her tight black evening dress fitting like a glove, making her look extremely sexy, provocative despite it being floor length, and with no plunging neckline, nor an open back; basically the only skin shown were her long, white arms.
尽管如此，加治还是不由自主地对那召唤他的警笛声露出了微笑。他转过身，看到了永远带着俏皮笑意的葛城美里那张美丽的脸庞，她身着紧身的黑色晚礼服，宛如第二层皮肤，让她显得极为性感撩人，尽管裙摆及地，也没有深 V 领口或露背设计；基本上，唯一露出的只有她那双修长白皙的手臂。

Still, he couldn't deny the immediate reaction she got from every heterosexual male in the room; even mousy Hyuga, his reliable assistant was transfixed with her.
尽管如此，他无法否认她立刻吸引了房间里每一位异性恋男性的目光；就连他那可靠的助手，一向腼腆的日向，也对她目不转睛。

She looked beautiful. 她看起来很美。

"What? No greeting for me?" she asked with a playful pout that made the suave promoter brush his unruly hair back, a playful, roguish smirk on his stubble-covered face.
"什么？连个招呼都不给我打吗？"她带着俏皮的撅嘴问道，这让那位风度翩翩的推广人往后捋了捋自己凌乱的头发，脸上带着一丝玩世不恭的坏笑，胡茬隐约可见。

"I would give you more than a greeting if we were alone and you know it." He began with the smooth talking, deep smoky tone he knew she loved so well, to then envelop her in a friendly (maybe a tad tight for friendly) hug.
"如果我们独处，我给你的可不止是一个问候。"他开始用那深沉而烟熏般的嗓音，那是他知道她非常喜欢的，随后将她拥入一个友好（或许对朋友来说略显紧绷）的拥抱中。

"How you been?" She asked smiling.
"你最近怎么样？"她微笑着问道。

"Working, which means I'm babysitting the prima Donna you just heard." He replied easily, walking through the backstage towards the visitors lounge. "What about you? Still working as a high profile baby sitter for that jerk?"
工作呗，其实就是刚听到的那个自负的家伙的保姆。"他轻松地回答，一边穿过后台走向访客休息室。"你呢？还在给那个混蛋当高级保姆吗？

"Yes she is, Mr. Kaji." A low, but deep rumbling voice answered behind him. "Although I still go by Dr. Ikari, thank you very much."
是的，她是，葛城先生。"一个低沉而有力的声音在他身后回答道，"尽管我仍然被称为碇博士，非常感谢。

Kaji sighed and turned to face him, a charming smile on his face even after the dreadful faux pas.
葛城叹了口气，转过身来面对他，脸上依旧挂着迷人的微笑，尽管刚刚犯了严重的失礼。

"And it is lovely to see you again Dr." He bowed traditionally at the imposing man flanked by a couple who seemed to be the same age as Asuka.
"再次见到您真是太好了，博士。"他向那位威严的男子传统地鞠了一躬，那男子身边站着一对看起来和明日香年纪相仿的男女。

Almost as if he had read his mind, Ikari introduced them. "My son and adopted daughter, Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami."
仿佛读懂了他的心思，碇介绍道："这是我的儿子和养女，碇真嗣和绫波丽。"

"Pleased to meet you." Kaji said as he bowed again. "So what brings you here?" He asked once the pleasantries had been out of the way."
"很高兴见到你。" 薰再次鞠躬说道，"那么，是什么风把你吹到这里来的？" 在寒暄过后，他问道。

"We came to enjoy the music." Ikari said calmly. "When we heard your German prodigy was in town I decided to come and see if she was worthy of all that praise."
我们来欣赏音乐。" 碇说得很平静，"听说你的德国神童来到了镇上，我决定来看看她是否真的配得上那些赞誉。

"She does live to her reputation." Rei said softly, and Gendo allowed himself the smallest of smirks before continuing.
"她的确不负盛名。" 绫波轻声说道，而元度则微微一笑，然后继续说下去。

"My son was so entranced by her I instructed Miss Katsuragi to grant him a quick interview."
我儿子被她深深吸引，我便指示葛城小姐给他安排了一个简短的采访。

Kaji turned to Misato, a small smile on his face; it held no emotions behind, it seemed mechanical, almost as if someone had drawn it onto his face. "Did you now?"
薰转向明日香，脸上挂着一丝微笑；这微笑毫无情感，显得机械，仿佛是有人画在他脸上的。“是吗？”

"Of course when she knew she will have to speak directly with you, she more than jumped for the chance to get us all tickets for the concert."
当然，当她知道将直接与你交谈时，她迫不及待地抓住机会为我们所有人弄到了音乐会的票。

"And I thank you for your patronage." Kaji said bowing formally, like an actor after receiving a prize. "However I'm sorry to inform you and your family Miss Sohryu is not in the best…disposition to greet fans."
“我感谢您的惠顾。”薰正式地鞠了一躬，就像演员在接受奖项后那样。“但遗憾的是，我必须告诉您和您的家人，苏芳小姐目前的状态并不适合接待粉丝。”

"I'm sure you can arrange something."
“我相信您能安排些什么。”

"When she is in that mood she will only communicate in-"
当她处于那种情绪时，她只会用这种方式交流——

"Shinji is well versed in Japanese, English and German, which I believe are the languages your charge expresses herself in fluently."
真嗣精通日语、英语和德语，我相信这些是你所负责的人流利表达自己的语言。

"Mr. Ikari." 碇先生。

"Dr. Ikari." He stressed the Doctor, and Kaji sighed, remembering why it had been difficult to work even as a third party for this man; his reputation preceded him, and he always did get what he wanted.
"碇博士。" 他强调了“博士”二字，而卡吉叹了口气，回想起为何即使作为第三方为这个人工作也如此困难；他的名声先于他本人，而他总是能得到他想要的。

"Dr. Ikari." Kaji matched his tone and words. "May I know why you seem so…interested in your son getting to know her?"
碇博士。" 加持用同样的语气和措辞回应。"我能知道您为什么对您儿子认识她这么感兴趣吗？

"I have no need to inform you such things." He finished with clear intentions, making Misato blush and try to sputter a response. Before she could however, Ikari turned around and walked away.
"我没有必要告诉你这些。" 他明确地结束了对话，让美里脸红并试图结巴着回应。然而，在她能开口之前，碇转身离开了。

"Katsuragi, deal with this, I saw an old acquaintance and need to speak with him." He said offhandedly over his shoulder, just as he clapped his hand over a gray haired, distinguished looking older gentle man referring to him only as "Professor".
"葛城，处理一下这个，我遇到了一个老熟人，需要和他谈谈。" 他随口说着，同时用手拍了拍一位灰白头发、看起来很有威严的老绅士的肩膀，只称呼他为"教授"。

Before Misato could begin to try and explain herself, Rei spoke up as well.
在美里开始尝试解释自己之前，绫波也开口了。

"I too, will be leaving." She said as she walked towards the back door, before leaning closer to Shinji and whispering something to him, something meant only for the two of them, but Kaji caught the way she spoke silently, and how Shinji could only stare and nod.
"我也要离开了。"她说着走向后门，在靠近真嗣时低声对他耳语了几句，那是只属于他们两人的秘密，但加持注意到了她说话的隐秘方式，以及真嗣只能呆呆地望着并点头。

Kaji redirected his attention to Misato.
加持将注意力转向了美里。

"So." 那么。

"So." Misato said forcefully, intent on saving face against him. "About what that Jerk-"
那么。"美里强硬地说道，决心在他面前挽回颜面。"关于那个混蛋——

"He still goes by Dr. Ikari." Kaji playfully reminded her, earning a small smile for Shinji and a glare from Misato.
"他仍然被称为碇博士。" 加持俏皮地提醒她，为真嗣赢得了一个微笑，却换来了美里的一瞥。

"Yes, any way he-" 是的，无论他-

"It's nice to see you again." Kaji interrupted her again. "And it will be no problem for me to introduce the young Mr. Ikari to the lovely Miss Sohryu. She was having a rather hard time earlier, but…" He leaned at Shinji, whispering softly, looking at him in the eye.
"很高兴再次见到你。" 加持再次打断了她。"而且对我来说，向年轻的碇先生介绍可爱的明日香小姐没有任何问题。她之前遇到了一些困难，但是……" 他靠近真嗣，轻声耳语，直视他的眼睛。

"I'm sure you can help her have a great time."
我相信你能帮她度过一段美好时光。

Shinji blushed and sputtered a response; thankfully, Misato came to his aid.
真嗣脸红了，结结巴巴地回答；幸好，美里来帮他解了围。

"Yeah, Shinji you can show her those things you do with your fingers."
对啊，真嗣，你可以展示一下你用手指做的那些事情。

Or not. 或者不展示。

"But before he does…" Kaji smirked lazily. "I want to know why you want to know her so much." He directed the question at Shinji, and he gasped at the bluntness of it.
"但在他展示之前…" 加持懒洋洋地笑了笑。"我想知道你为什么这么想了解她。" 他把这个问题直接抛给了真嗣，真嗣对这直白的提问感到惊讶。

"W-well I…" Shinji began hesitantly. Stopped, took a deep breath and composed himself, waiting for his hands to stop trembling.
"嗯，我…" 真嗣开始时有些迟疑。他停了下来，深吸一口气，整理了一下自己的情绪，等待双手停止颤抖。

"You see, I knew her before, we met once, back when my mother was still alive." He began again. "Her mother was a guest at the institute and somehow both our mothers coincided at the same place."
你看，我之前就认识她，我们曾见过一次，那时我母亲还在世。" 他重新开始说道，"她的母亲是研究所的客人，不知怎么的，两位母亲恰巧在同一个地方相遇了。

Kaji nodded, signaling Shinji to continue.
加持点头示意真嗣继续说下去。

"We met several times while they stayed there, and her mother and my mother became good friends, exchanging letters. My mother would always use talk about me and would ask Mrs. Sohryu about her daughter. She never had a chance to go to her funeral, but entrusted me with something to give her."
她们在那里逗留期间，我们见过好几次面，她的母亲和我的母亲成了好朋友，经常互通信件。我母亲总是提起我，并询问苏利宇女士关于她女儿的事情。她没能参加她的葬礼，但托付给我一样东西，让我转交给她。

"Why couldn't your mother come?" Kaji asked.
"为什么你妈妈不能来？" 加持问道。

"She died a few months back." Shinji answered simply, but he could see in his posture, in his hands and face and just by the way he was standing it still hurt.
"她几个月前去世了。" 真嗣简单地回答，但从他的姿态、手势和面部表情，以及他站立的方式，可以看出这仍然让他感到痛苦。

A lot. 很多。

"She knew the fire had been devastating, and that Mrs. Sohryu had pushed her daughter out a window into the cold water just as the fire began to make the timbers of the lake house fall on top of her." Shinji continued, more calmed now.
"她知道那场火灾是毁灭性的，而且苏芳女士在火势开始使湖边小屋的横梁坍塌时，及时将她的女儿从窗户推入冰冷的水中。" 真嗣继续说道，现在更加平静了。

"She wished she could have been by her side, but the cancer had debilitated her to a point when she could not even hold a spoon to feed herself." Misato added, whispering the last part.
"她多么希望自己能陪在她身边，但癌症已将她削弱到连勺子都握不住来喂自己的地步。"Misato 补充道，最后一句是低声耳语。

"On her death bed, my mother told me that when I had the chance to see Miss Sohryu again, to give her this."
在临终之际，我母亲告诉我，若有机会再见到 Sohryu 小姐，就把这个交给她。

He took a carefully laminated picture from within the inside pocket of his suit jacket, followed by a small envelope. He handed it to Kaji who opened it up, unfolded the first page, read…and stopped short.
他从西装内袋里小心翼翼地取出一张塑封的照片，随后是一个小信封。他递给 Kaji，后者打开信封，展开第一页，阅读起来……突然停住了。

It was the last letter Kyoko Zepellin Sohryu had wrote to his mother.
那是 Kyoko Zepellin Sohryu 写给母亲最后一封信。

In it in precise, beautiful and tight handwritten cursive letters, she spoke of the general happenings. She told Yui that she was having more and more problems moving around, and that she had decided to go to her old lake house to spend some time relaxing, noting that Asuka might be there, and that she might, at last tell her truth.
在精确、优美且紧凑的手写草书字母中，她讲述了普遍发生的事情。她告诉唯，她越来越难以四处走动，并决定去她旧湖边的房子放松一下，提到明日香可能在那里，她最终可能会告诉她真相。

The truth was that Kyoko had ASL, not a full paralysis, but enough to be an impediment to be at her daughter's concert. She knew it wounded her, but kept it a secret from her, under the guise of too much work.
真相是，Kyoko 患有 ASL，并非完全瘫痪，但足以成为她参加女儿音乐会的障碍。她知道这伤害了她，但以工作太忙为由对她保密。

She told Yui that she knew, given Asuka's attachment to her, she would quit the music world if she ever found out to take care of her, and she could never do that; She knew Asuka's music was something beyond, and she felt an obligation to the world in making Asuka show them that.
她告诉唯，考虑到明日香对她的依恋，如果她发现真相，她会放弃音乐界来照顾她，而她永远不能那样做；她知道明日香的音乐是超越性的，她感到有责任让明日香向世界展示这一点。

But on the last two pages, Kaji saw the regret that she had, how she had wanted all that time to be on the same stage as her daughter, crying with the rest of the people enjoying her music, how she praised and call her her little treasure, her small miracle.
但在最后两页，Kaji 看到了她的悔恨，她多么希望那段时间能和女儿同台，和其他人一起享受她的音乐而流泪，她如何赞美并称她为她的宝贝，她的小奇迹。

Kaji could literally see the tears streaming down Kyoko Zepellin Sohryu's perfect face, the tears streaming down Yui Ikair's high cheekbones. He read the paragraphs and immediately felt like a burglar, a prowler robbing Asuka of memories that should be hers. He finally understood the thin red thread of fate that was woven to connect these two souls.
加持能清晰地看到泪水顺着葛城美里·索龙完美的脸庞滑落，也看到它们沿着碇唯高高的颧骨流淌。他读着这些段落，立刻感觉自己像个窃贼，一个潜行者，盗取了本应属于明日香的记忆。他终于明白了那根将这两个灵魂紧紧相连的命运红线。

"Misato…" He said as he folded the letter and gave it back to Shinji before cupping his back and guiding him towards the door fo Asuka's dressing room, ignoring his mumbled protest and how his heels dug on the floor to prevent this from happening. "I feel like getting a drink, and haven't had a Yebisu in years…"
美里……" 他说着，将信折好还给真嗣，然后扶着他的背，引导他走向明日香的更衣室门口，无视他的低声抗议和用脚跟抵住地面以阻止这一幕发生的动作。"我想喝一杯，已经好几年没喝过惠比寿啤酒了……

He gave a final push after opening the door, ignoring Shinji's lowly yelp of surprise and closing it, before turning to Misato, offering her arm.
在打开门后，他用力推了一把，无视真嗣低低的惊叫声，然后关上门，转向美里，向她伸出手臂。

"Care to join me?" 愿意和我一起去吗？

Shinji stood there, not moving, not knowing what to do. There was nobody inside the dressing room, and for a moment he was unsure if he had understood correctly what Kaji had told him; was she in her room? Was she going to be coming any minute now?
真嗣站在那里，一动不动，不知道该做什么。更衣室里空无一人，有那么一刻，他不确定自己是否正确理解了加持的话；她在自己的房间里吗？她会马上来吗？

He took the moment to look across it, drinking in every small detail.
他趁机环顾四周，细细品味每一个小细节。

She was a contradiction. 她是个矛盾体。

He got near the vanity mirror in the far end of the room and saw that it had nothing more than the clothes she had been wearing.
他走近房间尽头的梳妆镜，发现里面除了她穿过的衣服外别无他物。

Her violin laid in the middle of the mess that was her room; strewn across it were the dress she had been wearing, the shoes and the stockings bunched in one corner; the steam coming form underneath the door signaled she was currently taking a shower.
她的房间一片狼藉，小提琴就躺在中间；她穿过的裙子、鞋子和堆在角落的袜子散落一地；门缝下冒出的蒸汽表明她正在洗澡。

Shinji paled at that; how could he have not noticed? He turned around with the intention of leaving, but instead was staring the brightest, bluest eyes he had ever seen.
听到这话，真嗣脸色一白；他怎么会没注意到呢？他转身打算离开，却对上了他有生以来见过的最明亮、最湛蓝的双眼。

They eyes of a scowling Asuka Langley Sohryu.
那是眉头紧锁的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的眼睛。

"Who are you and what are you doing here?" she asked in a forced, clipped and obviously displeased way.
“你是谁，在这里做什么？”她用一种刻意、简短且明显不悦的语气问道。

Shinji could only stare at the girl in front of him, clad in only a pink towel that reached mid thigh, her hair enveloped in a similar towel that had some tendrils escaping from within it. Her skin looked flushed, no wonder from the hot water she had employed to take a bath.
真嗣只能盯着眼前的女孩，她只裹着一条及膝的粉色浴巾，头发也被同款浴巾包裹，几缕发丝从中逃逸出来。她的皮肤泛着红晕，难怪，刚用热水洗过澡。

Shinji could only gape at her undeniable beauty, even when not clothed (In fact, especially when she wasn't clothed), and had no make-up of any kind, she was a sight to behold; past the radiant blue eyes, and fiery red hair laid perfect alabaster smooth skin, like creams and peaches, and her lips-
真嗣只能目瞪口呆地凝视她那无可否认的美，即使未着衣裳（事实上，尤其是她未着衣裳时），且未施任何脂粉，她依旧是令人瞩目的景象；透过那双明亮的蓝眼睛和火红的头发，是如奶油和桃子般光滑的完美肌肤，还有她的双唇——

Were still moving. 仍在动。

"I asked you what the hell where you doing here!" She asked again. Normally, she would have shouted at the top of her lungs, and Kaji would have barged inside, grabbing this pervert by the collar and throwing him out, however there was something…soothing about him, she felt she had met him before.
"我问你到底在这里干什么！" 她再次质问。通常情况下，她会大声尖叫，而卡吉会冲进来，抓住这个变态的衣领把他扔出去，然而，他身上有种……令人安心的感觉，她觉得自己以前见过他。

"Hey idiot! You speak English? Dummkopf! Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Anta Baka! Nihongo wo Hanashi Masuka?"
嘿，傻瓜！你会说英语吗？笨蛋！Sprechen Sie Deutsch？你个笨蛋！你会说日语吗？

"Uh…Yes, Ja, Hai…" 呃…是的，Ja，はい…

She stopped short, surprise etched across her face. "Y-you…" She began, liking her lips in anticipation. "You understand me?"
她突然停下，惊讶地表情凝固在脸上。"你…"她开始说，舔了舔嘴唇，充满期待。"你听得懂我说话吗？"

Shinji looked at her blushing. "You might not remember me; I'm Shinji Ikari." He finished before thrusting his hand towards her.
真嗣看着她，脸颊泛红。"你可能不记得我了；我是碇真嗣。"他说完，便向她伸出手。

A thousand memories came back; Memories of him, sitting next to her, laughing in dull sounds, memories of him, smiling, trying t cheer her up, memories of him and her, pushing him away, angry at him, at her mother, at the whole world.
千百回忆涌上心头；回忆中的他，坐在她身旁，发出沉闷的笑声，回忆中的他，微笑着，试图逗她开心，回忆中的他和她，将他推开，对他、对她母亲、对整个世界都感到愤怒。

Memories of her good bye, and the soft, chaste kiss she gave him on the lips.
回忆起她的告别，以及她轻柔而纯洁地吻在他唇上的那一刻。

"Sh-Shinji... kun?" She said in dull sounds, her tongue not used to talking after her eardrums had exploded, plunging her into a world of silence only her music, the music of Asuka Langley Sohryu could break free.
"新...新二？" 她用沉闷的声音说道，她的舌头因耳膜爆炸后不习惯说话，将她抛入一个只有她的音乐，明日香·兰格雷的音乐才能打破的寂静世界。

Shinji nodded, smiling, and that was all she needed.
新二点头微笑，这正是她所需要的全部。

She launched herself at him, hugging him with such a force he felt his bones turn to dust, like she wanted to fuse herself, mold with him, become only one.
她猛地扑向他，用力抱住他，力度之大仿佛要将他的骨头碾成粉末，就像她想要与自己融合，与他合为一体。

And in the midst of it all, she gave the him the most perfect, mind blowing, searing, hot waves crashing stop-the-world kiss he had ever had (conveniently, the second one he had ever had)
在这所有之中，她给了他一个最完美、令人神魂颠倒、炽热如海浪撞击、让世界停止的吻，这是他从未有过的（巧的是，这也是他的第二个吻）。

You see, Asuka had been born like a normal baby, but suffered from a severe from of tinnitus.
你看，明日香出生时和普通婴儿一样，但患有严重的耳鸣。

Her eardrum had distended earlier on her childhood, and by the time she had reached her mid teens, her hearing was lost on a 20 percent. By the time she was on her late teens she was deaf, but she played the most beautiful music other ears had ever heard; sublime and poetic, lyrical and exhaling; her music was capable of bringing people to tears, eliciting a standing ovation whenever she played.
她的耳膜在童年早期就已扩张，到了十几岁时，她的听力已经丧失了 20%。到了青春期末，她完全失聪，但她演奏的音乐却是他人耳中听过最美妙的；崇高而富有诗意，抒情而深沉；她的音乐能让人感动落泪，每次演奏都能赢得满堂喝彩。

And for the first time after the death of her mother, she was with someone who knew what she had went through, who understood her better than anyone else, who spoke her same language.
这是她母亲去世后第一次，她与一个真正了解她所经历的人在一起，这个人比任何人都更理解她，说着与她相同的语言。

You see…Shinji Ikari, like Asuka Langley Sohryu, is deaf too.
你看，碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷一样，也是聋的。

AN. I don't really know how this came into fruition. I guess it's the perks of letting your body sit in a computer and let it just…type away…
作者的话：我真不知道这个故事是怎么写出来的。我想，大概就是让身体坐在电脑前，任由它自由地打字的结果吧……

Tinnitus is the name of Beethoven's hearing impairment, this story might have repeated elements and themes of 10 things, since I have been forced to attend classical music concerts by school (I'm not complaining, in fact it's a great exercise trying to describe music using words) I know the whole concept of someone who is hearing impaired playing music is ludicrous, however a close friend of mine who was born deaf would tell me in sign language that she loved to strum her guitar simply to feel the vibrations of the strings. She still comes to my house when I'm back home and when we talk, she would put her hands on my throat to feel the air coming through it, trying to vocalize what she feels.
耳鸣是贝多芬听力障碍的名称，这个故事可能重复了一些元素和主题，因为我被迫参加学校的古典音乐会（我并不抱怨，实际上尝试用文字描述音乐是一种很好的练习）。我知道一个听力受损的人演奏音乐的概念很荒谬，但是一个生来就聋的密友会用手语告诉我，她喜欢弹吉他只是为了感受弦的振动。她仍然会在我回家时来我家，当我们交谈时，她会把她的手放在我的喉咙上，感受空气通过，试图表达她的感受。

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an update for Love and Hate to do.
现在，如果你不介意的话，我得更新一下关于爱与恨的内容。

### Chapter 08 Themes: K# 24 (Good night), W#08 (Kitchen)
主题：K#24（晚安），W#08（厨房）

Title: Reality Bites. 标题：现实残酷。

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like.
A.N.: 我会在此空间为自己辩解：这并非我所愿。我正努力克服写作瓶颈，因此决定同时挑战两个任务：在一篇故事中融合 30 个吻和 30 种情境。期待你的喜爱。

This short story is based on MagnumPI459's original idea of Quantum Genesis Evangelion Universe B, which you should read and review...really. I'm just hijacking his idea and Anno's character for the perverse pleasure of screwing them even more.
这篇短文灵感源自 MagnumPI459 的原创概念——量子创世纪福音战士宇宙 B，你确实应该去读一读并给出你的看法...真的。我不过是借用了他的创意和庵野的角色，出于一种扭曲的乐趣，将他们进一步颠覆。

Short synopsis: Reality is never a linear notion. A ripple effect, a butterfly effect has the consequences of creating infinite realities. In this case, we focus on a reality very much like the one we know, with several key differences. And I want to point this is NOT "The twilight Zone". Shinji Ikari has been absorbed by Leliel, and finds himself in a different Universe, Misato is clean, Rei speaks her mind and Asuka is shy. The story is in progress, but…
简述：现实绝非单一维度。涟漪效应、蝴蝶效应引发的结果是衍生出无数可能的现实。本故事聚焦于一个与我们世界极为相似的现实，却存在若干关键差异。特别指出，这并非“迷离时空”。碇真嗣被雷利尔吞噬后，发现自己置身于另一宇宙，美里纯洁无辜，零坦率表达，而明日香则显得羞涩。故事仍在进行中，然而……
WE know how the attempted kiss ended in Universe A, but I have to wonder how did it happened in "Universe B"?
我们已知 A 宇宙中尝试接吻的结局，但我仍好奇在“B 宇宙”里这一幕是如何上演的？

Useless Japanese lesson 101. "Aka" is Japanese for "Red". It can also be used as a short form for redhead (akage), baby (akago) and no good/useless person (akan).
日语入门 101："Aka"表示"红色"，亦可简称为红发（赤毛）、婴儿（赤子）及无用之人（赤ん坊）。

Best of all, it rhymes with Baka.
最妙的是，它和“傻瓜”一词押韵。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

The soft chords of Asuka's violin wafted through the room, she was sitting by herself, as always when she practiced, drawing her bow against the filament strings with grace and expertise born out of years of playing the instrument with consecrated teachers in Germany.
阿苏卡的小提琴奏出柔和的和弦，弥漫在房间中。她像往常一样独自坐着练习，以优雅而娴熟的动作拉弓触弦，这份技艺是多年来在德国跟随资深教师刻苦学习的结果。

She was drawn to the music, softly humming to herself as she reflected on the events of the day that was already, with the rays of the setting sun coming to an end.
她被音乐所吸引，轻声哼唱，沉思着随着夕阳余晖渐渐落幕的一天里发生的事情。

She stopped, and plucked at one of the chords of the violin, listening to its sound distending through the airwaves, becoming fainter, lower, smaller.
她停下脚步，轻触小提琴的一根弦，倾听那声音在空气中渐渐扩散，变得愈发微弱、低沉而细小。

She closed her eyes, let out a sight and began again.
她闭上双眼，轻叹一声，再次尝试。

And all the while she remembered.
她始终铭记在心。

"Hey, A-ka…" Asuka griped as she heard the sing-song elongated last vowels of her "official" nickname.
"嘿，A-ka…" 明日香不满地听着自己"官方"昵称那故意拖长的尾音。

How she hated it. 她对此深恶痛绝。

It had started out as a joke for him; When he had met her at the Over the Rainbow, while Misato was off molesting Kaji and he kept telling to let it go, Asuka had been shyly looking at the confident Third child.
最初，这不过是他的一场玩笑；在“彩虹之上”与她邂逅时，美里正忙于纠缠加持，而他一再劝解要放手，明日香则羞怯地注视着那位自信的第三适格者。

He had just gotten out of the helicopter, escorted by those two other students, Kensuke Aida, with a camera taking pictures for the school newspaper, followed by the straight faced class representative Toji Suzuhara, who claimed he had come representing the student body of Tokyo-3 Municipal high school.
他刚下直升机，由安田健介等两名学生陪同，安田手持相机正为校报拍摄照片。表情严肃的班长铃原东治紧随其后，他自称代表东京-3 市立高中的学生团体前来。

The last ones to step out had been Shinji Ikari and Hikari Horaki; Both snickering and laughing, Hikari even prodding the third child while he smirked at her in a confident way as Asuka had walked down smiling to greet her old guardian.
最后离开的是碇真嗣和班长光，两人边走边笑，光还时不时地逗弄真嗣，而真嗣则自信地对她微笑。与此同时，明日香带着笑容走下去迎接她的老监护人。

As she reached the platform, she smiled at Misato, bowing slightly at tall of them.
她抵达站台时，对美里展露微笑，并向在场的所有人轻轻鞠了一躬。

"Hello, my name is Asuka Langley Sohryu, pleased to meet you."
你好，我叫飞鸟·兰利·明日香，很高兴认识你。

While the pleasantries had gone underway (Toji and Kensuke smiling at her, while Kensuke blindsided her with picture after picture taken in quick succession, Shinji and Hikari stayed behind, snickering at her.
寒暄之际，冬二和剑介向她微笑，剑介趁机快速连拍，而真嗣和光则在后方偷笑。

When she had to greet him, she saw that he was watching her with an unreadable expression, part snickering, part smiling, confident and smooth and his eyes were bluer than the blue depths of the water were the carrier was on right now.
她向他打招呼时，发现他用一种难以解读的表情看着她，似笑非笑，既自信又从容，他的眼睛比此刻船只所在水域的深蓝还要深邃。

Just as she was about to greet him, a gust of wind decided to make her first impression memorable, lifting the hem of her yellow sundress, making Asuka scream in shock and surprise and embarrassment as everyone got a front seat at seeing just how new her panties were.
就在她准备向对方问好之际，一阵风突如其来，让她的初次亮相变得难忘——黄色的太阳裙被掀起，明日香惊慌失措地尖叫起来，尴尬至极，因为所有人都目睹了她那崭新的内裤。

Of course Hikari had taken Kensuke's camera and wasted no time taking pictures of her, much to Asuka's mortification, while Shinji simple laughed at it all.
自然，光接过健介的相机，立刻拍下了她的照片，令明日香尴尬不已，而真嗣只是在一旁笑而不语。

Before he finally smirked at her, ignoring her flushed, embarrassed face, her baby blue eyes brimming with tears.
他最终对她咧嘴一笑，对那涨红而尴尬的脸庞视而不见，任由她那双婴儿蓝的眼睛里泪水盈盈。

"Shinji Ikari…charmed huh?" He said, and there was a strange glint in his eyes that, before snorting in disgust and muttering "Aka…"
"碇真嗣…还挺有魅力的嘛？" 他开口说道，眼中掠过一抹奇异的光芒，接着不屑地哼了一声，低声嘟囔了句“赤…”

The next day, Asuka was greeted when she entered classroom 2-A with a huge print out of her shocked face, her mouth wide open as she screamed, her skirt flapping in the wind.
次日，明日香踏入 2-A 教室的那一刻，一张巨幅打印照片映入眼帘，捕捉了她惊愕的表情，嘴巴张得老大，尖叫声仿佛可闻，裙子在风中翻飞。

And her panties, proudly showed for everyone to see.
她的内裤，公然展示，供众人观赏。

"Yo Aka…I'm talkin' to ya." Hikari "The Mace" Horaki screamed at her, grabbing her by the shoulder, making the poor redhead jump in terror.
"喂，赤……我在跟你说话。"光 "铁锤" 博立冲她吼道，一把抓住她的肩膀，吓得那红发女孩惊恐地跳了起来。

"Ahh…" she screamed turning around. "Y-you better stay away from me H-Hikari…I know it was you who printed those pictures of me at swimming cla-"
啊…" 她惊叫着转过身，"你…你最好别靠近我，光…我知道那些我的游泳课照片是你打印的——

"Shut up." 别说话了。

Instantly, Asuka closed her mouth and stopped talking, a fearful look on her face.
瞬间，明日香闭口不言，脸上露出惊恐的神色。

"Listen kraut…are you doin' anything tomorrow?"
喂，德国佬，你明天有安排吗？

"W-well I have my violin lesson and-"
对了，我得去上小提琴课，然后-

"Stop." Hikari raised her opened palm and Asuka again kept quiet. "Let me put it this way…are you doin' anything fun tomorrow?"
停一下。"光举起手掌示意，明日香便再次沉默了。"这么说吧……你明天有什么有趣的活动吗？

"Uh…N-no..?" Asuka answered tentatively, wondering if that was what the girl in front of her wanted to hear…
"呃…不…？" 明日香迟疑地回答，心里琢磨着这会不会是面前女孩期望的答案…

"You mean you'll be available tomorrow."
你是说明天你能来吗？

"I-I guess." 我想应该是这样。

Hikari smiled, baring her fangs. "Great, then I've got a favor to ask you." She showed Asuka her closed fist, shaking it near her nose. "And I suggest you say yes, got it?"
光微笑着，露出尖牙。“太好了，我正好有件事想请你帮忙。”她向飞鸟展示紧握的拳头，并在她鼻尖前晃了晃。“我建议你答应，明白了吗？”

Asuka whimpered and nodded.
明日香哽咽着点头。

Hikari remained quiet for a few seconds, which felt like hours to Asuka. It was clear from her smirk and posture that she enjoying that look, the feel of utter helplessness, like a squirming worm the second child was giving out.
光沉默了片刻，对明日香而言仿佛度过了漫长的时光。她那得意的笑容和姿态清楚地表明，她正陶醉于这种彻底的无助感，就像第二孩子所流露出的那种挣扎的蠕虫一般。

"Listen, for some strange reason this loser wants to date you." Hikari said bluntly. "So you have a date tomorrow with him."
听我说，不知怎么的，这个不怎么样的家伙居然想和你约会。" 光直白地说道，"你明天得和他去约会了。

It took Asuka a moment to understand what was going on.
飞鸟过了一会儿才搞清楚状况。

"W-wait…What?" 等一下…什么？

Hikari let out an aggravated sigh. Wait for her small brain to get on with the program.
光烦躁地叹了口气，得等她那小脑袋反应过来。

"What! A date?" A terrified Asuka imagined as whomever this date was took her to a deserted alley and started to have his way with her only to-
"什么！竟然是约会？" 惊慌失措的明日香脑海中浮现出这样的场景：无论对方是谁，他带她进入一条荒僻的小巷，开始肆意妄为，然而..

"Listen Aka…" Hikari sighed, as she placed her right arm loosely around Asuka's shoulder, ignoring the frown she got as she used that stupid nickname again. The guy's a friend of Kodama, my big sister. And he keeps asking and askin' me to set you and him up." She reached for the waistband of her skirt and extracted a thick wad of cash.
"听着，阿光……" 光叹了口气，右臂随意地搭在明日香肩上，对明日香因她再次使用那个愚蠢昵称而皱眉的表情视而不见。"那人是姐姐儿玉的朋友，他一直缠着我，非要我撮合你们俩。" 她从裙腰带里抽出一叠厚厚的钞票。

"He already paid me in advance so that means tomorrow you are gonna have to show up, got it?" She smiled a toothy smile at her, and Asuka could hear the unspoken or else in Hikari's speech.
"他已经预付了款项，所以明天你得准时出现，懂了吗？"她向她展露了一个灿烂的笑容，而明日香能感受到光里话语中隐含的"否则"意味。

Before she could say something, though, Shinji appeared out of nowhere. "C'mon you." He grumbled, not pleased, but then again, Shinji was never happy, and the only time he smiled was when he was making her miserable.
就在她开口之前，真嗣突然不知从何处出现。“快点，你。”他不满地嘟囔着，毕竟真嗣总是郁郁寡欢，他唯一露出笑容的时刻，便是让她感到痛苦的时候。

"We have to go to do some Sync test." He said softly, and grabbed her hand, a small, possessive gesture, but at the same time intimate and frail, his hand was gently poised over her knuckles, and the soft pressure he had on it seemed out of character for Shinji, almost as if he were afraid to push too hard and break her.
"我们得去做同步测试。"他柔声说着，握住她的手，这动作虽小却充满占有欲，同时又显得亲密而脆弱。他的手轻覆在她的指节上，那份轻柔的压力与真嗣平日的风格大相径庭，仿佛他生怕稍一用力就会伤到她。

Asuka let herself be taken by Shinji, who apparently didn't mind or didn't care that he arrived into NERV still holding her hand, but she was sure she would still feel the heat on her face even after she took the coldest of showers once the test was over.
明日香任由真嗣牵着手，他似乎并不在意或未察觉到抵达 NERV 时仍紧握着她的手。她预感，即便测试后洗了冷水澡，脸颊上的热意也难以消退。

"Microsis operation completed. Inversable graph measurements analyzed."
微系统手术操作完毕。对可逆图的测量数据进行了分析。

The mechanic voices echoed through the vast expense that was the Pribnow Box. All of the available eyes and ears were currently strained on the exercise at hand, no one dared to let out a breath; even though this was one of those "routine exercises" there was always the possibility of something going wrong.
机械师的声音在宽阔的普里布诺箱内回响。所有在场者的目光和听觉都紧绷着，全神贯注于眼前的训练，无人敢松一口气；即便这只是一次“例行训练”，但意外总是可能发生。

So everyone kept their collective breath waiting for the agonizing seconds until…
于是大家都屏息凝神，等待着那煎熬的几秒钟直到……

"Synchro-position is normal."
同步位置处于正常状态。

Immediately, everyone let out a sigh of relief.
顿时，所有人都松了口气。

Ritsuko wordlessly began to busily scribble on her clipboard, pausing every now and then to collect her thoughts before continuing. She stopped and reached for one of the many aluminum cans that were lined in front of her, pausing to look at it expectantly.
律子默默地开始在写字板上忙碌地涂写，不时停下整理思绪，再继续。她停笔，伸手取过面前排列的铝罐之一，满怀期待地凝视着。

"Ritsuko, stop trying to transform that coffee into beer with your mind power alone." Misato said without even looking up from her clipboard.
"Ritsuko,别再试图仅凭意念把那杯咖啡变成啤酒了。" 碇真嗣头也不抬地从她的写字板上说道。

"So, which dress are you wearing?"
对了，你打算穿哪条裙子？

"Oh, for the wedding tomorrow?" Ritsuko asked as she continued checking the marks from her clipboard while Misato surveyed everything with a calm detachment. "I don't know…what about you?"
哦，是为了明天的婚礼吗？" 理津子一边继续核对剪贴板上的标记，一边问道，而美里则保持着冷静的旁观态度，审视着周围的一切。"我不太清楚……你有什么想法？

"Well, I wore the pink suit for Kiyomi's wedding and I wore the dark blue dress for Kotoko's shower…" Misato sighed and looked at her Nerv standard uniform, similar to the one Gendo, Fuyutsuki and Kaji wore, only hers in crimson red. "Maybe I should just take the Nerv Dress uniform to get it over with."
哎，我穿粉色套装出席了清美的婚礼，深蓝色裙子则是为了琴子的派对……" 美里叹息着，目光落在自己的 NERV 标准制服上，与元渡、冬月和加持的款式相同，唯独她的颜色是醒目的深红。"或许我该直接带上 NERV 的礼服制服，省得麻烦。

Ritsuko smirked. "There's that orange one, you haven't wore that one lately…why don't you put it on?"
律子狡黠地笑了笑：“那件橙色的衣服，你最近都没穿，不如穿上试试？”

"The orange one? Well there's a reason I haven't worn it..."
那件橙色的？哎，我不穿它是有原因的……

"It's too tight?" 是不是太紧了？

"Quite the opposite, actually." Misato continued checking out boxes and writing recommendations. "But the fact is that I had a small…accident with my service arm…"
实际上正好相反。" Misato 一边继续检查箱子，一边写下推荐意见。"但问题是，我的工作手臂不小心出了点小事故……

"Hole?" 洞吗？

"Yep?" 怎么了？

"In the butt?" 是在臀部吗？

"Worst." Misato sighed, unconsciously pulling her uniforms cassock to cover her crotch. "Maybe I should just buy a new one." She finished writing before she turned the pages to double-check them.
"真是糟透了。" 三乡叹息着，不自觉地拉扯着制服的法衣遮掩胯部。"也许我该考虑换件新的了。" 她写完笔记后，又翻回前面仔细核对了一遍。

"Man, all these stupid weddings are killing my bank account." Ritsuko moaned.
"哎，这些没完没了的婚礼真是让我的钱包大出血。" 理子叹息道。

"Tell me about it, we've been to so many showers I'm almost broke."
说起来，我们参加的婚礼太多了，我都快没钱了。

"Yeah!" Ritsuko continued looking at the profile of the three pilots on the HUD. "It's like everyone's in a rush to get married, before they turn thirty."
没错！" 律子目光停留在 HUD 上三位飞行员的信息上。"好像大家都在赶着三十岁前结婚一样。

Misato turned to shot a glare at Ritsuko, expecting the jive she knew should come right about-
真嗣转头向美里投去锐利的目光，期待着她预料中即将出现的玩笑

"And you don't want to be the last one still single, do you?"
你也不想成为最后那个单身的人吧？

Now.

"What are you implying Ritsu?"
律，你这话是什么意思？

Ritsuko snickered at herself before leaning forward and cracking open another canned coffee before giving it another longing look and a heart-felt sigh. "Ok…" she said, pushing the intercom button to open the comm. Line on the Evas. "You guys can take off now. Good work."
律子自嘲地笑了笑，随后倾身打开又一罐咖啡，深情地望了一眼，发出一声深沉的叹息。"好了…"她边说边按下对讲机按钮，接通了 EVA 的通讯线路。"现在可以出发了，大家辛苦了。"

"It's about time! These stupid experiments are really getting on my nerves!" Came an annoyed voice through the line. Misato and Ritsuko looked at each other before rolling their eyes.
"终于到点了！这些无聊的实验真是烦死人了！"电话里传来不耐烦的声音。碇真嗣和明日香相视一眼，随即翻了翻白眼。

"Speaking of which, Shinji seems more subdued, than usual." Ritsuko said sarcastically as she muted the comm. line of unit 01, the letters U and T no longer visible were the silent witness of how often they had to be used on the unruly kid.
"提到这事，真嗣今天显得格外沉默。" 律子带着一丝讽刺说道，随即切断了 01 机体的通讯。屏幕上原本频繁出现的 U 和 T 已被隐藏，无声地记录着为了应对这个顽劣少年，这些操作的频繁程度。

The fuming Third child looked straight ahead, a smoldering, intense look on his eyes, sending a shiver down the spine of Misato, and Ritsuko. Besides him Asuka was staring down, a downcast expression on her face while Rei was moving her head to and fro, banging it to the lively rhythm that was playing in her head.
怒火中烧的第三适格者直视前方，眼中燃烧着炽热而强烈的光芒，令美里和律子感到一阵寒意。在他旁边，明日香低头不语，神情沮丧；而零则随着脑海中欢快的旋律，左右摇晃着头。

"Hmm, yeah…" Misato hummed thoughtfully. "Tomorrow's the day."
嗯，确实…" 三佐沉思着应了一声。"明天就是关键日子了。

"Oh yeah, tomorrow." Ritsuko shuddered.
"哦，对了，是明天。" 里津子不禁打了个寒颤。

"Where is the commander, by the way?" Misato kept scribbling, the perfect picture of military efficiency.
"对了，指挥官现在在哪儿？" 三佐边写边问，一副军中干练的模样。

"Ahh the ol' yeller is probably locked in his office, drowning his grief in an 18 year old."
哎，老黄多半是把自己关在办公室里，借一瓶 18 年的陈酿来消解他的哀愁。

Misato nodded and continued scribbling.
真嗣点头后，继续匆匆地书写。

After a few seconds Ritsuko became impatient, she stared intently at Misato who continued scribbling. Ritsuko kept staring, a silent plea at her college friend. Finally Misato let out a sigh, turned to her friend frowning and took a deep breath. She took her clipboard and continued writing again.
几秒过去，律子开始显得焦躁，她目不转睛地看着仍在涂鸦的美里。律子持续注视，仿佛在向大学时的挚友无声地诉说着什么。最后，美里叹息一声，皱眉转向律子，深吸一口气后，拿起写字板继续书写。

"You're talking about some sort of whiskey, right?" She asked without looking up, the fake shock evident in her bored voice.
"你是在说某种威士忌，对吧？"她头也不抬地问道，声音中透露出明显的假惊讶和厌倦。

"Why Misato…" Ritsuko snickered, choosing to ignore that small fact and continue with her joke. "You have a very, very naughty mind…"
怎么偏偏是美里呢…"律子窃笑，故意不提这个小插曲，继续开着玩笑。"你这心思可真够坏的…

"Oh-no!" The cheesy lines from the TV were the only sound in the small apartment, and Asuka. She was clutching a cushion to herself as she saw the soap opera; it had been all in all an ok day for her, even going so far as to put what she had to eat in the school cafeteria on her diary, while writing in her personal hidden journal about the way Shinji had been looking at her all day, all thoughtful and how he had been holding her hand all throughout the walk to NERV after school. "It's you who said we should separate."
哎呀！"电视中那些老套的台词充斥着小公寓，明日香紧抱着靠垫，沉浸在肥皂剧里。这一天对她而言还算过得去，她甚至把学校食堂的餐点记入了日记，同时在她私藏的日记本里，记录了真嗣一整天如何深情地凝视她，以及放学后他如何一直牵着她的手，一同前往 NERV。"是你提出要分开的。

Asuka blinked when she heard the electronic beeping of a card entered on the lock system, and was grateful once she heard the front door slide open for the company of Misato. Shinji had gotten straight into his room, and had spent the better part of the day strumming his old, beat-up Rickenbacker.
当明日香听到门锁系统因刷卡而发出的电子哔哔声时，她眨了眨眼，随后前门为美里打开，她感到一阵安心。真嗣则径直回到自己的房间，几乎一整天都在弹奏他那把破旧的 Rickenbacker 吉他。

Asuka had been tempted to walk over and ask him what was wrong, but she remembered how edgy he had been through out the day.
明日香本想过去询问他出了什么事，但想起他一整天都显得心神不宁。

"What are you saying?" 你说什么？

Why did she feel the lines were mocking her?
她为何感到这些线条仿佛在嘲弄她？

"I'm home." Misato exclaimed as she walked towards the fridge to take out something to drink.
"我回来了。" 三乡喊着，走向冰箱，打算取些饮料。

"I don't know about you, but I'm different from what I was in those days."
我不知道你怎么想，但我已不再是过去的我了。

"Hey Misato." Asuka greeted her turning from the TV. "What's up?"
嘿，美里。" 明日香从电视那边转过身，向她打招呼，"有什么事吗？

"You'd better go to bed Asuka." Misato said a she brought in a dress still wrapped in plastic. "Don't you have a date tomorrow?" She questioned inspecting the dress as if it were her beloved NERV Dress uniform. Sighing, she wondered again why she couldn't take it to the weeding.
"明日香，你还是早点休息吧。" 美里拿着一件还包着塑料膜的裙子走进来，问道："你明天不是有约会吗？" 她仔细打量着裙子，仿佛在审视自己珍爱的 NERV 制服。叹息一声，她再次疑惑为何不能穿着它去婚礼。

"Y-yeah..." Asuka added shyly, not wanting to get drilled by Misato into the who, why and where, she knew nothing of the guy, but the prospect of being pummeled by Hikari was not something she would like.
"嗯...嗯..." 明日香有些害羞地补充说，她不想被美里追根究底地问及那个人的一切，她对那人一无所知，但想到可能会被光痛打，她可不乐意。

"Well, it was really nice of you to suggest this get to know a pilot day. Good publicity stunt, NERVS public opinion standing has gone up by 30"
你提议的这个认识飞行员日确实很棒。这真是个不错的宣传策略，NERVS 的公众支持率因此提升了 30%
Besides... 另外...

"I would have thought that Shinji would have pummeled anyone getting close to you though."
我原以为真嗣会阻止任何人靠近你。

"Wh-wha?" Asuka asked caught of guard until she saw her guardian's smirk. "Mi-Misato! It's not like that…"
啊？什么？" 明日香一时语塞，直到瞥见监护人美里那戏谑的笑容。"美里姐，不是你想的那样…

Misato frowned at the softness of Asuka's last rebuttal. She knew both pilots felt something.
美里对明日香最后那番软弱的反驳皱起了眉头。她清楚两位驾驶员都有所感触。

They just have to. She thought quietly. After all they went through in the synch training and Shinji telling Asuka that she kicks and moans and is a hugger in her sleep and Asuka accusing Shinji of almost kissing her…
他们别无选择。她暗自思忖。毕竟，经历了同步训练的种种，再加上真嗣透露明日香睡梦中会踢腿、呻吟，还爱抱人，以及明日香指责真嗣差点吻了她……这一切，都让他们不得不面对。

"Uhm, Misato. Can I borrow your lavender perfume..?"
美里，能借用一下你的薰衣草香水吗？

"Wah-?" Misato looked up from her dress and saw the blushing red head with her hands placed on her lap. She smiled, remembering the first time she had gone on a date, the anxiety, the changing of outfits over and over and…
"啊？" 碇真嗣从自己的裙子上抬起头，看到满脸绯红的明日香，双手拘谨地放在膝上。她嘴角勾起微笑，回想起自己初次约会时的忐忑不安，以及反复更换衣物的情景……

"No." She smiled. "I am only going to lend it to you when you and Shinji go out on a date." She teased the already flustered German girl.
"不。"她笑着说，"等你和真嗣约会时，我才借给你。"她逗得那位德国女孩更加脸红了。

"Mi-Misato...it's not like that..." Asuka grumbled, while Misato snickered at her expense. "Besides he would never..." She caught herself turning to Misato, her face red again, only this time out of anger, her cheeks puffed out.
"Misato...不是你想的那样..." Asuka 不满地嘟囔，Misato 则在一旁偷笑。"况且他根本不可能..." 她意识到自己转向 Misato，脸颊再次泛红，这次是因怒气而鼓起。

"Yet, I still love..." 尽管如此，我依旧深爱着……

"Hehe…gotcha…" 哈哈…上当了吧…

"Oh, meany!" She stomped her foot, which only added in making her look more like a pouting kid.
"哦，你真坏！" 她气愤地跺脚，却更显得像个赌气的小孩。

"I wouldn't let you any way...That stuff's not for kids." Missing the outraged but silent grumble of the redhead as she pouted turning back to the TV, Misato walked towards her other teammate's room.
"我绝不会让你看那种东西...那不适合小孩。" 红发女孩不满地嘟着嘴，默默地转回电视，Misato 则走向了另一位队友的房间。

"Is Shinji in his room?"
真嗣在他的房间里吗？

"Yeah, ever since he got home." Asuka replied, hugging the cushion in a reflex, pressing it against her body.
"对，自从他回家后。" 明日香说着，本能地抱紧了靠垫，紧紧地贴在身上。

"I don't think he wants to meet his father. If he hates him so much, why doesn't he just say?" She added sadly as she thought of her own dad and how overbearing he could be.
"我觉得他并不想见他的父亲。既然他这么讨厌他，为何不直说呢？" 她带着悲伤说道，同时想起了自己的父亲，以及他那令人难以忍受的专横。

Misato stopped short before going inside the other teenager's room. She was sure if he was sulking right now, otherwise he would be strumming like crazy, just like he did whenever he got had an awful day at NERV
真嗣在踏入另一位少年的房间前突然止步。她猜想，若非此刻他正闷闷不乐，那他必定会疯狂地弹起吉他，一如他在 NERV 遭遇不顺心日子时的习惯。

Like those two first months before Asuka came here. Misato added silently.
就像 Asuka 到来前的最初两个月一样。Misato 默默地补充说。

"Once...a woman cannot return to what she was. I cannot return to what I was in those days."
曾经...女人无法恢复到过去的自己。我也无法回到那些日子的我。

"Well, he doesn't actually hate him." Misato added as she remembered the way Gendo had welcomed Shinji when he had entered NERV first.
"其实，他并不真的讨厌他。" 葛城美里补充说，她记起碇真嗣初到 NERV 时，碇源堂迎接他的情景。

Her back was still aching form that bone-crunching hug. The disbelief on Asuka's eyes prompted Misato to try and explain herself better, while protecting Shinji's emotional scars.
她的背因那次紧得骨头都响的拥抱而依旧疼痛。看到明日香眼中的疑惑，美里试图更清楚地解释自己，同时小心翼翼地保护着真嗣的情感伤口。

"It's not like he hates his father…" Misato said in a low voice. "He just has…issues letting people get too close."
他并非讨厌自己的父亲……" 碇真嗣低声说道，"只是……他不太容易与人亲近。

"But I still love you."
但我依然爱你。

"Japanese boys are weird..." Asuka mumbled as she chewed around a Pocky stick.
"日本男孩真是奇怪……" 明日香含着百奇棒，喃喃自语。

"I hear you." Misato answered back thinking of her own boy in question.
"我听到了。" 三佐回应着，脑海中浮现出那个男孩的身影。

"I told you, it's impossible."
我早就说过，这行不通。

Whatever had happened inside Shinji's room had been like a quiet storm. Misato had exited with a thoughtful look on her face, almost like she was in the verge of realizing…something…
真嗣房间里发生的一切，宛如一场无声的风暴。美里带着沉思的神情走出，仿佛即将领悟到……某个重要的东西……

Asuka realized that Misato was over thinking and felt guilty about it for some odd reason; then again that was the usual frame of mind she had been ever since she met Shinji, somehow it always seemed like if anything wrong happened it was her fault.
明日香察觉到美里在过度思虑，并为此感到莫名的内疚；不过，自从她遇到真嗣后，这种心态便成了常态，仿佛任何差错发生，责任总归咎于她。

So Asuka decided to diffuse the situation by making girl talk with Misato.
于是，明日香决定通过和美里聊些女生话题来缓和气氛。

"Hey, you bought a new dress didn't you? Let me see!" she exclaimed with as much giddiness as she could muster. Instantly Misato rewarded the redhead with a soft smile and happy eyes.
"嘿，你买了新裙子吧？快让我瞧瞧！"她兴奋地喊着，尽力表现出自己的激动。Misato 随即以温柔的微笑和充满喜悦的眼神回应了这位红发女孩。

"Oh, you wanna see it, huh?" the redhead simply smiled and nodded and Misato motioned for her to go to her room while she picked it up from the couch. "It's an expensive one."
哦，你想看看是吧？"红发女子微笑着点了点头，Misato 便示意她去自己房间，同时从沙发上拿起那件东西。"这可是件贵重物品。

Asuka smirked at that. "Price doesn't always reflect the design." She stuck her tongue at her guardian, to which Misato puffed her cheeks, eliciting a grin from the young redhead by her side.
明日香对此不以为然，轻蔑一笑：“价格高不代表设计就好。”她调皮地向监护人吐了吐舌头，美里则故意鼓起腮帮子，逗得旁边的红发少女忍不住笑了起来。

"Tell me about it." She muttered as she took it out of the plastic bag it was encased with. "Well, what'cha think?"
说说看。"她低声说着，从塑料袋中取出物品。"怎么样，你怎么看？

Asuka was marveled at the sheer simplicity and beauty of the dress; she had always read on those girly magazines that a simple, little black dress would make wonders, make you look older, more mature.
明日香被这件裙子的简洁与美丽深深吸引；她常在女性杂志上看到，一条简约的小黑裙能带来意想不到的效果，让你显得更加成熟稳重。

This was definitely the type of dress they must've had in mind. A simple black sleeveless dress, with a low cut neck-line; not overtly cut to be too risque, but low enough to denote and exhume an air of sophistication on it. Long, but not pooling at her feet, with a simple slit running on the right side, it truly was a beautiful dress.
这无疑就是他们心目中的那款裙子。一件简洁的黑色无袖连衣裙，领口适度低垂；既不过于暴露，又恰到好处地流露出一种高雅气息。裙摆长及地面，但不会拖沓，右侧有一道简约的开叉，确实是一件优雅的裙子。

"Did you pick this one with Kaji in mind?" Asuka asked as she turned to look at her guardian, a faint blush appearing on her face.
"你挑这个是想着加持先生吗？"明日香说着，转向她的监护人，脸上微微泛红。

"Grow up!" Misato smiled and threw a soft pillow towards Asuka's face, making the girl squeal. "That was a long time ago."
成熟点吧！" 三佐笑着，把一个软枕头抛向明日香的脸，逗得她尖叫连连。"那都是老早以前的事了。

On his room, Shinji listened wordlessly to the squeals and laughter coming form it. He would never allow them to see him, and he would deny it if they happened to walk but, but that night, Shinji went to sleep with a relaxed, peaceful smile on his face.
在房间里，真嗣静静地聆听着传来的尖叫与欢笑。他决意不让任何人发现自己的存在，即便有人偶然经过，他也会矢口否认。然而，那个夜晚，真嗣带着一抹轻松而宁静的微笑进入了梦乡。

Asuka kept wondering, not for the first time what she was doing here. Jiro looked like an o.k. type of guy; he had been waiting for her with flowers and chocolates, outside of the Meguro station. She had been flattered; so he was a bit overweight and those small, rounded glasses simply drew attention to his round face; she was glad he wasn't a slick smooth talking biker gangster as she had wondered before, only the terror of having to face off Hikari on Monday at school (as well as a few, strategically placed calls Hikari made to her phone) kept Asuka from running away.
明日香不断思索，这已非初次，她究竟为何在此。二郎看上去是个靠谱的人；他在目黑站外手持鲜花与巧克力等候她。她颇感荣幸；尽管他略显肥胖，那副小圆眼镜更凸显了他圆润的面庞；她庆幸他并非之前担心的那种油腔滑调的摩托党，只是想到周一在学校要面对的希卡里（以及希卡里巧妙安排打到她手机上的几个电话），才让明日香没有逃离。

"Y-you look lovely…" Jiro said, as a blush colored his face. Somehow it made Asuka feel more comfortable, and she bowed, smiling at the compliment.
"Y-你看起来真可爱…" 次郎说着，脸上泛起红晕。这莫名让飞鸟感到更加安心，她微笑着鞠了一躬，欣然接受了这句赞美。

"Thank you." 感谢您。

"Well, let's get going then…"
那好，我们这就开始吧…

Asuka sighed as she got home. She felt miserable, and close to tears.
明日香踏进家门，不由得叹了口气。她心情沉重，眼眶里泪水几欲夺眶而出。

That…that…Baka had abandoned her.
他…他…巴卡竟然抛弃了她。

So she hadn't spoken a lot; he should have known, Hikari should have told him that she really wasn't a people's person, not like Shinji or Rei.
她话不多，他早该察觉到，Hikari 本应告诉他，她其实并不擅长与人交往，与 Shinji 或 Rei 截然不同。

The date had been going on great despite the forced attempts at a conversation. She really felt comfortable enough to begin small bits and pieces with Jiro. But then he had suggested they go to a cosplay cafe.
尽管对话略显生硬，但约会气氛一直不错。她感到相当自在，开始与二郎聊起一些琐碎的话题。不料，他提议去一家角色扮演主题的咖啡馆。

And then he had rented an exact replica of her plug suit (which seemed a bit too tight in certain areas).
随后，他租了一件与她的完全相同的插入服（某些部位显得略微紧绷）。

And then he had requested for her to model it to him.
随后，他请求她向他展示一番。

She had, of course denied the request and when he had told her that he had paid Hikari for this date, she trembling, but valiantly told him that Hikari wasn't her pimp, and that she had agreed to go out with him on a date, not any other type or perverted compensation date.
她自然拒绝了请求。当他透露已向 Hikari 支付了约会费用时，她虽感颤栗，却勇敢地反驳说，Hikari 并非她的拉皮条者，她同意与他约会，并非出于任何其他形式的或变态的补偿。

Jiro's answer had been to overturn the table and get up.
二郎的反应是掀翻桌子，随即起身。

Fortunately for Asuka, the cafe staff had intervened and told Jiro to get out. Once they had made sure he had indeed walked away and was not looming nearby, the told Asuka to leave as well.
幸运的是，咖啡馆员工及时介入，让次郎离开。确认他已走远并未在附近逗留后，他们也让明日香离开了。

Asuka whimpered but nodded, feeling dumb for not knowing what to do, and for not bringing her cell-phone with her.
明日香哽咽着点头，因不知所措且未带手机而自感愚笨。

Luckily for her, as soon as she put a foot outside the door, a black sedan was already expecting her, the door opened as two section 2 agents waited for her to get in and drive her home.
幸运的是，她刚迈出房门，一辆黑色轿车便已等候在外，车门敞开，两名第二节特工正等着她上车，准备送她回家。

So now, as she walked into her small room, covered in red and pink pastel colors. She went directly towards her nightstand, extracting her violin from within it and placing it on her chin.
此刻，她步入那间以红粉淡彩装饰的小屋，直奔床头柜，从中取出小提琴，轻轻架在颌下。

And she began to play it.
她随即开始弹奏起来。

She played for hours, or for days…but each time, she felt the music growing bolder, louder and sadder. She sniffled through a bit, but forced herself to keep on playing, needing this as a way to expunge those feelings of unworthiness form her self.
她连续演奏了数小时，甚至数天……每次，她都感受到音乐愈发大胆、响亮且充满哀愁。她虽一度哽咽，却仍强迫自己继续，以此来驱散内心的自卑感。

Music had always had this effect on her; no matter how miserable she felt, the small violin she cradled against her hands as a new mother would a newborn always managed to drive those feelings away from her.
音乐对她始终有着神奇的影响；无论心情多么糟糕，她将小提琴紧抱在手中的姿态，宛如初为人母者怀抱新生婴儿，总能将那些负面情绪一扫而空。

She lost track of how long she was playing until the sound of two clapping hand made her turn in surprise.
她玩得入迷，直到两声拍手声让她惊讶地转过身，才意识到时间已过许久。

Who-

Asuka gasped. 明日香屏住了呼吸。

Shinji. 新治。

"That was very nice, Asuka." He said with his trademark smirk. "I didn't know you played." He said easily, walking towards the small kitchen while Asuka turned around, in part to put away the violin, in part to hide her blushing face.
"明日香，你拉得真好。" 他带着一贯的戏谑笑容说道，"我还真不知道你有这手艺。" 他悠然自得地走向厨房，而明日香则转过身，一边收拾小提琴，一边试图隐藏自己羞红的脸庞。

"I-I started when I was five." She stammered, fidgeting with the bow as she heard Shinji' rummaging inside the refrigerator. "B-but I'm still not very good. I have no talent at all."
我五岁就开始了。"她有些结巴地说，手指不自觉地摆弄着蝴蝶结，同时听着真嗣在冰箱里翻找的声音。"不过，我还是不太行，感觉自己一点天赋都没有。

The last part was meant as a small whisper; a small self-deprecating humor attempt meant only for her to hear and smile at.
最后那句话是轻声细语，带着点自嘲的幽默，只想让她听见，然后微微一笑。

"Well…" 嗯…

Instead she came face to face with a cold bottle of soft drink, along with the upside down face of Shinji looking into her eyes, taking advantage of her still sitting state. He had his smirk still in place, but somehow, with the way his face was upside down, the way his bangs were sticking into the air, he look almost childish.
相反，她面前出现的是一瓶冰凉的软饮，以及倒挂着的真嗣的脸，他正盯着她的眼睛，趁她还坐着未动。他嘴角的笑意依旧，但因为脸是倒着的，额发朝上翘起，他看起来竟有些稚气。

Childish and cute. 孩子气和可爱。

"Perseverance wins the battle." He finished with a wink, getting upright and walking towards the window, enjoying the night summer breeze. "I'm impressed."
毅力终将赢得战斗。"他眨了眨眼，站起身来，走向窗边，尽情享受夏夜的凉风。"我确实很佩服。

Asuka shrugged, a small smile playing on her lips. "I only started because my teachers told me to. But I could've quit anytime."
明日香耸耸肩，嘴角勾起一抹浅笑。"我起初只是听从老师的安排。不过，我随时都能选择放弃。"

"So, why didn't you?" 那你为什么没这么做呢？

For some reason, that question asked met with a wall of silence; Shinji had softly uttered it almost as if he didn't believe he wanted to know. Asuka was left speechless, the last thing she expected was for Shinji to ask such a question to her; normally he would have simply uttered something about silly little girls and walk away.
不知为何，真嗣提出的问题却换来了一片沉默，他几乎是带着怀疑轻声问出，好像连他自己都不确定是否真的想知晓答案。明日香愣住了，她完全没料到真嗣会向她提出这样的问题；平时他总是会随便说些关于小女生的玩笑话就转身离开。

"Huh?" Asuka eloquently tried to buy herself some time, only to see directly into Shinji's dark blue eyes.
"啊？" 明日香机智地试图拖延时间，不料却直视了真嗣那双深邃的蓝眼睛。

"N-nobody told me to stop, I guess."
没人让我停下，我猜。

Shinji blinked at that and opened his mouth as if to say something, but stopped. Instead he kept his gaze straight ahead.
真嗣对此眨了眨眼，本想开口说些什么，却欲言又止。他只是直直地望向前方。

"Oh…" He muttered before turning to look at her, the look that made him seem like a lost little boy replaced in a second with his confident air and smirk.
"哦…" 他喃喃自语，旋即转头望向她，那瞬间，他脸上迷茫如孩童的表情已被自信与狡黠的微笑所替代。

"I should have known." He said in a silky tone, before frowning. "Well, if it weren't for these stupid robots, I would be a rock idol right now." Shinji shrugged. "I would be touring with Sato and Manabe…I'd have Kenji's place." He smirked, signaling at his black t-shirt which held a white letter "P" with an exclamation mark.
"我本该预见到的。" 他用一种柔和的语调说道，随即皱起了眉。"若非这些笨拙的机器人，我此刻已是摇滚巨星。" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"我会与佐藤和真锅一同巡演……占据健二的位置。" 他得意地笑了笑，指向自己黑色 T 恤上印着的白色字母"P"，旁边还有一个感叹号。

"I'd be a Little Buster right about now."
此刻我正扮演着小小执行者的角色。

Asuka was aware that Shinji had no talent whatsoever to save his life, but somehow knew he simply meant it to break the icy silence that was setting in the room. As long as he don't ask about my da-
明日香清楚真嗣根本不具备自救的能力，但她隐约感觉到，他只是想打破房间中愈发沉重的静默。只要他不提及我的父亲——

"Hey, you're back early." He said finally as he caught wind of the time. "I thought you were going out to dinner, too."
嘿，你这么早就回来了。"他注意到时间后终于开口，"我还以为你也会去吃晚饭呢。

Crap!

"Oh! M-my date wasn't even that interesting." Asuka closed the violin case and began to make a hasty retreat towards her room. "Uhm…I-I guess you would say that he was even more boring than me..."
哎呀！其实我的约会也没什么意思。" 明日香合上小提琴盒，匆匆向自己的房间撤退。"嗯……我觉得你可能会说他比我还要无趣……

Before she could even walk away she felt it again, a gentle soft pressure, something encircling her wrist. She turned down and saw Shinji's calloused hand over hers, his thumb and index finger locked around like a manacle.
她还没来得及抽身，就再次感受到那股轻柔的压迫，有什么东西缠绕在她的手腕上。她低头一看，只见真嗣那双粗糙的手正覆盖在她的手上，拇指和食指紧紧相扣，宛如一副手铐。

"What happened?" 怎么了？

He was looking directly at her.
他直勾勾地看着她。

"Wh-why would you think something happened?" Asuka asked looking away, trying to get loose. "Shinji c'mon let me go."
你怎么会认为发生了什么事呢？" 明日香一边问，一边扭头试图挣脱，"真嗣，快放开我。

"Not until you tell me what happened." Shinji smirked. When he saw Asuka still wasn't looking at him, he decided to change tactics. "Look; you have two choices, either you tell me, or I get the Section 2 reports from my old man. Either way I will know before the end of the day."
你得先告诉我发生了什么。" 碇真嗣带着一丝冷笑。见明日香依旧不与他对视，他便转换了策略。"听着，你只有两个选择：要么你亲自告诉我，要么我就去向我爸要第二课的报告。无论如何，我今天之内都会弄清楚。

Shinji stood tall, and as Asuka let her arm fall to her side, he crossed his arms in a sure sign of victory.
真嗣挺直站立，在明日香垂下手臂之际，他交叉双臂，显露出胜利的姿态。

"And why would you want to know…" She asked in a small voice. "Do you want to have more ammo to bully me? To make me feel bad?"
那你为什么想知道呢…"她轻声问道，"是想多找些理由来欺负我吗？让我更加难受吗？

Shinji was taken aback when she looked up and he saw tears slowly streaming down her cheeks. He gulped and felt more of a bastard in that moment; he also felt something… something alien in him; something that seemed out of place within himself, like a warm fuzzy pink blanket in a room full of death rock paraphernalia.
她抬头时，泪水悄然滑落，真嗣一时愣住。他吞咽了一下，那一刻深感自己是个混蛋；同时，内心也涌现出一种异样的感觉，仿佛自己体内有某种不协调的存在，如同在满是死亡摇滚装饰的房间中，突兀地铺上了一条温暖柔软的粉色毛毯。

Why did he want to grab that blanket and place it around Asuka's slim frame?
他为何想要抓住那条毯子，轻轻围在明日香苗条的身体周围？

"To make a long and boring story short and less boring, the guy was an idiot, he left me while I was standing in line for the roller coaster."
简而言之，那人真是个蠢货，我在排队等过山车时，他竟然离我而去。

Shinji simply looked at her…that seemed plausible, but his instincts were telling him otherwise.
真嗣默默地注视着她，表面上看似合理，然而他的直觉却在暗示着另一种真相。

"And how did you get here then?"
那你又是怎么来到这里的呢？

"I took a train back here."
我乘火车回到了这里。

Something inside Shinji relaxed as Asuka began to calm down. He finally shrugged and turned around. "That seems kinda cold." He said flatly. "The guy must have been an idiot."
随着明日香情绪的平复，真嗣感到内心也放松了。他最终耸了耸肩，转过身来，语气平淡地说：“这样似乎有点无情。那人肯定是个傻瓜。”

Asuka smiled shyly at that. "Y-you think?"
明日香羞涩地笑了笑，"你真这么觉得？"

"Of course." Shinji smiled roguishly. "A wimp like you? I would have taken you to the scary rides so you would have squealed and hugged on to me."
那还用说。" 真嗣狡猾地一笑。"像你这种胆小鬼？我肯定会带你去玩那些吓人的项目，让你尖叫连连，不得不紧紧抱住我。

Asuka turned to look at him as Shinji threw her a quick glance over his shoulder, a mischievous expression on his eyes.
明日香转过身来，正好迎上真嗣回头的一瞥，他的眼神里闪烁着调皮的光芒。

"That or to the love tunnel to make out." He winked.
"要么去爱情隧道亲热一下。"他眨眼示意。

He was rewarded with the usual routine
他照例得到了奖赏

A blush. 羞红了脸。

An 'Eeep' 一声“哎呀”

A door slamming shut. 门砰的一声关上了。

Hey Asuka? It's me. I'm gonna' be out drinking with Kaji. Don't wait up for me, Ok.
嘿，明日香，是我。我打算和卡吉出去喝一杯。不用等我，知道了吗。

The message had been quick and concise, just like all of Misato's were. Asuka had no more chance than to stammer out a short "Right, yeah, sure." Before the dial tone was the next thing she heard.
消息一如既往地简明扼要，来自美里的风格。明日香来不及多说，只得仓促应答：“好的，嗯，当然。”随即，耳边响起的是电话挂断的嘟嘟声。

Great, and she was hungry too.
太好了，她正好也饿了。

"Hey, was that Misato?" 嘿，那是美里吗？

Asuka turned to Shinji, a take out menu already in her hands. "Yeah she said she'll be late, so don't wait up for her."
明日香转向真嗣，手中已握着外卖菜单。“她说了会迟些，不用等她。”

"Heh! So…You mean she won't be back until tomorrow morning?"
嘿！这么说…她的意思是明天早上才能回来？

"I doubt it, she's going out with Kaji."
我对此表示怀疑，她正和加治交往。

"So that means we have the apartment all to ourselves, then?"
那就是说，这公寓完全归我们使用了，对吧？

"Yeah…I was thinking on ordering some take out…what do you wan…" The words died in her mouth as she looked up and saw Shinji decked only in a wife beater and boxer shorts. Shinji looked at her with a curious look before a predatory smile flashed across his face.
"嗯…我正考虑点外卖呢…你想吃什么…" 她的话突然停住，抬头一看，发现真嗣只穿着一件背心和短裤。真嗣好奇地打量着她，脸上随即闪过一抹狡猾的微笑。

"So that means I have you all to myself, huh?" Shinji let out a low growl. Asuka simply nodded still with a blush in her face.
"这么说，你是完全属于我了，对吗？" 碇真嗣低声咆哮道。明日香脸上带着红晕，只是轻轻地点了点头。

"Asuka…" Shinji continued, advancing slowly towards Asuka who simply stood there, almost rooted to where she was standing. As soon as Shinji came mere inches from her, she began to take a step back for everyone he took forward, until her back was pressed against the wall.
"明日香……" 新二边说边慢慢靠近，而明日香只是站在原地，仿佛被定住了一般。每当新二向前迈进一步，她便后退一步，直到背部抵住了墙壁。

"I want you…" He whispered in the small space between shivered lightly and closed her eyes, her face, her whole body red and warm and-
"我好想你…"他在这狭小的空间里轻声低语，她不禁微微颤抖，闭上双眼，脸颊和全身都泛着红晕，暖意融融

Shinji pulled back. 真嗣往后退了。

"To order for me…just nothing too spicy." He smirked at her, walking towards the couch and turning the TV on.
"帮我点餐的话…不要太辣哦。" 他向她眨了眨眼，走向沙发并打开了电视。

Asuka blinked. It took her a moment or two before she finally registered this and threw a cushion at an already laughing Shinji.
明日香眨了眨眼，愣了一两秒才回过神来，然后朝已经笑得前仰后合的碇真嗣扔去一个靠垫。

The plates had been cleaned and Shinji was back to watching TV, while Asuka was sitting by the table, her face leaning against its surface, her right fingers gently tapping against it. The last hours had been spent in tense silence, eating in silence, stealing glances in silence.
盘子已经清洗完毕，真嗣继续看电视，明日香则坐在桌边，脸颊贴着桌面，右手手指轻轻敲击着。之前的几个小时，两人在紧张的沉默中度过，默默地吃饭，偷偷地互望。

"Hey, Asuka. You wanna kiss me?"
嘿，明日香，想亲我一下吗？

Asuka looked up, unsure if she had heard correctly or not.
明日香抬起头，心中疑惑自己是否听得真切。

"Eh? What?" 啊？你说什么？

"Kissing." Shinji added, powering the TV set off and turning to look straight at the red head, the lower half of his body hidden by the couch, his arms crossed on top of the couches, looking like a perverted jack in the box.
"亲吻。" 碇真嗣说着，关掉电视，转过身来直视那位红发少女，下半身隐匿在沙发后，双臂搭在沙发背上，活像个不怀好意的弹簧小丑。

"You know; the thing you do when you finish dates." He smirked, a playful, dangerous smirk, like a small kitten toying around with a bird of a mouse; not really hunting them, just being playful and not caring if the mouse or bird were trembling and scared.
"你懂的，就是约会结束后常有的那种举动。"他嘴角勾起一抹既顽皮又略带威胁的笑，宛如一只小猫在逗弄鸟儿或老鼠；并非真要捕食，只是出于玩心，全然不顾那小动物的颤栗与恐惧。

"Have you ever kissed someone?"
你有没有吻过别人？

Asuka blushed, remembering when she woke up after the synch training, and staring into Shinji's peaceful, sleeping face. How his semi-parted lips seemed so warm and inviting and-
明日香脸颊泛红，忆起同步训练后苏醒之际，目睹真嗣安详的睡容。他那半启的双唇，显得异常温暖且诱人，让人不禁心生遐想。

"Hey…Aka…I'm talking to you…"
嘿，阿卡，我在跟你说话呢…

Asuka looked away and blushed, wondering if she was as transparent as she felt. Sure, Shinji could be a bit of a dense idiot, charging objects deemed by him as obstacles head first.
明日香别过脸，双颊微红，暗自思忖自己是否真如所感那般容易被看穿。诚然，真嗣这人有时挺木讷的，总是莽撞地直面他眼中的障碍。

But underneath it all, she somehow felt that sometimes, most of the times Shinji, like her, wore a heavy cloak and a mask over his face; something to cover his whole inner self, to keep everyone at bay.
然而，在这一切表象之下，她隐约察觉到，真嗣很多时候也像她一样，身披厚重的斗篷，面戴面具；似乎要用这些来遮掩自己的内心深处，将所有人隔绝在外。

He sometimes looked like the shell of what was left of an angry young man; angry at himself, angry at the world.
他偶尔会显得像是愤怒青年的遗留外壳；既对自己愤懑，也对世界不满。

And other times, he had the playful qualities of an overgrown kitten, one who loved playing with things between his furry paws.
其他时候，他就像一只大猫，顽皮可爱，喜欢用毛茸茸的爪子拨弄东西。

"Hey." He said, now sitting in front of her, his hand propping his head up, a lazy smile on his face. "I'm talking to ya…have you ever kissed someone?"
嘿。" 他坐在她对面，手托着下巴，脸上带着一丝懒洋洋的笑意。"我在跟你说话呢…你有没有亲吻过别人？

"N-"

Shinji smiled. 真嗣露出了微笑。

"I knew it." He got up, walked past the mere inches separating them, and looked down at her, a playful smirk like a crooked smile in his face. Asuka inched lower down her chair; only her eyes and the top of her head were visible.
"我就知道。"他起身，跨过彼此间短短的距离，俯视着她，脸上带着一丝狡黠的笑意。明日香不由自主地往椅子里缩了缩，只露出眼睛和头顶。

"So..?" Shinji said in a low husky tone. "Let's do it."
那么...？" 渚薰低声沙哑地说，"开始吧。

"Wh-" Asuka blushed. "B-but why?"
Wh-" 阿苏卡脸颊泛红。"B-但这是为什么呢？

"Hah!" Shinji laughed, as if he head witnessed a small private joke. "I knew you were too afraid to do something about it."
哈哈！" 新二笑了起来，好像他刚刚看穿了一个私下的玩笑。"我就知道你没那个胆量去解决这事。

"Huh?" 嗯？

"Besides, you would be so lucky as to kiss the best catch at school." Shinji smirked at her again, but now, it was his infuriating smirk, the one he used whenever he was picking on her. "You should've said yes, Aka."
而且，你能亲到学校里最受欢迎的那位，真是走运极了。" 渚薰再次向她露出那种坏笑，这次是他那让人气恼的笑，每当他戏弄她时，总是这样。"赤，你当时真该答应的。

The one he used when he was making fun of her.
他嘲笑她时所用的那个。

"You would have been able to boast to your friends, if you had any, about kissing me." Shinji punctuated the last part by pointing at himself with his thumb. "While I would've had to lower my standards."
要是你有朋友，本可以向他们炫耀亲吻过我。" 碇真嗣用拇指指向自己，以此强调。"而我，则不得不降低自己的标准。

The one he used when he was nagging on her.
他喋喋不休地数落她时用的那一套。

"Oh well…" Shinji said as he took a half turn and went back towards the TV set. "You snooze, you lose."
唉，算了…" 真嗣说着，半转身朝电视机走去。"一不留神，机会就没了。

Something in Asuka snapped. She did not jump, she did not cry, she simply did something that had always been out of character for her.
飞鸟心中某根弦突然断了。她既没有跳，也没有哭，只是做出了一个完全不符合她个性的举动。

She talked back. 她反驳了。

"I think you're the one who is afraid."
我觉得你才是那个感到害怕的人。

Shinji stopped and turned around slowly, a different smirk on his lips.
真嗣停下脚步，慢慢转过身，嘴角露出一丝别样的笑意。

She stood up. 她起身了。

"Yeah." Asuka said, her mind working at top speed, relaying and replaying information making her move forward, not losing any momentum. "That's it."
对。" 明日香说，她的思维高速运转，不断接收和重播信息，推动她持续前进，毫不减缓。"正是如此。

Now she was standing up, and walking up to him; She was closing the gap, She was invading his personal space.
此刻她已起身，正朝他走来；她正步步逼近，侵入了他的私人领域。

"Are you scared?" she said softly, looking up to his calm, stormy blue eyes; her own eyes blazing with pent up frustration. "Afraid to kiss a girl?"
你害怕了吗？"她柔声问道，仰望着他那平静如风暴前夕的蓝眸；她自己的眼中则燃烧着未发的怒火。"难道连吻一个女孩都害怕吗？

Ball's on your court, Ikari.
轮到你了，伊卡里。

"Not really." Shinji smirked. "I'd do it if you do it."
开个玩笑。" 碇真嗣嘴角勾起一抹笑意，"你先做，我就跟着做。

Balls on my court. 我的球场上有球。

"No." Asuka stated firmly. And Shinji's smile, for the first time in the whole tête-à-tête faltered and left his lips.
"不。" 明日香坚定地回答。真嗣的笑容，在这场对话中首次显得有些勉强，最终从他的脸上消失了。

"I'd do it because You'd want to." And with that final piece, Asuka closed the final inches, her nose just mere inches from Shinji's nose.
"我之所以这么做，是因为你希望如此。"说完这最后一句，明日香凑近了最后的几英寸，她的鼻尖几乎触到了真嗣的鼻尖。

"Why would you do it?"
你为什么要这么做呢？

There it was, the quiet urgency on her voice, the ultimate challenge made to him. Take control for once, take control and accept that you like me like I like you, don't blame it on a training like you did during the synch.
她声音中透露出的静默紧迫，是对他的终极挑战。这一次，掌控局面，坦然接受你对我的喜欢，正如我对你一样，别再像同步训练时那样，将责任推给训练了。

Don't blame it on orders like when you saved me at the volcano.
别像当初在火山救我那样，把责任归咎于命令。

Don't blame you staying with me, living with me, on us being pilot, or being convenient.
别因为你是飞行员，或图方便，就怪罪你与我相伴，与我共度时光。

I want you to be with me because of me.
我想要你因为我本身而陪伴我。

Shinji shrugged, the smile never leaving the place between his lips.
真嗣耸耸肩，微笑一直挂在他的嘴角。

"I've got nothing else to do."
我闲着没事干。

Asuka felt like someone had punched her in the stomach, taking the air from her.
明日香感到仿佛被人猛击腹部，一时间喘不过气来。

"That's your reason?" Asuka squeaked. She was a closet romantic, and being so close to a boy who was attractive, even if he did sometimes go out of his way to bully her, made her as nervous as…well…a schoolgirl.
"这就是你的理由？" 明日香尖声问道。她内心其实很浪漫，与一个虽然偶尔故意欺负她但长相帅气的男孩如此接近，让她紧张得像个情窦初开的女学生。

"N-no way!" She managed to say and muster as much confidence as she could, crossing her arms at her chest, turning her face away.
"不，绝对不行！" 她竭力装出自信的样子，双臂抱在胸前，将脸扭向一边。

"You're weird..." She sniffed affectedly. Shinji smirked and turned to leave, but befoore he could, Asuka said one last thing.
"你这人真怪..." 她故作姿态地哼了一声。真嗣嘴角勾起一抹笑意，正要转身离开，却被明日香最后的话拦住了。

"And you are afraid." 你感到害怕。

He turned to her. "I'm not afraid!" He said forcefully, yet, somehow, it felt like he was telling himself he wasn't; like he was making his brain and will come in synch with his thoughts and his voiced opinions.
他转向她，语气坚定："我不害怕！"然而，这话语似乎更多是在说服自己，仿佛在努力让内心与所言一致。

"Pucker up!" He said, and was once again close to her.
"来，撅起嘴！"他边说边再次贴近了她。

"R-right." Asuka stammered, looking at his eyes, and then at his lips, licking her own instinctively. "Did you brush your teeth?"
右...右。" 明日香有些结巴，目光从他的眼睛移到嘴唇，不由自主地舔了舔自己的唇。"你刷牙了吗？

"Yeah." Shinji answered in a whisper, and Asuka noticed Shinji was close. So close.
"嗯。" 碇真嗣轻声回应，明日香察觉到碇真嗣就在身边，近在咫尺。

Really close. 非常近。

"Then, here I come." Asuka whispered back, inching towards him, stopping just a breath away from his slightly parted lips, alternatively looking at his eyes and his lips.
"接着，我来了。" 明日香低声回应，慢慢向他靠近，几乎能感受到他微张的唇间气息，目光在他眼眸与唇间游移。

Just like him. 正如他那样。

"S-stop breathing." She let out in a hush. "You're tickling me."
别呼吸了。" 她轻声说，"你弄得我痒痒的。

And then, quick as a snake biting it's prey; her hand snaked upwards, her finger deftly pinching his nose shut, while her lips closed the final frontier, smashing into his with a force, a feeling of hunger, of want, of need.
紧接着，她的动作快如蛇捕食，手迅速上扬，灵巧的手指紧紧捏住他的鼻子，与此同时，她的嘴唇猛烈地贴上他的，充满了渴望、欲望和迫切的需求。

It was a desperate kiss, born out of their mutual feelings of loneliness, or wanting, needing to have a connection with those around them, but being so lonely, so scared to effectively look for it.
这个吻充满了绝望，是他们共同孤独感的产物，既渴望又需要与他人建立联系，却又因孤独和恐惧而难以主动寻求。

Asuka felt it like a kiss out of the agony of a soul, and the anguish born out of it; of anxiety, and concern; of dejection, depression, desolation, and despair.
明日香感受到的，仿佛是灵魂在苦痛中献上的吻，以及由此滋生的种种痛楚：焦虑、忧心；以及随之而来的沮丧、抑郁、孤寂与绝望。

Shinji felt this kiss out of distraction, but that held inside such a powerful distress, such a deep fear, an overwhelming gloom, and a powerful grief.
真嗣心不在焉地接受了这一吻，然而这吻中却藏着深重的痛苦、深切的恐惧、难以言喻的阴郁和强烈的悲伤。

Asuka 's kiss was out of heartache; of hopelessness. Out of a sad melancholy and just plain misery.
明日香的吻，是心痛与绝望的产物，蕴含着深深的忧郁和无尽的苦楚。

Shinji's kiss was out of pain, like pangs of sorrow, a soft, bearable torture, sometimes evoking unhappiness, but other times, times such as this of something more-
真嗣的吻，是痛苦的产物，宛如悲伤的阵痛，既柔软又可承受，有时带来不悦，然而在某些时刻，比如此刻，它承载着更深层的意义——

Shinji broke off, taking deep gulps of breaths, his heart was racing, his lungs were threatening to explode, he was close to passing out due to shortness of breath and asphyxiation.
真嗣突然顿住，深吸几口气，心跳急促，肺部似要爆裂，因呼吸困难和窒息感几乎要晕过去。

And it was all due to that mind numbing, soul wrenching kiss he had just been dealt.
这一切都源于他刚刚承受的那个令人心神俱疲、灵魂受创的吻。

Asuka was running, hiding her tears, closing herself in the bathroom, opening the faucets and gurgling loudly for him to hear.
明日香边跑边掩饰泪水，躲进浴室，拧开水龙头，故意大声漱口，好让他听见。

"I should never kiss to kill time!" Shinji muttered loudly, trying to hide the sting in his heart.
"我绝不该为了打发时间而亲吻！" 真嗣大声自语，极力隐藏内心的痛楚。

And now, here they were, in front of each other; Kaji had already left, saying good night and bashfully attempting to stop Misato form glomping onto him again. Misato was tucked nicely inside her bed they had been avoiding each other for the past hours, the tense silence broken by the cheerful voice of Kaji as he dragged a happily drunken Misato into the apartment.
此刻，他们正面对面站着；卡吉已先行告辞，临走时还略带羞涩地试图阻止美里再次热情拥抱他。美里已安然躺在床上，过去数小时两人都在刻意回避对方，直到卡吉那欢快的声音划破紧张的寂静，他带着醉意盎然的美里回到了公寓。

But now, they were here, and there were no walls behind they could hide.
如今，他们身处此境，背后已无墙壁可依。

"What's wrong?" Shinji smirked when he saw Asuka was sheepishly standing behind him, his familiar smirk back in place. "You look upset. "
怎么了？" 真嗣看到明日香羞涩地站在自己身后，嘴角勾起了熟悉的坏笑。"你看起来不太高兴啊。

"That's because you kissed me!" Asuka shouted at him, anger and hurt present in her eyes, she turned, retreating into her room, a part of her hating him for giving her false hopes, and a part of her loving him for the kiss they had shared moments ago.
"那是因为你吻了我！" 明日香怒视着他，眼中闪烁着怒火与伤痛，随即转身躲进自己的房间。她心中既有一部分因他给予的虚假希望而憎恨他，又有一部分因刚才那深情一吻而对他心生爱意。

"You jerk!" 你真是个混蛋！

So she never saw Shinji's thoughtful, frown, nor how he looked at her, a look of longing, of wanting.
所以，她从未留意到真嗣那深思的皱眉，更未曾察觉他凝视她的目光中，满是渴望与向往。

Of need. 出于必要。

Silently, he saw her closing the door, not forcefully; just a simple shove, a quiet click, and the latch mentioning the finality of it all.
他默默地注视着她轻柔地关上门，没有用力；只是轻轻一推，伴随着一声微弱的咔哒声，门闩仿佛在宣告一切的终结。

So why did it felt like something more heavy; like an iron door, a steel curtain being drawn across them both.
那么，为何感觉如此沉重，仿佛一扇铁门，一道钢幕在他们之间缓缓落下。

Frowning, Shinji shook his head, muttering something about angry redheaded babies and went to sleep.
真嗣皱着眉，摇头低语着关于一个愤怒的红发婴儿的事，随后便去睡了。

But before getting into bed, he washed his teeth and sucked them in.
上床前，他刷完牙后还吸了吸牙。

They tasted like mint. 它们的味道类似薄荷。

And like strawberry lipgloss.
还喜欢草莓味的唇彩。

It would be several days after when Shinji Ikari would be absorbed by Leliel and by some strange twist of faith, the Shinji Ikari from this reality would be transported the a different reality, where a far more tamer Shinji, a far more introverted Rei, a far more competitive Asuka and a far more laid back Misato resided.
数日后，碇真嗣将被雷里尔吞噬，因命运的奇异安排，这个世界的碇真嗣将被送往另一现实，那里有更为平和的真嗣、更为内敛的绫波、更为争强好胜的明日香以及更为随性的美里。

But that's a different story…
不过，那又是另一回事了……

AN.

So there you have it, once again the idea is based on Magnum's idea, and was preread and approved by him. Sadly, the draft I sent to Hideaki Anno never got returned, but I did receive a phone call from some practical joker who in broken engrish told me he was a "lawyer by Gainax" and that the "story was good yet not real" and that I should "Cease, desist or stop" from doing this.
所以，情况就是这样，再次基于 Magnum 的构思，并已由他预先审阅并批准。可惜，我发给庵野秀明的草案石沉大海，不过我接到了一个恶作剧电话，对方操着蹩脚的英语，自称是“Gainax 的律师”，告诉我“故事虽好但并非真实”，并要求我“停止、放弃或不再继续”此事。

Fresh…I know it was you, so stop playing prank calls man.
我知道是你，别再打恶作剧电话了，兄弟。

### Chapter 09 Themes: K#02 (News, Letter), W#13 (Flight)
主题：K#02（新闻，信函），W#13（航班）

Title: Equivalent Exchange.
标题：等价交换。

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like. I'll update with another one shot if I'm still blocked, if not, expect the other chapter of 10 things briefly.
A.N.: 我在此处为自己辩解：并非我所愿。我正努力克服写作瓶颈，因此决定同时挑战两个任务：将 30 个吻和 30 种情境融入一篇故事。期待你的喜爱。若瓶颈依旧，我将再发一篇短文，否则，敬请期待《10 件事》的下一章节。

Pre-required read: Ryoma's "Best Laid Plans 2", just for those "This is waaaay too OOC" gripes.
必读前置内容：龙马的《最佳计划 2》，特别为那些觉得“这太偏离角色性格了”的读者准备。

Full disclaimer is at the end.
详细免责声明位于文末。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. (Alchemy's First Law of Equivalent Exchange)
人若想得到什么，必先付出同等代价。（炼金术第一法则：等价交换）

"If there was ever a time when both of you where the happiest… it pales in comparison to right here, right now."
如果你们曾有过最幸福的时光，那与现在相比也显得微不足道。

Everyone cheered. The room filling with the sounds of clapping, chanting and general signs of merriment, affection and appreciation were showed, making the newly weds blush profusely, one of them choking back a few tears even while her face showed the pride of being here today, after all of what had happened.
大家齐声欢呼。房间内掌声、欢呼声和欢乐的氛围交织，人们纷纷表达喜爱与赞赏，令新婚夫妇面颊绯红，其中一位新娘更是哽咽着，眼中含泪，脸上却满是今日能在此的骄傲。

Her best friend smiled and decided to make this moment last for as long as possible, before she clicked on her glass, the clear sharp tingling noise emanating form within attracting the eyes of everyone in the room, making the conversations slowly stop, then fade into the background before finally silence engulfed the room.
她最亲密的朋友面带微笑，决心让这一刻尽可能持久。她轻触玻璃杯，那清脆而尖锐的响声从杯中传出，吸引了室内所有人的注意，谈话声逐渐减弱，直至整个空间被静谧所包围。

"I remember when I first met you…" she said, pointing to her best friend throughout school, maybe even in the entire world, a smile gracing both of their lips. "You were a handful, a condensed ball of energy; always upbeat and bouncing, striving for the attention of everyone."
我记得第一次遇见你…"她微笑着指向她从学校到全世界最好的朋友。"你那时真是活力四射，像个浓缩的能量球，总是那么兴奋，蹦蹦跳跳，总想吸引所有人的目光。

She paused, wet her lips and looked at the groom.
她顿了顿，润了润嘴唇，目光投向新郎。

"You were the outsider…" she smiled solemnly at the groom, noticing the smile of them both, how they complemented each other, how there was nothing that could make this day go wrong. "When you first came, I didn't trust you, and only tolerated you because it was expected from me…"
你曾是局外人……"她庄重地对新郎微笑，注意到他们相视而笑，彼此间如此和谐，仿佛这天注定完美无瑕。"你初来乍到时，我对你心存疑虑，只是碍于情面才勉强接纳你……

When the chuckles subsided, she smirked again.
笑声渐渐停歇，她又得意地笑了笑。

"You've come a long way…"
你已经走了很远的路…

She continued in the tradition of using the time to make a speech to roast the newlywed couple, recounting countless anecdotes, some funny, some that made the bride, or sometimes the groom, and other times both, blush profusely but that made all of the crowd, their close friends, as well as those new and old, smile and laugh.
她延续了传统，在这个时刻发表演讲，调侃新婚夫妇，讲述了许多趣事，有的令人捧腹，有的则让新娘或新郎，有时两人都面红耳赤，但这些轶事却让在场的所有宾客，无论是老朋友还是新面孔，都笑逐颜开。

But as with everything, it too, came to an end.
然而，和所有事物一样，它终究也走到了尽头。

"So now…all I have to say is congratulations to the both of you…" and there was moisture in her eyes from taking a stroll down memory lane with the two people she had come to treat more like an annoying younger sister and an overly affectionate older brother than as mere school friends.
"此刻，我只想对你们俩说声恭喜…"她眼中泛起泪光，与这两位她已视如烦人的妹妹和过分亲昵的哥哥一同漫步在回忆的小径上，超越了普通学校朋友的情感。

"May your marriage be long and prosperous, may you find the happiness you have been looking for, and may you do all that you hoped to do while holding each other's hand like you do today…"
愿你们的婚姻美满长久，幸福常伴，愿你们携手共度，实现心中所愿，如同今日这般紧紧相依……

She was crying now, openly, honestly…something few had ever seen her do, she hugged her best friend, easing back her long hair done artfully into a high ponytail, simple, yet it helped to frame her beautiful face; the wedding veil making her look more like a princess bride.
此刻，她毫不掩饰地哭泣着，这情景鲜少有人目睹。她紧紧拥抱着挚友，轻柔地整理着高高束起的马尾，虽简约却巧妙地勾勒出她姣好的面容；婚礼的面纱更添了几分公主般的婚礼气息。

"Misato…Ryoji…" he had shaved clean of that stubble and had somehow managed to get through his own wedding without loosening his tie, nor unbuttoning his collar. Ritsuko eyed them both and smiled through her own tears.
"Misato…Ryoji…" 他剃掉了胡茬，神奇地在自己的婚礼上保持了领带和衣领的整齐，未曾松懈。律子望着他们，眼中含泪却带着微笑。

"Congratulations." 恭喜！

"Check." 确认一下。

Gendo frowned. 源渡眉头紧锁。

He really wasn't expecting the move that his opponent had managed to sneak past him. He was supposed to be a master tactician; an expert at setting people up and taking advantages from them, not the other way around.
他万万没想到对手竟能悄然绕过他的防线。作为公认的战术高手，他本该精于布局，从中占尽优势，而非被对手反制。

He frowned again, looking at the board another time, and wondering how it had gotten past him…even with all the current "preparations" and other miscellaneous projects going on, he should have seen it coming. Was he so preoccupied by all the other matters that he had blindsided himself?
他再次皱起眉头，又审视了一遍棋盘，心中疑惑为何自己竟未察觉……尽管眼下有诸多“准备”和其他杂事缠身，他本应预见到这一步。难道是其他事务让他分心至此，以至于自己蒙蔽了自己？

"It's your turn now, Commander."
该你了，指挥官。

He heard in the same mocking tone, but Gendo simply chose not to answer, to not committing anything, biting out sounds and instead grunting and humming. He was about to begin a retaliatory attack to cover his king when he noticed something odd.
他听到那嘲讽的语气依旧，但源渡决定不予理会，避免做出任何承诺，只是含糊其辞，转而发出哼哼声。就在他准备发起反击以保护国王之际，他察觉到了一些异样。

"What is the matter Commander? Am I finally getting the best out of you?"
指挥官，出什么事了？我是否终于激发出你的最佳表现了？

He was the one being baited. He was the one being set up.
他正是那个被诱饵引诱的人，也是被设局陷害的对象。

"Or maybe you prefer Go instead of chess?"
或许你更倾向于围棋，而非象棋？

Gendo said nothing, but began to reassess all of his past moves and the outside influence on the ones he had deemed critical, noticing every time he had tried to make a move to set up a 5 step attack, the same mocking tone would be heard, trying to get him to make an error.
源渡沉默不语，重新审视自己过往的每一步棋，以及外界对那些关键决策的影响。他发现，每当试图布局五步攻击时，总有一股嘲讽的语气出现，似乎在引诱他犯错。

The worst part was that the voice, the scatting comments and biting remarks were doing a good job at that. He had made 3 major mistakes so far, now his knight, bishop and rook had been taken out of the game.
最糟糕的是，那些即兴的评论和尖刻的言辞在这方面表现得相当出色。他已犯下三个重大失误，导致他的骑士、主教和车相继被淘汰出局。

So Gendo sat in silence, his fingers intertwined at the height of the bridge of his nose, looking at the board, checking his options and thinking all of his options through.
源堂静坐沉思，手指交叠于鼻梁前，目光紧锁棋盘，仔细考量每一步棋，深思熟虑每一种可能。

If he had been bested by thinking 5 steps ahead, he would now start thinking 10.
若他之前因预见五步而失利，此刻他定会开始预见十步。

It was beautiful. 它非常美丽。

It was simply the most beautiful thing in the world right now for her.
对她而言，这无疑是当下世界上最美的存在。

The golden band glistened in the light, and the diamond had a way of catching the light that simply took her breath away.
金带在光线下熠熠生辉，钻石捕捉光线的独特方式，令她惊叹不已。

Hikari Horaki simply stood mesmerized as she saw the ring on her finger, still trying to register all of what Toji had told her.
堀木光呆立着，目光被手指上的戒指牢牢吸引，脑海中还在努力消化东二所说的一切。

"So you mean to tell me that the time of the restaurant y-"
那么，你是说餐厅的营业时间吗？

"Yeah…" the tall brash boy answered in an uncharacteristic whisper, a red tinge on his cheeks.
"嗯…"高个子男孩一反常态地轻声应道，脸上微微泛红。

"And …the thing about the chicken bon-"
还有…关于鸡腿的事-

"Sorry 'bout that…" Touji said again, his teeth gnawing together as the image and the stupid excuse came back to his mind.
"抱歉，那事儿…" 图吉再次开口，牙齿紧咬，那幅画面和拙劣的借口再次涌上心头。

"And the whole-" 整个都-

"Don't ya have someplace else to be?" Touji spun around facing the smirking red head. "Or someone else ta' bother at that?"
你难道没有别的地方要去吗？" 东二转身面对那个咧嘴笑的红发人。"还是说有其他人等着你去烦？

"Actually, I came to say goodbye…" Asuka said simply, as Touji and Hikari stared at her in surprise.
"其实，我是来告别的……" 明日香平静地说，东治和光则一脸惊讶地望着她。

"I must say, however, that I am immensely grateful for you to acquiesce so quickly to the resolutions of the Council regarding Uni-"
我得承认，尽管有此情况，我仍对您迅速同意理事会关于 Uni-的决议深表感激。

"Check." 核对一下。

Klaus Von Scherbach looked at the board, just mere minutes he had been gloating, now he had decided that Gendo was a worthy adversary for his keen intellectual mind. A pity he had never sided with him when the opportunity had presented itself, instead choosing to somehow acquire the power that was Lorenz Kihl for his own agenda.
克劳斯·冯·谢尔巴赫凝视着棋盘，就在不久前他还沉浸在胜利的喜悦中，如今他意识到源堂是一个值得他运用敏锐智慧去较量的对手。遗憾的是，他未曾在机会来临时选择与源堂并肩作战，反而设法将洛伦兹·基尔的力量纳入自己的计划之中。

"It's your turn now, General."
轮到您了，将军。

Von Scherbach looked at the board, noticing Gendo had taken his queen out, thus lifting the check from his own king, while simultaneously placing Von Scherbach's king in check.
冯·舍尔巴赫凝视着棋盘，发现元度已将他的皇后吃掉，既解除了自己国王的被将军状态，又让冯·舍尔巴赫的国王陷入了将军的困境。

Attempting to gain control of the situation, killing time until he had to leave, he decided to engage Gendo in another match of chess, this one more stylized, more subtle.
为了掌控局面并打发时间，直到必须离开，他决定与源堂再下一盘棋，这次的对弈更加讲究风格，也更为细腻。

"You are aware that Unit 02 will leave for Germany in 12 hours."
你已知晓，Unit 02 将在 12 小时后启程前往德国。

Gendo's face registered no emotions, but then again that was nothing new. Von Scherbach had met him, along with the head of operations for NERV-03, Dr. Langley, back when NERV was only a hushed whisper; a glimpse of things to come; back when Gendo had just become the man that now sat in front of him, and back when Langley had chosen the same path, to bury all of his emotions in his work, forsaking their own flesh and blood.
源渡的面容未显露任何情感，然而这已非新鲜事。冯·舍尔巴赫曾与他和 NERV-03 的运营主管兰利博士会晤，那时 NERV 仅是耳语中的预兆；那时源渡刚成为如今坐在他面前的人，兰利也选择了同一条路，将所有情感深埋于工作之中，舍弃了血亲。

"I had not been informed of that." Gendo replied, still focused on the board and nothing more. Von Scherbach scratched at his balding head, and extracted a folded paper from within his coat.
"我对此事一无所知。" 源堂回应着，目光始终不离棋盘。冯·谢尔巴克挠了挠自己光秃秃的头顶，从衣内抽出一张折好的纸。

"That's because as acting chairman for the council, I've decided you had no need to be informed." Von Scherbach retorted, his grey eyes twinkling underneath his eyebrows. His mouth curled under his mustache, colored salt and pepper gray into a cruel smirk.
"那是因为我作为理事会的代理主席，认为你没有必要知情。"冯·舍尔巴赫反驳道，灰眸在眉下闪着光。他的嘴角在灰白胡须下勾起，露出一抹冷酷的笑意。

"Because I would object." Gendo finally looked up, his ever present glasses catching the light and showing no sing of his eyes.
"因为我会反对。" 源渡终于抬头，他那副常戴的眼镜在光线下闪烁，却丝毫未透露他的目光。

"You can object if you want." Von Scherbach motioned with his hand, moving another piece effortlessly, gliding across the board. "But the truth is you have no say in the matter. Unit 02 will be taken back for further research and development in Hamburg."
如果你愿意，可以提出反对。"冯·舍尔巴赫挥手示意，另一枚棋子轻松滑过棋盘。"但真相是，你对此事无权置喙。02 单位将被带回汉堡，以进行更深入的研究与开发。

He paused his rook in front of the space to flick the other knight off.
他把车移至空位前，轻巧地将对方的马弹开。

"Along with its pilot. Check."
连同飞行员一起。确认无误。

Gendo pursed his lips together.
源渡紧抿双唇。

"See the brilliant strategy, Ikari?" Von Scherbach continued goading Gendo, capturing another one of his knights. "You thought you held all the trump cards…but that changed the moment Kihl passed away."
见识到这精妙的策略了吗，碇？"冯·施切尔巴赫继续挑衅源堂，再次俘获他的一名骑士。"你曾以为自己掌控了所有王牌……然而基尔的逝世改变了这一切。

"I am NERV now." Von Scherbach said as he nailed Gendo with a hateful glare and an angry smirk. "And you…? You are simply someone who suffered a casualty, who lost a loved one…"
我现在是 NERV。"冯·谢尔巴赫一边说，一边用充满恨意的眼神和愤怒的冷笑紧盯着源堂。"至于你……？你不过是那个不幸的牺牲者，失去了挚爱之人……

"I lost my wife." Gendo's response came back, and there was ice in the words, a cold fury only he could deliver in a quiet hush. "I had to stand by and see her go."
我失去了妻子。" 源渡的回答中带着冰冷的怒意，那种只有他能以平静的低语表达的冷酷。"我只能无助地站在一旁，目睹她离去。

"The sins of the father…" Von Scherbach said simply, but his face held no emotions, almost as if he were discussing the weather. "And so, to make up for your failures as a father, you think that granting your son liberty to come and do as he pleases, to play house with another pilot will make you get what? A request to play catch in the park? To go see a baseball game?"
父债子偿……"冯·舍尔巴赫淡淡地说，脸上波澜不惊，仿佛在谈论天气。"所以，你以为通过让你的儿子自由自在，与另一位飞行员同居，就能弥补你作为父亲的失职？期待他提出去公园玩接球，或是去看棒球赛？

Gendo remained silent, still focused on the game.
源渡沉默不语，全神贯注于游戏之中。

But Von Scherbach decided he still had to go for another shot, like a boxer trying to feel his way around his opponent,
但冯·舍尔巴赫认为他仍需再次尝试，如同拳击手在试探对手的招式

"You thought I didn't know, no?" The general mimicked Gendo's posture, kneeling towards him. "We are in a position where second guessing and feelings are hindrance, where we are not allowed to ask or give quarter."
你以为我蒙在鼓里，是吧？" 将军模仿源堂的姿态，跪在他面前。"我们身处一个不容许猜疑和情感干扰的境地，既不能提问，也无法给予宽恕。

He crossed his arms across his chest and looked at Gendo straight in the eye. "We are at war…permanently. We are not to forget that for any reason, lest of all for sentimental outdated values…Commander."
他双臂交叉抱于胸前，目光直射源堂。“我们正身处一场永久的战争……任何时候都不能忘记这一点，更不能因那些陈旧的感伤价值观而有所动摇……指挥官。”

If Gendo felt the jibe directed at him, the scorn dumped on his title, he never showed.
如果源渡察觉到那句讽刺是针对他，对他的头衔的轻蔑，他从未表露出来。

"Do you have any idea how sickening it was to see them both prancing around like that? They are our weapons! The Evangelions, they are nothing but tools! But the children…" He paused and sat back, crossing his arms while leveling Gendo with a glare.
"你可曾想过，目睹他们那般欢腾跳跃，内心是多么的厌恶？他们是我们手中的利剑！那些福音战士，不过是冰冷的工具！然而，那些孩子们……" 他顿了顿，靠回椅背，双臂交叠，目光如炬地直视着源堂。

"They are not to be used and disposed of, but they are NOT to be pampered and nurtured…they are to be the pilots for these killing machines! They are to be our last line of Defense! We can't run the risk of Humanity being wiped because you suddenly grew up a conscience and decided to let your child walk away! We can't walk away…the only way we get out is in a body bag or in a casket…there nothing more and nothing less…"
它们不应被使用后丢弃，也不应被过分呵护和培养……它们应成为这些杀人机器的驾驶员！它们应成为我们的最后一道防线！我们不能因你一时良心发现而让子女离开，冒着人类灭绝的风险！我们不能退缩……我们唯一的出路是装在尸袋或棺材里……仅此而已，别无其他……

He paused, but Gendo still hadn't moved; he was still with his hands stapled in front of him, the light bouncing of his glasses, his face as expressive as a slab of concrete. In a flash Von Scherbach got up and slammed his hands heavily against the table, the pieces falling from the chess board.
他稍作停顿，然而源渡依旧纹丝不动；双手被固定在身前，眼镜上的光线闪烁，面无表情如同一块混凝土。刹那间，冯·舍尔巴赫猛地站起，重重地拍击桌子，棋盘上的棋子随之散落。

"To try and convince him there is another way is futile and cruel. They are to be guarding you! ME! The whole world! Not delude themselves into looking for a happy life…they are soldiers, they are nothing more…nothing else!"
试图说服他还有其他出路是徒劳且残忍的。他们本应保护你！我！乃至整个世界！而不是自欺欺人地追求幸福生活……他们是士兵，仅此而已，别无其他！

Von Scherbach laid back and looked at Ikari with contempt. "I used to hate you for gathering all of the Evangelions. But then, when I read reports of the battles, and how effortlessly we won, I saw your brilliant mind, and came to respect you…"
冯·舍尔巴赫向后一靠，轻蔑地打量着碇。"我曾因你集结所有福音战士而对你恨之入骨。但后来，当我阅读战斗报告，目睹我们如何轻易获胜时，我领略到了你的非凡才智，从而对你产生了敬意……"

"But then this happened…you let your son become attached to her! She failed because of him! So…the only thing I can do is take her away, and begin molding her again."
然而，事情发展至此……你竟让你的儿子对她产生了依赖！她因他而失败！因此……我唯一的选择便是将她带走，重新开始塑造她。

He looked at Ikari who was still in the same position.
他注视着仍然保持原姿势的碇。

"You can keep you son." He smirked one last time. "But I get to keep your red queen."
你可以留下你的儿子。"他最后一次得意地笑道，"不过，你的红皇后得归我。

And with that, he made his way to the door. The wooden pieces rattling against the marble floor as he knelt, and picked the red queen before placing it in the board.
就这样，他走向门口，木块随着他跪地而敲击着大理石地面，他拾起红皇后棋子，随后将其安放在棋盘上。

"Wanna dance?" 想一起跳舞吗？

The question threw Asuka out of her reverie. She had been thinking, not sulking by one of the many tables where the wedding was undergoing. She had known that it would have to happen eventually; the news hadn't taken her by surprise.
这个问题打断了飞鸟的沉思。她其实一直在思考而非闷闷不乐，婚礼正在众多餐桌旁热闹进行。她心里清楚，这一刻终将到来，所以消息并未让她感到惊讶。

But it was still so hard to let go.
然而，放手仍是那么不易。

Asuka blinked, forcing herself to push those thoughts back and glanced at Kaji's extended hand.
明日香眨了眨眼，努力将那些杂念抛诸脑后，目光转向了加持伸出的手。

"That depends…" she grinned mischievously, "Will this lead to us slinking away to the restroom and you finally making a woman out of me?" she asked with a barely contained smirk.
"那得看情况……"她狡黠一笑，"这是否意味着我们会悄悄躲进洗手间，而你终于要让我蜕变成真正的女人了？"她带着难以掩饰的笑意问道。

"Wouldn't I be a bit too late for that anyway?" Kaji asked jovially, enjoying Asuka's blushing face before he bowed like a gallant knight would to his lady.
"我难道不是已经有点太晚了吗？" 加持笑着问道，欣赏着明日香脸红的样子，随后优雅地鞠了一躬，宛如骑士向心爱的女士致敬。

"Asuka…you are one of the loveliest lady in this whole gathering." Kaji answered truthfully, a killer smile on his lips. "But my heart and soul are Misato's…always have been…always will…" he said as he fingered the simple white gold band around his ring finger.
"明日香，你无疑是这场聚会中最迷人的女士之一。" 加持真诚地回答，嘴角挂着迷人的微笑。"但我的心和灵魂都属于美里…始终如一…永不变迁…" 他边说边轻轻摩挲着无名指上那枚朴素的白金戒指。

Asuka smiled at that, happy for him, and although she would never accept it openly, for her as well. Silently, she took Kaji's hand and walked with him to the dancing floor, intent on enjoying herself.
明日香对此露出微笑，内心为加持感到高兴，尽管她不会明说，其实她自己也很开心。她默默地牵起加持的手，一同走向舞池，决心要好好享受这段时光。

"You know…" Kaji began absently as he twirled with the red head around gracefully. "I would have thought that Shinji would be here with you…"
你知道吗…" 薰心不在焉地开口，一边优雅地与红发女孩共舞。"我还以为真嗣会在这里陪你…

Asuka's face became a mask of stone.
明日香的脸庞变得像石头一样冷硬。

"I have to thank both of you for this…me and Misato would never have taken this step if you two hadn't butted in." Kaji continued, unaware of, or simply not caring about, the change in mood on his dancing partner.
"我得感谢你们俩，要不是你们介入，我和 Misato 绝不会迈出这一步。" Kaji 继续说着，似乎并未察觉或不在意他的舞伴情绪上的变化。

"And I suppose that this is also true for both you and Shinji. It took me some time to figure it out, but it turned out he was right making all that he made." Kaji paused turning to look at another couple nearby.
"我想这对你和真嗣也同样适用。我琢磨了一阵子才领悟，但他所做的一切最终证明是正确的。" 薰稍作停顿，目光转向旁边的一对情侣。

"Toji and Hikari, for instance." Kaji said smiling, but Asuka refused to look at her best friend. She was happy, she really was, but in this moment, with so much on the line, she was just plain jealous.
"比如东司和光。" 加持笑着说道，然而明日香却不愿看向她最亲密的朋友。她内心是喜悦的，确实如此，但在这一刻，面对如此重大的局面，她无法抑制自己的嫉妒之情。

"Hikari would have kept shuffling through the motions, and then she would have finally decided to let go and look for someone else." Kaji paused and turned to look.
"光或许会一直机械地重复那些动作，但最终她可能会选择放手，去寻找新的伙伴。" 加治停下脚步，转头望去。

Asuka smiled at that, memories of how she had been trying to help her friend and that…She smiled, realizing she could refer to Toji as a jock or an idiot, but in all honesty, she had come to tolerate him, if not for Hikari then for Shi-
明日香对此微微一笑，回想起自己如何尽力帮助朋友，以及那些往事……她微笑着，意识到她可以称东治为运动员或笨蛋，但说实话，她已经逐渐接受了他，如果不是因为光，那就是因为志——

"It really was nothing…It was my obligation…after all she IS my friend." Asuka replied haughtily, and in that moment Kaji saw something…a chink in the armor she always wore.
"这真的不算什么…毕竟她是我的朋友，这是我应尽的责任。" 明日香傲慢地回答，那一刻，加持察觉到了她坚硬外壳上的一丝裂痕。

It began with Asuka looking at where Hikari was dancing, and how she looked, how both she and Toji looked.
故事开始于明日香凝视着光跳舞的场景，观察她的舞姿，以及她和当二的神情。

They looked happy. 他们显得很开心。

They looked complete. 他们看上去完好无缺。

Kaji and her kept dancing, a soft ballad and Asuka smiled while Toji and Hikari talked softly among themselves, a soft smile here, a blush there, her fingers at the nape of his neck while he held her so close yet so lightly, like he was afraid of breaking her.
卡吉与她共舞，伴着柔和的民谣，明日香面带微笑，与此同时，东治和光在轻声细语中交流，时而露出温柔的微笑，时而脸颊微红，她的手指轻抚他的后颈，而他则轻柔地拥抱着她，既亲密又小心翼翼，仿佛担心会伤害到她。

And Hikari kept looking at her ring finger, which held a modest gold band topped with a discreet stone; it might not be that big, or that sparkling, but Asuka remembered when Toji had finally come out clean, how both she and Hikari had confronted Shinji and Toji to tell them the truth.
光始终注视着她无名指上那枚简约的金戒指，其上点缀着一颗低调的宝石；它虽不显眼，也不璀璨，但明日香清晰记得，当东治最终坦白时，她和光一同直面真嗣和东治，向他们揭露了真相。

How Toji had gritted his teeth and looked at Shinji who had simply nodded in a grim way; how Toji had then knelt in front of Hikari, taking her hand with his own shaking hand and, pulling the finger out of the velvet box, he slid it down her finger, asking her the most important question he had ever asked the pigtailed girl.
东治如何紧咬牙关，望着只是沉重点头的真嗣；接着，他跪在光面前，颤抖的手握住她的手，从天鹅绒盒中取出戒指，缓缓滑入她的指间，向这位扎着马尾辫的女孩提出了他一生中最重要的问题。

And now, they were making plans, plans about the future, plans about a future she might not have, plans about the future she thought she had never wanted until she realized they were taking that choice from her; it wasn't so much that she wanted to get married and have children, but…somewhere along the lines, she had come to think of it as an alternate ending for her.
如今，他们正筹划着未来，筹划着她或许无法触及的未来，筹划着她曾以为自己从未渴望过的未来，直到她发觉他们正剥夺她的选择权；并非她真的渴望婚姻与子女，然而……在某个时刻，她已将其视作自己人生的另一番景象。

That had changed earlier today, and that had changed everything afterwards.
今天早些时候情况已变，此后一切随之改变。

She blinked when she felt the burning became tears and smiled to herself, chiding herself for being a sentimental fool.
感受到灼热转为泪水，她眨了眨眼，对自己微微一笑，暗自责怪自己太过感性。

But Kaji… 可是卡吉…

Kaji witnessed all of this, and slowly, masterfully, he danced towards a balcony, and just as the song had ended, he grabbed Asuka's hand and walked outside with her, before looking at her in the eye.
卡吉目睹了这一切，他缓缓地、娴熟地舞向一个阳台，就在歌曲结束时，他牵起明日香的手，一同走到户外，随后深情地凝视着她。

"They've already told you, didn't they?"
他们不是已经告诉你了吗？

And Asuka simply stood there, and nodded at this. "The truth is…" Asuka began, paused and passed her tongue through her lips to wet them, taking a deep breath to calm herself. "The truth is, Kaji…"
明日香静静地站在那里，对此点了点头。“其实……”她开口道，稍作停顿，用舌头润了润嘴唇，深吸一口气以稳定情绪。“其实，加持……”

She had been looking at her feet, shuffling with Kaji when she suddenly looked up, a radiant, beautiful smile on her face.
她原本低头看着脚，与加治一同缓步前行，忽然抬头，脸上洋溢着灿烂而美丽的笑容。

"I do want to do it. I'm going home, and I simply came to say goodbye." she finished lamely, and God! did she feel incredibly stupid with that flimsy excuse. Kaji smirked at that, but decided the rebuttal would contain cold hard facts, logic and figures…if Asuka was trying to mask everything by simply saying she wanted to leave, that Germany needed her, that NERV still had a use for her, that Eva was still the most important thing in her life, he would make sure to make those statements come crashing down.
"我确实想这么做。我正要回家，只是来告个别。" 她尴尬地结束了这句话，天啊！她觉得自己用这个蹩脚的借口显得无比愚蠢。加持对此嗤之以鼻，但决定用冷酷的事实、逻辑和数据来反驳……如果明日香试图用简单的离开、德国需要她、NERV 仍有她的用武之地、Eva 仍是她生命中最重要的东西来掩盖一切，他会让这些说法土崩瓦解。

Kaji looked carefully at the smiling face of Asuka. Anybody else would have given her a look and said she was indeed honestly happy about leaving home.
卡吉凝视着明日香那洋溢着笑容的脸庞。旁人若见，定会认为她对离家一事确实满心欢喜。

But Kaji knew better. Kaji knew her better.
然而，加治更懂。加治更懂她。

"So you are looking forward to gong back then?"
这么说，你很期待回去吧？

"W-" Asuka was sure he was going to tell her to stay, but this unexpected question made her stop short. Kaji continued undauntedly, though.
"W-" 明日香本以为他会让她留下，不料这出乎意料的问题让她一时语塞。但加持并未受影响，继续说道。

"It must be really hard, and you must miss a lot of things form home..."
这肯定很不容易，你一定很怀念家里的许多事物……

"I…" Asuka smiled, but the smile never reached her eyes. "I miss so much about Germany and don't even know where to begin."
我……" 明日香虽在微笑，眼中却无笑意。"德国的一切让我如此怀念，真不知该从何谈起。

So he simply looked at her with deep sad eyes, and in those eyes Asuka could swear she could see a little bit of Shinji in him, the light slump of his shoulders, the way his mouth became a thin line drawn downwards.
他只是用那双深邃而忧伤的眼睛凝望着她，在那些眼神中，明日香确信自己捕捉到了一丝真嗣的痕迹——他微微低垂的肩膀，以及嘴角下垂成一条细线的模样。

"I miss the food, the wonderful German festivals I used to go to, the Marketplatz and the Schnoor, the Schlachte and walking down the Liebfrauenkirche; the weather and the people."(1)
我怀念那里的美食，那些我曾参与的精彩德国节庆，市场广场与施诺尔街区，施拉赫特河岸以及漫步于圣母教堂旁；还有那里的气候和人们。

She smiled a little as the nostalgia of everything came to her like unrestrained waves. "I miss Germany and every day I stayed here I hoped to return..."
她嘴角微微上扬，怀旧之情如潮水般汹涌而至。“我真的很想念德国，留在这里的每一天，我都渴望着能回去……”

Asuka paused, and forced her smile to become bigger, brighter, until it pained her jaw, and the corners of her mouth, but most of all it pained her inside.
明日香顿了顿，竭力让笑容更加灿烂，直至下巴和嘴角隐隐作痛，而内心更是感到一阵阵的痛楚。

"So I'm really looking forward to going back."
我非常期待能够回去。

She looked at Kaji expectantly, waiting for him to say something. Instead, he simply sighed and extracted a cigarette from within his tuxedo, lighting it and exhaling a soft plume of wispy smoke.
她满怀期待地望向卡吉，盼着他开口。但他只是叹息一声，从西装内抽出一支烟，点燃后缓缓吐出一缕轻柔的烟雾。

Finally, he spoke. 最后，他终于说话了。

"I'm sorry…" Kaji said softly. "If it were up to me, I would grant you this. As it is I don't have the authority to make any changes. Everything will go according to plan."
真的很抱歉…" 加治轻声说道。"若我能做主，定会满足你的请求。可惜我无权更改，一切只能按计划执行。

"Wh-what do you…?" Asuka stopped and turned to look at her long time crush, her long time guardian, and the closest thing she ever had to a father, to a brother.
"你……你说什么？" Asuka 停下脚步，转身望向她长久以来的暗恋对象，她的长期守护者，以及她生命中最接近父亲和兄长的人。

The closest she had to family; he and Misato and Shinji and everybody here.
对她而言，最亲近的家人就是他和美里、真嗣，还有这里的所有人。

"Wh-what do you mean?" 你指的是什么意思？

And it hurt; it pained her like nothing could. But she had promised she would never cry.
它痛彻心扉，痛得无以复加。然而，她曾发誓绝不流泪。

"Asuka...I'm not able to stop the wheels from turning. As an active Evangelion Pilot, you are to follow orders." Kaji said simply, flatly, covering his mouth as he took another drag from his cigarette. "You've been given your orders by the High Command; Asuka Langley Soryu, Designated Second Child and Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 will be going back to Germany, to NERV-3."
明日香...我无力阻止事态的发展。身为现役 EVA 驾驶员，你得遵从指令。" 加持语气平淡，边说边用手掩口，深深吸了一口烟。"你已接到最高指挥部的命令；明日香·兰格雷·索西尔，即第二适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员，将返回德国，前往 NERV 第三支部。

The moment Asuka heard her name, her designation, what made her Asuka Langley Soryu, she stood straight, like a soldier receiving orders, but her eyes, her mouth; her whole face betrayed the girl that was beneath the hard surface; the girl that wanted to cry at the injustice of it all.
听到自己的名字，那个赋予她身份的代号——惣流·明日香·兰格雷时，明日香立刻挺直了身躯，仿佛士兵在接受指令。然而，她的眼神、嘴角，乃至整张面庞，都流露出那个内心脆弱的女孩；那个面对不公，内心渴望哭泣的女孩。

"You'll be going whether you want it, or not." Kaji finished with another long drag. "The minute you began to drop hints for a change in departure time Von Scherbach accelerated the time table; the moment you began to grasp at straws trying to stop the whole thing from happening-"
不管你愿不愿意，你都得去。" 加治说完，又深深吸了一口烟。"自从你开始暗示想调整出发时间，冯·谢尔巴赫就提前了计划；而当你开始拼命寻找阻止这一切的方法时——

"N-no...I..." Asuka interjected, a pathetic smile, the kind one flashes when they have been discovered in a lie, but refuse to accept was now gracing her lips. "I just didn't want thing to go wrong..."
不，我……" 明日香打断道，嘴角勉强挤出一丝苦笑，那种谎言被识破却仍不肯认输时特有的笑容。"我只是不希望事情出差错……

"You had an interview with the Japanese government liaison to see if they could fast track your request for Japanese citizenship."
你与日本政府联络官面谈，探讨是否能加速审批你的日本国籍申请。

"That was bec-" 那是因为-

"A request for citizenship you asked for when you heard about Von Scherbach's intention of moving Unit 02 to Germany. You asked the German embassy a plea to renounce citizenship, citing as a resource the fact that your mother was a Japanese National."
您在听说冯·舍尔巴赫计划将 02 单位迁移至德国后，向德国大使馆申请放弃国籍，依据是您的母亲具有日本国籍。

Asuka passed her tongue through her lips again, feeling her throat dry and constricted.
明日香又用舌头舔了舔嘴唇，感到喉咙干涩且有些紧绷。

"I…" she stammered. "I was simply telling them to void the req-"
我…" 她支支吾吾地说，"我只是让他们取消那个请求-

"There was even talk for a request of political asylum, until the UN shot it down citing your own ability to synch with Eva 02 as the basis of the mandate to submit to UN authority."
甚至有人提出申请政治庇护，但联合国以你能够与 Eva 02 同步的能力为由予以否决，并以此作为你服从联合国权威的依据。

Asuka's silence was all Kaji needed. He sighed and walked to the bench in front of them.
明日香的沉默对加持来说已经足够。他叹息一声，走向面前的长椅。

"H-how did you know?" 你...你怎么知道的？

"Please Asuka, give me a little more credit." Kaji said and with that single sentence, Asuka suddenly felt drained, tired, physically tired, emotionally dry, and just generally spent. She leaned against the stone railing and simply…looked at him.
"阿苏卡，请多信任我一些。" 卡吉的话音刚落，阿苏卡顿感身心俱疲，无力地倚在石栏上，只是默默地凝视着他。

"So just come clean…" 还是坦白交代吧…

He looked at her in the eye, before letting out a soft question. "Do you really want to go back?"
他凝视着她的双眼，轻声问道：“你真的愿意回去吗？”

Those eyes; that posture, the same kind of sad, melancholic look he had given her, the same posture he had before she left him at the apartment.
那双眼睛；那种站姿，他曾向她投去的同样悲伤、忧郁的眼神，以及她离开前他保持的同样姿态。

"No..." she began in a soft voice.
"不……" 她轻声开口道。

"I don't..." she stopped, brushing her hand against her eyes as she felt them sting and burn and hurt, and then felt a salty wetness on her cheeks. "I don't want to go back..."
我不想……"她顿了顿，手轻抚过眼角，感受到一阵刺痛与灼热，随即脸颊上滑落了咸涩的泪水。"我真的不想回去……

Kaji kept quiet, and Asuka continued on.
加持沉默不语，明日香接着往下说。

"So what if it's the only operational base? What if they need Eva 02 for further Research and Development?" she said lowly, her whole frame trembling because of the sadness, of the repressed anger.
"即便这是唯一的运营基地又如何？如果他们需要二号机进行更深入的研究和开发呢？"她低声说着，身体因悲伤和隐忍的怒火而微微颤抖。

"But why do they need me?"
但他们为何需要我呢？

Kaji had been sure that sooner or later she was going to explode, and he was actually surprised she hadn't done that in the church or at the beginning of the reception.
加治一直坚信，她迟早会爆发，他甚至对她没在教堂或招待会刚开始时就爆发感到意外。

"They say they need my unit 02…" she said in a harsh whisper. "They know I can't live without her…They…they…"
他们说需要我的 02 单元……"她低声而严厉地说。"他们清楚我离不开她……他们……他们……

"Asuka…" Kaji said softly. "You know it was bound to happen; the angels are gone, there is no other reason for unit 02 to stay here. It's either this or turning it into scrap."
明日香……" 加持轻声说道，"这是迟早的事；使徒已不复存在，再无理由让二号机驻留于此。除了转移，就只能将其报废了。

"But they know I won't let it go, she needs me as much as I need her…I just can't part with her…I just can't…" Asuka turned at the ledge and hunched herself. Behind her, Kaji snuffed the cigarette and approached her.
"但他们清楚，我不会就此罢休，她对我的依赖不亚于我对她的需要……我无法与她分离……真的做不到……" 明日香转身面对着边缘，身体微微前倾。在她身后，加持掐灭了烟头，缓缓向她靠近。

"But you are going to Germany…" Kaji said quietly. "It's what you had wanted ever since Von Scherbach came here..."
但你即将前往德国……" 加治低声说道。"自从冯·谢尔巴赫来此，这便是你一直以来的愿望……

"B-but I-" 可是，我-

"Be careful what you wish for Asuka." Kaji said simply, flatly, with a sense of finality.
"明日香，当心你的愿望。" 加持简洁而平淡地告诫，语气中透露出一种决绝。

"I don't care!" Asuka let out an anguished scream as she turned to Kaji and punched him in the chest, letting part of her frustration bottled within free. "I don't care if I wanted to go back for God knows how long! I don't want to go back now!"
我不在乎！" 明日香痛苦地尖叫着，转向加持并猛击他的胸口，释放了内心积压的怒火。"天知道我曾多么渴望回去！但现在，我不想回去了！

She was now crying softly against Kaji's chest, not really caring if anyone was hearing or if anybody else cared, because the people she cared about cared; Kaji cared, he was here, holding her, soothing her. Misato cared; earlier today she had broken down and cried with her in her arms, while Asuka had remained silent and cold, but inside was bawling like a baby.
她此刻正轻声啜泣，紧贴着卡吉的胸膛，全然不顾是否有人听见，也不在意他人是否关心，因为她所珍视的人在乎；卡吉在乎，他就在这里，拥抱着她，抚慰着她。美里同样在乎；今天早些时候，她曾与她相拥而泣，而明日香虽外表沉默冷淡，内心却如同婴儿般痛哭流涕。

"All I can remember about that base is the horrible training! The coldness of the people in there! Von Scherbach and his orders..."
关于那个基地，我记忆犹新的是严苛的训练和那里人们的冷漠无情。冯·舍尔巴赫和他的命令，至今仍让我印象深刻……

Hikari cared; she had told her, while crying, that she hoped to see her again, even began making plans to head over on one of her school breaks. The stooges cared, they hadn't said anything about her, but had made the supreme sacrifice of not picking on her.
光很在乎；她曾泪眼婆娑地告诉她，她渴望再次相见，甚至开始筹划在假期时去找她。那些家伙同样关心她，尽管他们未曾提及，却做出了不欺负她的重大让步。

Even Rei and the new boy cared about her.
就连零和那个新来的男生也很关心她。

"I don't care about Germany..." she kept mumbling as Kaji's calloused hands massaged her head, making her body shudder as another break of sobs escaped from within her.
"我对德国无所谓..."她喃喃自语，卡吉那双粗糙的手轻抚着她的头，令她不禁颤抖，又一阵啜泣声不由自主地从她心底涌出。

"It stopped being my home when I came here, when I fought here! It stopped being my home the minute I risked my life here, for all of them...and now they want me to go back! Like some good soldier, like a good little doll!"
自从我来到这里战斗，这里就不再是我的家了！从我为了大家在这里冒险的那一刻起，它就不再是我的家...如今他们却要我回去，像个模范士兵，像个听话的小玩偶一样！

Kaji sighed and held her closer to him, catching Misato's form on the threshold of the balcony, her own face glistening with shed tears.
加治轻叹一声，将她拥得更紧，目光落在站在阳台边的美里身上，她的脸上泪光闪烁。

They remained like that for what seemed like hours; Kaji soothingly rubbing his hand on Asuka's back, feeling his own heart breaking for one of the girls he loved the most holding her as she cried, while the party was still going on full swing.
他们仿佛这样度过了数小时；加持轻柔地抚摸着明日香的后背，心中为这位深爱的女孩感到痛苦，她在他怀中哭泣，而派对依旧热闹非凡。

A soft click on the door and the worried face of Misato made Kaji smile at her reassuringly, and wave her away, wordlessly telling her that everything will be ok, that it was bound to happen; that the young German Red head could not keep everything bottled up indefinitely.
门上轻轻的咔哒声响起，美里忧心忡忡的面容让卡吉对她露出安抚的微笑，并挥手示意她离开，无声地传达着一切都会好起来的信息，暗示那位年轻的德国红发女孩终究无法将所有情绪长久压抑。

Misato walked back, mouthing a "thank you" at Kaji before closing the doors of the balcony, and drawing the curtains to make sure nobody came by.
真嗣走回去，对着美里无声地说了句“谢谢”，随后关上阳台门，拉上窗帘以防有人来访。

As the sobbing stopped, as the tears dried and as her eyes became parched pieces of flesh, Asuka got up, hiccuped and let out a sigh.
当啜泣声止息，泪水风干，她的双眼如同干瘪的肉块，明日香缓缓起身，打了个嗝，深深叹了口气。

"You know you don't have to accept the assignment." Kaji began running his hand through Asuka's red hair. "You can always ju-"
你其实不必非得接受这项任务。" 薰边说边轻抚着明日香那头红发，"你随时都可以选择...

"There's no point anyway, Kaji." she said softly, cutting him off. She got up and shrugged, and it broke Kaji's heart to see her like that, walking towards the door.
"反正也没什么意义了，卡吉。" 她轻声打断他，站起身来，无所谓的耸了耸肩，卡吉看着她这样走向门口，心如刀割。

"You said it yourself; I have to go…it's my responsibility as an Eva Pilot."
你不是也说过吗？我必须去，作为 Eva 的驾驶员，这是我的责任。

Kaji looked at her, not saying anything. She stopped short, turning quickly and enveloping the older man in a bear hug, burrowing her face in his chest.
加治默默地注视着她。她猛地止步，旋即转身，紧紧拥抱着那位长者，脸庞深埋在他的怀中。

"Congratulations to you and Mrs. Kaji, Ryoji…I'm so happy for the both of you." Asuka smiled, before she walked out the door.
"恭喜你和卡吉夫人，谅二……我真为你们俩感到高兴。" 飞鸟微笑着，随后走出了门。

Once she was out of his sight, Kaji's hand came to softly brush his rugged cheeks and eyes, before muttering softly, "Ich seh Dir in die Augen, Kleines…"(2)
她一离开他的视线，卡吉的手就温柔地抚摸着自己粗糙的脸颊和眼睛，轻声呢喃：“我凝视着你的双眼，小家伙……”(2)

It was then that he realized it was the first time she had called him by his given name.
那一刻他才意识到，这是她第一次直呼他的名字。

"Are you leaving?" 你准备走了吗？

The soft question from Shinji made Asuka stop, tensing her back. She had hoped not to do this here; she had hoped to have a graceful exit, saying good-bye and maybe shedding a tear or two, something natural, not bawling like a baby like she had done with Kaji.
真嗣柔和的问话让明日香止步，背部不由自主地绷紧。她本不想在此刻如此，原打算优雅告别，或许洒下几滴泪，自然而不造作，而非像与加持分别时那样失声痛哭。

"Yes." Asuka said softly, letting out a sigh.
"是的。" 明日香轻声说着，不由得叹了口气。

She was in the courtyard, almost ready to leave, the limousine probably on its way to pick her up and take her to the hangar bay, to leave Japan and everything she loved, secretly and openly behind.
她伫立在庭院中，即将启程，那辆豪华轿车或许已在路上，准备接她前往机库，离开日本，以及她深爱的一切，无论是暗中还是明面上的，都将被抛在身后。

"What about us?" Shinji asked as he walked up to her. "Where you even gonna say goodbye?"
我们怎么办？" 真嗣走向她时问道。"你打算说再见吗？

The soft music wafting from the party gave added to the romantic scenery to the courtyard, a modified garden, green and overflowing with life, a soft warm breeze flowing by.
派对中飘出的轻柔音乐，为庭院增添了一抹浪漫情调。这里是一个经过精心打理的花园，绿意葱茏，充满生机，一阵柔和的暖风轻轻吹过。

"Shinji." it was a faint touch, and Shinji turned to see Asuka's finger bracing his hand softly, and she was looking at it, a beat and a pause; almost as if she were unsure of how to proceed. "You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?"
Shinji。" 那是一次轻柔的触碰，Shinji 转头发现 Asuka 的手指正轻触他的手，她凝视着，停顿了片刻；似乎在犹豫该如何是好。"你真觉得我没跟你道别是因为我不在乎你吗？

Shinji looked away, still hurt ad angry and thinking why? Why was she doing this? His mind was trying to understand why she couldn't make it hurt less. Asuka simply held her hand against his cheek, forcing him to look at her.
真嗣别过头，心中依旧伤痛与愤怒交织，不解地思索：为什么？她为何要如此？他试图理解，为何她不能让这份痛苦减轻些许。明日香轻轻将手贴在他的脸颊，迫使他直视自己。

"You're an idiot…" 你真蠢…

It came out as something natural for her and it hurt so much to the both of them how she used their secret name, the word she used only for him and him alone.
她自然而然地用了他们之间的秘密昵称，这个只属于他的专属词汇，却让两人都感到深深的痛楚。

"I can't believe that after all this time you still don't know ONE thing about me."
真不敢相信，这么长时间过去了，你竟然还对我一无所知。

Shinji looked at her and sighed, trying not to notice how his own eyes were burning as well.
真嗣望着她，不由得叹息，努力忽略自己眼中同样灼热的感觉。

"Fine, then why didn't you say something?"
那既然这样，你之前怎么不说呢？

"W-well…because…" Asuka began to say softly, but her voice and her breath and her posture began to grow, to get more and more agitated. His eyes were still trained on her and it was so hard for her to say the words and accept that.
"W-well…因为…" 明日香轻声说着，但她的声音、呼吸和姿态逐渐变得激动。他的目光始终未曾离开她，让她难以吐露心声，难以接受这一现实。

"Because it is too damn hard Shinji! I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go…So if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye!"
因为这实在太难了，真嗣！我甚至无法向你表达我会有多么想念你。一想到以后不能天天见到你，我就不想离开……所以，如果你以为我没有和你道别是因为你对我来说不如别人重要，那你就错了。恰恰相反，你对我来说更重要。好了，这就是你的告别！

She could have said that; she should have said that.
她其实可以说那句话的；她应该说那句话的。

But instead in the last moment, Asuka Langley Soryu chickened out, and exploded.
然而，在紧要关头，阿苏卡·兰格·索琉却胆怯了，结果发生了爆炸。

"YOU NEVER ASKED ME TO STAY!" she shouted and huffed and sobbed and her tears were streaming down her cheeks now. "You never once asked me to stay, Idiot! Ever!"
你从来就没让我留下过！"她大声喊着，气愤又伤心地抽泣，泪水顺着脸颊直流。"你这个笨蛋，一次都没让我留下过！从来没有！

It was her silence what finally made Shinji snort; he had tried to let her know, but it seemed like she was more interested in going back, the scene at the kitchen, at school, the countless times he had tried to talk to her finally emerging making him stare at with hurt and with anger.
正是她的沉默让真嗣最终嗤之以鼻；他曾试图向她表达，但她似乎更想回到过去，厨房的那一幕，在学校，他无数次尝试与她沟通的情景终于涌上心头，让他带着伤痛和愤怒凝视着她。

"You know what? After all we've been through I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us." Shinji muttered before turning around. "Have a good time in Germany."
你明白吗？毕竟我们经历了那么多，我难以置信你竟想以这种方式了结我们的关系。" 真嗣喃喃自语，随后转身离开。"祝你在德国过得愉快。

Asuka stayed silent at that, her whole body trembled, inhaling sharply to try and calm herself.
明日香对此默不作声，全身颤抖着，深吸一口气以平复情绪。

"You could have stopped all this, you know..."
你其实可以阻止这一切的，你心里清楚……

"That's not my choice to make." he said quietly, and Asuka simply rolled her eyes at that and turned, her red hair flipping with the motion, showing him her back.
"这不是我该决定的事。"他低声说道，明日香对此只是翻了个白眼，随即转身，红发随着动作一甩，只给他留下一个背影。

"I know…it's mine…" she said forcefully and turned to him. "So I made the call, and I made my choice."
我知道…这是我的…"她坚定地说，随即转向他。"所以我拨了电话，做出了我的决定。

Shinji looked down but chose to keep quiet, the anger of Asuka almost palpable, becoming almost a tangible aura surrounding her, coming of in waves from within her.
真嗣低头沉默，明日香的怒火几乎能被触摸到，它形成了一种几乎可见的气场环绕着她，从她内心一波接一波地涌出。

"Shinji I don't want you to be tomorrow around when I leave." Asuka said, and then left, without waiting for an answer, without turning back. Shinji said nothing, until Asuka was a few steps way from him.
"真嗣，我不希望你明天还在我离开的地方徘徊。" 明日香说完便径直离去，未等回应，亦未回头。真嗣默然无语，直至明日香渐行渐远。

Then he pleaded in a small voice.
接着，他用细小的声音恳求。

"Please?" 请问？

Asuka stood there, and Shinji felt a bit of hope.
明日香站在那儿，让真嗣心中萌生了一线希望。

"Shinji…" Asuka began in a controlled tone. "There's nothing you or I can do. I have my orders, and you have yours." Asuka turned to him, and he could see the tears threatening to spill from her eyes.
"真嗣…"明日香语气克制地开口，"你我皆无能为力。我有我的命令，你也有你的。"她转向他，眼中泪光闪烁，几欲夺眶而出。

"So please…" Asuka began, her voice quivering under the strain. "I don't want to do this, not today, and not tomorrow…I know that we'll fight, and I don't want my last memories of you to be like that."
所以，拜托了…" 明日香开口，声音因压力而颤抖。"我不想在今天或明天这么做…我知道我们会有争执，但我不想让那些成为我对你最后的记忆。

Shinji was about to say something, but her eyes made him stop, like always just a single look form her eyes, bluer than the bluest sky would make him simply nod and agree with whatever she wanted.
真嗣本想说话，却被她的眼神制止了，一如往常，她那比蔚蓝天空还要深邃的眼睛只需一瞥，便足以让他默默点头，顺从她的任何意愿。

"So what do we do now?"
那我们现在该做什么呢？

"Just…hold me…and let me have my last dance…"
就…抱紧我，让我跳完这最后一支舞吧…

And so, slowly, the danced, silently, letting the music guide them on their step. And as with everything, it ended, and before Shinji could utter a word, Asuka placed her finger against his mouth, silencing him.
就这样，他们缓缓起舞，默默无言，任由音乐引领着每一步。如同世间万物，舞蹈终有尽头，真嗣还未来得及开口，明日香已将手指轻触他的唇，让他静默。

"No. don't say anything…it's hard enough as it is."
别说了，已经够不容易的了。

Silently, she rested her head against his, enjoying how nice, how good and natural this felt, wishing for a few seconds that it could last forever.
她默默地把头倚在他的头上，感受着这份美好与自然，心中暗自希望这一刻能永恒。

And then, when they had danced for as long as they could, when the enchantment was about to end, She stopped, and just as silently, turned and walked away. And with each step, Shinji could feel as another bit of him was chipped away.
随后，当他们跳至力竭，魔法即将失效之际，她驻足，静默无言地转身离去。每迈出一步，真嗣便感到自己又有一部分随之消逝。

There are few things sadder in life than seeing someone walk away, watching as they slowly become smaller and smaller, as the distance swallows them whole after they've left, the space between both bodies expanding slowly, inexorably until there's nothing but empty space and silence.
生活中鲜有比目送某人离去更令人心酸的场景，眼睁睁看着他们的身影渐行渐远，直至被距离完全吞没。两人之间的空间缓缓、不可阻挡地扩大，最终只剩下一片空旷与静默。

Shinji watched this, feeling the distance become a void, feeling the sadness slowly boil, transmuting into frustration, into anger at himself for not fighting, for standing still, for not taking action.
真嗣目睹了这一切，心中感受到距离化作一片空洞，悲伤逐渐沸腾，转化为对自己的愤怒与懊恼，因为他没有反抗，只是呆立原地，未曾采取任何行动。

For not doing anything. 什么也没做。

And so, Shinji choked back his own tears, brushing the back of his hand angrily against his eyes, turning around and walking towards the party.
于是，真嗣强忍泪水，愤然用手背拭去眼角的泪珠，转身向聚会地点走去。

"What are you doing Ikari-kun?"
碇君，你在忙什么呢？

Shinji blearily lifted his head from between her arms, squinting and looking at the swimming images of the 3 or 7 Rei Ayanami and guests that stood in front of her. Rei tilted her head to one side, noticing the sad smile on Shinji's face, how his eyes were held by a distant point, how he blinked every now and then.
真嗣昏昏沉沉地从她的臂弯中抬起头，眯着眼看着面前晃动的 3 或 7 个绫波丽的影像和来宾。绫波丽侧着头，察觉到真嗣脸上的苦笑，他的目光凝视着远方，不时眨眼。

"Are you…enjoying yourself?" The question was asked with caution and trepidation, almost as if Rei knew the real answer but wanted to hear it from the boy, and Shinji simply nodded and smiled at her.
"你是在…享受此刻吗？"绫波丽小心翼翼地问道，似乎她已知晓答案，却仍期待从真嗣口中确认。真嗣只是对她点了点头，露出了微笑。

"You know me…" 你了解我…

"I haven't seen you dancing with Soryu…"
我还没看到你和 Soryu 一起跳过舞……

"Yeah, well, you know her…" Shinji said and suddenly there was a soft sob. "She came to say good bye."
是啊，你了解她的…" 真嗣说着，突然间传来了一阵轻柔的啜泣声。"她是来告别的。

Shinji sobered up; looking at the half empty glass he had been drinking before muttering mostly to himself.
真嗣清醒过来，望着那半杯残酒，低声自语，仿佛在跟自己对话。

"I really thought she'd stay."
我确实以为她会留下来。

"You are aware that getting inebriated will do little to help you tomorrow." Rei said flatly, sitting next to her. "In fact, I believe the hangover will make it worst."
你明白喝醉了对明天并无益处。" Rei 平静地坐在她身旁说道，"实际上，我觉得宿醉只会让事情变得更糟。

"I don' care…I wanna be all numb a-and... drunk all through tomorrow and the next day and the one after…" Shinji hiccuped. "'s nothing else for me to do any way…"
我无所谓…只想让自己麻木，然后…从明天起，连着几天都醉生梦死…" 真嗣打了个嗝。"反正我也没什么其他事要做…

Rei sighed and seated. "I am not that familiar with this bonding process, but I am sure Soryu would have wanted for me to be with you in a time like this."
玲叹了口气，坐下说道："我对这种结合过程不太了解，但我相信索龙一定希望我能在此时陪伴你。"

Shinji smiled bitterly at that. "Yeah…apparently after all she had the best intentions and plans for all of us."
真嗣苦笑道：“确实…看来她终究是出于好意，为我们大家谋划了最佳方案。”

"Did you tell her how you felt?"
你有没有告诉她你的真实感受？

"Ev'ry time I tried to, she kept giv'n me this... th' ode to Germany; Oh Germany, Germany...The great, great Germany…" Shinji said sarcastically, slurring every word as he made wild movements with his arms. "What's so great about it any way?"
每次我想开口，她总是滔滔不绝地赞美德国；哦，德国，德国...伟大的德国..." 真嗣带着讽刺的语气，醉醺醺地吐字，夸张地挥舞着手臂。"德国究竟有何伟大之处？

"That I cannot tell you." Rei said as she threw a meaningful glance to the bartender who nodded at her and then walked out, grabbing Shinji and half dragging him, half carrying him outside. "What I can tell you is that you have to make a choice."
我无法透露详情。" 绫波丽说完，向酒保投去一个深意的目光，酒保点头回应后，她便拉着真嗣，半拖半抱地离开了。"但你必须做出选择，这是我能告诉你的。

"What are you talking about Rei?" Shinji grumbled. "You are not making any sense."
绫波，你在说什么呢？" 真嗣不满地说，"你这话一点逻辑都没有。

Rei walked into the taxi waiting for her while Kaworu held the door for her and Shinji. She got in, and held the drunken boy as the bar tender placed him inside, Kaworu slipping him a few yen notes for his help.
丽步入等候她的出租车，薰帮忙扶着车门，让真嗣和她进入。她坐进车内，搂着醉醺醺的男孩，酒吧服务员将他安置好，薰则悄悄递给他几张日元以示谢意。

"Asuka made her choice." Asuka 做出了选择。

"Yeah...so?" He said drowsily, as Rei sat next to him, and Kaworu sandwiched him, Shinji's head resting against Rei's shoulder. "She's taking a page from my book; she's running away…"
嗯...那又如何？" 他带着睡意说道，此时绫波坐在他身旁，薰夹在两人之间，真嗣的头倚靠在绫波肩上。"她这是在模仿我；她也在逃避……

"You both are." Rei finished as Shinji's head lolled before finally sleep claimed him. "You are both giving up."
你们俩都一样。" Rei 话音刚落，Shinji 便垂下头，沉沉睡去。"你们俩都在放弃。

The sun was so bright, it just wasn't fair.
阳光如此耀眼，简直太不公平了。

She had wanted for it to be dark and cloudy and rainy, a perfect mirror of her inner self; she wanted rain so she could blame on it the wetness she would feel on her face and cheeks later today.
她曾盼望天色阴沉，乌云压顶，雨丝绵绵，恰如她内心的写照；她渴望雨水，以便稍后能将脸上的湿润归咎于这场雨。

She had been sitting in the living room for a great deal of the day, simply petting and sobbing into Pen-pen's feathers, crying with parched eyes for God knew how long.
她几乎一整天都坐在客厅里，一边抚摸着 Pen-pen，一边将脸埋进它的羽毛中哭泣，双眼干涩，不知哭了多久。

She sighed, sniffing, and wiping her eyes, cursing herself for showing any signs of weakness again.
她叹息着，吸了吸鼻子，擦去眼角的泪水，暗自咒骂自己再次显露出脆弱。

Asuka stopped by Shinji's door, placing her hand against the stupid wooden sign and quietly remembering how long had it been since the thought of being away from this place, from this familiar walls and the people she called her friends and loved ones had crawled on her, making her physically feel completely lonely.
明日香驻足于真嗣的门前，手轻触那块木牌，默默回想自己多久未曾想过离开此地，离开这些熟悉的墙和那些她视作亲友的人，这念头让她深感孤寂。

Especially when her mind thought about a certain blue-eyed boy.
尤其是当她想到那个蓝眼睛的男孩时。

She knew she would have to eventually make her way to the limousine waiting at the entrance of her apartment. But she wanted to wait, look again, to take it all in and remember everything as it was.
她清楚自己终究得走向公寓门口那辆等候的豪华轿车。然而，她想再停留片刻，再次环顾四周，将眼前的一切深深刻入记忆。

One more time. 再试一次。

She wanted to remember all the little things that had shaped her feelings for him, all the small nuances that made him who he was, that made her love him.
她渴望铭记那些细微之处，它们塑造了她对他的情感，那些独特的细节定义了他，也成就了她对他的爱。

She opened his room and looked around his room, noticing on one of the drawers of his closet a small bottle of body wash; a memento he had kept from that time he had saved her from the volcano.
她推开他的房门，环视四周，发现他的衣柜抽屉上摆着一小瓶沐浴露，那是他当年从火山中救她时珍藏的纪念。

"Shinji? Idiot, don't go overboard."
Shinji？你这个笨蛋，别做得太过火了。

In front of her was the cello he would often play, and Asuka walked to it and pressed her hand against the grand instrument, plucking the strings and enjoying the distending sound, remembering the first time she had heard him play that soulful way he always did and the ki-
她面前是他常拉的大提琴，飞鸟走近，轻抚这把宏伟的乐器，拨动琴弦，沉浸在悠扬的音色中，回想起初次聆听他用那深情的方式演奏，以及那份触动心灵的情感——

"Hey, Shinji, do you want to kiss?"
嘿，真嗣，想不想亲一个？

She was crying gain, her hand against her mouth, her fingers on her lips, a sad, wistful smile merging with her tears as they began to flow freely; It wasn't because she had a crush on him, because she liked him or wanted to go steady, it wasn't because Shinji had been her first kiss, or because he had saved her…
她再次泪流满面，手捂着嘴，手指轻触唇边，带着一丝哀愁与渴望的微笑与泪水交织，任其肆意流淌。这并非因为她对真嗣心生情愫，或喜欢他，渴望与他确立关系，也非因他曾是她的初吻对象，或是他曾救过她……

It was all that, everything else, and nothing at all.
它包含了所有，涵盖了其他一切，却又空无一物。

It was the falling rain that had drenched them the last time it had rained in this city as they had been walking back from school, cutting against the buildings and the trees to stay as dry as possible, the warmness of his body as he tried to shield her with his jacket, and the blush on his face when she stayed too close to him.
上次这座城市下雨时，他们从学校回家的路上被突如其来的大雨淋得透湿，尽管他们尽量躲在建筑和树木旁避雨。他用外套为她遮挡，身体传递着温暖，而当她靠得太近时，他脸上不禁泛起红晕。

It was the lazy afternoons they had spent simply staring out the window, watching as the sun gave way to the darkness and the stars, enjoying the soothing sound of the cicadas and their lullaby; he would get up and walk into the kitchen, and come out with two glasses of tea, and simply sit and enjoy the company of the other in silence.
那些慵懒的午后，他们只是静静地望着窗外，看着太阳渐渐隐没于夜色与星光之中，聆听着蝉鸣的宁静旋律；他会起身去厨房，端来两杯茶，然后静静地坐下，在沉默中享受彼此的陪伴。

It was early morning and the smell of fresh made breakfast.
清晨时分，新鲜早餐的香气扑鼻而来。

It was late nights over snacks and Pocky sticks.
那是深夜，一边吃着零食，一边品尝着百奇饼干。

It was cheesy movies and dumb television shows and video games and boxed lunches and synch tests and long walks and her watching him under her red bangs and noticing just how much he meant to her, how every time he would hug her, or simply hold her hand would make her stomach do flip-flops and her knees shake.
那是些情节老套的电影、乏味的电视节目、电子游戏、盒饭、同步测试、悠长的散步，她透过红色的刘海凝视着他，逐渐明白他对自己有多重要，每当他拥抱她，或是仅仅牵起她的手，都会让她心跳加速，膝盖微颤。

How a single innocent peck on her lips would make her heart swell and how all the collective actions would somehow make it seem like there was order and meaning to the universe itself.
一个单纯无辜的轻吻落在她的唇上，便足以让她的心潮澎湃，而所有这些行为汇聚起来，仿佛让宇宙本身也显得井然有序，充满了意义。

Just every day...Little things like that...Little by little...He broke down the walls...
每天都是如此...那些微不足道的小事...一点一滴地...他逐渐瓦解了障碍...

She sighed, grabbing her small duffel bag, checking for the last time her room, previously a homely, comfortable mess, an organized chaos, than now seemed so clean and antiseptic, so devoid of life and feeling.
她叹了口气，拎起小行李袋，最后一次环顾房间。这里曾是温馨而舒适的杂乱之地，一种有序的混乱，如今却显得异常干净和无菌，失去了往日的生机与情感。

Everything was neatly packed in boxes, markings of Achtung! and Gochuui! all over them.
所有物品都井然有序地装在箱子中，箱体上遍布着“注意！”和“警告！”的标识。

A buzzing in her pocket made Asuka realize she was receiving a call.
口袋中传来的嗡嗡声让明日香意识到有电话打进来。

-Ma'am…we're waiting. -女士…我们在等您。

"Yeah…Just…go and take a ride a round the block…I'll be down in a couple of minutes."
去吧，绕着街区骑一圈，我过几分钟就下来。

She knelt down towards Pen-pen, patting him in the head, the warm water penguin looking at her and for a moment she smiled softly, thinking that perhaps the penguin would do something, like run around warking, or stand at the door to stop her from going.
她跪在企鹅彭彭面前，轻抚它的头，这只温水的企鹅望着她，她不禁柔情一笑，暗想这小家伙或许会有些动作，比如绕圈欢叫，或是守在门口不让她走。

Pen-pen simply titled its head, warked sadly, moving his flipper to say good-bye before he shuffled to his refrigerator room.
企鹅彭彭轻轻歪了歪头，哀伤地发出一声“哇”，挥动着鳍状肢表示告别，随后蹒跚地走向它的冷藏间。

For the last time, she looked at her home.
最后再看一眼，她凝视着自己的家。

For the last time, she sighed.
她最后一次叹息。

Then, she picked her red duffel bag, almost crying as she remembered the first time she had met Shinji in the over the rainbow, and how so long ago it felt. She wiped her eyes angrily and grabbed a small brown bag, clutching it against her. Closing her eyes and steadying herself, she looked straight ahead, a resolute look in her face.
随后，她拎起那只红色的行李袋，泪水几乎夺眶而出，回忆起初次在彩虹之上邂逅真嗣的情景，那感觉遥远得仿佛是上辈子的事。她愤愤地拭去眼角的泪，紧握着一个小巧的棕色袋子，将其紧紧拥在胸前。她闭目凝神，调整情绪后，目光坚定地直视前方。

And then finally, silently, in a completely opposite way in which she had entered their lives, Asuka Langley Soryu turned off the lights, and clicked the screen shut, stifling another sigh as she walked past the living area, petting pen-pen , taking all that she could commit to memory, before finally, slowly, walking to the front door, putting on her shoes and opening the door, exiting towards the hall and closing her eyes when she heard the loud hiss and the turn of the locks.
最终，她悄无声息地，以与闯入他们生活时截然相反的方式，关掉了灯，合上屏幕。经过起居区时，她压抑着叹息，轻抚着企鹅 Pen-Pen，尽力将一切铭记于心。然后，她缓缓走向前门，穿上鞋子，打开门，朝着走廊走去，在听到锁转动的响亮嘶嘶声时闭上了眼睛。

And as she entered the elevator and pressed the button for the ground floor, she began to feel a burning in her eyes when she realized the truth behind it all…
她步入电梯，按下一楼的按钮，眼中突然涌起一股灼热，因为她终于看清了这一切背后的真相……

All those small, little meaningless tasks she had done, had been the final ones she would do here.
她在这里完成的那些琐碎小事，竟是最后的告别。

As she climbed to the door and began her trip to the airport, to the future awaiting her she sighed, and clutched the brown bag against her chest.
她走向门口，踏上前往机场的路途，面对即将到来的未来，不禁叹息，紧紧抱住怀中的棕色提包。

One last time. 再来一次。

"Draw the curtains…the sun is getting in my eyes."
把窗帘拉上吧，阳光太刺眼了。

The driver simply nodded, and moments later a small cloth covered the window, obscuring the sun form the outside.
司机微微点头，随即一块小布遮上了车窗，挡住了外头的阳光。

Silently the limo continued going towards NERV
豪华轿车静悄悄地继续驶向 NERV

Shinji stirred awake and looked around, rubbing his eyes and wincing in pain.
真嗣突然醒来，环视四周，揉了揉眼睛，因疼痛而皱起眉头。

"Here drink this." 来，把这个喝了。

He took the offered water bottle and painkiller and wordlessly drank, enjoying the fresh feeling the water left in his parched tongue.
他接过递来的水瓶和止痛药，默默地喝下，感受着水滋润干渴舌头的清爽。

"Where are we?" 我们这是在哪儿？

Rei placed down her book and looked at him impassively. "You were in an inconvenient stage yesterday, and not fit to be by yourself; I took you to my apartment and while inebriated you and I had intercourse."
丽放下手中的书，神情淡漠地望向他。“昨天你状态不佳，不宜独处；我便带你回了我家，在你醉酒后我们有了肌肤之亲。”

Shinji spit the water he had been drinking when Rei's words made sense in his brain.
真嗣在听到绫波的话突然明白其含义时，不禁将口中的水喷了出来。

"Wh-wh-what are you talking about Ayanami?" Shinji asked, terrorized, raking his brain for any piece of information, and trying to remember what he had or hadn't done last night. "Are you kidding me? Why are you here Rei?" Shinji asked after a moment when he mulled over her words. "Why am I here with you?"
你到底在说什么，绫波？" 新二颤抖着问道，脑海中拼命搜寻着任何线索，努力回忆昨晚的所作所为。"你在耍我吗？为什么你会在这里，绫波？" 他沉思片刻后再次发问。"为什么我会和你在一起？

"The commander instructed me that due to budgetary cutbacks, I should cut back on expenses." Rei said flatly. "Carpooling seemed like a natural choice."
指挥官告诉我，由于预算缩减，我需要节省开支。" Rei 平静地说，"拼车成了理所当然的选择。

Shinji looked at her, a small smile playing on her lips; slowly the smile began to grow into a small giggle, and then into laughter, before finally both children were laughing at the sheer absurdity of the thought.
真嗣凝视着她，唇边掠过一抹浅笑；这微笑逐渐演变成轻声的笑，继而转为开怀大笑，最后两个孩子都因这荒诞不经的想法而笑作一团。

"Thank you Rei." Shinji said between the laughter. "I really needed that."
谢谢你，丽。" 真嗣笑着说，"我真的很需要那个。

"You are welcome." Rei said as she picked up her book, and began to read again.
"不客气。" Rei 说着，拾起书本，继续阅读起来。

"Do you know when Asuka is leaving?" Rei asked quietly, not bothering to turn and look at Shinji, who was looking at the darkened window instead.
"你知道明日香何时离开吗？" 绫波丽轻声询问，并未回头看向真嗣，而真嗣则凝视着昏暗的窗子。

He simply nodded. 他只是简单地点了点头。

"Are you sure you don't need to see her?"
你真的确定不需要见她吗？

"I don't know…Would it change anything? Is it to late to tell her no to go?"
我不确定…这会有所改变吗？现在告诉她别去，是不是已经太迟了？

Rei looked at him for a long time, deciding whether he wanted an honest answer or was simply seeking solace.
蕾凝视了他良久，心中琢磨着他到底是想要一个坦诚的答案，还是仅仅在寻求安慰。

"I think you need to answer your own questions."
我觉得你应该自己解答这些问题。

"You think I'm wrong?" He asked after pondering and letting out a sigh.
"你觉得我错了吗？"他沉思片刻后，叹息着问道。

"Do you wish to be wrong?"
你希望自己是错的吗？

Shinji looked at her, then at his cell phone. "I'll never be able to do it in time anyway."
真嗣望向她，随后瞥了一眼自己的手机，心想：“无论如何，我都赶不上了。”

"You could simply call her."
你直接给她打电话就行。

"So are you ready?" Von Schebach asked, his deep rumbling voice bringing Asuka out of her reverie.
"你准备好了吗？"冯·舍巴赫的声音低沉有力，将飞鸟从沉思中拉了回来。

"Yes." Asuka said simply, extracting a pair of dark shaded glasses and putting them on.
"是的。" 明日香简洁地回答，随即戴上了一副深色太阳镜。

"Everybody is looking forward for your arrival." Von Scherbach pressed on, not aware or not caring about the obvious discomfort in Asuka's face. "You will be welcomed a hero, Germany's most important daughter. You will become someone all of the young German girls will look up to."
大家都热切期盼你的到来。"冯·舍尔巴赫继续施压，似乎并未察觉或并不在意明日香脸上的明显不适。"你将以英雄的身份受到欢迎，成为德国最尊贵的女儿。你将成为所有德国年轻女孩的榜样。

Von Scherbach looked at the silent red head, how her glasses shielded all of her eyes, the silent posture and mouth drew in a tight line.
冯·舍尔巴赫注视着那位沉默的红发女子，她的眼镜完全遮住了双眼，身体姿态静默，双唇紧闭成一条直线。

And decided to go for one final attack
决定发起最终一击

"Your father will be so proud of you…" He began in a soft, velvety tone. "Another Soryu in such a key position fro NERV-3…Did I ever tell you I knew your father and mother well? It was a pity what happened to Kyoko of course and had I kn-"
你的父亲一定会为你感到无比骄傲……"他以柔和而丝滑的语调开口。"在 NERV-3 的关键岗位上，又有一位 Soryu……我是否曾提过，我与你父母颇为熟识？京子遭遇的不幸确实令人遗憾，若我当时知情——

As he kept babbling about her mother and the choices made and how they reflected on the future, Asuka simply nodded, grinning and bearing it, deciding on sleeping the whole trip back.
他喋喋不休地谈论着她的母亲、过去的抉择以及这些如何影响未来，明日香只是点头微笑，默默承受，打算在回程中全程睡觉。

Miraculously a soft buzzing sound emerging from her cell phone interrupted Von Scherbach's long and winded speech. Asuka looked at the number curiously and then back at the General.
就在这时，她手机里突然传来一阵微弱的嗡嗡声，打断了冯·谢尔巴赫冗长的讲话。明日香好奇地瞥了一眼来电显示，随后目光又转向将军。

"It's from-" 它来自-

-Asuka? -Asuka？

Asuka stared at the phone still not believing the number that was flashing on it.
明日香凝视着手机，依旧难以置信屏幕上跳动的号码。

"Y-yes?" Von Scherbach frowned when he saw the way she answered; it would just be his luck if it were that Ikari kid.
"是-是的？"冯·舍尔巴赫见她如此回答，不禁皱眉；要是碰上那个叫碇真嗣的小子，那可真是倒霉透顶。

-Are you at the docks?
-你在码头那边吗？

Her heart skipped as she heard the question…maybe this was a sign.
听到这个问题，她的心跳不由得漏了一拍……或许，这是某种预兆。

"Uh…No…why?" 呃…不…为什么呢？

-It's a good thing we were able to find you before you arrived there.
-幸好我们及时找到了你，没让你到那里去。

Before Asuka could answer back, Von Scherbach had taken the phone from her, looking at the name flashing on the screen, his eyes shrinking into tiny slits.
阿苏卡还未来得及回嘴，冯·谢尔巴赫便从她手中抢过电话，目光紧锁屏幕上闪现的名字，双眼眯成了一条缝。

"Is something wrong?" he asked in short, clipped tones.
"出什么问题了吗？"他急促地问道。

-Well…Actually… -嗯…其实…

As they passed by one of the many tunnels that cut through the Japanese mountain that served as a natural bastion fro Tokyo-3, Asuka had to press her phone to her ear to hear better before the call got disconnected.
他们经过东京-3 天然屏障——日本山脉的众多隧道之一时，明日香为了听得更清楚，不得不将手机紧贴耳朵，但通话还是中断了。

Outside, the world had stopped, the road was moving slower and slower with each passing second, and Rei made mental calculations about how long until the exit to the docks came into place.
户外，世界似乎凝固了，道路每过一秒都变得更加迟缓，Rei 则在心里估算着离码头出口还有多远。

He was so close. 他离得很近。

But with a look of sadness as she saw the interminable expense of car tail lights and honking sounds, she realized they would never make it on time. At the most they might be able to arrive to watch the boat taking off.
然而，面对连绵不绝的车尾灯和此起彼伏的喇叭声，她脸上掠过一丝哀伤，意识到他们注定无法按时抵达。至多，他们可能只能赶到码头，目睹船只离岸的瞬间。

"Damn!" Shinji cursed, punching the numbers again. Rei kept looking at him, a slight look of worry and apprehension on her face.
"该死！" 真嗣咒骂着，再次猛敲数字键。绫波一直注视着他，脸上掠过一丝忧虑和紧张。

"It's not going through…" Shinji whispered in anger, hearing once again the dial tone and then the overtly perky voice of a recorded operator telling him the number he had dialed was currently out of service and-
"打不通啊……" 真嗣带着怒气低语，又一次听到拨号音后，录音中过分欢快的女声告诉他，所拨号码当前无法接通，而且-

"Dammit! ...there's nothing I can do." Shinji sighed sadly as he clicked his phone off. He had been so stupid to think that he would be able to cheat destiny so easily.
"真糟糕！...我束手无策。" 真嗣带着悲伤叹息，按下了手机的关闭键。他意识到自己太天真了，竟以为能轻易地改变命运的轨迹。

"You know how you sound like?" Rei asked after a moment of silence. Shinji lifted his head and saw the coldest look in her eyes he had ever.
"你意识到自己听起来是什么样子吗？" 绫波在片刻沉默后问道。真嗣抬头，迎上了她眼中从未有过的冷冽目光。

"You sound like a man who's desperately trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in."
你这语气，像极了拼命说服自己相信某个自己都不信的事儿的人。

Shinji kept quiet at that, but clearly her words had a great deal of impact, his hand now tightly clenching the phone he was till holding.
真嗣对此默不作声，然而她的话语显然产生了巨大影响，他紧握着手中那部电话。

"Well what do you want me to do? She's not answering the phone, I can't get ahold of her, and she's leaving in about 10 minutes!" Shinji began to shout, his voice becoming more agitated, his tone more brash, before throwing the phone in disgust to the other side, flying by Rei who never once batted an eyelash.
"那你想我怎么办？她不接电话，我根本联系不上她，而且她再过大约 10 分钟就要走了！" 真嗣开始大喊，声音中透露出越来越明显的焦躁，语气也变得粗鲁，随后气愤地将手机扔向另一边，手机从丽身边飞过，而丽却始终面无表情。

"NERV is taking her away from me and I was unable to do anything to stop them, I was too cowardly to do anything at all, I should have told her to stop and stay or something…anything!"
NERV 正把她从我这里夺走，我却无能为力，我太懦弱了，什么都没敢做，我本该让她停下，留下，或者至少说些什么……任何能做的！

The force that had driven him forth, the anger and fire that had briefly shone in his face and eyes extinguished once the initial rage died, once his breathing became more and more slow.
驱使他前行的力量，那曾短暂在他面容和眼中闪现的怒火与激情，随着最初的愤怒平息，随着他的呼吸逐渐放缓，也渐渐熄灭了。

Once he realized the truth and the bitterness and the reality behind his words. Shinji closed his eyes, his face in his hand, resting on his knees, and tried to think that the dryness in his throat and the itching in his eyes weren't sobs and tears for doing too little too late.
意识到真相与苦涩，以及自己话语背后的现实后，真嗣闭上双眼，手掩面庞，倚膝而坐，试图说服自己喉间的干涩和眼中的刺痒并非因行动过迟、付出太少而引发的哭泣与泪水。

Rei waited for a minute or two before calmly picking the phone. Shinji only heard as the soft noises of the keys being pressed, the electronic pits and pats flowed on the car, before he felt it pressed against his face.
丽等了一两分钟，才从容地拿起电话。真嗣只听见轻柔的按键声，电子的滴答声在车内回响，紧接着电话就贴到了他的脸上。

-Hi!

The voice at the end of the other line said cheerfully, and Shinji felt his heart break once more.
电话那端的声音欢快地说着，真嗣的心又一次碎了。

-You've reached the voice mail of the great Asuka Langley Soryu…if you are calling to tell me how much you love me, save it, Baka-Shinji!
-你已接通惣流·明日香·兰格雷的语音信箱……若来电只为表达爱意，免了吧，真嗣大笨蛋！

He almost cried at the sound of her voice and the childishly, girly happiness it held.
听到她的声音，他几乎要哭出来，那声音里充满了孩子气和少女般的欢快。

-If you're Hikari or Misato, send me a text!
若你是光或者美里，请发消息给我！

He almost cried when he remembered this was probably the last time he would hear her.
他差点哭出来，一想到这可能是最后一次听到她的声音。

-If you are any of the two stooges drop dead!
-如果你是那两个蠢货之一，干脆去死！

Shinji looked at Rei who simply nodded, an encouraging smile on her lips, and did just that.
真嗣望向绫波，她微微颔首，唇边漾起一抹鼓励的微笑，他随即依言而行。

-Anyone else, leave me a message and tell me how wonderful I am!
还有谁，给我留言夸夸我吧！

"Ah…I just…" 啊…我只不过是…

Shinji started shakily, letting out a few calming breaths, taking advantage of the silence in the other side of the line before he continued with a bit more resolve.
真嗣起初声音微颤，他深呼吸几次以稳定情绪，利用电话那头短暂的沉默，他继续说道，语气更显坚决。

"I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry…that I know what you were trying to tell me, that I know why you did it all…"
我想告诉你，我真的很抱歉…我明白你想传达的意思，也理解你为何这么做…

A sob, a chocked gasp and a stuttering breath.
一阵啜泣，哽咽的抽噎和断续的呼吸声。

"I…I know you are leaving…that you should get going...but…You can't...You can't leave yet…"
我…我知道你得走了…是时候出发了...但是…你不能...你现在还不能走…

"The boat is about to leave..." She heard the General say in a restrained tone. "We have no time for this type of-" He was cut off and his eyes bore Asuka down, almost as if he was blaming her for whatever he was being told.
"船就要开了……"她听到将军压低声音说，"我们没空应付这种——"话未说完，他的目光锐利地盯向飞鸟，似乎在责怪她，因为他所听到的任何事情。

"Like I said, you can send us all that information to the NERV-3 offices, I'll make sure Pilot Soryu gets it when we arrive there."
正如我之前所说，请将所有资料发送至 NERV-3 办公室，我会在抵达后确保驾驶员 Soryu 能够及时接收。

More silence, more beats. More incensed looks thrown at her and Asuka wanted to desperately know what was going on, what was the General being told, why was he looking so close to explod-
更多的沉默，更多的节拍。她与明日香承受着越来越多的愤怒目光，她迫切地想知道究竟发生了什么，将军接到了什么消息，为何他看起来如此濒临爆发。

"Ikari." 怒气。

It was one word, whispered with so much contempt and tiredness in Von Scherbach's voice that made Asuka's own spine crawl. His big hands whitened at the pressure inflicted on Asuka's little red phone, and she could swear she heard a faint crack before von Scherbach finally released it and gave a small, victorious smile.
那仅是一个字，冯·舍尔巴赫的语气里满是轻蔑与倦怠，让明日香感到脊背发凉。他那双大手因用力过度而泛白，紧握着明日香的小红电话，她几乎能听到细微的裂声，直到冯·舍尔巴赫最终松手，脸上掠过一丝得意的微笑。

"See that you do…and do not call any more. I'll take care of this personally"
记住你做了什么…别再打电话了。我会亲自处理这件事

He pushed a button and leaned forward to give Asuka her phone, turning it off in the process. Asuka looked at it, her thumb hovering over the on/off, biting her lip before Von Scherbach let out a frustrated sigh.
他按下按钮，身体前倾把手机递给明日香，并顺手关掉了它。明日香接过手机，拇指悬停在开关上，咬着嘴唇犹豫不决，此时冯·舍尔巴赫忍不住发出了一声沮丧的叹息。

"Were you waiting for someone to call you, pilot Soryu?"
你在等谁的电话吗，飞行员 Soryu？

Asuka looked at the phone, and suddenly her vision got a bit blurry, and she grasped the phone softly, her hands on her knees, her face looking at the floor.
明日香凝视着手机，视线忽然模糊起来，她轻柔地握着手机，双手搭在膝上，面庞低垂，目光投向地面。

"No sir." She said softly.
"不，先生。"她柔声说道。

Did you expect him to ask you to stay? The voice in her head asked, before amending the question and rephrasing it. Did you wanted him to ask you to stay?
你曾期待他开口挽留你吗？她内心深处的声音先是如此发问，随即又调整了措辞：你是不是希望他开口挽留你？

Asuka said nothing; she had no need.
明日香默不作声，她无需多言。

"It's too bad then…he's probably on his way to the docks to attempt a last ditch effort in making you change your mind." Von Scherbach said. "I have a report of a Limo driving him to the docks, but it appears that it's stuck in traffic."
真是可惜……他大概正赶往码头，打算做最后的尝试来说服你改变主意。"冯·舍尔巴赫说道。"我接到消息，一辆豪华轿车送他去码头，不过好像遇到了交通堵塞。

Asuka never raised her face, and Von Scherbach simply let out a grumble at that. "He is very much like his father, both good and bad."
明日香始终没有抬头，冯·谢尔巴赫对此仅是低声嘟囔。“他真是他父亲的翻版，优点缺点都如出一辙。”

"I know…" 我明白…

Asuka's faint voice echoed in the car, as Von Scherbach looked at her curiously, and nodded, allowing her to turn on the phone again, almost like a condemned person waiting for the call that will acquit them from death row.
明日香微弱的声音在车内回荡，冯·谢尔巴赫好奇地打量着她，点头同意她再次开启手机，那情景宛如死囚在期盼一通能赦免死刑的电话。

It was also something I wanted to see for myself…
这也是我渴望亲眼目睹的…

Long after she had been told she was going back, long after she had realized that whatever she had hoped to do to prevent it was not going to be able to stop it, long after she had let the anger and frustration flow away once she had understood there was no way to win, Asuka had made up her mind.
在被告知即将返回很久之后，当她意识到无论怎样努力都无法阻止这一结果时，当她明白胜算全无而让愤怒与挫败感随之消散时，明日香已下定决心。

She had decided that, when the moment would come for her to leave, she would have to see something for herself.
她已下定决心，一旦离别时刻来临，她必须亲眼见证。

She would have to make sure that Shinji Ikari was not coming. That was the only way she would be able to leave, because if he ended up coming, if he ended up being in front of the boat, if he somehow had managed to arrive to the docks on time before she had boarded and was safely tuck away in her cot, crying and sobbing until silent and dreamless sleep could claimed her, she would then wake up and realize she was sailing back to Das Vaterland.(3)
她必须确保碇真嗣不会出现。这是她能离开的唯一条件，因为一旦他真的来到，一旦他出现在船前，一旦他设法及时赶到码头，在她安全地躲进铺位，哭泣至无声无息地沉入无梦的睡眠之前，她就会醒来，意识到自己正返回德意志祖国。(3)

But if he showed up, she would get mad.
他若现身，她定会发怒。

She would get really mad.
她会变得非常生气。

She would probably stare him down and sneer, maybe slap and curse him, asking him at the top of her lungs why was he being such a pigheaded fool, such a stubborn idiot…such a stupid, perverted whinny spineless wimp who was always good at getting under her skin, of rubbing her the wrong way.
她多半会狠狠地瞪着他，冷笑一声，甚至可能给他一巴掌，扯着嗓子质问他为何如此顽固愚蠢，如此固执己见……如此一个愚蠢、变态、爱抱怨、没骨气的懦夫，总是能轻易激怒她，总是让她感到不快。

Why was he the only one brave or stupid enough to still care and look after her, even after she drove him down, after she ridiculed him, even after all the harsh words she had said, why was he still around, with her.
为什么他是唯一一个勇敢或愚蠢到仍然关心并照顾她的人，即便她让他失望，嘲笑他，即便她说了那么多尖刻的话，他为何依旧留在她身边。

She would make a show of saying that she hated him, always had, and always will.
她总是装出一副讨厌他的样子，声称自己一直讨厌他，将来也永远不会改变。

Because Asuka Langley Soryu, Second Children, and designated Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 had no other choice but to act that way.
由于明日香·兰格雷，作为第二适格者及 EVA 二号机的指定驾驶员，她别无选择，只能采取那种行动。

She had no other option.
她别无选择。

Because in all truth…in all honesty, she couldn't face him, she was never able to see him with those big, blue eyes, full of sadness and fear, and melancholy and despair.
说实话，她真的无法面对他，无法直视他那双深蓝的大眼睛，里面满是悲伤、恐惧、忧郁和绝望。

She could never do it, she never could. For a simple reason.
她永远做不到，这是有简单原因的。

In all truth…in all honesty, she really loved him.
说实在的…坦率地说，她确实深爱着他。

The little girl inside of her, the Asuka Langley Soryu that he loved for being simply Asuka Langley Soryu and no one else would then want to go with him; to take hold of his hand and never let go just like she did when she felt the pressure and regret and terror of the all to real possibility of loosing him for ever, and seeing him everyday hand in hand with someone else just hurt so much, physically and emotionally that she grabbed his hand and fell into him and never let go ever since.
她心中的那个小女孩，他所爱的明日香·兰格雷，那个纯粹作为明日香·兰格雷存在的她，那时愿意与他携手同行；她紧握他的手，誓言永不分离，正如她曾因害怕永远失去他而感受到的压迫、悔恨与恐惧，每天目睹他与他人携手，那种痛苦深入骨髓，她紧紧抓住他的手，依偎在他怀里，自那以后便再也不曾放手。

General Klaus Von Scherbach hated that frail scared, crying child who ended up relying on Shinji, because it served as a reminder of the person who used to be her, and even thought nothing was left save for some few pieces and remnants he felt like inside of this Asuka was the pilot who had been the joy and pride of both NERV-3 and the Langley household.
克劳斯·冯·谢尔巴赫将军对那个脆弱、恐惧、哭泣的孩子深恶痛绝，她最终依赖了真嗣。这孩子让他想起了曾经的自己，尽管除了一些零星的碎片和残余外，似乎已无他物，但他内心深处仍感觉到，这个明日香体内，依旧是那个曾让 NERV-3 和兰利家族引以为傲和喜悦的驾驶员。

He couldn't let Asuka be with the one she loved.
他无法允许明日香与她心爱的人相守。

And Shinji…Shinji could never bare to let the Asuka he held inside of him slip and fade away...
而真嗣……他绝不愿让心中的明日香悄然离去，逐渐淡出记忆……

Those three sides combined were the final pieces left that proved that she existed...
这三个方面的结合，正是证明她存在的最后关键证据...

The final wall that had never been torn down was the pride of the Asuka Langley Soryu that loved Shinji Ikari
那堵始终屹立不倒的墙，是深爱着碇真嗣的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的骄傲所在

"Pilot Soryu…Let's go..."
飞行员 Soryu…走吧…

Shinji Ikari never made it on time.
碇真嗣总是迟到。

He had arrived only to see the ship already a distant point in the horizon.
他抵达之际，那艘船已化作地平线上的一个渺小点影。

The drive back to the city was silent and awkward, neither Rei, nor Shinji daring to say a word.
返回城市的路上，Rei 和 Shinji 都沉默不语，气氛尴尬。

Rei leaned forward and tapped lightly on the window pane, waiting for it to roll down to reveal the driver.
零俯身向前，轻叩车窗，期待它缓缓下降，露出驾驶座上的人。

"After you drop me off at NERV for a synch test, you can then drive pilot Ikari home."
把我送到 NERV 进行同步测试后，你就可以开车送碇飞行员回家了。

The driver looked at her through the mirror before nodding, not saying another word. The brown haired boy still looking at the floor with his hands on his knees and his phone in his grasp.
司机通过后视镜瞥了她一眼，随即点头示意，不再言语。那棕发少年依旧低头凝视着地板，双手搭在膝上，手机紧握在手中。

"Was it worth it?" Shinji asked softly as the limo pulled over at NERV. Rei simply looked at him with a neutral face, before she exited the car.
"这么做值得吗？" 碇真嗣轻声问道，豪华轿车缓缓停在 NERV 总部前。绫波丽面无表情地瞥了他一眼，随即下车离去。

"Perhaps it would be best if you were to stay here at NERV…I have read that after something like this, humans tend to find solace with their acquaintances and friends…perhaps we can get together with Suzuhara, Horaki and Nagisa…" She spoke the last name softly, a red tinge on her cheeks, while Shinji simply kept looking at the floor.
"或许你最好留在 NERV 这里……我了解到，经历这类事件后，人们往往会在熟人和朋友中寻求安慰……或许我们可以和铃原、洞木还有渚一起聚一聚……" 她轻声念出渚的名字，脸颊微微泛红，而真嗣依旧低头看着地板。

"Yeah, sure…" 当然，没问题…

So without really caring, simply letting himself be carried through the motions of it all, Shinji allowed Rei to grab his hand and dragged him to the lounge.
就这样，他并未多加思索，任由绫波牵着他的手，一路被带到了休息室。

Shinji stared aimlessly at the wall, wondering how long it would be until Rei finished the synch exercise and they could leave…he had tried walking around the endless corridors, but ended up at Misato's office door, and then at Kaji's, and despite how much he wanted to barge in and talk to them, to at least let the pulsating bile inside him festering see the light and let it wash away from him, he knew better.
真嗣无目的地凝视着墙壁，心中盘算着绫波完成同步训练还需多久，他们才能离开。他曾在走廊里漫无目的地走动，却不知不觉走到了美里和加持的办公室前。虽然他很想闯进去与他们交谈，让内心积压的苦闷得以宣泄，但他明白这不是明智之举。

Kaji and Misato were right now on a cruise on their way to their honey moon; someplace warm and tropical, where they would serve little fruity drinks in coconuts and pineapples with little straw umbrellas, where Misato would turns some heads prancing around in one of those revealing bikinis of her while Kaji would simply smile at her, holding her hand and staring into her eyes.
加治和美里正乘游轮前往温暖的热带蜜月地；那里有装在椰子和菠萝中的精致水果饮料，搭配小巧的吸管伞。美里穿着她那件性感的比基尼，定会引人注目，而加治则微笑着紧握她的手，深情凝望。

And now Shinji was getting depressed…
如今，真嗣的心情逐渐变得低落……

He walked around the lockers, and he could still hear Asuka's voice, and he could still smell her body wash and shampoo; sweet smelling, something that smelled and felt delicate for a girl who outside was a warrior born and bred.
他在更衣室周围踱步，耳边依旧回响着明日香的声音，鼻尖萦绕着她沐浴露和洗发水的香气；那是一种甜美而细腻的味道，与她外在的战士形象截然不同。

He decided staying in the locker with memories of her wasn't going to help him, so he turned away again.
他意识到，沉浸在与她有关的回忆中并不能帮助自己，因此他再次转身离去。

Finally, getting sick of staring at the same window overlooking the Geofront, Shinji began to walk away and reached one of the elevators. Without thinking about it, he got in and decided to ride it to wherever it may go, stopping immediately on the floor underneath.
终于，真嗣对一直盯着窗外那片 Geofront 的景色感到厌倦，他开始离开，并走到了一部电梯前。未经多想，他便踏入电梯，任其随意带他前往任何楼层，电梯随即停在了下一层。

A couple of techs got in, no names who were bustling around, sweat lining their forehead as f they had either just jogged all the way from one end of the floor to the other, or had been chewed off by someone.
几位技术人员匆匆进入，虽未提及姓名，却见他们忙碌穿梭，额头汗水涔涔，似乎刚从楼层一头疾跑到另一头，或是刚受了某人的责备。

Shinji decided to not pay attention, focusing instead on the soft clicking mundane sound of the elevator signaling the floor they were headed for.
真嗣决定不去理会，转而专注于电梯那单调的咔嗒声，这声音提示着他们即将到达的楼层。

"Do I really have to do this?" Asuka asked herself softly in a petulant way as she looked at the small enclosed space.
"我真的非得这么做不可吗？" 明日香带着些许怨气，轻声自语，目光投向那狭小的空间。

"Pilot Soryu, we're ready."
Soryu 飞行员，我们已准备就绪。

Silently Asuka nodded and got in, the metal door clicking shut.
阿苏卡默默点头，随即上车，金属门随之咔哒关闭。

Shinji stepped out of the elevator with the techs, and wandered around the outer stations of the cages; the entrance to the personnel elevator for the Pribnow box was a few meters down the cages, and to his other side was the entrance…he knew Rei would be currently inside doing the synch test and decided to simply walk around, letting his steps take him back to the elevator.
真嗣和几位技术人员一同走出电梯，在笼子外围的站点间闲逛；人员电梯通往普里布诺盒的入口就在几米开外，另一侧则是另一个入口……他清楚绫波此刻正在里面进行同步测试，便决定随意走走，让脚步自然地引领他回到电梯处。

A simple ding made it stop again on the floor just below, and Shinji sighed, not lifting his head to see who it was.
一声简单的叮响，使它再次停在下方地板上，真嗣叹了口气，并未抬头看是谁。

A pair of black shoes came into view, standing in front of his sight, almost expecting something.
一双黑色鞋子出现在眼前，静静地立在那里，似乎在等待着什么。

Shinji stepped back to allow more space, slumping against a wall, noting the figure turned around and faced the door.
真嗣退后一步，倚墙而立，腾出空间，同时观察到那人转过身，正对着门。

"You should have fought for what you wanted."
你本应为你想要的东西去争取。

Shinji blinked and looked up, noticing his father was staring at a PDA like object in his hands.
真嗣眨了眨眼，抬头发现父亲正凝视着手中的一个类似 PDA 的设备。

"I know." 我明白。

"Where you at least able to tell her goodbye?"
你至少有机会跟她道别吗？

Shinji shook his head silently.
真嗣无声地摇了摇头。

"Would you do it if you had another chance?"
若再给你一次机会，你会去做吗？

"Yes." 是的。

Gendo turned around, mildly surprised; he hadn't even finished asking the question when Shinji had instantly answered, and though he had never looked up, he could sense the steely resolve in his voice.
源渡转过身来，略显惊讶；他话音未落，真嗣便已迅速作答，虽未抬头，但那声音中透露出的坚定决心却清晰可感。

Behind his glasses, his eyebrow arched and he smiled a secret smile at that.
透过眼镜，他眉毛一挑，对着那件事神秘地笑了笑。

Maybe the boy was not a weak-willed namby-pamby as he thought.
可能这个男孩并不像他自以为的那样缺乏意志、软弱无能。

He had to make sure, though.
但他还是得确认一下。

"And what would you say?"
那么，你又会怎么说呢？

Shinji thought long and hard at this, before choosing the simplest answer he had.
真嗣经过一番深思熟虑，最终选择了他手头最简单的答案。

"I would tell her not to go away."
我会劝她别走。

She thought about the irony of it all, about the situations faced, and how they always seemed to escalate; how it seemed to be always games they seemed to play never saying openly all that they felt.
她深思这其中的讽刺，所遭遇的种种局面，以及它们似乎总在不断加剧；他们仿佛一直在玩着某种游戏，却从不坦率表达内心的感受。

She chuckled bitterly how someone with all of her education could never find the words to say, how insults always seemed to be that the only things she knew how to say, how the only feelings she could show were the ones that were wrong.
她苦笑一声，感慨自己虽受过良好教育，却总找不到恰当的言辞，仿佛只会用尖刻的话语来表达，能流露的情感总是偏离正轨。

How it always seemed like the only constant in their relationship, form start to bitter end were games, changes and fears; how most of the times it felt like they were pushing her down, keeping her back and making her stop.
仿佛在他们关系的全程中，从始至终，游戏、变迁与恐惧始终如一；多数时候，这些感受如同重压，使她难以前行，迫使她停下脚步。

How she had choked whenever she wanted to say goodbye, how she felt like she would stumble and fall when she had to walk away from him last night.
每当她想说再见时，总是哽咽难言，昨晚不得不从他身边离开时，她感觉自己几乎要跌倒。

How it became the more apparent, all the more clear that, whenever he wasn't with her, her whole world seemed to crumble and fade away.
愈发明显的是，每当他不在她身边，她的世界仿佛就会崩塌，逐渐消逝。

"Pilot. We are ready to leave."
飞行员，我们已准备好，可以出发了。

Asuka sighed and nodded, and heard the metallic click once again, seeing the light as the entry plug opened. She stepped down and saw Rei getting out of her own entry plug, walking her way.
明日香轻叹一声，点头示意，随即再次听到金属的咔哒声，随着插入栓的开启，光线透了进来。她迈步下来，只见绫波也从自己的插入栓中走出，正朝她这边走来。

"Are you leaving now?" 你现在要走了吗？

"Yes." Asuka said softly. "We only stopped to check unit 02 on the boat. The General and I were originally going to leave with it, but this thing-"
是的。" 明日香轻声说，"我们停下只是为了检查船上的二号机。将军和我本来是要带着它走的，但这个东西——

"Losing all the synch data from the past 6 months and not having a backup was a regrettable mistake from the engineering department. I am sure Commander Ikari had acted accordingly."
过去六个月的所有同步数据丢失且未备份，这是工程部门的一大遗憾。相信伊卡洛斯指挥官已做出相应应对。

"Oh..." Asuka said softly. "So it was the Commander the one who called General Von Scherbach to let him know?"
哦……" 明日香低声说，"是指挥官通知了冯·谢尔巴克将军吗？

"That is correct, it was a good thing too." Rei answered as both made their way towards the locker rooms. "I was already on my way somewhere else and would have been unable to come here to act as the control cross syncrhonization graph procedure."
确实如此，幸好如此。" 丽边走边答，两人正前往更衣室。"我原本正赶往别处，若非如此，便无法来此执行控制交叉同步图程序了。

"Yeah…I guess…" Asuka said as she walked to grab her duffel bag with her clothes. "I'm just glad I'm able to at least take a shower, I would hate to make the flight to Germany smelling of LCL."
嗯…我想也是…" 明日香说着，走向装有衣物的行李袋。"能洗个澡真是太好了，我可不想带着 LCL 的气味飞往德国。

She quipped, but her voice broke at the last part and Rei felt as the volatile girl, the fierce fighter leaned against her, placing her head on her shoulder…
她虽俏皮地开口，声音却在尾声中哽咽，Rei 感受到那个情绪多变的女孩，那位勇猛的战士，正倚靠着她，将头轻轻搁在她的肩上……

And cried. 大声呼喊。

"Tell Shinji I'll miss him."
跟真嗣说一声，我会想他的。

Rei simply patted her back standing in front of the elevator door and waiting for the car to arrive.
丽只是轻轻拍了拍她的背，站在电梯门前，静候电梯抵达。

"Why are we stopping here?"
我们为什么要在这里停下？

"I have something to do here." the Commander said dryly.
"我在这儿有事要处理。"指挥官冷冷地说。

"Oh…"

Gendo turned to Shinji and clasped his shoulders with his gloved hands, making the brown haired boy look up to him, startled at the sudden, unfamiliar contact. Gendo paused for a second, and his mouth opened, without emitting a sound, almost as if he wanted to say something but was unsure of what.
源渡转向真嗣，双手戴着手套紧握他的肩膀，令棕发少年惊讶地抬头望向他，对这突如其来的陌生触碰感到错愕。源渡顿了顿，嘴巴微张却未出声，似乎想说些什么，却又犹豫不决。

And then, without saying another word, Gendo simply pushed the boy out of the car. Shinji turned around, looking at his father's smirking face as the doors of the elevator closed.
随后，源渡一言不发，径直将少年推出了车外。真嗣回过头，目睹电梯门合上时父亲脸上那抹嘲讽的微笑。

The smirk never left his face.
他脸上始终挂着一抹坏笑。

Shinji got up and dusted himself off, patting his knees and legs.
真嗣起身，拍去膝盖和腿上的尘土。

"Jerk." he muttered before turning around...
他低声骂了句：“混蛋。”随即转身离去……

And coming face to face with Asuka Langley Soryu.
与惣流·明日香·兰格雷直面相对。

"Shinji…" 真嗣……

Rei slid quietly away from the wide eyed Asuka.
丽静悄悄地从睁大双眼的明日香身旁溜开。

"Asuka…" 阿苏卡…

And walked down the hall, passing a still on the floor Shinji, entering the elevaton and standing next to a still smirking Gendo.
他穿过大厅，途中经过躺在地上的真嗣，进入电梯后，站在一旁依旧面带冷笑的源堂身边。

The metal door slowly closed.
金属门慢慢地关上了。

The last thing she saw was as Shinji jumped from the floor towards her and lifted Asuka from the floor in a warm embrace, while Asuka held onto his neck, almost as if she wanted to be tattooed onto him forever.
她最后所见，是真嗣从地面跃起，向她奔来，温柔地将明日香抱起。明日香紧搂他的颈项，宛如渴望永远与他融为一体。

As both rode the elevator in silence, Gendo turned to Rei, looking down at her with a soft smile on his face. The blue haired girl stood in front of the elevator staring down the crystal panel as Asuka and Shinji kept hanging onto each other for real life.
两人在电梯里默默无语，源渡转向绫波，脸上挂着柔和的微笑。蓝发少女站在电梯前，目光凝视着水晶面板，而明日香和真嗣则紧紧相依，仿佛在现实中彼此寻求支撑。

She suddenly let go and was apparently speaking to him in quick urgent sentences, while Shinji grabbed her upper arms with his hands. It was still apparent they were trying to say goodbye, yet at the same time looking for one last way to stay together.
她突然松开手，急促地对他说着什么，而真嗣则紧握她的双臂。他们虽在告别，却仍试图找到最后一丝相守的可能。

Every time Shinji's head would move, and thus show he was saying something, Asuka would nod, before shaking her head, empathically answering back, hand in chest, trying to make her point be clearer still.
每当真嗣的头一动，示意他在说话，明日香便先点头，随即摇头，手抚胸前，强烈回应，力求让她的观点更加明了。

The choice was hers and only hers.
选择权完全掌握在她手中。

Suddenly, Shinji's stance went rigid, making Asuka turn around.
突然，真嗣的身体僵直，让明日香不由得转过身来。

Behind her was the imposing figure of General Klaus Von Scherbach, head of the SELEE committee for the UN. He was just standing there, but his frame seemed like it was a compact explosion waiting to happen, like he had a bad case of internal combustion.
她身后站着的是联合国 SELEE 委员会的负责人，克劳斯·冯·谢尔巴赫将军，他的身姿威严，仿佛体内蕴藏着随时可能爆发的巨大能量。

He said something, soft and sharp and leaving no space for doubt. Asuka slowly, reluctantly let go of Shinji's hand and walked towards him.
他轻声而尖锐地说了些什么，让人无法怀疑。明日香缓缓地、带着几分不舍地松开了真嗣的手，朝他走去。

That was the last thing Rei saw before the steel tunnel of the elevator shaft swallowed the car whole.
那是 Rei 在电梯轿厢被电梯井的钢铁隧道完全吞噬前所见的最后一景。

Both Rei and Gendo were more than used to walking around and riding the elevators of NERV in silence, with only the rhythmic ticking of the floor.
丽和元渡对在 NERV 内默默行走和搭乘电梯已习以为常，唯有地板的规律滴答声打破寂静。

But right now, it seemed heavy and suffocating, claustrophobic and Rei felt the need to ask something just to make this oppressive feeling of pressure go away.
此刻，它显得沉重压抑，令人感到窒息和幽闭，Rei 觉得必须说点什么，以缓解这种沉重的压迫感。

"What do you think she'll do, Commander?"
指挥官，您认为她会采取什么行动？

Rei had kept quiet the whole way, never asking a question during the elevator ride, nor when they had exited and she had followed him to the office. She had sat in complete and total silence, the only sound the scribbling of the commander's pen as it scratched against the paper.
丽一路沉默不语，电梯里未发一问，出了电梯后，她默默跟随他走进办公室。她静坐一旁，唯有指挥官笔尖划过纸面的沙沙声打破寂静。

Gendo looked at the girl, while he kept reviewing papers, sitting in his desk on his cavernous office. He did, as every other day, the menial task of reviewing reports and signing them, as well as miscellaneous forms and orders, while others were sent back with annotations and questions, demanding an explanation or two.
源渡坐在他那宽敞办公室的办公桌前，一边审视着女孩，一边审阅文件。他日复一日地重复着这些琐碎的工作：审阅报告、签字，处理各类杂项表格和指令。对于某些文件，他会退回并附上批注和问题，要求对方给出解释。

The commander looked straight ahead; brows were knitted together for but a second, deep in thought, before he finally spoke.
指挥官直视前方，眉头微蹙片刻，深思之后方才发言。

"There is an old saying used by the forefathers of scientists: To obtain, something of equal value must be lost."
古人云，科学家先贤们常言：欲得之，必先失之。

"Elric's First Law of Equivalent Exchange. Later adapted to the First Law of Thermodynamics, as well as the principle of the conservation of energy."
埃尔里克的等价交换第一定律，后来被改编为热力学第一定律，并体现了能量守恒的原则。

Gendo nodded grimly. "There comes a time in each and everyone of us when we must choose our own path, however that choice is a hard one; we must let go of something dear to gain a benefit."
源渡神情严肃地点了点头。“我们每个人都会面临一个抉择时刻，必须选择自己的道路，尽管这个决定颇为艰难；为了获得某种利益，我们不得不舍弃一些珍贵之物。”

He turned back to his desk, and as he kept talking, the rigid lines in the commander's face began to become slowly become softer, little by little, almost unnoticeable…a small metamorphosis in his face.
他转身回到办公桌，边说边聊，指挥官脸上的僵硬线条逐渐变得柔和，一点一滴，几乎难以察觉……他的面容悄然经历了一次微妙的转变。

"The world isn't perfect, and the law is incomplete." Gendo paused, recollecting his thoughts before continuing. "There's an ebb, a flow; a cycle."
世界并非完美无缺，法律亦有其不完备之处。" 源渡稍作停顿，整理思绪后接着说，"世间万物，皆有涨落，循环不息。

Gendo turned to Rei, and she looked up to him like a student would to a mentor, a daughter to a father, expecting his explanation.
源渡转向绫波，她仰望着他，如同学生对导师、女儿对父亲般的期待，等待着他的解释。

"Equivalent Exchange does not encompass everything that happens in life, but I still believe in its principle that all things do come at a price."
等价交换虽不能涵盖生活中的一切，但我仍坚信这一原则：凡事皆有代价。

Rei nodded at that, satisfied with then answer he had given her, because somehow, it seemed to fit him, it seemed to be this belief what had molded him from Gendo Rokobungi into Gendo Ikari, Supreme Commander of NERV
丽对此点头表示认同，她对给出的回答感到满意，因为这似乎恰如其分地描绘了他，正是这种信念将他从源堂元治塑造成了 NERV 的最高指挥官——源堂司令

But still something bothered her.
但她心里还是有些烦扰。

"Is it worth it?" She asked after a minute or two.
"这值得吗？"她过了一两分钟问道。

The commander looked at the girl, then at his desk.
指挥官先看了看女孩，随后目光转向了自己的办公桌。

Without saying a word, he opened one of the drawers, and looked at the contents.
他默默地拉开一个抽屉，审视着里面的物品。

Inside was a modified picture frame holding four pictures.
内部是一个改装过的相框，里面摆放着四幅照片。

The first one was that of the pilots; a candid shot, with Asuka on top of a smiling Shinji and Rei, bringing them together in an awkward group hug.
第一个镜头是飞行员们的；一张自然的抓拍，阿苏卡位于上方，面带微笑的真嗣和零，三人因尴尬的集体拥抱而聚在一起。

The second one was of a 2 year old Shinji in the loving embrace of Yui Ikari, looking directly at the camera.
第二幅画面捕捉了两岁的真嗣在母亲碇唯的慈爱怀抱里，目光直直地望向镜头。

The third one was a black and white surveillance picture depicting the pilots for units 01 and 02 in a clandestine kiss in a small café outside of Tokyo -3.
第三张照片为黑白监控画面，捕捉到 01 与 02 单位的飞行员在东京郊外一家小咖啡馆内秘密亲吻的一幕。

The last one was an old family picture, similar to the one that had Yui and Shinji, only this time a half smiling- half smirking Gendo, a good deal younger, was looking straight at him, his eyes boring into the commander's own eyes.
最后一张是家族旧照，与之前有绫波和真嗣的那张类似，不同的是，这次年轻许多的源堂带着半笑半嘲的表情直视着他，目光锐利地穿透了指挥官的双眼。

He looked at Yui, and as a reflex his finger brushed over the picture, stopping faintly at the face of the woman he loved the most, softly rubbing against the crystal.
他凝视着结衣，本能地，手指轻抚过照片，在至爱女子的面容上稍作停留，温柔地摩挲着水晶。

He turned to look at the same face, with ice blue hair and blood red eyes staring at him, the very picture of childish innocence and questioning glance.
他回头一看，那张脸依旧，冰蓝发丝下血红的双眸凝视着他，纯真无邪中带着探询的目光。

"The pain we all went through will have a reward and anyone who's determined and perseveres will get something in return, even if it's not what they expected."
我们共同经历的苦难终将有所回报，任何坚定不移、持之以恒的人都将得到相应的回馈，即便那并非他们最初所期待的。

And while several feet below a chapter in the life of two pilots was coming to an end, and Rei would like to know what ending it would have, she felt content, and allowed herself the briefest of smiles.
在两位飞行员的生活篇章即将在下方几英尺处落幕之际，绫虽好奇结局如何，却感到心满意足，不禁露出了短暂的微笑。

She had done the best she could; she had given something for the chance of something else to become.
她已竭尽所能；为了某种可能性的实现，她已有所付出。

When the final signature was placed on the reports, Gendo looked down at Rei, and both smiled faintly at each other. 

"I seem to have worked up an appetite, Rei. Care to accompany me?" He asked stepping up as Rei did the same, walking around the desk and reaching the door. He held it open allowing the blue haired girl be the first one to exit.
"我好像已经饿了，Rei，要不要一起出去？" 他边说边跟上 Rei，绕过办公桌走到门前，为她打开门，让蓝发女孩先行。

"Yes." 是的。

"Excellent." Gendo smiled. "You can then tell me all about this Nagisa fellow over lunch."
太好了。" 源堂微笑着说，"那午餐时你再详细跟我说说这位渚君吧。

He walked past Rei ignoring her startled face and blushing cheeks. As he kept walking, the door began to slowly close by itself, before the office was thrown into darkness, the last light catching the reflection and bouncing off from the Red Queen sitting on his desk.
他径直走过丽，对她的惊愕表情和泛红的双颊视而不见。随着他的步伐，门缓缓自动关闭，办公室顿时一片漆黑，仅剩的一线光恰好照在桌上的红皇后棋子上，反射出微光。

So don't go away, say what you say…But say that you'll stay, forever and a day
所以请别离去，尽管说出你的心声……但请承诺你会留下，直到永远再多一天

In the time of my life, 'cause I need more time…Yes, I need more time, just to make things right…
在我有生之年，我需要更多时间……没错，我需要更多时间，只为把事情理顺……

AN:

This is a long one.
这是一句较长的内容。

Random Notes. 杂记。

(1) While it's never said where NERV-3 lies, it's commonly placed in Berlin. Magi -3 and Magi-5 are located, respectively in Berlin and Hamburg. I choose to place NERV-3 in Bremen, however, since it's a harbor city, which also has several high profile technology development firms, and would be a more logical choice to have Unit 02 be shipped to Japan from there.
(1) 尽管 NERV-3 的确切位置并未明说，但普遍认为它坐落于柏林。Magi-3 和 Magi-5 则分别位于柏林与汉堡。不过，我倾向于将 NERV-3 安置在不来梅，因其作为港口城市，汇聚了众多高端科技研发机构，从这里将二号机运至日本显得更为合乎逻辑。

(2)"Here's looking at you kid." famous last words by Rick Blaine to Ilsa Lund in " Casablanca".
(2)"就看你了，孩子。" 这是《卡萨布兰卡》中里克·布莱恩对伊尔莎·伦德说的那句脍炙人口的台词。

(3) It has been drawn to my attention a German national refers to their country as Fatherland; I hope the translation was the correct one.
(3) 有人向我指出，德国人称自己的国家为“祖国”；希望这个翻译是准确的。

Well, before you all begin to torch me and say things like plagiarism or anything…a couple of things…
嗯，在大家开始指责我抄袭之前，我想先说明几点……

This kiss is meant as homage for both Ryoma's "The Best Laid Plans 2" as well as for the first part of Re-Take After. If you feel that the characters are OOC; keep in mind this moves on the story line of BLP2; read it first to understand why a character behaves like he or she does; if you feel the scenes or dialogue are reminiscent or a direct rip from Re-Take…well…that's why it's a homage.
这个吻既是对《最佳计划 2》的致敬，也是对《Re-Take After》开篇的致敬。若你觉得角色行为偏离了原作，请先阅读《BLP2》，以便理解角色行为背后的缘由；若你察觉到场景或对话与《Re-Take》相似或直接引用，那正是致敬的体现。

Also, the ending is open ended for you to decide; I don't know if Asuka'll leave in BLP2, or how or what would Shinji do to convince her to stay…this is simply a spin-off of what would happen if she was forced to leave and Shinji never got around to actually asking her to stay.
另外，结局留有悬念，供你自由想象；我不清楚明日香是否会在 BLP2 中离去，也不了解真嗣会怎样或用什么方法挽留她……这仅是设想她被迫离开，而真嗣未能及时开口挽留的一种情节发展。

I know some of you are asking "Well, did she stay?"...well, the last question is a tough one to answer, and I sincerely believe there is only one way for them to be together under this scenario, I've tried hinting at it all throughout the story; Asuka is being forced to choose between her present as an Eva pilot, and a future with Shinji, staying in Eva means saying goodbye to someone she loves, but staying with Shinji means saying good-bye to Mama.
我明白你们中有人会问“她到底留下了吗？”...这个问题确实难以回答。我坚信，在这种情境下，他们要想在一起，只有一条路可走。我已在整个故事中不断暗示这一点：明日香必须在作为 Eva 驾驶员的现在和与真嗣共度的未来之间做出抉择。留在 Eva，意味着与心爱之人告别；而选择真嗣，则意味着与母亲说再见。

It is a tough call.
这真是个棘手的选择。

I therefore leave it to your imagination what she would choose, because no matter what ending I could come up with, it felt too contrived, and too fake, and like I was cheating the character out.
因此，我将其留给您的想象，她会选择什么，因为无论我构思出何种结局，都显得过于牵强，过于不真实，仿佛我在对这个角色不公。

This was one of those stories I've always wanted to do, but sincerely was afraid it would suck; not only because it's based heavily on a personal favorite like BLP2 and Re-Take, but it's also one of those that no matter how hard you try to polish it, it's just not as perfect as the original ones.
这故事我一直想写，但说实话，我怕它搞砸了；不仅因为它借鉴了我钟爱的 BLP2 和 Re-Take，更因为无论怎么精心雕琢，总觉得难以企及原作的完美。

显然，部分内容并非出自本人之手；因此，所有功劳归于 Gainax、Studio Kimigabuchi、Nergal 重工业旗下的 Nergal Fan Fiction LLC、华纳兄弟以及电影《卡萨布兰卡》，后者为 Kaji 的德语告别词提供了灵感，还有 Square Enix 与 Studio Bones，他们提出了“爱德华的等价交换第一定律”，这明显是在推广《钢之炼金术师》，以及匿名的 Spore，他为《Re-Take》系列提供了翻译。

Thanks must immediately go to all those involved in this story:
首先要感谢的是所有参与这个故事的人：

Himonky: without whose assistance I would be still treading through mud to get to a decent story.
希蒙基：若非他的协助，我或许仍在泥泞中艰难前行，只为寻得一个精彩的故事。

Fresh C: whose cynicism made me realize I really had to take this on a different way, even when he told me "Silly author…this is where Re-Take would say this and this"
新鲜的 C：他的讥讽让我明白，我得换个角度来应对这件事，尽管他曾提醒我：“傻作者啊……这里 Re-Take 会这么说，那么说。”

JW, my own Sage…I can't begin to thank you for your assistance, especially with the reason for Asuka to go back part…you're right; she's no Heidi.
JW，我的智者…对于您的帮助，我感激不尽，尤其是关于让明日香回去的原因那部分…您说得对；她并非海蒂。

Ryoma: for allowing a crappy author like me to take a decent story and turn it into crap (ever heard of the Midas touch? This is the exact opposite)
龙马：感谢像我这样不入流的作者，竟能把一个原本还不错的故事糟蹋成这样（听说过迈达斯之触吗？这完全是个反例）

Hououza: For being a rockin' mate, whose opinion and friendship will always be looked upon, even if you never actually got around it, the simple matter was that you accepted my pestering to pre-read means a lot for me.

Last but certainly not least to any and all who took the time to read it, regardless of if you liked it or not, just the fact that you decided to grant me a hit is thanks enough; if you want to do a full favor and want to grant me a Review as well, go ahead.

### Chapter 10 Themes: K#14 (Radio-cassette player), W#05 (Books)
主题：K#14（收音磁带一体机），W#05（图书）

Title: The End of an Eros.
标题：爱洛斯的落幕。

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: If you somehow recognize anything here, they're not mine. I'm attempting to get out of this writers block, so I'm gonna take 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story. Hope you like. I'll update with another one ch— wait… I've said that for ten straight times with this.
A.N.: 我在此处为自己辩解：若你从中察觉到任何熟悉之处，那绝非我所为。我正努力突破写作瓶颈，故决定同时挑战“30 个吻”与“30 种方式”于同一故事中。愿你欣赏。我将更新下一章——等等……这话我已重复十遍了。

Well, you know the drill.
嗯，你懂的，按常规来吧。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

It was in the quiet of the night that Shinji began his little ritual.
夜深人静之际，真嗣开始了他的小小仪式。

He got up from his bed, which was nothing more than a glorified futon on the floor, and went towards the door that lead up to the attic. The wood creaked softly as he opened the door, and the sweet smell of scented burnt wax assaulted his senses.
他从地上的豪华蒲团床上坐起，走向通往阁楼的门。开门时，木门轻声作响，一股香甜的蜡烛烧焦味迎面袭来。

He threaded softly through the "room", nearing the opened window that overlooked the city to his right, before he looked across to her office and smiled, remembering that the time was coming and that soon he would have to go for his last mandatory sessions.
他轻柔地穿行于“房间”中，靠近右侧那扇俯瞰城市的敞开窗户，随即目光转向她的办公室，面露微笑，心中记挂着那个时刻即将来临，不久后他得去参加最后一次强制性的会谈。

But tonight he felt that familiar tingle he always felt just when it was about to happen; it had been close to a month, and he was still unsure any of them had been accepted. The night was calm, not a single gust of wind was blowing which signified he had to begin.
然而今晚，他再次感受到那种熟悉的刺痛，每当事情即将发生时他总会如此；已经过去近一个月，他仍不确定任何一项是否已被接纳。夜色宁静，无风无息，这预示着他必须行动了。

Now was the moment he always feared.
此刻正是他一直所畏惧的。

He had to see. 他不得不去看。

He had to know if they had been accepted.
他得弄清楚他们是否已被接纳。

A faint light illuminated the small altar he had and across and below, above and on the sides, a multitude of small candles laid and most of them, save for two, had long been snuffed as the wax pooling to varying degrees on the tables and counters where they were could attest.
一缕微光映照着他面前的小祭坛，四周上下，众多小蜡烛静静摆放，除了两根外，其余的早已熄灭，蜡油在桌台和柜面上积聚成不同程度的池塘，见证了它们的消逝。

He disrobed, the pale moonlight seeping in, the silvery white bouncing off from his hair as he picked up and held two bottles of liquid high against the pale light before he began mixing them in a small shallow bowl. He placed the offering of wine and sake mixed with other things down, dipping his finger in the mixture, drawing thin lines with his fingers across his cheeks and forehead.
他褪去衣衫，苍白的月光悄然洒入，银辉在他发间跳跃。他举起两瓶液体，迎着微光，随后在小碗中将它们调和。放下这掺杂了葡萄酒、清酒及其他成分的祭品，他蘸取混合液，用指尖在脸颊与额头上勾勒出细线。

The liquid began to slowly roll down his skin, feeling like blood seeping from a cut, thick and viscous and coagulated before he began to utter a quick prayer, the same prayer he had recited ninety-seven other times, eyes closed and lips moving silently against the night. He kept repeating the lines over and over: a soft plea, a silent shout, an emotionless scream echoing without sound against the vastness of the night.
液体缓缓滑过他的肌肤，宛如伤口渗出的血，浓稠而凝滞。他闭上双眼，嘴唇在夜幕下无声地翕动，重复着那段已念过九十七次的祈祷。他一遍遍地念诵：轻柔的祈求，无声的呼喊，情感空白的尖叫，在夜的广袤中悄然回荡。

He opened his eyes and saw one of the candles flicker, before it was snuffed.
他睁开双眼，只见一支蜡烛忽闪了一下，便熄灭了。

He got up and walked back to his room, kneeling next to where his things lay strewn around on the floor, pawning in the darkness for his wallet, and when he found it, he closed his eyes, anticipation bottling in his throat before he took out a small, worn out but carefully folded patch of paper.
他站起来，走回自己的房间，跪在地板上散落的物品旁边，在黑暗中摸索着寻找钱包。找到后，他闭上双眼，一股期待感涌上喉头，然后他小心翼翼地展开一张虽已磨损但保存得很好的小纸片。

With trembling fingers he began to unfold it, and then, right before his eyes, the number "98" written on it began to shimmer, to shift and become absorbed before it began to reform in the middle, becoming a "99" only his eyes could see.
他颤抖着手指展开那张纸，眼前数字“98”开始闪烁，逐渐模糊并被吸收，随后在中央重新凝聚成只有他能看见的“99”。

It was only then that a smile appeared in his lips.
正是那时，他的嘴角才浮现出微笑。

Ninety-nine. 九十九。

Just one more before Hyaku…
百之前，再添一个…

Hyaku… 一百…

He repeated the word several times, rolling it in his tongue, feeling the way the back of his throat stuck to the roof of his mouth to make the first syllable, while his breath stuck to his teeth to say the last part
他反复咀嚼这个词，舌头在口腔中翻滚，体会着喉咙后部与上颚相贴形成首音节的感觉，同时气息轻触牙齿，发出尾音

One more… just one more and he would be free, free of this mortal coil, free of this world.
再一个…只需再一个，他就能挣脱这尘世的枷锁，自由地离开这个世界。

Just one more before he could collect his prize.
再完成一个任务，他就可以领取他的奖品了。

"So, now you'll die." 那么，你即将死去。

She stared down the barrel of the gun, trying not to show any fear.
她直视着枪口，竭力掩饰内心的恐惧。

It wasn't working. 它无法正常运作。

The gunshot never sounded like a bang; it never sounded like any of the onomatopoeia she had read anywhere. It sounded deafening, like a loud thunder clap; expanding relentlessly within the confines of Kaname's ears and head, echoing against her body and she clutched her chest, so sure of feeling the numbness and the pain associated with getting hit by a bullet there, before she opened her eyes and saw Sousuke in front of her.
那枪声并不像她曾在任何地方读到的拟声词那样，它震耳欲聋，如同雷鸣在 Kaname 的耳际和脑海中轰鸣，不断回荡，冲击着她的身体。她紧捂胸口，确信自己即将感受到被子弹击中的麻木与痛楚，直到她睁开眼，看见 Sousuke 站在面前。

And Leonard falling against the ground.
伦纳德倒地。

"S—" She began to whisper, before she noticed it.
"S—" 她刚要低声说话，突然察觉到了。

He was falling as well.
他也正在坠落。

Slowly he was falling and she suddenly realized what it was that people meant by when they said "legs wouldn't hold anymore."
他渐渐倒下，她这才恍然大悟，人们常说的“双腿无力支撑”究竟是何感受。

He simply slumped against the wall, feeling as his knees buckled underneath his weight, sinking into the floor ever so slowly, as a dark streak was left against the bricks of the wall.
他颓然倚墙，双膝因体重而弯曲，缓缓下沉，墙砖上留下一道暗淡的痕迹。

It was raining. 当时正在下雨。

Actually, it was pouring. It was almost as if the sky themselves were crying their heart out. Wave after wave of rain, drenching them both, making their clothes stick to their body and intermixing with the tears in her eyes.
实际上，那时正下着倾盆大雨，仿佛天空都在痛哭。雨水一波接一波，将两人淋得透湿，衣服紧贴身体，与她眼中的泪水交织在一起。

Through his hazy vision, he saw as she ran towards him, still dressed in her high school uniform, not caring if the whiteness of her shirt got smeared by his—
透过他模糊的视线，他看到她穿着高中校服向他奔来，全然不顾白衬衫是否会被他的——

"You idiot, what do you think you're doing?"
你这个笨蛋，你到底在干什么？

He turned to look at her, and he wondered again how someone so small could look so imposing with her hands on her hips, and looking at him with so much anger.
他转过身来，目光落在她身上，心中再次涌起疑惑：她身材如此娇小，双手叉腰，怒气冲冲地盯着他，却显得格外威风凛凛。

And he never feared for his life.
他从未担心过自己的生命安全。

"I-it's not like th—" 我-我并不是那—

"Shut up." She said softly, but with enough command to make the body guard instantly close his mouth.
"别说话。"她轻声但坚定地说，保镖随即闭口不言。

He tried to say something, but instead, his body was wrecked by his coughing, making him spit out blood from his mouth, mixing with the immaculate white shirt he was wearing, also wet with the water form the rain and the blood oozing from his chest.
他本想开口，却被一阵剧烈的咳嗽打断，鲜血从口中喷出，染红了原本洁白的衬衫，衬衫上还混杂着雨水和胸口渗出的血迹，湿漉漉的。

"You are an idiot." 你真蠢。

He looked at her with one eye half closed, still slumped against the wall. The harshness in her voice, the hardness in her chocolate colored eyes melted away as tears began to well, though he could be mistaken since it was raining and he was feeling like he was slipping into unconsciousness with every passing moment he was here.
他半闭着一只眼凝视着她，身体依旧无力地倚在墙上。她声音里的严厉，她那深棕色眼眸中的冷硬，随着泪水的涌现而逐渐软化，虽然他可能看错了，毕竟外面正下着雨，而他感到自己每分每秒都在滑向昏迷的边缘。

"Why did you have to do it? Why?"
你为何非要这么做呢？究竟是为什么？

"You shouldn't have done that… you shouldn't—" Kaname kept saying as her small, lithe body began breaking into tiny sobs.
"你本不该那么做…你真的不应该—" 彼方哽咽着，她娇小的身躯开始微微颤抖，泪水随之滑落。

Sousuke simply grabbed onto her hand, pressing his calloused fingers against her soft delicate ones, making her look at him through the tears in her eyes.
相楽只是紧紧握住她的手，粗糙的手指与她柔软细腻的手指相触，使她含泪望向他。

"I told you," He said roughly under his breath, forcing her to look into his dull grey eyes. "I would protect you… always."
我早就说过，"他压低声音，语气粗暴，逼她直视他那双无神的灰眸，"我会保护你……永远。

Around them, red light began to flash as the police and the EMT's began to swarm on the area, as orders and counter orders were shouted in indistinct fashion, making the whole scene feel like a pandemonium, but in the midst of it all, in the center of it all, she could only see his dull grey eyes, could only feel his calloused hands against her own soft fingers, could only hear his ragged voice; small and hushed and whispered against her.
四周红灯闪烁，警察和急救人员如潮水般涌入，命令与反命令交错，现场一片混乱。但在这一切的中心，她的视线只被他那灰暗的眼眸吸引，她的触感只停留在他粗糙的手与自己柔嫩手指的接触上，她的耳边只回荡着他沙哑而低沉的耳语。

"You know that, correct?"
这一点你知道的，对吧？

She didn't have to look back at him, instead, she simply smiled.
她无需回头，只是微微一笑。

"I know, and I'll wait for you." Kaname whispered back.
"我明白，我会等你。" 卡纳梅低声回答。

"For years?" 已经好几年了吗？

"Even hundreds of years…"
即便过了数百年…

Anything more they could have said, was cut short as with quick efficiency the paramedics came and began to try and keep him alive, while they covered her with a soft blanket to give her shivering form some warmth. With practiced ease, they strapped Sousuke to the stretch bed, while they began to shout for 10 cc of this, and 4 pints of that.
他们原本还有更多话要说，但急救人员迅速而高效地赶到现场，开始竭力维持他的生命，同时用一条柔软的毯子为瑟瑟发抖的她带来温暖。他们熟练地将 Sousuke 固定在担架上，并开始呼叫需要 10 毫升的这种药物和 4 品脱的那种液体。

It all became a distant drone as she kept his eyes within hers.
随着她让他的目光停留在自己眼中，一切嘈杂声都变得遥远而模糊。

And as the ambulance rode away, anyone watching would have seen how she never released his hand.
救护车离去之际，旁观者都能注意到，她一直紧紧握着他的手，未曾松开。

"And Cut!" 剪辑完成！

Everyone turned to looked at the director who had a self-satisfying smile in his face before he uttered the words everyone had been waiting to hear.
众人纷纷转头望向导演，只见他面露得意之色，随后道出了大家翘首以盼的话语。

"Print." Junpei Manaka said as everyone around him cheered, signaling the end of the filming. Immediately news reporters covering this story began to swarm around the writer/producer and the director.
"打印。" 真平真中话音刚落，四周便响起了欢呼声，宣告拍摄结束。紧接着，报道此事的记者们纷纷围拢到编剧兼制片人与导演身边。

"Miss Tojo, how does it feel to be able to end the filming of the latest saga of the Full Metal Panic franchise, FMP: Continuing on my own (With or without you)?"
东城小姐，完成《全金属狂潮》系列最新作品《FMP: 独自前行（无论有你与否）》的拍摄，您有何感想？

"Is it true that stars Kaname Chidori and Sousuke Sagara are engaged?"
千鸟要和相良宗介这对明星真的订婚了吗？

"Is this a case of life imitates art?"
这是否是生活模仿艺术的一个例子？

All around questions were shouted, while those who were asked did their best to answer without the aid of their publicist.
周围不断传来提问声，被问者则努力在没有公关协助的情况下作答。

And behind the barricade and lines of police and rented security, Asuka Langley Sohryu and Shinji Ikari looked at it all with mixed faces.
在路障和警察及雇佣保安的防线后，明日香·兰格雷与碇真嗣面露复杂神情，凝视着眼前的一切。

"Finally they're done." The redhead said after a brief moment before they began to walk towards the building adjacent to the on location set.
"终于完成了。"红发人稍作停顿后说道，接着他们便朝现场旁边的建筑走去。

"C'mon Asuka." Shinji was smiling at the image of Kaname and Sousuke walking away from the prongs of reporter still hand in hand, as if they had never heard the word "cut" from the director. "It wasn't that bad."
明日香，你看。" 真嗣指着屏幕上神乐和相良手牵手，从容地从记者的围追堵截中离去，仿佛完全没听到导演喊“停”的场景，微笑着说，"其实也没那么糟糕。

"Please." Asuka grumbled as she took a sip from her coffee cup to guard herself against the freezing cold, more biting thanks to the rain that had began to fall suddenly. "You were having the time of your life and looking forward for all the movie crew to go to the bar."
拜托了。" 明日香嘟囔着，啜饮了一口咖啡，以抵御因突降的雨而更加刺骨的寒冷。"你刚才明明乐在其中，还满心期待着和电影团队一起去酒吧。

"W-well not re—" 嗯，不，不是重新—

"C'mon admit it; big tips, cute girls, bigger tips…" Asuka said as she turned to Shinji and frowned noticing he was once again simply wearing a coat but no scarf or something to cover his head.
"承认吧，大额小费，可爱的女孩，小费更多……" 明日香转向真嗣，皱眉道，发现他依旧只穿了件外套，没有围巾或帽子来保暖。

"I've told you going out like that is just asking to get pneumonia." Asuka said as she took her own scarf and tied it around Shinji's throat. "Drink up."
我早就说过，你这样出门容易得肺炎。" 明日香边说边把自己的围巾系在真嗣的脖子上，"快喝点热饮。

Shinji kept quiet but drank from his own coffee. "Thank for the coffee."
碇真嗣沉默不语，却喝起了自己的咖啡。“谢谢你的咖啡。”

"Don't mention it, like I said, it's just to celebrate this damn movie is finally over, now I can continue working in peace."
没什么，正如我之前所说，庆祝一下这部烦人的电影总算拍完了，现在我能安心继续我的工作了。

"Well, I'm sure gonna miss all this."
哎，我肯定会怀念这一切的。

"C'mon." Asuka said as she began to walk towards the building where the filming crew was beginning to wrap everything up. "Who would miss all the people simply standing here, snooping around and hoping to get an autograph to sell over at e-bay or something?"
走吧。" 明日香边说边向拍摄团队正在收工的楼房走去。"谁会错过这些站着的人，四处打探，就为了弄个签名去 e-bay 上卖呢？

Shinji smiled a small smile behind her, finally aware of how she reacted, of how important it was for Asuka to show inner strength and live up to the standards over anything else.
真嗣在明日香身后露出一丝微笑，终于明白她的反应，意识到对她而言，展现内心的坚韧并符合高标准比任何事都重要。

"Sometimes I don't know if you're incredibly cynic or just simply jaded." Shinji said as he followed Asuka through the mass of people.
"有时我真分不清你是过于愤世，还是单纯的心灰意冷。" 真嗣说着，紧随明日香穿梭于人群之中。

Asuka simply shrugged at it. "People like to live in a dream world, but some of us actually understand the concept of real life."
明日香对此不过耸了耸肩。"人们总爱沉浸在梦境里，可我们中有些人懂得什么是现实生活。"

Shinji caught the jive and smiled good-naturedly at the redhead.
真嗣跟上了节奏，对那位红发女孩露出和善的笑容。

"C'mon, you say it like it's a bad thing… besides, it's not like all I do is stare at those two…" Shinji continued quietly. "Although I did bring them together, you know."
你这么说，好像这是件坏事似的……其实，我并不只是盯着他们俩看。" 真嗣轻声补充道，"毕竟，是我促成了他们的相遇，这点你清楚。

Asuka frowned when Shinji said that, and quickly turned around to face him.
听到真嗣的话，明日香眉头一皱，立刻转身面向他。

"Shinji, we need to get this straight." Shinji stopped when he registered the tone of her voice, and noticed how she lost all previous warmth and replaced it with the could countenance that mean the doctor was, very much, in.
"真嗣，我们得把话说清楚。" 真嗣一听到她那严肃的语气便停了下来，注意到她脸上的温暖已不复存在，取而代之的是那种医生认真起来的冷峻神情。

"I thought we had made enough progress about this." Asuka said as she took a deep breath before motioning towards Shinji. "Shinji, you need to understand and accept the fact that you are not Cupid."
我本以为我们在这件事上已有足够进展。" 明日香深吸一口气，转向真嗣说道，"真嗣，你得明白并接受，你并非爱神丘比特。

Shinji sighed at that; it had become something of a recurring theme; he would get the couples together, unlikely couples, or two people everyone else could see miles away belonged together.
真嗣对此叹了口气；这已成为一种反复出现的主题；他会撮合那些看似不可能的情侣，或是大家一眼就能看出注定要在一起的两个人。

And every time Asuka would pick at his ways and method, and every time they would always end up like this.
每当明日香对他的行事方式和方法提出质疑时，结果总是如此。

"Explain to me then how all of these…" Shinji paused, fumbling for a mundane word to use. "These situations… these things always happen when I'm around?"
那么请解释一下，为什么这些……" 真嗣顿了顿，试图找到一个平凡的词汇。"这些状况……这些事情为何总在我周围发生？

"Shinji." It had always amazed Shinji how Asuka's tone had no nonsense written all over it and how she was able to pull all of it on his name alone: It was hard, and direct and unyielding. It gave no quarter and offered no respite and it almost, almost made it seem as if any minute now she would call him an idiot.
"真嗣。" 真嗣一直对明日香那种直截了当、毫不含糊的语气感到惊讶，仅凭他的名字就能传达出这种感觉：强硬、直接、坚定不移。她毫不留情，也不给任何缓和的余地，几乎让人以为她下一秒就会骂他是个傻瓜。

"We've been though this for a long time; you're not cupid, you just happen to have an inordinate amount of luck.."
我们经历这段时光已久；你并非爱神，只是运气出奇地好。

"Luck about what?" 关于什么事情的运气？

Asuka sighed. 明日香叹息了一声。

"Look, Shinji; we've been over this already."
听着，真嗣，这事我们已经谈过了。

"Yes. And I would have thought after seeing m—" Shinji began, looking down.
"是的。我本以为在看到 m——" 真嗣开口道，目光垂下。

"That's the thing Shinji, I don't think you understand."
新二，问题在于，我觉得你还没理解。

Shinji stopped talking and looked to see Asuka pinching the bridge of her nose. "You know, from time to time, I forget that you're a mental patient. Then you do something that brings it all back into focus."
真嗣不再言语，目光转向明日香，她正捏着鼻梁。"说真的，偶尔我会忘记你是个精神病患者。可你一做些什么，就立刻让我记起来了。"

"I know, and I am so close and then we will both be free of each other." Shinji said pleasantly, even if the smile did not reach his eyes. "Then you can go your own way and I can go my own wa—"
我明白，我们即将各自自由。" 碇真嗣语气轻松，尽管他的眼中并未流露出笑意。"到那时，你可以走你的路，我也可以走我的——

"You're not listening, Shinji." Asuka interrupted him, making him close his mouth. "Look, I can't do this, not anymore… your observation period ended with the last session. I have your review pending, and I have to submit my report today before 6:00 P.M."
你根本没听进去，真嗣。" 明日香打断他，使他闭上了嘴。"听着，我不能再继续了…你的观察期在上次会话已经结束。你的评估报告我还没提交，我必须在今天下午 6 点前完成。

"So what's the problem then?" Shinji asked cautiously.
"那问题到底出在哪里呢？" 真嗣谨慎地询问。

"The problem is every time I think we are making progress you pull this crap." Asuka said firmly. "The problem is every time I think I have made a breakthrough with you, you fall back again!"
每次我觉得我们有所进展，你却总是这样拖后腿。" 明日香坚定地说，"每次我觉得和你有了新的进展，你却又退回原点！

Shinji looked at her before she pushed him to the wall, pressing his shoulders with her hands to prevent him form escaping.
真嗣刚一望向她，她便猛地将他推向墙壁，双手紧按他的肩头，不让他有逃脱的机会。

"The problem is I don't know if you're crazy, or just some con artist! The problem is you seem lucid enough before you start saying you are the God of Love!" He stared at her with wide eyes. Never before had he seen Asuka so angry, so hurt, so tired of it.
"问题在于，我分不清你是真疯了，还是仅仅是个骗子！问题是你一开始说话时明明很清醒，怎么突然就自称是爱神了呢！"他睁大眼睛凝视着她。他从未见过明日香如此愤怒，如此受伤，如此疲惫。

"The problem is that I have to make a choice, and I have to decide if I should tell the board if you're cured, or if you should be institutionalized…" She said as she turned, showing him her back, her voice once again becoming nothing more than a lulling hush.
"问题在于我必须做出选择，我得决定是否向董事会报告你已康复，还是应该将你送入治疗机构……" 她边说边转身，背对着他，声音再次变得如同催眠般的低语。

"The problem is that right now, I'm leaning towards the last one… and it's a problem for me because I—" She trailed off, not knowing how to finish her line of thought.
"问题在于，我现在倾向于最后一种方案……这对我来说是个难题，因为我——"她话音渐弱，不知该如何表达自己的想法。

Shinji stood there dumbfounded, he opened his mouth on reflex, before he frowned, deciding not to say another word. Shinji simply turned around and exited Asuka's office, not caring to hear the redhead's next words, as Asuka sighed again, still with her back to him.
真嗣愣在原地，下意识地张了张嘴，但很快皱起眉头，决定保持沉默。他转身离开了明日香的办公室，对红发少女接下来要说的话漠不关心，而明日香再次叹息，始终没有转过身来。

"You know what, fine. Fine. Fine!" Asuka said as she got up. "You want to ignore the fact that you have been charged to my care? Fine!"
你知道吗，行吧。行吧。行吧！" 明日香站起身来，说道，"你真想无视自己已托付给我的事实？那就随你吧！

"You want the courts to find out and re-institutionalize you? Fine!" She continued, screaming after him as he kept on walking. "If you want to sit in a padded room and watch the world series on an imaginary TV, then really, why should I care? Huh?!"
你想让法院查出来，再把你送回精神病院？随你便！"她继续对他吼叫，而他依旧走着。"如果你愿意坐在软垫房里，对着虚构的电视看世界大赛，那我何必在意？嗯？！

The sound of her door closing made he turn around, and Asuka simply let out a tired breath as she saw Shinji leave through the glass door, before she turned, looking at the folder on her desk with Shinji's name on it.
她关门的声音使他回头，明日香疲惫地叹了口气，目送真嗣穿过玻璃门离开，然后她转过身，目光落在桌上的文件夹上，那上面写着真嗣的名字。

"Idiot." Asuka mumbled, taking out her notes and making herself comfortable for what seemed to be a long night. The redhead pulled a small cassette player form her desk, placing it next to her books puting an audio cassette inside of it, pressing "play".
"笨蛋。" 明日香低声自语，取出笔记，为自己营造了一个似乎要持续很久的夜晚。她从桌上拿起一个小型磁带播放器，放在书本旁边，插入磁带后按下了播放键。

This medical journal will entail the progression of the patient assigned to me by court order mandate No. SH-002; this will also serve as my own recommendation for the review board in how to better treat the patient.
本医学杂志将详细记录法院指令编号 SH-002 指定给我的患者的病情进展，并作为我向审查委员会提出的，关于如何更有效治疗该患者的建议。

A preliminary report of the patient has yield the fact that the main reason of affliction seems to be social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia.
患者初步报告显示，其主要问题似乎是社交焦虑障碍，即社交恐惧症。

It is a well known fact that a diagnosis of this type within psychiatry and other mental health professions refers to excessive long-lasting social anxiety causing relatively extreme distress and impaired ability to function in at least some areas of daily life. The diagnosis can be of a specific disorder (when only some particular situations are feared) or a generalized disorder.
在精神病学和心理健康领域，众所周知，此类诊断涉及长期且过度的社交焦虑，这种焦虑导致严重的痛苦，并影响日常生活中的某些基本功能。诊断可能针对特定情境的恐惧（特定障碍），也可能是泛化的（泛化障碍）。

Generalized social anxiety disorder typically involves a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being judged by others and of potentially being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny by others. While the fear of social interaction may be recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable, considerable difficulty can be encountered overcoming it.
广泛性社交焦虑障碍通常表现为一种持续、强烈且长期的恐惧，担心被他人评判，以及可能因自己的行为而感到尴尬或羞辱。这种恐惧可能由他人实际或感知到的审视所触发。尽管患者可能意识到对社交互动的恐惧是过度的或不合理的，但要克服它却面临相当大的困难。

The interesting aspect about this case happens to be that the subject has been categorized by Dr. Akagi as being "Love-shy", in accordance to Dr. Brian G. Gilmartin's book and how he describes a specific type of severe chronic shyness.
此案例的引人注目之处在于，Dr. Akagi 根据 Dr. Brian G. Gilmartin 的著作，将该对象归类为“恋爱羞涩”，这正是 Gilmartin 博士所描述的一种严重的慢性羞涩类型。

According to his definition, published in Shyness & Love: Causes, Consequences, and Treatments (1987), love-shy people find it difficult to be assertive in informal situations involving potential romantic or sexual partners; under the same tenure, some can express this feeling of inadequacy by overcompensate this feeling of non-assertiveness by being overtly aggressive.
根据他在《羞涩与爱情：原因、后果及治疗》（1987 年出版）中的定义，爱情羞涩者在面对潜在的浪漫或性伴侣时，往往在非正式场合中难以自信表达。同样，有些人为了弥补这种不自信，可能会表现出过度的攻击性。

Dr. Gilmartin researched this phenomenon exclusively, concluding that—
吉尔马丁博士对此现象进行了专门研究，最终得出结论——

A low humming followed by a buzzing sound made Asuka stop the recording, looking down at her mobile phone vibrating with life as the screen lit up in color, making the small red little thing seem more lively.
低沉的嗡嗡声后紧随嘈杂的嗡鸣，让明日香暂停了录音，她低头望向那部震动的手机，屏幕亮起色彩，使得那个小巧的红色物体显得分外活泼。

Staring at the screen, Asuka sighed when she saw who was calling, and after a minute or two of hesitation, she answered the phone curtly.
明日香盯着屏幕，看到来电显示后叹了口气，犹豫片刻，最终简短地接听了电话。

"Yes, Dr." 是的，医生。

"Asuka, how are you?" Asuka，最近怎么样？

Asuka sighed, noticing that she was making small talk, and for her to do so was always a sing of something bad, so she decided to cut to the chase.
明日香轻叹一声，察觉到自己竟在闲聊，这对她而言，往往预示着不妙，便决定直截了当。

"I'm actually finishing my report on my patient for the oversight committee, ma'am."
我正在完成患者的报告，准备提交给监督委员会，女士。

"How good and efficient, just like your mother." Asuka could almost hear the smirk on the other side of the line playing over her lips. "We will be expecting your report today at 5 sharp. Be prompt."
真是出色又高效，跟你母亲一样。" Asuka 几乎能感受到电话那头的人嘴角得意的笑意。"我们期待你今天 5 点整准时提交报告。

Asuka was just taking the phone form her ear when she heard her last words.
Asuka 刚把电话从耳边移开，就听到了最后那句话。

"I'm proud of you, Asuka."
明日香，我真为你感到骄傲。

Asuka stared at the screen where the name blinked in and out of existence, signaling the call had been terminated. She held the phone for another moment before clicking the recorder back to life, taking a look at her notes, frowning as her eyes landed on the clock next to her.
明日香凝视着屏幕上忽隐忽现的名字，意识到通话已经结束。她握着手机又停留了片刻，随后重新开启录音，翻看笔记，目光不经意间落在旁边的时钟上，眉头微蹙。

2.34 P.M. 下午 2 时 34 分

Sighing, she turned to the notes in front of her, wondering again how it had all come to this.
她叹息着，目光转向面前的笔记，心中再次涌起疑惑，不明白这一切是如何演变至此的。

"I'm telling you, I'm the God of love…"
我得告诉你，我就是爱神……

Kaji simply smirked down at Shinji, noticing how he was much closer to falling from the stool he was sitting than to making any sense.
加治只是对真嗣微微一笑，注意到他几乎要从凳子上跌落，而不是理解任何事情。

"Sure you are kid… thanks to you, me and Misato got past our differences and managed to start again." Kaji said as he handed Shinji another crate to be put on the freezer.
"你这孩子真行……多亏有你，我和美里才得以消除隔阂，重新出发。" 加持说着，又递给真嗣一个箱子，示意他放入冰柜。

"That's because you were nothing more than a horny man-whore."
那是因为你只不过是一个满脑子色欲的男人。

Kaji and Shinji turned to look at Misato who had finished signing for the rest of the stock before tearing into a new Y'bisu pack ad taking out one of the beers to sample it.
加治和真嗣转头望向葛城，她刚签收完剩余的货物，随即撕开一包新 Y'bisu 啤酒，拿出一瓶尝了尝。

"Hey! Don't do that!" Kaji said from behind the counter. "We still need to do a final count for tonight's pa—"
嘿！别这样！" 卡吉在柜台后提醒道，"我们还得为今晚的派对做最后的结算——

The unmistakable sound of the pressured contents of the beer bottle being released and drank made him stop in mid sentence as he saw Misato take one long gulp, before he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders and smiled.
啤酒瓶中压力释放的独特声响，以及紧随其后的畅饮声，让他话说到一半就戛然而止。他目睹美里豪饮一大口，随后摇摇头，耸耸肩，露出了微笑。

"Hm… nice light taste with a hint of orange on it…" Misato said thoughtfully before taking one of the tall beer glasses Kaji had been wiping and pouring the rest of the beer there.
"嗯……口感清新，透着淡淡的橙香……" 碇真嗣若有所思地说着，随后从加持手中接过一只高脚啤酒杯，将剩余的啤酒倒入其中。

"Now I know they're trying to market it to the young and hip crowd."
现在我明白了，他们正努力将产品营销给年轻且时髦的人群。

"That means you'll drink it?" Kaji said as he walked behind her to inspect the rest of the beers and beverages.
"你是说你要喝这个？" 加治说着，跟在她身后，查看其余的啤酒和饮品。

"No way… I'm a one beer kind of gal." Misato made a face. "Besides it's too light for my taste." She walked back to the bar and sat in a fluid motion that made her seem even younger than her real age, something that was a well guarded secret along with her weight and three sizes.
"怎么可能…我只喝一杯啤酒就够了。" 碇真嗣皱了皱眉。"而且这酒太清淡，不合我的口味。" 她轻盈地回到吧台坐下，那动作让她显得比实际年龄还要年轻，她的真实年龄、体重和三围都是深藏不露的秘密。

"So, what's on your mind kid? You look even downer than usual."
孩子，你心里在想什么呢？看起来你比平时还要不开心。

Shinji was about to tell her when Kaji interrupted.
真嗣正准备向她说明，却被加持中途打断。

"The kid's going on about how he got those two movie stars together and no one is giving him credit."
那孩子不停地说他如何促成了那两位电影明星的相遇，却无人认可他的功劳。

"N-no, I mean… it's not li—"
不，我是说…这并不像—

"Aww c'mon Shinji." Misato said teasingly. "Everyone here knows we have our own little cupid; too bad you didn't want to use that cupid idea for last Valentine's."
哎呀，真嗣，别这样嘛。" 美里打趣道，"大家都知道我们这儿有个小丘比特；可惜你去年情人节没打算用那个点子。

"Or in Halloween, or in White day, or in Tanabata… I think Misato simply wants to see you semi nude and running around showing your cra—"
无论是万圣节、白色情人节还是七夕……Misato 似乎就是想看你半裸着四处奔跑，尽情展现你的疯狂一面——

Kaji's remark was silenced by Misato throwing him a wet wash towel to his face.
加持的话被美里用一块湿毛巾捂脸给打断了。

"Sh-shut up, you! Those were simply sales strategies!"
闭嘴，你！那只是销售策略而已！

"Yeah, yeah… same like putting on that tiger striped bikini and trying to make this a cosplay bar."
对啊，对啊…就像穿上那件虎纹比基尼，试图将这里打造成一个角色扮演酒吧似的。

"Well, it was better than that idea of making Wednesdays "Casino" nights and you dressing up as James Bo—"
说起来，这比提议每周三办'赌场'主题夜，让你装扮成詹姆斯·邦德要好多了。

"Well it was better than you…"
说起来，这还是比你强……

Shinji sighed, as he watched the on-again/off-again couple begin their usual bantering routine, before letting a small smile play on his lips.
真嗣轻叹一声，目睹那对时好时坏的情侣又开始了他们习以为常的拌嘴，嘴角不由得泛起一抹淡淡的笑意。

He had brought them both together… that much was true. It had been tricky given Misato's thoughts on Kaji sleeping around, but anyone could see that Misato really did care and love the man, even if she sometimes cover up those feelings with rudeness or name calling.
他确实促成了他们两人的相聚……这是不争的事实。鉴于美里对加持风流韵事的看法，这确实颇具挑战，但旁观者清，美里对加持的深情与爱意是显而易见的，尽管她有时会以粗鲁或辱骂来掩饰这些情感。

And as always, once the discussion was starting to get heated, Kaji would then silence Misato the only way he knew was a sure-fire way to do it.
每当讨论气氛升温，卡吉总会用他那屡试不爽的方法让美里闭嘴。

Shinji smiled as he saw how, once they were done, and Kaji would continue taking stock for tonight's party, Misato would look at him and smile a soft, small smile, before turning away, sticking her tongue out at him or Kaji whenever they caught her.
碇真嗣面带微笑，目睹他们任务完成后，卡吉继续为晚上的派对做准备，而美里则会朝他投来一个温柔的微笑，随即转身，每当被他和卡吉发现时，便俏皮地吐吐舌头。

Yeah, it did bring a smile to his face.
确实，这让他脸上绽放了笑容。

But also a pang of… something.
但同时也有一种…莫名的刺痛。

Somehow, every smile and every giggle seemed…
不知何故，每一张笑脸和每一次咯咯笑都显得……

Kaji and Misato blinked from their bantering-evolved-into-necking session when Shinji simply picked up his jacket and made his way to the door.
真嗣拿起夹克向门口走去，卡吉和美里这才从争吵转为亲昵的氛围中回过神来。

"Hey, Shinji, where the hell are you going?" Misato asked to his back. "We're having last minute preparations here for the wrap up pa—"
嘿，真嗣，你这是要去哪儿啊？" 美里冲着他的背影喊道。"我们正在做最后的收尾工作——

"I'll be back in a while, just need to think."
我稍后回来，需要点时间思考。

And just like that, for the second time today, Shinji walked way, and when he heard the latch of the door licking shut, he somehow felt like a part of his life was being closed as well.
就这样，真嗣今天第二次离开，听到门闩咔哒一声关上，他隐约觉得自己的一部分生活也随之落幕。

"Dr. Sohryu." 索龙博士。

Asuka looked up from her feet, staring at the attendant. The girl simply motioned to the great oak doors.
明日香抬起头，目光从脚边移向服务员。那女孩仅是向那扇宏伟的橡木门示意。

"They're waiting for you."
他们在等你。

Slowly, Asuka rose, checked her dress and coat, picked up her briefcase, and walked towards the door.
缓缓地，明日香起身，整理了衣裙和外套，拎起公文包，朝门口走去。

Shinji was used to walking aimlessly.
真嗣习惯了漫无目的地闲逛。

He had done it or at least it felt like he had done that so long ago. Sometimes it felt like he had been here before, but every now and then it felt like he was nothing but a scared little boy wandering without a reason through the city; he could really remember the first time he had done so, how he had ended in a corner somewhere, but this time it was different.
他仿佛很久以前就做过这件事，至少感觉如此。有时他觉得自己曾来过此地，但偶尔又觉得自己只是个在城市中无目的游荡的胆怯小男孩；他清晰记得第一次这么做时的情景，那时他不知怎么就走到了一个角落，但这次情况不同。

Now it felt different somehow.
现在感觉似乎有所不同。

He reached the park and simply sat down, and proceeded to simply… be there, sitting in the bench, witnessing as people walked by, watching as they went around on their normal, every day life, and thinking…
他抵达公园，随意坐下，就那样静静地坐在长椅上，观察着过往行人，目睹他们如常地生活，心中思绪万千…

Had he become so used to being them, had he really lost track of who he was?
他是否已习惯于成为他们，以至于忘记了自己原本的身份？

He got up, suddenly feeling sick, ready to begin pacing or to simply walk away again, but as he took some steps, he felt that feeling again in the pit of his stomach before he sat down again.
他起身时，突然感到一阵恶心，正打算踱步或再次离去，然而刚迈出几步，胃中那股不适感再次袭来，迫使他重新坐下。

If he had to be honest with himself, he was tired, tired of all this, tired of people not believing him, tired of her always saying that his job was nothing more than a simple coincidence.
如果他对自己坦诚，他确实感到疲惫，厌倦了这一切，厌倦了人们的不信任，厌倦了她总说他的工作只是偶然。

So what if he had no bow and arrow, and not much of a personality?
即便他既无弓箭，个性也不鲜明，那又如何？

He was who he was, and that was the simple truth.
他本性如此，这便是朴素的真相。

But…

Every time he stopped, he could see them, he could feel them, smell them all; it had been hard at first, understanding why he had been cast away, understanding that it had been his pride, his hubris what had been his down fall in the beginning.
每当他驻足，便能看见他们，感受到他们，闻到他们的一切；起初，要理解自己为何被遗弃，明白是他的骄傲，他的自大使他初尝败绩，确实不易。

"One hundred couples" had been something burned into his mind when he woke up that time, like a goal or something with structure and purpose for him to attain.
那次醒来时，“一百对夫妇”的念头深深烙印在他的心中，宛如一个明确的目标，或是一项有结构和目的的任务，召唤着他去达成。

And yet… 可是…

He remembered how he had been standing in the same corner, hounding the pedestrians with the promise of getting them a chance at true love, and how the shout men from the local soap houses and cosplay cafes had began to shout at him to leave, how even while he had tried to explain why he was doing what he had been doing, one of them came at him and in the scuffle that broke afterwards, how that person had ended with a broken nose and a concussion.
他回忆起自己曾站在那个角落，向行人承诺能帮他们找到真爱，结果引来附近肥皂屋和角色扮演咖啡馆的男人们大声驱赶。尽管他试图解释自己的动机，但其中一人冲上来，在随后的冲突中，那人不幸鼻子骨折并伴有脑震荡。

He remembered how the police officers nearby had arrested him. Making him march to the local station and the crazy look they gave him when they asked him to state his full name please.
他回忆起附近警察逮捕他的情景。他们让他步行至当地派出所，当要求他报出全名时，那些警察投来的疯狂目光。

He remembered how she… 他回忆起她当时的样子…

Shinji frowned. 真嗣皱着眉头。

It had taken him weeks to finally convince her that he wasn't crazy.
他费了好几个星期，才终于让她相信自己并非疯言疯语。

Well, ok, so maybe he had to lie a bit and play the game to be let out, but it was the only way out if he wanted to complete his mission, and he wasn't going to be able to do it while inside a hospital forced to wear a bathrobe all day.
嗯，好吧，或许他确实得撒点小谎，耍点花招才能离开，但这是他完成使命的唯一途径。如果一直被困在医院，整天被迫穿着浴袍，他将无法达成目标。

"She's right you know? You really do whine a lot."
她说的没错，你确实挺爱抱怨的。

Shinji blinked wearily, the voice ringing in his ears as pleasantly as the sound of a nearby river would sound to a thirsty man. When he focused his eyes, he saw her next to him; her presence and warm smile seemed to make her skin glow against the setting sun.
真嗣疲倦地眨眼，那声音在他耳边回荡，宛如口渴之人听闻近旁溪流的潺潺声般令人愉悦。定睛一看，她就在身旁；她的身影和温暖的笑容在夕阳映衬下，仿佛让她的肌肤都泛起了光芒。

"Mother?" 妈妈？

"How are you?" She answered simply, before she sat next to him, without waiting for an invitation, the folds of her long coat brushing against the cobblestones of the park.
她简单回应：“你好吗？”随即不待邀请便坐到他身旁，长外套的褶皱轻触着公园的鹅卵石。

"He's doing fine, obviously."
他显然过得不错。

Shinji turned around and looked in front of him, before his face turned into a frown.
真嗣转身向前看去，随即眉头紧锁。

Standing in front of him, cut against the yellow-orange light of the dying day was a man of imposing height, looking down at him; his face was obscured by the blinding light, but Shinji instantly felt his name within the confines of his mind.
站在他面前，被夕阳的黄橙色光芒映衬着的，是一位身材高大的男子，正低头凝视着他；尽管他的面容被耀眼的光线所遮蔽，但新二立刻在心中感知到了他的名字。

"Father." 爸爸。

"Indeed." He said simply staring down at him.
"的确如此。"他简单地说着，目光直视着他。

"What do you want?" 你想要什么？

He simply smirked, a cruel grimace that in him seemed like a rictus on his face.
他只是冷冷一笑，那残忍的笑容在他脸上显得格外僵硬。

"We simply came to see you, see how your mission is coming." His mother said instantly, appeasing Shinji, while simultaneously shooting his father a glare, making the older man look away before walking a few steps away, giving them a bit of privacy.
"我们只是来看看你，了解一下你的任务进展。"他的母亲立刻说道，安抚着真嗣，同时向他的父亲投去责备的目光，使得这位年长者转过头去，然后走开几步，为他们留出一些私密空间。

"You have to forgive him, you know how he is."
你得原谅他，毕竟你知道他的为人。

Shinji simple let out a huff before he turned around.
真嗣轻叹一声，随即转身。

"I…"

"We've been watching you from afar." She continued, modulating her voice to a soothing calm tone, as she placed her hand on his arm, and gave him a look full of love and warmth.
"我们一直在远处关注着你。"她温柔地说着，声音平和而安抚，同时轻触他的手臂，目光中满是爱与温情。

"I have told your father several times to allow you the use of your powers when you were obviously struggling."
我已多次向你父亲建议，在你明显遇到困难时，应允许你运用你的能力。

"Why?" 为什么呢？

"Well…" She stopped for a bit, looking away as if she were thinking of the best way to explain before smiling wistfully while brushing a strand of chestnut colored hair. "Mothers are like that… We're ready to come forth and cast a loving embrace and protective hand to guard our children from any harm."
嗯……"她顿了顿，目光飘向别处，仿佛在斟酌最恰当的表达方式，随后露出一抹淡淡的微笑，轻抚着一缕栗色发丝。"母亲总是如此……我们时刻准备着，用满怀爱意的怀抱和守护之手，保护孩子免受一切伤害。

Shinji simply stared at her from the corner of his eyes, not saying a word.
真嗣只是斜眼看着她，默不作声。

"And what did father say."
父亲说了什么？

"You know your father." She simply shrugged, turning to look at the aforementioned father, who was trying hard not to make it look like he was hanging on to her every word, the devotion from him towards her as palpable and obvious it sometimes seemed to Shinji like there was some sort of thread connecting them both undeniably in every way, in every aspect, like the duality of the sun and the moon, of male and female, of heaven and earth.
"你了解你父亲。"她只是耸了耸肩，转头望向那位父亲，他正尽力掩饰自己对她的每一句话都如饥似渴，他对她的忠诚如此明显而强烈，有时让真嗣感觉他们之间似乎有一条无形的纽带，将他们紧密相连，如同太阳与月亮、男性与女性、天堂与大地之间的双重性。

"He believes a child's worth should be proved by their own self… that way, any kind of prize they get or ask for will be justly awarded to them and them alone…"
他坚信孩子的价值应由其个人证明…如此一来，他们所获或所求的任何奖励都将公正地仅归于他们个人…

"Is that why you came here?" Shinji asked quietly, his voice no higher than a whisper. "To try and justify what you did?"
你来这里，就是为了这个吗？" 碇真嗣低声问道，声音轻得如同耳语。"想为你的行为辩解？

"No. We came here to see you." His mother said simply. "I came to let you know I will be expecting you back soon."
不，我们专程来看你。"他母亲直截了当地说，"我来是想告诉你，我盼着你不久就回来。

She cupped his face with both hands, and drew his eyes into her own, blue reflecting against blue, like a mirror image down to the same delicate features on their faces.
她双手捧起他的脸庞，让他的目光与自己的相遇，蓝眸对蓝眸，宛如镜中倒影，连面容上的细腻特征都一模一样。

"You have done a fine job so far." She continued, looking at all the couples walking by. clearly enjoying the multitude of people there, all with their own thoughts, ideas, feelings; all individuals, but strangely connected.
"你到目前为止做得很好。"她接着说，目光随着过往的情侣流转。显然，她沉浸在人群的多样性中，每个人带着自己的思绪、理念和情感；虽是独立的个体，却奇妙地彼此相连。

"It has always marveled me how this could be, how such a feeling can… become."
我总是对这种感觉如何能够…成真感到惊奇。

The faces of the young couples were open, all showing their feelings for the night; but it wasn't only the couples; there were several men and women alone, and the owners of the small cafes and restaurants were beginning to put out the tables on the sidewalks, waiting anxiously for the young couples and lovers to come and have something to eat.
年轻情侣们的脸上洋溢着坦诚，无不流露出对夜晚的情感；然而，不只是情侣们，还有许多独自的男女，小咖啡馆和餐馆的老板们正开始在人行道上摆放桌椅，急切地期待着年轻情侣和爱侣们光临用餐。

"You see how they all interact?" She questioned in a cheerful manner. "This is the magic behind it all, the reason for us being here. It's not only a spur of the moment thing, but something for which we lay the foundations."
你注意到他们之间的互动了吗？"她兴高采烈地问道。"这就是一切背后的奥秘，我们存在的理由。这不仅仅是即兴之作，而是我们为之奠定基础的事业。

She motioned towards a young couple sharing a cup of coffee, and already Shinji could see a thin red shimmering tendril emanating from them both growing redder, firmer, stronger.
她指向一对共享咖啡的年轻情侣，新二立刻注意到，从他们身上散发出的微弱红色光晕正逐渐变得鲜亮、坚实、强烈。

"They've known each other since grade school." She began simply, closing her eyes, humming a mellow tune, almost as if she was harmonizing her words with their thoughts.
"他们打小学起就彼此相识。"她轻声开口，闭目哼唱着悠扬的旋律，似乎在用话语与他们的思绪交织共鸣。

"She has been the one always pushing him to do better, and although he might be a bit of a dumb insensitive person, he really has a warm gentle heart." She turned to Shinji, her eyes sparkling as she spoke.
"她始终是那个激励他不断进步的推动者，虽然他有时显得有些迟钝和不够敏感，但他的内心确实温暖而柔和。"她转向真嗣，眼中闪烁着光芒，说道。

"Do you think they are meant to be?"
你觉得他们是不是命中注定的一对？

Shinji spared them a glance. The girl was now talking about something, her freckled cheeks flushed with excitement, while the tall boy was simply staring at her in awe, his slouched posture as casual as his ensemble of track suit and running shoes, almost as if he had just gotten out of the gym and rushed to be with her, the southern wind flowing behind him.
真嗣瞥了他们一眼。女孩正兴致勃勃地谈论着什么，雀斑点缀的脸颊因兴奋而泛红，而高个子男孩则只是目不转睛地凝视着她，他那随意的驼背姿态和一身运动服配跑鞋的打扮，宛如刚从健身房匆匆赶来与她相会，南风在他身后轻柔地吹拂。

But Shinji could see it in his eyes; that look of utter adoration, how he was hanging from every word she was saying almost as if his very soul was being feed by the sound of his voice.
但真嗣能从他的眼神中看出，那是一种彻底的崇拜，他几乎一字不漏地听着她说话，仿佛他的灵魂正被她的声音滋养着。

"Yes. It's obvious he's in love with her, and she is also with him."
没错。他显然爱上了她，而她也同样爱着他。

She smiled at Shinji and nodded. "You are so close, Eros… You are so close to proving us that you still exist here. Don't lose faith, don't despair, believe in you as others believe in you."
她向真嗣微笑并点头示意。“厄洛斯，你已经很接近了……你即将证明你依然存在于我们之中。不要丧失信心，不要绝望，要像他人信任你一样信任自己。”

She rose then, bending her waist to still keep Shinji's eyes on herself, before she leaned forward and kissed his forehead softly, delicately.
她随后站起身来，微微弯腰，确保真嗣的目光依旧停留在自己身上，接着她倾身向前，温柔地吻了吻他的额头。

"You felt so sure of yourself and your craft, that you needed to be taught a lesson, boy." His father's voice boomed, making Shinji realize he was standing next to him, still staring out at the horizon, into the ever encompassing night.
"你对自己的技艺过于自信，孩子，是时候给你上一课了。" 父亲的声音如雷贯耳，让真嗣意识到他正站在自己身旁，依旧凝望着远方，沉浸在那无垠的夜色中。

"One hundred couples without the use of your bow and arrows, without the use of your charisma and beauty. A challenge fit for the God of love."
百对情侣，无需你的弓箭，不靠你的魅力与美貌。这场考验，恰是爱神所宜。

Shinji looked at his father with awe; the light turning into darkness, the day becoming dusk, clearly outlining his tall form, the short beard and hair, the glasses obscuring his eyes, giving off the glare of the fire that raged within him, fire that could be destructive, that could be war, that could forge arms and arrows as well as treasures and jewels.
真嗣带着敬畏凝视着父亲；随着光线转暗，白昼步入暮色，他那高大的身影、短须与发丝被清晰地勾勒出来，眼镜虽遮住了双眼，却难掩其中燃烧的烈焰，那火焰既能带来毁灭，亦能点燃战火，既能铸就兵戈箭矢，亦能雕琢珍宝美玉。

He stared until he could no longer stare, and then looked down at his feet.
他一直盯着看，直到眼睛再也支撑不住，才垂下目光看向自己的双脚。

"You are close to completing this challenge on my terms, boy. Finish it, and then return to your mother's side."
你即将按我的条件完成这项挑战，孩子。完成后，就回到你母亲身边吧。

"It's not much of a challenge now." Shinji said simply. "I only need one more."
现在这已经没什么挑战性了。" 真嗣淡淡地说，"我还差一个就完成了。

"You never learn, do you?" He said as he turned to Shinji, blinding him with the light coming form his glasses. "The reason you were sent here is because of your pride."
你总是学不乖，是吧？" 他转头对真嗣说，眼镜反射的光线令真嗣眼前一花。"你之所以被派来，全因你的傲慢。

"Pride… you always say that." Shinji said in a low voice. "What do you mean pride? I've jumped through hoops to be able to get here… I've done what you wanted so fa—"
自尊……你总挂在嘴边。" 真嗣低声回应，"所谓的自尊究竟指什么？我可是费了九牛二虎之力才走到这一步……我已经尽力按照你的意愿去做了——

"And you still haven't learned the point of this." His reply was so swift and cutting, almost like a battle forged sword cutting at tender young flesh.
"你还是没明白这一点。"他的回答既迅速又尖锐，仿佛战场上锻造的利剑，直刺年轻而脆弱的心灵。

"I've learned that I am good at what I do!" Shinji said fiercely, clutching the arm rest of the bench until his knuckles grew white.
"我终于明白，我确实擅长自己所做的事！" 真嗣激动地说，紧抓着长椅的扶手，指节因用力而泛白。

"I've learned that you can take my arrow and bow, my personality and charisma, but I'd still be able to pull it off!"
我领悟到，即便你夺走了我的箭与弓，我的个性与魅力，我依然能够应对自如！

"Really? So confident in just one more couple? So you finally remember why you started all this?" His tone was… cryptic… like someone talking of a cooking recipe that bequeathed a great mystery and family tradition, or like a scientist of older times guarding a secret to a neophyte who was still too wet behind the ears to understand.
"真的吗？就这么自信地再试一次？你终于想起当初为何开始这一切了吗？"他的语气……神秘莫测，仿佛在讲述一道蕴含重大秘密和家族传统的烹饪秘方，又或者像旧时代的科学家，对一个尚显稚嫩的新手保守着某个秘密。

It made Shinji stare at him again, long and hard and trying look through all the haze in his mind, only to find it impossible and for him to once again look to his feet, subdued.
这让真嗣再次凝视着他，努力透过脑海中的迷雾，却徒劳无功，最终只得再次垂下目光，显得有些消沉。

"I've done it so far... besides, I could probably do it in one night, if I wanted to."
我目前已经做到了这一步...而且，如果我愿意，或许一个晚上就能搞定。

"Very well, I accept that." And with that, His father turned around, the wind billowing against his coat, making it look almost like a black cape with red undertones on it.
"好吧，我接受这一点。" 话音刚落，他的父亲便转过身，风将他的外套吹得鼓起，仿佛一件带有红色衬里的黑色斗篷。

"Part of your punishment here on Earth was to find out about mortality, and to remember why you embarked on trying to mend one hundred broken hearts."
你在地球上受罚的一部分，是要领悟死亡的真谛，并铭记你当初试图治愈百颗破碎之心的初衷。

He stopped mid stride, turning around, eyeless eyes glaring at him, mouth shrouded by the shadows of his own face. "Remember… mortals die. You have until tonight. Fail, and you will never leave. You will become a mortal, and you will die."
他猛地止步，回身面对那双空洞的眼窝，嘴巴被自己面部的阴影所掩盖。“记住……凡人终将逝去。你只有到今晚的机会。若失败，你将永困于此，沦为凡人，走向死亡。”

The words died in an echo in his ears, making Shinji open his eyes, noticing he had been asleep the whole time on the bench.
话语在他耳边回响后消逝，真嗣这才睁开眼，发现自己竟在长椅上睡了一觉。

He got up and decided to quiet the voices raging within.
他起身决定安抚内心激荡的声音。

He had to make them believe in him, again… and there was only one way to do it.
他得让他们再次相信他，办法只有一个。

But as Shinji walked back to the bar, a thought occurred to him: if he wasn't who he thought he was, then… who was he?
当真嗣走回酒吧时，一个念头突然浮现：如果他并非自以为的那个人，那么……他究竟是谁？

"He's a delusional man." 他是个妄想狂。

The muttering on the room felt oppressing, the small mumbled words, the whispered words...
房间内的窃窃私语令人感到压抑，那些细碎的嘟囔声，低声细语...

"I know that." Asuka answered back, alone in the room, facing the other woman's back as she poured herself a glass of water.
"我知道了。" Asuka 回应着，独自站在房间中，望着另一位女士倒水的背影。

"Do you…?" She let out a hum, and Asuka simply kept repeating to herself to calm down, calm down, calm down. "So you accept the fact that his delusion that he is in fact Cupid, the Roman god of love, remains fixed, and that he was released because according to the reports which you filed, he'd overcome his delusional state?"
你……？"她轻哼一声，明日香则反复自语以平复情绪，冷静，冷静，一定要冷静。"那么，你是否认同这一事实：他仍固执地认为自己就是罗马爱神丘比特，而他之所以获释，是基于你提交的报告，称他已摆脱了妄想状态？

Asuka opened her mouth to refute it, when she realized she had nothing to fall back on.
明日香本想开口反驳，却突然发现自己无言以对。

"Asuka, I have the obligation of letting you know that the committee found your case review unsatisfactory." She took a drink and sat in front of her, taking her glasses and brushing her short reddish-brown colored hair.
"Asuka，我有责任通知你，委员会对你的案件审查结果感到不满意。"她喝了口水，坐到她面前，摘下眼镜，轻抚着自己那短而红棕色的头发。

"I know that bu—" 我知道那部分—

"All evidence points toward a degenerative schizophrenia. I am telling you this, not as your supervisor, and not as a member of the review committee." She said as she leaned towards Asuka, placing a comforting hand on her arm.
"所有证据均表明这是一种退行性精神分裂症。我之所以告诉你，并非以你上司的身份，也非作为审查委员会成员。" 她一边说着，一边向飞鸟靠近，轻柔地把手放在她的手臂上以示安慰。

"I'm telling you this as your mother as well." She leaned back, shooting Asuka a long, hard look. "Now as my daughter, I want you to be honest with me."
我以母亲的身份告诉你这些。"她身体微微后仰，目光锐利地盯着飞鸟。"作为我的女儿，我希望你能对我坦诚相待。

"Asuka." Kyoko said somberly and with reluctance, waiting. "Are you having an affair with Shinji Ikari?"
Asuka." 绫波丽语气沉重，带着一丝勉强，等待着回答。"你和碇真嗣是不是有了婚外情？

"Mom!" Asuka said angrily. "How can you—"
妈妈！" 明日香愤怒地说。"你怎么可以—

"I know." Kyoko said quickly, cutting her daughter's rant. "But there have been allegations made to the effect that you may be having..." Kyoko paused, thinking for a moment before her professional side took over. "Inappropriate relations with him."
我明白。" 京子急忙插话，打断了女儿的抱怨。"不过，有人提出了一些指控，大意是说你和他之间可能存在……" 京子顿了顿，思索片刻后，她的职业素养促使她继续说："不当关系。

Asuka couldn't believe what she was hearing, she simply stared at her mother's face, feeling as if her professional life was crumbling around her like a castle made out of sand just when the high tide came in.
明日香难以置信地凝视着母亲，仿佛自己的职业生涯正随着潮水上涨，如同沙堡般轰然崩塌。

"Listen, you are a grown up, and I can't tell you what to do." Kyoko said after a beat, letting the graveness of the accusation sink in Asuka's mind. "But if I where you, I wouldn't be talking or seeing a man who is the reason why I am being investigated for improper conduct."
听着，你已经是个成年人，我无权干涉你的决定。" 京子顿了顿，让这严肃的指控深入明日香的心。"但若我是你，我不会与那个导致我被调查不当行为的男人有任何接触。

Asuka looked down, looking like a chastised child.
明日香垂下目光，一副受责备的孩童模样。

"I wouldn't want to lose my career, and your final review is inconclusive, asking for more time to have him under observation is like admitting you are."
我不愿断送我的职业生涯，而你的最终评审仍未有明确结论，提出需要更多时间来观察他，这无异于自认能力不足。

"I will not lose my career over him."
我不会因为他而断送我的职业生涯。

"Good." Kyoko agreed, as she placed the file Asuka had presented on the table, and on top of it, the small cassette player kept the file folder closed. "Because any way you see it right now, with this report, that's exactly what you're doing… you are throwing away your career."
好的。" 京子点头表示同意，她将明日香递交的文件置于桌面，再用一个小型磁带播放器压住文件夹，使其保持闭合。"因为有了这份报告，无论从哪个角度看，你现在所做的……无疑是在自毁前程。

"There is nothing going on between u—"
你我之间并无瓜葛——

Kyoko got up and walked next to Asuka, kneeling next to her, cupping her chin and forcing her to look up.
京子站起来，走到飞鸟身边跪下，轻轻托起她的下巴，让她抬头看向自己。

"Asuka, listen…" Kyoko began, and her tone became softer, mellower; like the untouched grass after a soft summer rain, lulling and refreshing, yet feeling like someone had wrapped a warm blanket around her cold shoulders.
"明日香，听我说…" 绫波丽开口了，她的声音变得温柔而圆润，宛如夏日细雨过后那片静谧的草地，既带来宁静又让人感到清新，仿佛有人在她冰凉的肩头披上了一层温暖的毯子。

"Can you honestly tell me he is getting better? Can you honestly tell me you have seen improvements?"
你能坦白告诉我他真的在好转吗？你能坦白告诉我你确实看到了进步

"What is the alternative then?" Asuka asked angrily. "We're talking about putting him on a drug that will fundamentally change his personality."
那替代方案又是什么呢？" 明日香怒气冲冲地问。"我们这是在考虑给他用一种会彻底改变他个性的药物。

She slammed her hands on the glass table. "Do you understand that? It's who he is!"
她双手重重地拍在玻璃桌上，质问道：“你明白了吗？这就是他的真面目！”

Kyoko in contrast remained calm, and collected, staring down her daughter with sharp, razor-like eyes. "We're also talking about your reputation. Your career."
相反，京子显得冷静而沉着，用锐利如刀锋的目光直视女儿。“我们还在讨论你的声誉。你的职业前途。”

Asuka and Kyoko stared at each other for a beat, a moment, a glimpse of time before Kyoko continued in the same cold clinical way she used when dissecting to Shinji that one time ago the reasons why love and romance were dead.
明日香与京子目光交汇，刹那间，时间似乎停滞。接着，京子用她曾对真嗣进行解剖时那种冷静而客观的语气，继续阐述爱情与浪漫为何已不复存在的理由。

"There is no shame in feeling love, but there is great shame in losing all of what you've worked for, all of what you have gotten so far for a simple romp in the sack."
心中有爱并非可耻，但若为了一时的欢愉而丧失所有辛勤积累的成果，那才是真正的耻辱。

Asuka glared at Kyoko but said nothing, instead, she simply got up and walked away, leaving behind the file.
明日香怒视着恭子，却未发一言，随即起身离去，留下那份文件未动。

Kyoko simply sat down, and sighed.
京子坐了下来，轻轻叹息。

The clock kept ticking away.
时钟不停地滴答走着。

Shinji stared at the bottle of alcohol with intensity, sitting in the dining table of his apartment almost as if he was forcing it with his mind to finish itself, or rather, what was left of it.
真嗣紧盯着桌上的那瓶酒，目光炯炯，仿佛要用意念让它自行饮尽，确切地说，是让剩下的酒消失。

The whole room was dark, the night already present and the curtains drawn. The only sound in the apartment was the tick-tock of the clock going on and on, making the fleeting seconds turns into decaying minutes, corpses of the moment that had just passed by, that would never come back, that will keep on going on and forth.
房间内漆黑一片，夜色已深，窗帘紧闭。公寓中唯一的声音是钟表的滴答声，它不停地响着，将短暂的秒数转化为流逝的分钟，那些刚刚逝去的时刻，如同遗骸，永不再来，只会不断向前推进。

Shinji sighed, noticing he was, indeed, quite drunk.
真嗣叹了口气，发觉自己确实醉得厉害。

And the clock kept ticking away.
时钟不停地滴答走着。

After a moment of contemplation, he extracted a phone from within his clothes and began to punch in the numbers before the phone began to light up with movement and sound and life.
沉思片刻后，他从衣兜里掏出手机，开始按键输入号码，紧接着手机屏幕亮起，充满了动态、声响和活力。

Ring.

He raised the bottle to his lips, closing his eyes and taking a deep drink.
他举起瓶子，凑到嘴边，闭上双眼，深深地饮了一口。

Ring.

He looked blearily at the bottle, leaning back on the chair, holding it up to gauge the color of the liquid against the pale light of the candles.
他睡眼惺忪地凝视着瓶子，身体后仰倚在椅背上，将瓶子举至蜡烛的淡淡光晕中，仔细观察液体的色泽。

Ri—

"Yes?" 怎么了？

Shinji smiled to himself, hearing her voice on the other line. "Hey, Dr. Sohryu,"
真嗣听到电话那头她的声音，不禁微微一笑。“嘿，苏尔修博士，”

"Who- Shinji... What do you want?" Asuka answered, and even through the distorted voice over the aerial telephone signals, Shinji could feel the tiredness on her voice, and for a moment he felt bad, terrible… he felt filled with remorse for what he was about to say and do.
"谁——真嗣……你有什么事？"明日香应答着，即便电话信号中的声音扭曲不清，真嗣仍能察觉到她声音里的疲惫，一时间，他感到愧疚难当，为自己即将说的话和要做的事深感悔恨。

But just as easily as it came, he forgot about it as well.
它来得轻而易举，他也同样轻易地将其遗忘。

"I just thought you should know…"
我刚想到，你应该知道…

He stopped, closing his eyes, focusing, concentrating on what he wanted to say, thinking of the words to express the feeling of rage and anger and despair within his very fiber, his very soul.
他驻足闭目，全神贯注地思索着要表达的话语，竭力寻找能传达内心深处愤怒、怨恨与绝望的词汇，这些情感已深深烙印在他的骨髓与灵魂之中。

"Shinji I re—" 真嗣，我再说—

"I'm planning a breakthrough." Shinji said quickly, interrupting Asuka and pressing his advantage more and more.
"我正策划一次突破。" 真嗣急忙插话，打断明日香并持续施压。

"I have found a lovely young lady with whom I feel a deep emotional connection." Shinji said, smiling pleasantly at the bottle of wine in his hand.
"我遇到了一位迷人的年轻女士，与她有着深厚的情感纽带。" 碇真嗣微笑着，目光落在手中的酒瓶上。

"So… what? Are you calling me to let me know? I th—"
那又怎样？你打电话来就是为了通知我一声吗？我想—

"No… but I thought this would be something you needed to know. Set your mind at ease on a number of issues." He said as he took another drink from the bottle. "I'm thinking of my good ol' pal Ba—"
不……但我觉得这事儿你得知道。好让你在不少事情上放宽心。"他边说边又抿了一口酒。"我在想我的老伙计巴——

"Shinji… you're not making any sense…"
真嗣…你这话完全说不通啊…

"…thinking maybe he was rightfully named the liberator…"
…思索着，或许他被称为解放者确实当之无愧…

"What do you me—" 你想说什么——

"I mean that it's time for me to shuffle away form this mortal coil, one way or another…it also means you are today's big winner."
我想说的是，现在是我该告别这尘世的时候了，不论以何种方式……同时，这也意味着你是今天的赢家。

"Listen, Shinji, I've had a rough day today and I re—"
真嗣，听我说，我今天过得很不顺，我得重—

"Rough day? Let me tell you about rough days…" Shinji said, chuckling, taking another drink. "I am this close to actually getting a get out of jail free card." Shinji said, as he got up, separating his thumb and forefinger by a mere inch, even if Asuka couldn't see the action.
"今天过得很糟吗？我来给你讲讲什么叫糟透了的日子……" 真嗣边笑边又喝了一口。"我差点就能弄到一张免罪金牌了。" 他站起身，拇指和食指仅隔一寸，尽管明日香看不见这个手势。

"I mean, everything was going according to what I have planned so far…" He paused as he heard the rumbling of the rain as it started to fall in the city. "But it's true what they say… the best laid plans..."
我是说，一切到目前为止都按计划顺利进行……" 他顿了顿，耳边传来城市中雨点开始落下的轰鸣声。"不过，确实如人所言……再周密的计划也……

Shinji too another drink, feeling the familiar warmth of the wine coursing through his veins... waiting and noticing as it permeated, expecting for the cells to give way and cancel out the day.
真嗣再次举杯，感受着葡萄酒熟悉的暖意在体内流淌……静静等待，察觉到它逐渐渗透，期待着身体的细胞能因此放松，驱散这一天的疲惫。

"So you see… I'm at my rope's end here… every time I tried setting someone up to finally leave, Eris seemed to have a yang for my choices." Shinji said as he scanned the streets below from his window.
"你看，我真是黔驴技穷了…每次我设法安排人离开，厄里斯似乎总能洞察我的意图。" 真嗣说着，目光从窗户投向街道。

"I mean, there was this waitress, cute as a button, looked like a doll, and just as she was walking to a customer I pointed out, she slips and crashes all of the drinks on him." He paused for a moment, taking another drink.
"我是说，有位女服务员，可爱极了，模样像个洋娃娃。就在她端着饮料走向一位顾客时，我刚一指，她就不慎滑倒，把饮料全洒在了那人身上。"他顿了顿，又抿了一口酒。

"There was also a couple of kids; one was going on and on about how he liked to build domes in the sand box and the girl would come and stomp on it… and since there wasn't any rules about ages, I figured schoolyard romance so I tried to steer them in the right direction…"
那里还有几个小孩；其中一个滔滔不绝地说他喜欢在沙箱里堆建沙堡，而女孩则会过来一脚踩扁……既然没有年龄限制的规定，我猜这可能是校园里的青涩情愫，便尝试引导他们往正确的方向发展……

He took another pause, waiting for Asuka to jump at him, to say something.
他又停顿了一下，期待着明日香扑向他，或是说点什么。

But, again, only silence.
然而，依旧是一片沉默。

"So instead, the kid ended up in a fight against the little girl, and their mothers are gonna sue each other for damages."
结果，孩子和小女孩打了起来，两家的母亲都打算起诉对方，要求赔偿损失。

"Obviously not a way to start on the path of true love…" The irony in Asuka's answer was as physical as the railing of the window Shinji was grasping now.
"显然，这不是开启真爱之旅的正确方式……"明日香回答中的讽刺意味，就如同真嗣此刻紧握的窗栏一般真实而具体。

"Oh, well, then I shouldn't be too worried about it, Miss Relationship Expert…" Shinji said in a somber tone. "After all, you and your mother might be right… Cupid has been replaced by cards and chocolates… real love has been replaced by chat rooms and onanism"
哦，好吧，看来我不用太担心了，关系专家小姐……" 真嗣语气沉重地说。"毕竟，你和你母亲说的或许没错……丘比特已被贺卡和巧克力所取代，真正的爱情已被聊天室和自我慰藉所替代

He paused to get some air, before continuing, not caring about why Asuka kept quiet. "So, a full three hours of personal bliss, freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy, or wine and I should be cured, right?"
他停下脚步，深吸一口气，接着往下说，并不关心明日香为何沉默。“也就是说，通过疯狂、狂喜或酒精，沉浸在整整三个小时的个人极乐中，摆脱日常的自我，我应该就能康复了吧？”

"I don't know, Shinji. You tell me." Asuka said simply, her tone betraying the fact that she really could care less.
"我不清楚，真嗣。你自己说吧。" 明日香直截了当地说，语气中流露出她对此并不太关心的态度。

"That's right." Shinji nodded, pausing for a second or two. "No more immortality, no more scores, no more true love, no more Cupid." Beneath him, people came and go. Singles becoming couples, then couples becoming groups. Young and old and children all hurrying, scurrying going to restaurants and cafes and karaoke bars.
"没错。" 真嗣点头，稍作停顿。"不再追求永生，不再计较分数，不再寻找真爱，不再有爱神丘比特。" 他脚下，人们穿梭不息。单身者结为伴侣，伴侣又聚成群体。无论老少，都在匆忙中涌向餐馆、咖啡厅和卡拉 OK。

"End of delusion and all thanks to you. So, I thought I should call and say congratulations." He said simply, walking back to the inside of the apartment and taking the phone from his ear, ready to end the call when Asuka's voice made him stop.
"幻想的终结，多亏了你。因此，我觉得应该打个电话来道贺。"他简短地说完，便走回公寓内，正要将电话从耳边拿开准备挂断，飞鸟的声音却让他停住了动作。

"Shinji… are you home?" 真嗣…你在家吗？

"Why do you a—" Shinji answered when a knock on the door interrupted him, making his way to it and opening said door to reveal Dr. Asuka Langley Sohryu on the other side, drenched from head to toe and dripping rain water on the hallway and staring at him with an expression of anger on her face as she slowly ended the call.
"你为什么——" 真嗣正要回答，却被敲门声打断。他走过去开门，只见门外站着浑身湿透、雨水滴落在走廊上的明日香·兰格雷博士，她怒目而视，缓缓挂断了电话。

She hiccuped, brushing the back of her hand over her already reddened eyes, leaning against the frame of the door slowly.
她打了个嗝，用手背轻抚着已经泛红的双眼，身体缓缓倚靠在门框上。

Shinji noticed the smell of alcohol coming from her; her face clothes, small splashes of dark on her pristine white shirt, almost as if she had too much to dri— "Thanks to you I lost my job."
真嗣察觉到她身上飘来的酒气；她脸上，洁白衬衫上隐约可见的深色斑点，像是饮酒过量时不慎溅上的——“因为你，我失去了工作。”

"Wh-what?" 什么？

"I lost my job!" Asuka shouted, rushing past a still drunk Shinji. "I was supposed to go there and tell them you were crazy! That you were a danger to society! That you were better off being chemically castrated, having a lobotomy… anything but being left to wander out in the open!"
我失业了！" 明日香喊着，从还醉醺醺的真嗣身边匆匆跑过。"我本该去告诉他们你疯了，对社会构成威胁！你最好接受化学阉割，或者做个脑叶切除手术……绝不能让你再这样在外面游荡！

Shinji simply stared at her as Asuka felt the range and anger slowly leaving her body, her breathing coming out in jagged, shallow pants.
真嗣默默地注视着她，明日香感到怒气和愤懑正缓缓从身体中退去，呼吸急促而浅薄。

"A-Asuka I didn't kn—" A-Asuka 我不太清楚—

"Shut it." Asuka simply said as she walked out, toweling her hair. "I was this close of coming and telling you to go to hell, I came to the bar and looked for you. And Misato said you were gone."
关掉。" 明日香边说边走出去，用毛巾擦着湿漉漉的头发。"我差点就过来让你滚蛋，我去了酒吧找你，结果 Misato 说你已经离开了。

Shinji stared dumbly at her. "And you were worried?"
真嗣愣愣地望着她，说："你之前还担心呢？"

"Of course I was worried you idiot! I'm still in charge of you, even if I have lost my job, I'm still legally in charge of you!" She grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and began to shake him as much as she could.
"我当然担心你这个傻瓜！即便我失业了，我依旧是你的法定监护人，还得对你负责！"她一把揪住他的后颈，用力摇晃起来。

"Do you have any idea of what is that? Do you even care of something other than your grand plan? I still don't know how I haven't been able to get through with you! A number of people have benefited from my advice, you know." Asuka said, looking almost like a little girl pouting, the only thing missing was her stomping her foot.
"你明白那是什么吗？你除了自己的宏伟计划，还关心其他事吗？我始终搞不懂，为何就是无法与你沟通！要知道，许多人已经从我的建议中获益了。"明日香说道，神情宛如一个撅嘴的小女孩，只差没跺脚了。

"Will I ever be something more than a thesis statement for you?"
我对你而言，是否能超越一个简单的论点？

"Well, you know what? that's funny, because the thousands of people who read my books and my column think so." Asuka said as she staggered towards Shinji. "The people who pay me to counsel them think so, and you know who else thinks so? The people who put me in charge of saying if you are or aren't crazy."
哎，你知道吗？这事儿挺逗的，因为成千上万读过我书和专栏的人都这么看。那些花钱请我做咨询的人也这么认为，你猜还有谁这么认为？就是那些让我来裁定你精神是否正常的人。

"So you think I'm crazy?"
你是不是觉得我疯了？

"It doesn't matter what I think or don't think…" Asuka answered, turning her back on him. "As of 6.00 p.m. today, I am no longer associated with the Health and Welfare Ministry."
我怎么想或不怎么想都无关紧要……" 明日香背对着他说，"从今天下午 6 点起，我与卫生福利部再无瓜葛。

"But then why did you came here?"
但后来你为何来到这里？

"Because until the clock hits midnight today, in about 10 more minutes…" Asuka said simply, shrugging. "I am still legally bound to you. And even if I lost my job, I will not be sent to jail in case you decide to do something stupid and kill yourself. Besides… all this time I've wanted to ask you…"
因为直到今天午夜的钟声响起，大概还有 10 分钟……" 明日香简单地说着，耸了耸肩。"我依然在法律上与你绑定。即便我失去了工作，若你做出什么愚蠢的决定，比如结束自己的生命，我也不会因此被投入监狱。还有……其实我一直想问你……

"Ask me..?" 问我吧..?

"Why do you do it?"
你为什么要这么做呢？

"What?" 什么？

"This…" She said, gesturing around, yet at nothing at all. "All… this."
这…" 她环顾四周，手势空泛，仿佛指向虚空。"所有…这一切。

"Don't you ever notice it?" Shinji said simply. "Don't you crave the attention?"
你难道从未察觉到这一点吗？" 真嗣直截了当地说。"你难道不渴望得到关注吗？

"Attention…" Asuka repeated, obviously not following. Asuka began to look at Shinji, finally noticing something. He got up, stumbling, his legs feeling like lead but his hand still clutching the bottle as if his life depended on it.
"注意…" 明日香重复着，显然有些困惑。她转而看向真嗣，终于察觉到了异样。他艰难地站起来，步履蹒跚，双腿沉重得像灌了铅，但手里依旧紧紧抓着那个瓶子，仿佛那是他的生命线。

"Everyday we pass a thousand people on the street, right?" There was a quiet desperation in his voice, something palpable, something that could be tasted, like a bitter sticky substance coating his soul. "Any one of them could be our one, but we're too preoccupied to notice. We don't see one another. That's your thousand people out there. Every one of them… but none of them are willing to take the plunge… not even me…"
每天我们在街上与无数人擦肩而过，不是吗？"他的声音里藏着一种难以言说的绝望，那种触手可及、仿佛能尝到的苦涩，黏附在他的灵魂上。"他们中的任何一个都可能是我们的命中注定，只是我们太过忙碌，无暇顾及。我们彼此视而不见。那就是你所说的街上的千人。他们中的每一个……却无人愿意迈出那一步……连我也不例外……

"Tell me, why are you doing this because you believe that for each couple you match up, you will win a… what? A mark? A tally? A bead?"
告诉我，你这么做是出于什么信念？每成功撮合一对情侣，你就能得到什么？一个记号？一次计数？还是一颗珠子？

"N-no…" 不…

"And when you get a hundred of them, you will magically transport back to Olympus to resume your life of leisure."
一旦集齐一百个，你便会神奇地返回奥林匹斯，继续享受悠闲生活。

"No… I mean… I- I have absolutely no reason to be here. I ju—"
不…我是说…我-我真的没有理由在这里。我刚—

"So that's it?" She asked. "It that what this is all about?"
就这样了吗？"她问道，"这就是全部内容？

"N-no, I mean—" 不，我是说—

"Some kind of challenge? A phallic argument over seeing who is the alpha male? Do you have issues with you father? Were you abused as a child?" Asuka asked each question, punctuating by poking Shinji in the chest.
"某种挑战吗？关于谁是雄性领袖的争论？你和你父亲之间有矛盾吗？你小时候受过虐待吗？" 明日香每提出一个问题，都会用手指戳一下真嗣的胸口。

"Then tell me why!" Asuka asked sharply.
"那你说说为什么！" 明日香尖锐地问道。

"I don't know All right!" Shinji shouted, looking at her. "I don't know! All I know is that…"
我不清楚，行了吧！" 真嗣大声说道，目光紧盯着她。"我真的不知道！我只明白……

"What!?" 什么！？

"It's broken." Shinji said suddenly, staring at her with a different face, almost as if enlighten had reached him by chance.
"它坏了。" 真嗣突然说道，目光中带着一丝顿悟，仿佛意外地触及了某种启示。

"What?" 什么？

"It's broken." Shinji said looking at everything with a new light. "My heart was broken."
它坏了。" 真嗣说着，眼中映出全新的景象。"我的心已碎。

"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
这究竟是什么意思？

"I wasn't able to take the pain." Shinji said a his eyes kept looking around, not focusing on anything, almost as if the words were coming by themselves. "I had to heal my heart. I had to heal all the broken hearts…"
我承受不了那份痛苦。" 真嗣说着，眼神飘忽不定，似乎这些话不由自主地脱口而出。"我得疗愈自己的心。我得疗愈所有受伤的心……

"I don't—" Asuka began before she licked her lips, trying to learn more, trying to understand more. "Maybe you're here because you are the end of Eros himself, the embodiment of the idea of how love is blind, and now you have noticed that love isn't blind…"
我本来想说——" 明日香开口时舔了舔嘴唇，她渴望深入了解，渴望领悟更多。"也许你出现在此，是因为你象征着爱神厄洛斯之终结，体现了爱情盲目这一理念，而今你察觉到爱情并非真的盲目……

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"I mean that maybe… you loved someone and you weren't loved back, and maybe that was because you weren't meant to be, and you have to accept that not every love story has a happy ending." Asuka said softly. "And this is for you to simply move forward and forget all of this."
我是说，可能…你曾深爱某人，却未被同等爱回，这或许是因为你们注定无缘，你得接受不是每段爱情都能圆满收场。" 明日香温柔地说，"这是为了让你能轻松前行，将这一切抛诸脑后。

"You think you can get love that way? That you can make love go away? That you can find it through websites and show it with chocolates and flowers and presents and cards?"
你以为爱是这么容易得到的吗？以为爱可以随意丢弃？以为通过网络就能寻觅到它，用巧克力、鲜花、礼物和贺卡来展示它？

"No, I think that there's a huge advantage of getting someone with a like-minded profile."
不，我觉得找到一个思维相近的人选大有裨益。

"For you maybe." Shinji said bitterly. "Your problem is that you stick everyone into these neat little psychological shoe boxes."
对你而言或许如此。" 碇真嗣苦涩地说道，"你的毛病是，总把人硬塞进那些刻板的心理分类中。

"Like what?" 比如说什么？

"Needy co-dependant, insensitive aggressor, insecure narcissistic, delusional psychotic…"
依赖性强的人，冷酷的侵略者，缺乏安全感的自恋者，妄想症患者……

"If the shoe box fits…" Asuka smirked at him.
"要是这鞋盒正合适……"飞鸟冲他狡黠一笑。

"You know what?" Shinji said as Asuka took the bottle form him and gave it a drink. "You just can't pick a profile and assume that it'll get the job done."
你知道吗？" 真嗣说着，明日香从他手里接过瓶子喝了一口。"不能随便挑个配置就以为它能胜任。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"Th— they're just— they're facts." Shinji simply stared at her, noticing for the first time what could be his salvation. "They have nothing to do with heat or chemistry or the stuff that makes up love."
那— 那些只是— 那些都是事实。" 真嗣只是凝视着她，首次意识到这或许是他得救的关键。"它们与热度、化学或构成爱的那些东西无关。

"Love isn't brains!" Shinji said simply, as he pointed to his temple, almost as if his thumb and forefinger were mimicking a gun. "It doesn't think or rationalize. Love isn't logical, it's not supposed to make sense!"
爱情不是靠脑子！" 真嗣直截了当地说，他指着太阳穴，拇指和食指的动作仿佛在模仿一把枪。"它不思考，也不讲道理。爱情本就无逻辑可言，它不需要合理！

"Love is supposed to be spontaneous, not clinically proven." Shinji said sitting down dejectedly, looking at the burning candle, at the paper that still showed him a "99" nearby, at the clock ticking away, watching as it was slowly ending.
"爱情本该是自然而然的，而非经过临床验证。" 真嗣沮丧地坐下，目光凝视着燃烧的蜡烛，旁边那张依旧显示着"99"的纸，以及滴答流逝的时钟，眼睁睁看着一切正逐渐落幕。

"Love is supposed to be found by catching someone's attention in a sharp, hard undeniable way! Like walking around and hugging someone you don't know, or telling them to have a nice day… it's little small details that I can't do because I'm not allowed to do so!"
爱情理应通过一种尖锐、强烈且不容置疑的方式吸引某人的注意！比如在街上拥抱一个陌生人，或是对他们说一声祝你有个美好的一天……这些微小的细节我无法做到，因为我没有权利这么做！

"Love is love…" He said as he pressed his hand against his chest. "It's guts and feelings and gravity and pull… love is blood…" He continued, leaning forward to be eye level with Asuka, his free hand against the edge of the table while the other one clasped his chest. "Blood screaming inside you to work its will."
爱就是爱……" 他边说边把手放在胸前，"它包含勇气、情感、引力和牵引……爱如同血液……" 他倾身向前，与明日香目光相接，一手撑在桌沿，另一手紧贴胸膛。"血液在你体内呐喊，渴望实现其意志。

Shinji staggered in front of her, kneeling while Asuka simply kept that dumb detached look any drunk person has, wondering if this was a dream or if this was a joke, until Shinji started talking again.
真嗣在她面前踉跄地跪下，而明日香则是一脸醉酒后常见的茫然表情，心中疑惑这是否只是一场梦或玩笑，直到真嗣再次说话。

"Aren't you tied of it all?" Shinji said fervently almost as if the warmth of the wine on his body had turned into a fire raging within, a fever of epic proportions that felt as though he was going to be eaten alive by the feelings that were crashing and colliding, mixing and becoming one and more and all and nothing at the same time.
"难道你对这一切还不感到厌倦吗？" 真嗣热切地说道，仿佛体内的酒温化作了一团熊熊燃烧的火焰，一种史诗般的狂热让他感觉自己即将被汹涌澎湃、交织融合、既是一切又空无一物的情感所吞噬。

Asuka couldn't think straight, couldn't really understand any of it, all she cold do was stare at those blue eyes that seemed right now to hold onto the greatest mysteries of lives long gone, almost as if Shinji had been covering his face all this time, like she had never seen the real him underneath; not the meek and overly apologetic man, but someone who had a calm and focused face, someone who finally knew—
明日香思绪混乱，难以理解眼前的一切。她只能凝视着那双蓝眼睛，它们此刻似乎承载着久远生命的深邃秘密，仿佛真嗣一直隐藏着真面目，她从未窥见其真实一面；不是那个怯懦且频频道歉的形象，而是拥有平静专注神情的人，一个终于领悟——

"What I am doing here is finding myself." Shinji said, as if reading her thoughts. "I'm tired of talking."
我在这里是为了找回自己。" 真嗣说道，仿佛看透了她的想法。"我已经厌倦了无休止的交谈。

They stood like that for a moment; Asua opened her mouth, licked her lips, her eyes going from Shinji's serious face t his half closed lips as she leaned in almost at the same time Shinji mirrored her move.
他们静静地站了一会儿，阿苏亚张开嘴，轻舔唇瓣，目光从真嗣严肃的脸庞移向他半闭的双唇，随即她倾身靠近，而真嗣也几乎同时模仿了她的动作。

Until a loud thunder clap smashed the silence to non existence, and the lights outside went out with a shower of sparks as something, presumably a transformer from a light post, exploded into the night, plunging the apartment into a darkness so dense the only light was the one form the candle in the middle of the dinning table.
直到一声震耳欲聋的雷鸣，打破了四周的寂静，外面的灯光随着一串火花熄灭，很可能是路灯的变压器在夜空中爆炸，导致公寓陷入一片深邃的黑暗，唯一的光亮来自餐桌中央的蜡烛。

But that was more than enough to have an effect on Asuka, as she got up with a jump, the spell now broken, the trance long gone.
然而，这已足够对明日香产生影响，她突然一跃而起，咒语解除，恍惚状态不复存在。

"L-look I just… I really... I need to go home, okay?" Asuka said as she realized in a startled rush of adrenaline the implications of her being drunk and alone with someone who was her patient and—
"听着，我...我真的...我必须回家了，好吗？" 明日香突然意识到自己醉酒且与曾是她病人的某人独处的严重性，一阵惊慌的肾上腺素让她急切地说道。

"I have to go home, that's what I have to do."
我得回家了，这是我的当务之急。

"Don't you get tired of it?" Shinji asked, not regarding or not caring fr what Asuka had said, desperate, hungry, prowling.
"你难道不觉得厌烦吗？" 真嗣问道，对明日香的话置若罔闻，他显得绝望而饥渴，四处游荡。

"Shinji, what do you mean?"
真嗣，你这话是什么意思？

"Don't you get tired of talking and posturing and building walls?"

"I do—"

"Don't you get tired of talking?"

"No, I don't." Asuka said as she held her hand to her head. "Shinji what are yo—"
不，我没有。" 明日香捂着头说道，"真嗣，你这是在做什么——

"Well I do." Shinji simply responded in a calm, subdued voice, echoes of times and waves crashing by, of rivers and honey and epic long wars held in his voice and for a moment Asuka—

错误原因

"I don't want to talk anymore."

Before she could say anything else, Shinji raised his hands and grabbed her by her biceps, the alcohol and the anger finally breaking the self contained barrier he had been wearing, the depression, the notice, the idea of him becoming a mortal finally mattering to him as little as wasted air.
她还没来得及再说什么，真嗣就举起双手，紧紧抓住她的双臂，酒精和愤怒终于冲破了自我约束的防线。抑郁、通知，以及意识到自己终将沦为凡人的念头，对他来说已变得如同废弃的空气一般无关紧要。

Before he finally kissed her.
他终于吻了她。

Asuka's eyes were open wide at the shock and surprise before a warm sensation of something familiar, something melting away from within her, like a lead blanket that had been wrapped around her began to slowly slip away.
明日香因震惊和惊讶而瞪大了双眼，紧接着，一种熟悉的温暖感从心底涌起，仿佛束缚她的沉重铅毯正逐渐消融。

She staggered back as Shinji kept her face with his, his hands traveling form her arms to her neck to her face cupping lovingly and delicately and fiercely and possessively at the same time, until the wall stopped their retreat. Asuka held up before she slid down the wall, Shinji following suit as he held on top of her, kissing her for all it was worth, for all that could be lost and for all that could be gained.
她步履蹒跚地后退，真嗣的脸紧贴着她的，双手温柔而激烈地从她的手臂抚至脖颈，再至脸颊，充满占有欲地捧着。墙壁挡住了他们的退路。明日香力竭，顺着墙滑坐下去，真嗣也跟着俯身，紧紧拥住她，倾尽全力地吻她，既为了可能失去的一切，也为了可能得到的一切。

Mortality for falling in love with a mortal wasn't anymore a fear, nor was it to be held in a fragile container such as this.
爱上凡人不再意味着死亡的威胁，也不再被束缚于这样脆弱的牢笼之中。

Shinji realized the lesson to b learned and so he held onto Asuka, kissing her, as all around him th winds form the storm began to pick up, thunder and lightning showing up as the wind forced open the windows, making the papers inside the room fly in a circular formation.
真嗣明白了要吸取的教训，便紧紧拥抱着明日香，与她亲吻。此时，四周的风势渐强，雷鸣电闪，狂风将窗户吹开，屋内的纸张随之在空中旋转飘扬。

Shinji caught sight out of the corner of his eyes as the small parchment he had been thumbing changed numbers from a "99" to "100", before it caught the flame of the candle and disintegrated in a flash of light and smoke, not even leaving ashes behind.
真嗣无意中瞥见手中把玩的小羊皮纸上的数字从“99”跳到了“100”，紧接着它被烛火点燃，瞬间在一片光与烟的闪烁中消失无踪，连一丝灰烬都未留下。

And then, the last candle was blown off, and their whole world was plunged into darkness.
接着，最后一支蜡烛熄灭，他们的世界顿时一片漆黑。

AN: Hmm… don't know where this came from. Oh, well, I pledge drunkenness on Shinji's part... really why should Asuka always be the one drunk?
嗯……搞不清这是哪儿来的。算了，我赌真嗣会醉倒……凭什么总是明日香喝得烂醉呢？

In any event Happy Valentine's days to all. Thanks go to Himonky, Fresh C, and Fraulein Kaname Langley for prereading this. The story is taken form a very good romantic comedy drama series called Cupid (Not mine, but Rob Thomas, Columbia Tri-Star and Mandalay)

### Chapter 11 Themes: K#25 (Fence), W#11 (Games)
主题：K#25（栅栏），W#11（娱乐游戏）

Title: Of Circumstances 标题：环境因素

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or Hamtaro. This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, lets take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
A.N.: 我在此声明免责：Eva 和 Hamtaro 并非我所拥有。这个小小的玩笑源于我试图突破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，当时我（不明智地）对自己说：“自己，让我们同时挑战两件事：在一篇故事中融合 30 个吻和 30 种情节。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

Walking home from school had never been a chore for Shinji.
放学步行回家，对真嗣而言从未感到过负担。

At least not until he had known Asuka. Ever since that fateful moment he had been introduced to her, and ever since they had been living on the same building, everything that had been easy as pie changed into something more... complex; walking home had been a simple routine he had always loved doing, and also his favorite moment because he was able to do some quiet introspection, think and not be forced to partake in any sort of sharing of his thoughts.
至少在结识明日香之前，他的生活还是一帆风顺。自从那次偶然的相遇，自从他们同住一栋楼，原本轻松愉快的生活变得错综复杂；步行回家曾是他的日常乐趣，也是他享受独处思考的宝贵时光，无需与人交流心声。

"Hey idiot, Hurry up." 喂，快点儿，别磨蹭了。

Now however, for the sake of keeping appearances, he had to do it ever so often, and it was slowly getting on his nerves.
但现在为了顾全面子，他不得不频繁为之，这逐渐让他感到心烦意乱。

"Say, Miss Asuka... Why do you always call Shinji an idiot?"
对了，明日香小姐，你为什么总爱叫真嗣笨蛋呢？

Asuka stopped short and turned to look at Nozomi Horaki, walking hand in hand with her sister giving her a serious (for a six year old) and cursory glance.
明日香突然止步，转头望向堀其一子，她正牵着妹妹的手，用六岁孩子特有的严肃而匆忙的眼神匆匆一瞥。

"That's because he is an idiot, 'Zomi."
那是因为他太愚蠢了，'Zomi。

Asuka turned to look at the smiling innocent face of the girl holding onto her right hand before smiling back at Mariko Suzuhara, sharing the known smile of someone who had the correct answer at the right time. Nozomi, however didn't seem so sure, and Mari could see this in her face; they have been best friends all of their lives (Or at least since first grade) but she still couldn't understand how Nozomi sometimes couldn't accept what Asuka was saying.
明日香转头望向紧握她右手、面露纯真笑容的女孩，随即回以微笑，与铃原万理子共享了那种恰逢其时掌握答案的会心一笑。然而，希似乎心存疑虑，万理从她的表情中察觉到了这一点；她们自幼便是挚友（至少从一年级起），但万理始终不解希为何有时难以接受明日香的观点。

After all it was a know fact boys had cooties; logic would dictate that this was because they were idiots and perverts. And while Mari had no clue what the second one meant (And she had heard stupid Toji say that Miss Asuka would definitely kill any pervert that would come near her when he had mentioned something about pictures of Miss Asuka), she accepted that as a given; idiots and perverts went together like peanut butter and jelly and so she figured her idol was always right, and therefore that answer satisfied the young girl's curiosity.
毕竟大家都知道，男孩们身上有所谓的“虱子”；按照逻辑推理，这应该是因为他们既愚蠢又下流。虽然玛丽并不明白“下流”具体指什么（她记得那个笨蛋东治曾说过，明日香小姐肯定会干掉任何敢靠近她的下流家伙，当时他提到了一些关于明日香小姐的照片），但她还是接受了这一说法；在她看来，愚蠢和下流就像花生酱和果冻一样是绝配，因此她坚信自己的偶像总是正确的，这个答案也让她的小小心灵得到了满足。

Nozomi thought about it for a second, turning to look at the aforementioned idiot who was currently carrying his own books bags, as well as the backpacks of the girls who were ahead of him, and frowned clearly not convinced of the flimsy, fuzzy logic her friend thought as absolute dogma.
望月思索片刻，侧目望向那个正背着书包，还帮前方的女生们提着背包的笨蛋，明显对朋友那套似是而非的逻辑不以为然，觉得那是绝对的真理。

"Asuka!" Hikari said suddenly, frowning at her while the redhead simply turned at smiled apologetically at both Horaki girls. Nozomi simply looked at both the redhead and her best friend Mari, a look far too serious in the small face of the shorter, glasses-wearing girl.
"Asuka!" 光突然喊道，眉头紧锁地盯着她，而那位红发少女只是转过身，向两位堀木家的女孩歉然一笑。希则静静地注视着红发少女和她最亲密的朋友玛丽，那张戴着眼镜的小脸上流露出与年龄不符的严肃。

"What?" 什么？

"That's not a very nice thing to say." Nozomi said, ignoring her sister and Asuka, after all, if they wanted to behave like children, she wasn't going to stop them; Nozomi had more important things to do, like educate Mari.
"说这种话可不太好。" 希美说道，对姐姐和飞鸟的举动视而不见，既然她们要像孩子一样行事，她也不打算干涉；希美还有更重要的事，比如教导真理。

"Oh please, he is an idiot!" Mari said with conviction, her mannerism mirroring those of Asuka; hands in hips, legs parted and with a glare that looked scarier enough on the Suzuhara girl regardless of size or age, getting a smiling approval from Asuka and a grumbled answer from Shinji who made him the target of Mari's tongue being stuck out at him.
"哦，得了吧，他简直是个傻瓜！"玛丽坚定地说，她的姿势与明日香惊人地相似：双手叉腰，双腿微分，那锐利的眼神，无论年纪大小，都让铃原家的女孩显得格外吓人。明日香对此露出赞许的微笑，而真嗣则收到了玛丽对他吐舌头的挑衅，他不满地嘟囔着回应。

"But he's Toji's best friend, you should be good to him." Nozomi tried to draw some sense on her friend, who was busy arranging her short hair in a high ponytail held at the side of her head, discarding the dumb yellow hat which Shinji wordlessly took before putting it inside of Mari's Hamtaro book bag.
"但他毕竟是东治的挚友，你应当善待他。"希美试图劝导她的朋友，此时她的朋友正忙着将短发束成侧边的高马尾，随手丢弃了那顶黄色的傻帽，而真嗣则默默地接过帽子，将其放入真理的哈姆太郎书包中。

Mari simply stared at Hikari before turning to seek confirmation of her idol, which made Hikari in turn glare at Asuka, shaking her head disapprovingly while Nozomi did the exact same thing in a eerily synchronized way, which would have normally made the redhead laugh at them; this time, however it made Asuka simply sigh before she nodded, not needing to see Hikari anymore to know her best friend was still staring at her intently.
玛丽凝视着光片刻后，转向确认她的偶像，这使得光也回瞪明日香，摇头表示不满，而希美也以一种令人毛骨悚然的同步方式做出相同反应，这在平时定会让红发女孩发笑；但这次，明日香只是叹息一声，然后点头，无需再看光便知她挚友仍在紧盯着自己。

"Hikari is right... we shouldn't pick on the boy for being an idiot."
光说得没错...我们不应该因为那男孩笨就欺负他。

"B-but Miss Asuka!" Mari whined, drawing the "a" at the end for extra feeling, feeling the need to stand by her initial assessment of Shinji, even if he was a good guy who would help her with classes when he wasn't busy getting beaten at videogames by both Asuka and herself.
"可是，明日香小姐！" 玛丽拖长声音抱怨，特意拉长"啊"的尾音以增强情感表达，她觉得自己应该坚持对真嗣的第一印象，虽然他是个乐于助人的好男孩，在不被她和明日香在电子游戏中击败的空闲时间里，还会帮她辅导功课。

"Mari." asuka tried once more but the girl shook her head.
"玛丽。" 阿苏卡又试了一次，然而女孩还是摇头拒绝了。

"Look at him! He's a dork!" Mari began, pointing at Shinji who simply rolled his eyes at the younger girl's antics. "He's not cool and has dumb hair and needs to cut it and sucks at videogames and he stutters a lot an-"
瞧他那样！真是个书呆子！" 玛丽指着真嗣说道，真嗣对这位小姑娘的闹腾只是翻了个白眼。"他一点也不酷，头发乱糟糟的，该剪了，电子游戏也玩不好，说话还老结巴，

Shinji simply frowned at every passing derogatory comment before Asuka wordlessly grabbed Mari's shoulder, making Toji's sister shut and look at the redhead.
真嗣对每句经过的贬低话只是皱了皱眉，随后明日香默默地抓住了玛丽的肩膀，使得东治的妹妹闭上嘴，转头看向这位红发少女。

"Ease up on him, Mari." Asuka said simply before looking straight at Shinji's eyes.
"对真嗣宽容一点，玛丽。" 明日香说完，直直地望向真嗣的眼睛。

"He might be a dummy, but he's a good dummy." She added quietly, hoping no one heard clearly enough.
"他虽是个傀儡，却是个称职的傀儡。"她低声说道，暗自希望没人听清。

"Huh?" 嗯？

"Nothing!" 什么也没有！

Mari stared at Asuka, her eyebrows knitting in confusion as she tried to understand what was Asuka trying to get at, before a light bulb literally was turned on in her head.
玛丽凝视着明日香，眉头因困惑而紧皱，努力揣摩明日香的意图，忽然间，她脑海中灵光一闪。

"Oh I get it, you need him happy so he can make you supper and do your chores." She said smiling a lopsided smile. "I always do that with stupid Toji."
哦，我懂了，你是想让他心情好，好让他给你做饭，帮你干家务。" 她歪着嘴角笑道，"我总是这样对付笨笨的 Toji。

"Wh-? No!" Asuka exclaimed before she blushed at the passing glances of the people around her, muttered chuckles with the words "crazy" "exchange" "students" mixed with the sighs and hopes of being young again.
"什么？不！" 明日香脱口而出，随即因旁人的目光而脸颊泛红，周围隐约传来带着"疯狂"、"交换生"等字眼的轻笑，以及对逝去青春的叹息与憧憬。

"Then? You need his help at school?" Mari said in the same tone, smiling an opened mouth smile that showed a missing tooth, giving it an endearing look, before frowning. "I tried it once and Toji helped and I got a really low grade on that class. Ever since then, Miss Hikari helps me."
那后来呢？你在学校需要他帮忙吗？"玛丽用同样的口吻说着，她张嘴一笑，露出一颗缺了的牙齿，显得格外亲切，随后眉头一皱。"我曾尝试过一次，Toji 帮了我，但那门课我成绩很差。自那以后，Hikari 老师就一直辅导我了。

"No Mari." Nozomi said with a long suffering sigh, as if her having to deal with her normally hyperactive friend's antics cause the smaller, almost miniature version of Hikari a growing head ache. "She wants you to let her boyfriend in peace."
没有 Mari。"希子长叹一声，似乎在忍受着通常活泼好动的朋友带来的困扰，这让身材娇小的她感到头痛加剧。"她希望你别再打扰她男朋友了。

"WHAT!?" The twin exclamations of Mari and Asuka overshadowed Hikari's giggle and Shinji's own gasp of surprise. "B-But..."
什么！？" 玛丽和明日香的惊呼声同时响起，压过了光的小声笑和真嗣的惊讶声。"但是...

"It is rather obvious." Nozomi continued, happy with the chance to use the newest words she had learned while thumbing though Kodama books; longer, bigger, fancier words were what smart girls in higher grades used; they also seemed to make Mari frown and decide that whatever anyone who used them might say was probably true.
"这很明显。"Nozomi 接着说，她很高兴能用上从 Kodama 的书中学到的新词；那些更长、更复杂、更华丽的词汇，是高年级聪明女孩的标志；这些词汇似乎也让 Mari 皱起眉头，认为使用它们的人所说的话多半是真的。

"But that's not possible!" Mari said with all the conviction she could muster staring at Shinji and then at Asuka before pointing at both with her finger. "H-he's idiot Shinji! A-and she's Miss Asuka! Why would she want to go out with boys!"
但这不可能啊！"玛丽坚定地说，她先看向真嗣，接着转向明日香，然后用手指着他们俩。"他可是个笨蛋真嗣！而她是明日香小姐！她怎么会想和男生约会呢！

At this the three teens smirked, seeing Mari shudder at the mention of boys, whispering under breath other adjectives such as "ick" and "gross".
此言一出，三名少年相视而笑，见玛丽提及男生时浑身一颤，她轻声嘀咕着“恶心”、“讨厌”之类的词。

"Besides, if Miss Asuka has to have a boyfriend, it has to be someone cool, like Sousuk-"
再说了，要是明日香小姐非得有个男朋友，那也得是像草薙那种帅气的类型。

"He's an anime character!" Nozomi exclaimed while pinching her nose like she had seen adults do it; she thought it looked cool.
"他是个动漫角色！"希美模仿着大人的样子捏着鼻子，觉得这样很酷。

"Whatever!" Mari told her dorky friend; why was that dummy pinching her nose? Everyone knew you should pick at it if it bugged you.
"说什么呢！" 玛丽对她的笨拙朋友说；那个傻瓜干嘛捏她的鼻子？大家都知道，要是觉得不舒服，直接抠掉不就好了。

"Besides, Miss Asuka likes Shinji but she likes to hide the fact by being mean to him, just like you and Maru-"
另外，明日香小姐虽然喜欢真嗣，却总爱通过对他刻薄来掩饰这份感情，就像你和丸那样

"I d-don't like that idiot!" Mari interrupted Nozomi, blushing and turning away in a huff. "He's a big dumb meanie who is always pulling my hair and hiding my books and making me trip!"
我真不喜欢那个笨蛋！" 玛丽打断希美，脸颊泛红，气鼓鼓地扭过头去。"他是个又大又蠢又讨厌的家伙，老爱扯我头发，藏我的书，还故意让我摔跤！

Nozomi sighed theatrically, making her sister and Asuka giggle while Shinji simply felt like it would be better to let the two younger girls resolve this without him getting involved.
望月夸张地叹息，引得妹妹和明日香咯咯直笑，而真嗣则认为最好让这两位小姑娘自行解决，自己不介入为妙。

"Please, you're the one who does that to him." Nozomi said, not minding the fact that her best friend's face had a color that equaled Asuka's hair. "You always take his milk box at lunch and throw paper balls and pieces of chalk at him."
要知道，是你总这样对他。" 希美说道，全然不顾她好友脸上那与明日香发色相媲美的红晕。"你每次午餐都抢走他的牛奶盒，还朝他扔纸团和粉笔头。

"T-that's because he's a big dumb jerk."
那是因为他是个又大又蠢的混蛋。

"And you always scribble in his notebook with the red crayon. And you always push his seat when you have to go explain a lesson."
你总爱用红蜡笔在他的笔记本上乱画，每当要去讲解课程时，又总是推他的座位。

"T-that's..." Mari began trying to make Nozomi shut up. "That's because red is my favorite color a-and he is so fat I can't pass by his side whenev-"
T-那是……" 玛丽试图让希美别再说了。"那是因为红色是我最爱的颜色，而且他太胖了，我每次都过不去他身边。

"Not to mention that you always get angry when he picks Aki to play with him or when he gives her his cookie."
更不用说，每当他选阿基一起玩或把自己的饼干给她时，你总是会生气。

"W-well that's because Aki's dumb and she doesn't know him that good."
哎，这是因为阿基太笨了，她对他了解得不够透彻。

Without knowing, all five of them had reached entrance of the Horaki household, and Hikari, Asuka and Shinji stared at both small girls who kept arguing about one's attraction to her classmate while the other one denied it vehemently, red faced and fidgeting at every word. This continued back and forth until Hikari decided to make the two girls settle down, followed by Shinji giving them their book bags while Nozomi bowed respectfully at the brown haired boy to thank him, and Mari simply chucked her foot and mumbled a thank you.
不知不觉间，五人已站在洞崎家门前，光、明日香和真嗣目睹了两个小女孩的争执：一个极力表达对同班同学的好感，另一个则红着脸坚决否认，每句话都显得局促不安。争执持续了一阵，光出面让两人冷静，真嗣递上书包，望向棕发男孩鞠躬道谢，玛丽则是轻踢一脚，含糊地道了声谢。

"Sorry about these two." Hikari said smirking as the two girls raced inside with the promise of snacks and videogames after they finished their homework. "Apparently Mari has her eye on one of her classmates but she seems to be afraid to act on her feelings."
对这两位真是抱歉。"光带着一丝坏笑说道，两个女孩为了零食和电子游戏的诱惑，急忙跑进屋里去完成作业。"看来真理子对她的一位同学动了心，但又似乎不敢表露自己的情感。

"Yeah..." Shinji said simply to fill in the uncomfortable silence.
"嗯..." 真嗣简单地应了一声，试图打破这令人不安的沉默。

"Nozomi keeps telling her she's being childish at that, but you know her, she feels like she needs to act tough on principle." Hikari said with a practiced shrug of her shoulders, giving her best friend a very familiar look before looking at Shinji again. "Really childish, no?"
Nozomi 一直说她那样太幼稚，但你也了解她，她总觉得按原则得表现得坚强些。" Hikari 边说边熟练地耸肩，对好友投去一个熟悉的目光，随后又看向 Shinji。"确实挺幼稚的，对吧？

"Yeah, we got that." Asuka said dryly, turning to check her watch, ignoring Hikari's smirk directed at her.
"嗯，我们知道了。" 明日香淡淡地说，随即转头看表，对光那边的窃笑不予理会。

"Yeah, so childish and immature."
确实，太幼稚了，不够成熟。

Asuka mumbled something under her breath while Shinji simply bowed and said goodbye to Hikari.
明日香低声嘀咕着，真嗣则微微鞠躬，向光道别。

"By the way..." 对了，顺便提一下...

Both teens stopped short at Hikari's tone, turning to her. Only to have Shinji flinch as he saw the pigtailed girl's index finger pointed directly at him.
两位少年被光的声音吓了一跳，转头看向她。新二看到扎着马尾的女孩用食指直指自己，不禁一惊。

"Mari was right; your hair needs to be cut, remember school policy; I don't want to see you with that hair uncut or I'll have to give you a write up, Ikari-kun." She smirked at Shinji's shocked expression before turning to Asuka who was busy trying to hide her smirk behind her hands.
"玛丽说得没错；你的头发该剪了，别忘了学校的规定；我不想看到你留着那头乱发，否则我只能给你记过，碇君。" 她对真嗣震惊的表情微微一笑，随后看向正忙于用手遮掩笑意的明日香。

While his hairstyle was the same as usual; an adequate but messy cut, when Asuka looked at Shinji's face closer, she did notice it seemed to have grown quite a bit; the redhead was about to crack a joke at that, mentioning how his normal choir-boy 'do' was now starting to resemble more that crazy guy who was dressed in a green jumpsuit from that new anime about ninja's that had taken the nation by surprise.
虽然他的发型依旧，是个还算过得去但略显凌乱的剪裁，但当明日香更仔细地端详真嗣的脸庞时，她发现他的脸似乎变长了。她正打算调侃一番，说他的标准唱诗班男孩发型现在越来越像那个穿着绿色连体衣的疯狂角色，那部新出的忍者动漫突然间在全国引起了轰动。

Minus the eyebrows, of course.
当然，这里不计算眉毛。

Shinji, of course, fidgeted as he felt himself be the center of attention from both Hikari and Asuka, prompting him to grab his bangs and ease them back, before pinching a bit of his hair and trying to ascertain it's length by that.
自然，碇真嗣在绫波和明日香的注视下显得局促不安，他伸手将刘海往后拨，接着捏起一撮头发，试图以此估量其长度。

"Uh... do-does it look strange?"
呃...看起来是不是有点奇怪？

Asuka felt a small smile tugging at the corners or her mouth; it was when Shinji did this sort of stuttering thing, usually whenever he felt he was put on the spot light, what normally made her realize sometimes he wasn't that bad after all; a bit dull and somewhat prone of being pushed over, but always someone that would eventually come through, even if he had to be pushed towards making a choice.
明日香嘴角不自觉地上扬；每当真嗣结巴时，通常是因为他感到自己处于焦点之下，这让她意识到，其实他也没那么差劲；虽然有些迟钝，容易受人影响，但他终究是个关键时刻能站出来的人，即使需要别人推动才能做出决定。

"Asuka, you'll be in charge of that."
Asuka，那件事就交给你负责了。

Asuka stopped snickering at that. "Wh-what!? That's a joke right Hikari?"
明日香止住了窃笑，问道：“什、什么！？光，你这是在开玩笑吧？”

"No joke." Hikari said in the same tone she reserved when dealing out school policy to any student, and Asuka knew right then and there she was in trouble. "Make sure Ikari has his hair cut or you'll get a write up tomorrow as well."
这可不是闹着玩的。"光用她一贯宣布校规的严肃口吻说道，明日香一听便知自己处境不妙。"务必让碇把头发剪短，不然你明天也会被记过。

Before anything else could be said, or rather, before Asuka and Shinji could recover from their shock and make any sort of refusal, Hikari had walked inside her house, closing the door behind her, a satisfied smile in her face.
在明日香和真嗣还未来得及从震惊中回过神来，更别提拒绝，光已经步入了自己的家门，随手将门关上，脸上洋溢着满意的笑容。

Asuka was grumbling. 明日香嘟囔着抱怨。

That was never a good thing.
那件事从来就不算好事。

Shinji sighed, again. This seemed to be the most acceptable answer as they had walked out the third hair saloon looking for an emergency squeeze-in, and time was of the essence. Normal business hours meant that the saloons would be closing in by 6.00 and it was already 5.45. All of the places they had gone to had required an appointment beforehand, which left them with little choice.
真嗣再次叹息。这似乎成了唯一的选择，他们已经从第三家美发沙龙失望而出，急切寻找能临时安排的空档，时间紧迫。正常营业时间即将结束，6 点关门，而此刻已是 5 点 45 分。之前走访的每家店都要求提前预约，让他们几乎无路可走。

As the notion began to sink on each of the teens that they would be given a write-up. Making each one react in their usual way; Shinji getting depressed but accepting his fate with quiet dignity and just the right amount of whine, while Asuka tried to force herself inside simply to be asked politely to leave or have the cops called.
当这个观念逐渐在每个青少年心中沉淀，他们意识到即将面临写报告的命运。真嗣以一贯的消沉态度，带着沉默的尊严接受了这个结果，适当地表达了他的不满；而明日香则试图硬闯，最终要么被礼貌地请走，要么就面临警察的介入。

"... and to top it off I'm in charge of making sure you get a haircut!" She said in an obvious pissed off way. "I mean it's one thing if you idiot don't care about your personal appearance, but why am I the one in charge of this?"
...更让人恼火的是，我还得盯着你去理发！" 她明显带着怒气说。"我是说，你自己不在乎形象就算了，为什么这事还得我来操心？

The residential area surrounding their apartments was quiet now; dusk settling down, the sky becoming tat strange mixture of orange and purplish dark blue. Autumn was deepening, making the air feel chillier as the evening quickly cooled down from the setting sun. Both Asuka and Shinji had been walking by the bridge that connected one of the sidewalks to the other, allowing them to cross over the bustling avenue filled with cars.
他们公寓周边的住宅区此刻静谧无声；黄昏悄然降临，天空染上了奇异的橙紫交织的暗蓝。秋意渐浓，使得傍晚随着夕阳西下迅速降温，空气愈发寒凉。明日香和真嗣正漫步在连接两侧人行道的桥上，横跨着车流不息的繁忙街道。

"I'm sorry." 对不起。

"What do you have to apologize for?" Asuka snarled back, and Shinji shrugged, looking out at the setting sun.
"你有什么要道歉的？" 明日香反问道，真嗣则耸肩望向夕阳。

"Look, why are you getting so upset and worked up over this?"
瞧，你为何对此如此生气和激动呢？

"Because it's your own damn fault in the first place." Asuka stopped in the middle of the bridge to tell him off, making Shinji frown, but once Asuka's little outburst was done she stopped and sighed, pouting. She knew Hikari would never actually give them a write-up for something as silly as a haircut, but...
"谁让你自找的。" 明日香在桥中央停下脚步，训斥着真嗣，让他眉头紧锁。待明日香发泄完毕，她叹了口气，嘴角微噘。她清楚光不会因为理发这种小事就真的给他们记过，然而...

"How long have we known each other?"
我们相识多久了？

The setting sun and its colors made Shinji stare at Asuka's profile, the soft, warm colors making her hair seem more lovely; Asuka's hair color had always fascinated Shinji ever since he had known the German redhead; there was something about that girl...
夕阳的余晖与色彩让真嗣不禁凝视着明日香的侧颜，那柔和温暖的色彩映衬得她的秀发更加动人；自从结识这位德国红发少女，明日香的发色便一直吸引着真嗣；她身上似乎有种难以言喻的魅力...

"What the hell is that supposed to do with this?" Asuka asked softly, angrily, not looking at him directly, and instead looking at the horizon again.
"这跟这事到底有什么关系？" 明日香低声质问，语气中带着怒意，目光并未直视他，而是再次投向了远方的地平线。

"I just want to know why you're always like this with me..."
我只是想知道，为什么你总是这样对我...

Asuka was about to say something but stopped short and looked at Shinji, the question catching her by surprise; she noticed he had mirrored her position: one hand on the rail and the other grabbing his leather carrier, looking out at the horizon in deep contemplation. She was about to answer with her usual snippy tone, almost tempted to start with a mocking sing song voice and ask if wittle shinji was sad and wants to cwy before she realized she had been more and more aggressive with him lately.
明日香本欲发言，却戛然而止，惊讶地望向真嗣；她发现他竟模仿了自己的动作：一手搭在栏杆上，另一手紧握皮包，凝视着远方陷入沉思。她本想以惯有的尖锐口吻回应，甚至差点用嘲讽的调子问真嗣是否伤心欲泣，却猛然察觉自己近来对他愈发刻薄。

She had always thought it was part of who they were: people seemed to love... no, actually people seemed to expect their "snap, crackle, pop" routine, often making or goading them into argument that seemed to erupt out of thin air.
她始终觉得这是他们性格的一部分：人们不仅喜爱，甚至期待他们那种“咔嚓、噼啪、砰”的互动模式，经常有意无意地挑起或激化他们之间突如其来的争执。

But he was Shinji, a well meaning, mumbling fool who at the end of the day would always smile at her and wish her good night before closing the door of the small veranda of the apartment where he and his parents lived, right next to one Asuka and her mom had.
然而，他就是真嗣，一个心地善良、说话含糊的傻小子，每天临睡前总会对她微笑，道声晚安，然后轻轻关上他和父母同住的公寓小阳台的门，而她和母亲住的公寓就在隔壁。

And she was Asuka; sure, she could be a little rude, and somewhat overbearing; she could be breathing down someone's neck, and calling people names, picking on them, teasing them but...
她就是明日香，确实，有时会显得有些粗鲁和霸道；她可能会紧盯不放，给人起外号，挑刺儿，逗弄人，但……

Somehow, through it all it always boiled down to the same thing: Shinji and her always managed to laugh at their combined antics at the end of the day while Rei will simply roll her eyes as she sat next to them, asking questions to keep the conversation going while drinking calmly and demurely from her cup of tea, as the three helped the other with their respective questions from their assignments while both their mothers would be in the kitchen of either of their apartments preparing dinner, Gendo not that far from Yui, helping her until she will tell him to stop bugging and go sit and wait, and Shinji's dad will then walk to the living room and sit, thumbing through the ever present paper.
不知何故，经历种种，最终总是回到同一点：真嗣和她总能在一天结束时，对彼此的滑稽行为笑逐颜开，而丽则坐在一旁，优雅地品着茶，提出问题以维持对话，三人互相协助解答作业难题。他们的母亲们则在其中一个公寓的厨房里忙碌着准备晚餐，元度虽在唯身边帮忙，但最终总被她打发走，让他去坐着等。真嗣的父亲便会走到客厅，坐下翻阅那本常备的报纸。

Sometimes, when their parents had to stay and work late Shinji would cook for both girls, and then Asuka would say that she had to go and get ready, looking back from the door at the image of Shinji and Rei washing the dishes side by side, smiling and laughing in their own special way.
偶尔，若父母因工作晚归，真嗣便负责为两位女孩烹饪晚餐。饭后，明日香会表示需要去准备一番，临走前从门边回眸，只见真嗣与零一同洗碗，两人面带微笑，以独有的方式分享着欢声笑语。

And Asuka would then frown and feel a slight tear inside, and she would go straight to the couch and fall asleep waiting for Kyoko to arrive, only to have her wake the redhead up, smiling softly as they went to their respective bedrooms and sleep the rest of the night away.
随后，明日香会皱眉，心中隐隐作痛，她会直接走到沙发上，在期盼京子到来的等待中入睡，直到京子温柔地笑着唤醒她，两人便各自回房，安睡至天明。

But for Shinji, lately, seeing Asuka and thinking about her had made him blush involuntarily, something Rei had begun to catch upon, but had wisely decided not to ask him, even if he was always the target of the blue haired girl's questioning eyes, asking silently a question he had no answer for.
然而，对于真嗣而言，近来每当他看到明日香或想起她时，总会情不自禁地脸红。零已经注意到了这一点，但她明智地选择不去追问。尽管如此，真嗣仍是那位蓝发少女质疑目光的焦点，她无声地提出一个他无法回答的问题。

"Look, Shin-" Asuka began, blinking. Shinji frowned wiping away the wetness in his eyes, and then a slight drizzle began to fall, a drizzle that soon became a rain pour, making them both scream and run as quickly as possible to their apartments, and whatever Asuka had been wanting to say was interrupted by this.
"瞧，真嗣——"明日香刚要说话，眨了眨眼。真嗣皱着眉头擦掉眼角的泪水，突然间，细雨变成了瓢泼大雨，两人不得不尖叫着冲向各自的公寓，明日香的话就这样被突如其来的大雨打断了。

"Yes Mom, I understand." 好的，妈妈，我懂了。

Shinji frowned, looking at the mess in the kitchen and the bathroom before he began to pick everything up, deciding wisely to not bring this to the attention of a certain redheaded teenager who was the cause of this mess.
真嗣皱眉望着厨房和浴室的一片狼藉，明智地选择不向那位红发少年提及，毕竟这乱象是他一手造成的。

"No, it's no problem." 没事，这不算什么。

He was sure somewhere, someone would probably beg to differ but that wasn't neither here nor there.
他坚信，某个角落总会有人提出异议，但这并不影响大局。

"See you then." 那会儿见。

Asuka emerged from his room flipping her mobile closed while putting it away, dressed in a simple t-shirt and a pair of running shorts, bare footed and toweling her hair dry, grumbling to herself about idiots and keys being left inside the apartment; she had reached her door after telling Shinji to make a run for it only to find out she had no key with her.
明日香走出房间，将手机合上收好，身着 T 恤和跑步短裤，赤脚用毛巾擦着湿发，嘴里不满地抱怨着那些把钥匙忘在屋里的蠢货；她刚让真嗣快跑，到了自家门前才意识到自己没带钥匙。

Shinji had opened his apartment's door to find a drenched Asuka in front of him. Without a word he had stepped to the side to let her in, without an explanation of the situation, or her asking for his help. It had been an automatic reaction for them both, getting ushered inside the warm apartment, her nose already assaulted with the smell of food being cooked, before Shinji emerged with a pair of towels, and Asuka excused herself, going into the bathroom to take a warm shower, grateful she had brought her gym supplies inside her bag until she realized her hair brush was not there, shrugging before taking the one in the bathroom and brushing and combing her hair.
真嗣打开家门，只见明日香浑身湿透地站在门外。他默默地侧身让她进来，没有询问缘由，也没有等她开口求助。两人都自然而然地走进了温暖的公寓，明日香一进门就闻到了正在烹饪的食物香味。真嗣随即递上毛巾，明日香道谢后便去浴室冲澡。她庆幸自己把健身用品带在了包里，只是忘了梳子，便顺手拿起浴室的梳子，梳理起头发来。

"So?"

Asuka snorted. "Mom wants for me to wait here until she and your parents come home."
明日香哼了一声。"妈妈让我在这儿等着，直到她和你的爸妈回来。"

"W-well, I mean, you can stay here, I'll just be in my room listening to music an-"
嗯，我的意思是，你可以待在这儿，我回房间听音乐。

"Oh, so you don't want to spend time with me?"
哦，这么说你是不想和我共度时光了？

Shinji blinked, frowning after a second or so. Ever since he knew her, it had been like this; Asuka would go on the offensive, pushing her advantage and shooting accusation behind accusation, but right now... the hurt in Asuka's voice was quite obvious, but right now it ticked Shinji the wrong way.
真嗣眨了眨眼，几秒后眉头紧锁。自打认识她，明日香总是咄咄逼人，不断施压，连珠炮似的指责，然而此刻...她声音中的痛楚显而易见，却让真嗣感到格外刺耳。

"You're the one who keeps saying I'm a bother and an idiot and all that." Shinji said back. "I thought you would be jumping of joy at the idea of having me out of your hair."
你不是一直说我烦人、愚蠢之类的吗？" 真嗣回敬道，"我还以为你会因为我不再烦你而高兴得跳起来呢。

Asuka flinched at that, but just as she was about to counter in someway, she heard Shinji's quiet apology. "Sorry. Look Asuka..."
明日香闻言一怔，正欲反驳之际，耳边传来了真嗣低沉的歉意：“抱歉，明日香，你听我说……”

Asuka's face began to fall as she imagined that Shinji would tell her to get out and wait for her mother outside.
明日香的脸色逐渐黯淡，她想象真嗣会让她离开，到外面去等她的母亲。

"Look, I'm-" Asuka cut in, silencing him, as she sucked the air in and braced herself to give him an apology, but somehow the words refused to come out of her mouth. "The things I say, I don't always mean them-"
听着，我-" 飞鸟突然插话，她深吸一口气，准备向他道歉，可那些话却卡在喉咙里，怎么也说不出来。"我有时候说的话，并非我的真心话-

Shinji's arched eyebrow and gave her a look that clearly said she wasn't going to be getting of the hook so easily.
真嗣挑起眉毛，向她投去一个眼神，明摆着告诉她别想轻易脱身。

"Okay, so I do mean them, I just-" Asuka fumbled again, unwilling or unable to apologize properly before Shinji raised his hand, sighing, the unspoken tension made itself present once more while Shinji fumbled for an answer.
"好吧，我确实是在说他们，只是——" 明日香又一次结巴了，既不愿也似乎无法在真嗣举手叹息前好好道歉，那种未曾言明的紧张感再次弥漫开来，而真嗣也在努力寻找合适的回答。

"Look, it's no big deal; I'll just go out and hang with Toji and Kensuke at the arcade, you can stay here."
瞧，没什么大不了的；我出去跟东治和健介在游戏厅玩，你留这儿吧。

"Idiot. I am not chasing you off, and the rain hasn't let up." Asuka said, blushing uncomfortably, deciding to shut up before she began to try and grasp for more reasons to stay.
"傻瓜，我可没赶你走，再说这雨也没停。" 明日香尴尬地脸红，决定在开始寻找更多留下来的理由之前先保持沉默。

He shrugged before continuing. "I'm sorry to be such a bother, I called Rei and she said she was still doing this thing, so she won't be back until seven or eight."
他耸耸肩，接着说：“真不好意思，打扰了。我联系了 Rei，她说还在处理那件事，估计得七点或八点才能回来。”

Asuka scoffed before looking away. "Why are you even trying to be nice when you know what I think of you and I know what you think of me?"
明日香嗤笑一声，随即别过脸去。"既然你我心知肚明彼此的看法，何必还费心装作友好呢？"

Shinji shrugged, looking away. "Because..."
真嗣耸耸肩，目光移向别处。"因为..."

"Yeah well stop doing it, and cut the crappy 'I'm a martyr" routine."
得了吧，别再这样了，别再搞那种'我是个牺牲者'的烂把戏了。

He inhaled, exhaled and cricked his neck. God, this girl is irritating. "What is your problem, Asuka?"
他深吸一口气，缓缓呼出，又扭了扭脖子。天啊，这女孩真让人心烦。“明日香，你到底怎么了？”

"My problem?" 我的问题是什么？

"Yeah, yours." He looked the other way, withering under Asuka's glare. "Why can't you just let me be nice?"
对，是你的。" 他避开目光，在明日香的严厉注视下显得有些颓丧。"为什么你就不能让我表现得好一点呢？

"Because it makes me uncomfortable." She said softly. "This whole thing makes me uncomfortable."
这让我感到不舒服。"她轻声说，"整个事情都让我感到不舒服。

"Precisely why I'm telling you I'll be outside, besides..." Shinji said as he took the phone and began to punch in the numbers as he smiled a small smile. "You are practically family, so I'm su-"
正因如此，我才告诉你我会在外面等着，再说……" 碇真嗣边说边拿起电话，手指轻快地按下号码，嘴角露出一丝微笑。"你对我来说，几乎就是家人，所以我才……

"W-wait! I mean..." Asuka's mind raced as she tried to find explanation as to why he had to stay here. "I-if you go outside, I'll be responsible for you catching a cold or something a-and you mom and my mom AND Rei will say I'm the one who di-"
等等！我是说..." 明日香急忙思索，试图找到让他留下的理由。"如果你出去着凉了，你妈妈和我妈妈，还有绫波，都会怪我——

"Mom would never do that." Shinji shook his head
"妈妈绝不会做出那种事。" 真嗣摇了摇头

"My mom would..." Asuka added softly. "And so would Rei."
我妈妈也会..."飞鸟轻声补充道。"绫波也一样。

Shinji simply kept quiet, knowing full well what Asuka was trying to do, but deciding to give the redhead a break. Asuka watched the normally quiet boy with the saddest smile she had ever seen look somewhat dispirited, reminding her of a tired, stray puppy, too scared and weak to do anything but stare and hope for someone to give him some food or affection...
真嗣默默无言，深知明日香的意图，却选择给她一个喘息的机会。明日香注视着平日里寡言的真嗣，他那悲伤的微笑显得有些颓丧，让她联想到一只疲惫的流浪小狗，既害怕又无力，只能眼巴巴地望着，期盼有人施舍些许食物或关怀...

"Can't we... stay? Both of us?" Asuka said as she grabbed Shinj's hand, making him set the phone down on the cradle, trailing off, and Shinji turned to look at her; her eyes were cast down, and she seemed to be struggling to say whatever was on her mind before she finally let out a forced sigh and looked up, meeting his eyes.
"我们难道不能...一起留下来吗？" 明日香说着，紧紧握住真嗣的手，使他放下电话，声音渐弱。真嗣转头看她，只见她目光低垂，似乎在努力寻找合适的言辞，最终她无奈地叹了口气，抬头迎上他的目光。

She turned again to look at Shinji who had also found the floor to be rather interesting, noticing that his hair was still uncut, wet and ruffled up... in short, he looked pretty bad, and leaving him like that would be irresponsible of her and she didn't want to find out if Hikari was serious about the write up.
她再次回头望向真嗣，他似乎也对地板产生了兴趣。她注意到他的头发依旧未修剪，湿漉漉的，凌乱不堪……总之，他看起来很狼狈，就这样置之不理显得她太不负责了，而且她也不想探究日香是否真的会提交报告。

"Hey..." She began softly after thinking about it for a minute or two, making Shinji look at her silently. "Why don't I give you a haircut while we wait for Rei?
"嘿..." 她沉思片刻后柔声说道，真嗣便静静地望向她。"趁等绫波的空当，我给你理个发如何？

Even if the Ikari household was big enough for a 4 person family, their bathroom was still small and cramped; Shinji watched the small oval mirror over the faucets, a plastic glass with four toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste next to it.
碇家虽宽敞，足以容纳四口人，但浴室却狭小局促；真嗣凝视着水龙头上方的小椭圆镜，一旁塑料杯中插着四支牙刷和一支牙膏。

On the other side of the sink, laid a brush that still had the familiar strawberry aroma of Asuka's shampoo and her body wash still lingered in the air.
洗手池另一侧，一把刷子静静躺着，依旧散发着明日香洗发水和沐浴露的草莓香气，空气中她的余香依稀可辨。

Somehow the idea of Asuka being naked in his shower, lathering up and enjoying a warm bath made Shinji feel...
想到明日香赤身裸体在他的浴室里，沐浴着泡沫，享受着温暖的水流，真嗣心中涌起一种...

"Is this too tight?" Asuka asked as she gently tied a towel around his neck before putting a butterfly clip on it to make sure it wouldn't come undone, pulling Shinji out of his reverie.
"这样会不会太紧？" 明日香轻声询问，边说边将毛巾轻柔地围在真嗣的脖子上，再用一只蝴蝶夹固定好，以防松脱，这一动作将真嗣从沉思中唤醒。

"N-no, it's all right Asuka." Shinji said too quickly before he sighed again, moving in the chair, hearing the newspaper underneath to make it easier to clean crinkle as Asuka extended a vinyl sheet and proceeded to tie it around his neck using the towel as a cushion before putting another clip on the edges, making sure it covered as much as it could of Shinji's body to prevent any hair clippings on his clothes.
"不，没事的，明日香。" 真嗣急忙说道，随后叹了口气，在椅子上调整姿势，让报纸在身下发出沙沙声，以便清理时更加顺手。明日香展开一块塑料布，用毛巾垫在真嗣的脖子上，仔细地将塑料布围好，并用夹子固定边缘，确保最大限度地覆盖真嗣的身体，以防头发碎屑沾染衣物。

"Alright, let's do this." Asuka said as she retrieved a pair of rounded tips scissors her mother would use to give her tips a trim before the redhead began to laugh in an over the top, sinister sounding low chuckle. Shinji caught sight of Asuka's mischievous smile as she played with the scissors she intended to use to cut at his bangs and hair, making him feel uneasy at the idea of her being able to make him look ridiculous in any more ways than she could already.
"好了，开始吧。" 明日香边说边取出一对圆头剪刀，这是她母亲常用来帮她修剪发梢的。紧接着，她发出一阵夸张且阴险的低笑。真嗣瞥见明日香那狡黠的笑容，她正摆弄着剪刀，打算对他的刘海和头发下手，这让他心生忐忑，生怕她再让他出更多洋相。

"A-Asuka... do you uh..." Shinji stammered wondering the best way to word his concerns before deciding to be straight with Asuka."Do you have any experience cutting hair?"
明日香，那个...你，嗯..." 真嗣有些结巴，他思索着如何恰当地表达自己的疑虑，最终决定直截了当地问。"你剪过头发吗？

"No." Asuka answered shrugging, but never losing her smile as she began to feel around Shinji's head, looking at the soft, straight dark brown, almost black hair and wondering where to begin. "But I've played around with Hikari's and Mari's hair."
不。" 明日香回答时耸了耸肩，脸上笑容依旧，她开始轻抚真嗣的头发，那柔软直顺、深棕近黑的色泽让她琢磨着该从哪里开始。"不过，我给光和玛丽的头发弄过造型。

"So... this is your fist time actually cutting it?"
所以...这真的是你第一次切这个？

"Yeah." 对。

Shinji's face became paler than normal, feeling his forehead become wet and not precisely because of the rain.
真嗣的脸色比往常更为苍白，他感觉到额头湿漉漉的，这并不全是因为雨水。

"Please don't cut my hair in a funny way." He pleaded, half joking-half serious.
"请别把我的头发剪得滑稽可笑。"他半开玩笑半认真地恳求。

"What about your ears?" 你的耳朵还好吗？

Snip.

She had meant it as a joke, the snipping was a slow, drawn sound of polished flat metal blades scrapping against the other slowly, and Shinji's thoughts were, literally, cut by the sound of the scissors closing close to his ears
她本意是开玩笑，剪刀剪切声缓慢而悠长，光滑的平金属刀片相互摩擦，真嗣的思绪被这紧贴耳畔的剪刀闭合声实实在在地打断了

"Please don't cut off my ears?"
请别割掉我的耳朵，好吗？

Shinji cold see through the mirror how Asuka was still giving him that smile: lips tugging up but not high enough to call it a smile, and eyes staring straight at him, like a playful kitten who had just happened upon a defenseless mouse, and was advancing with the intention of playing with him, unaware that to the mouse that "play" seemed more like "maul" and for some reason whatever Asuka would have said, Shinji was sure he would have nodded regardless.
真嗣透过镜子，清晰地看到明日香依旧挂着那抹微笑：唇角轻扬，却未达真正的笑意，双眼直视着他，宛如一只顽皮的小猫偶遇无助的老鼠，正带着戏弄的意图步步逼近，而小猫并不知晓，对老鼠而言，这“戏弄”更似“撕咬”。不知何故，无论明日香说什么，真嗣都觉得自己会不由自主地点头。

But Asuka's whispered words made their way, jumping the fence of his thoughts before Shinji realized the soft pressure on his shoulder was her hand and the warmth he felt on his cheek was her closeness and the soft wetness of her breath whispered against his ear with a soft blow of air.
然而，明日香低语的呢喃悄然传入，越过了他思绪的屏障，直到真嗣察觉到肩上那轻柔的压力来自她的手，脸颊上的温暖是她的贴近，耳边那轻柔湿润的呼吸，伴随着微风，轻声细语地拂过。

"Don't worry, I'll see what I can do."
别担心，我会想办法的。

It had begun slowly at first; Asuka's fingers tentatively dancing around Shinji's scalp, softly feeling the distinctive bumps that gave form to his head; she had been looking intently as if deciding the best way to tackle the situation before she grabbed a bit of hair between fore and middle finger, leveling it with her thumb wile the scissors slowly sniped at it, and Shinji felt the soft sound of the falling hair as it made contact with the sheet covering him and the newspapers on the floor.
起初，动作颇为迟缓；明日香的手指轻柔地在真嗣的头皮上探索，感受着那些塑造他头型的微妙凸起；她凝视着，似乎在斟酌如何下手最为妥当，随后她用食指与中指夹起一缕发丝，拇指轻压，剪刀随之缓缓剪断，真嗣听见了发丝飘落，轻触覆盖他的床单及地上报纸的细微声响。

"So... Shinji..." 那么... 真嗣...

Shinji looked at the reflection o the mirror, noticing Asuka had a different look on her face, and her voice sounded softer than usual, and he kicked himself mentally for stammering again, wondering what was it about her that made him be intimidated simply by the closeness of her.
真嗣凝视着镜中的倒影，察觉到明日香面露异色，声音也比平日里温柔，他内心自责又结巴了，疑惑究竟是她的什么特质，仅因她的靠近就让他心生畏惧。

"Uh... yeah?" 嗯... 是吗？

Asuka kept quiet for a moment, grabbing another bit of his hair and cutting it softly, slowly, before patting his head with her hand in a side way motion to make sure all the clippings had fallen.
明日香静默片刻，再次轻握他的一绺发丝，缓缓剪下，接着用手侧轻抚他的头，确保所有剪下的碎发都已掉落。

"You know I didn't mean anything of it on purpose, did you?"
你明白我并非有意为之，对吗？

Shinji nodded but said nothing; it was always like that with them: Asuka would say things about him at school whenever someone mentioned the possibility of her liking him, or of them being closer than she would like. Asuka would typically respond with an outraged cry and deny all of it, and she would go out of her way to make fun of Shinji for whatever reason, hoping in that way to make it more clearer that there was nothing going on between them.
真嗣点头不语；他们之间总是如此：每当学校里有人提及她可能对他有意，或他们关系比她所愿更近时，明日香总会愤然反驳，全盘否认。她还会刻意嘲弄真嗣，以此更明确地表明两人间并无瓜葛。

Snip. Another bit of hair fell and Asuka kept staring at his hair and his face using the mirror. Looking at how each cut gave a new dimension to Shinji's head, slowly molding it to how he would normally be seen, little by little... cut by cut.
剪下一段后，又有一小撮头发飘落，明日香透过镜子专注地观察着他的头发和面容。每一次剪切都让真嗣的头部轮廓逐渐清晰，慢慢呈现出他平时的模样，一点一滴……剪影渐成。

"It's just that... sometimes I say things without really meaning them or thinking about them."
只是...有时候我脱口而出的话，其实并没有深思熟虑或真正含义。

And it was true; sometimes she would cross the line and Hikari and Rei will tell Asuka in their own way to back off; sometimes Toji will jump in to defend his buddy and another shouting match between both the German and Osaka, as many boys would call Toji behind his back, would erupt.
确实如此；有时她会越过界限，这时光和零会用自己的方式暗示明日香退让；而东治往往挺身而出，捍卫好友，随之而来的是德国人与大阪人之间的又一轮激烈争执，这是不少男生背地里对东治的称呼。

Snip. Another cut, almost like a hit on a chisel against marble, taking away that which wasn't needed to leave underneath something the sculptor felt was there.
剪裁。犹如凿子敲打大理石般的一击，削去不必要的部分，露出雕塑家认为原本就蕴含其中的形态。

"A-and I know I normally don't say I'm sorry..."
而且我知道，我通常不会轻易道歉...

Because in the secrecy of their daily walk back home, just after they had rounded up the corner from the park and they were only 5 minutes away from the comfort of their house, Asuka would wordlessly grab Shinji's hand without looking at him, simply staring ahead with a light blush on her face while Shinji would close his eyes and smile, missing Asuka's own smile as well.
每天放学回家的路上，当他们刚从公园拐角转过来，离家仅剩五分钟路程时，明日香会默默地牵起真嗣的手，目光直视前方，脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。而真嗣则会闭眼微笑，未曾察觉明日香嘴角同样扬起的笑意。

"But... I am, alright? I should've never have called you an idiot simply to get a good laugh, I'll talk with Mari about her easing up on you."
但是...我确实如此，不是吗？我不该为了逗笑就轻易称你为傻瓜，我会和 Mari 沟通，让她对你宽容一些。

"It's not about Mari." 这与玛丽无关。

Asuka looked down; she knew it wasn't about Mari, she knew what this was about, but she really didn't want to touch that issue, at least not right now.
明日香垂下目光；她心里明白，这事与真希波无关，她清楚症结所在，只是实在不愿此刻去触碰那个话题。

Snip. Shinji simply kept quiet.
片段描述。真嗣一言不发，静静地待着。

Snip. Asuka made sure to keep her word of not giving him a ridiculous haircut, even if she did try to make him go for the Mohican cut.
阿苏卡坚守承诺，没有给他剪一个荒唐的发型，虽然她曾试图说服他尝试莫西干头。

Snip. Shinji watched as Asuka held his head in her hands, making him look from side to side to make sure the hair was not too short or long from either side before she nodded to herself, pleased before she continued giving his hair small little snips and cuts.
真嗣注视着明日香用手托住他的头，让他左右查看，确保头发两侧长度适中，随后她满意地点头，继续细致地为他修剪头发。

Shinji had began to feel relaxed and comfortable, the issues resolved in his mind before he felt Asuka's whispered voice once more against his ear, and her body heat so close to his.
真嗣逐渐感到放松和舒适，心中的问题已在他脑海中得到解决，此时他再次感受到明日香在他耳边的低语，以及她紧贴着他的体温。

"The truth is..." She began softly, in a breathless voice, and Shinji could see her face; eyes closed, small honest smile on her lips and a light flush on her cheeks. "Even if I can't be who I really am with anyone, I feel I can be myself with you."
事实是..." 她轻柔地启齿，声音带着些许喘息，真嗣能看见她的面容：双眸紧闭，嘴角挂着一丝真挚的微笑，脸颊上透出淡淡的红晕。"即便我无法在他人面前展现真我，但在你面前，我感到可以自在地做自己。

There was a quiet and tacit agreement spoken there, but Shinji was sure he would get clarification later on; that was the way Asuka was: She never held anything to herself for long; she would bitch and moan and dance around the issue, kicking buckets and biting out snarky remarks, but at the end of the day you could count on Asuka letting you know what bugged her, even if it wasn't always the whole thing.
那里存在着一种心照不宣的默契，但真嗣相信不久后就能得到解释；明日香向来如此：她从不将心事久藏；她会抱怨、发泄，围绕问题兜圈子，踢翻水桶，口出尖刻之言，但最终，你总能指望明日香透露令她烦恼的事，即便未必是全部实情。

Because one thing Shinji had come to realize after all this time with the redhead was she never let up; she could come as a sort of daring self assured and independent girl, but underneath it all, Shinji was sure to have seen brief glimpses of the real her; brief cases of "blink-and-you-miss-them" actions that seemed to be at odds with the normal Asuka behavior.
与红发女孩共度的时光让真嗣明白，她从不松懈；她能展现出大胆自信、独立自主的一面，然而，真嗣确信自己曾捕捉到她真实性格的瞬间——那些稍纵即逝、一不留神就会错过的行为，与平日的明日香大相径庭。

She was duality; evens... half and half. Like the day, she could start sunny and cheery and in the middle of it all a storm could begin brewing but by night, the sky was once again peaceful and calm.
她身上有着双重特质；既平和又矛盾。就像白昼，起初或许阳光灿烂、心情愉悦，但转眼间可能乌云密布，然而夜幕降临时，一切又归于宁静与安详。

And Shinji knew that was the truth about Asuka; what mattered was what was done during the storm. Shinji would normally squeak and try to get away, but Asuka knew that when the chips were down and it mattered all to fate and chance, Shinji would be there in the storm, gritting his teeth but braving away, silently daring pride, pomp and circumstance to do their worst.
真嗣深知，明日香的本性便是如此；关键在于风暴中的行动。平日里，真嗣或许会尖叫着逃避，但明日香明白，当命运的紧要关头，一切悬于一线时，真嗣定会挺立于风暴之中，咬牙坚持，无言地挑战骄傲与虚荣所能施加的最大考验。

But once those words had been said, once nothing could take them away, Shinji felt a strange sensation overcame him; unknown, but familiar... warm and tender.
然而，那些话一旦出口，便无法收回，真嗣感到一种奇异而熟悉的感觉涌上心头，温暖而柔和。

It felt like his chest was tight, and his heart was being crushed. His face was warm and something felt to be welling inside of him.
他感到胸口紧绷，心脏像是被紧紧压迫。脸颊发热，体内似乎有股力量在涌动。

"Could you turn your head a little?"
麻烦你把头稍微转一下，好吗？

Shinji never answered, simply turned his face to one side never taking his eyes from Asuka's smile reflected on the mirror, before he saw her lips moving again.
真嗣没有回应，只是侧过脸，目光一直停留在镜子里明日香微笑的映像上，直到他注意到她的嘴唇再次动了起来。

"No, not that way... the other way."
不，不是那条路...是另一条路。

Shinji felt Asuka's long, thin fingers pressing against his face, and the sensation felt good, it felt calmer and cooler against his own skin, and though the corner of his eye, Shinji could see Asuka next to him, her red hair tied in a loose ponytail, moving around and noticed, involuntarily her white T-shirt.
真嗣感受到明日香纤细的手指轻抚他的脸庞，这触感令他感到舒适，比自己的肌肤更为清凉宁静。他眼角余光瞥见身旁的明日香，她那红发随意束成马尾，随着动作轻轻摇曳，无意中注意到她穿着的白色 T 恤。

It was a pretty cheap T-shirt made of material so thin that you could see through it in the light, and somehow Shinji's eyes were glued to the slender figure clothed in jean and cotton, and as Asuka moved in front of him to try to cut the hair on his forehead, the contour of her body from her armpit down to the bones showing from her jean short sitting so low on her hip were slightly visible through the shirt.
那是一件相当廉价的 T 恤，薄如蝉翼，在光线下几乎透明。真嗣的目光不由自主地被那个穿着牛仔裤和棉质上衣的纤细身影所吸引。当明日香走到他面前，试图为他修剪额发时，她从腋下到低腰牛仔裤所勾勒出的身体曲线，透过那件薄衫若隐若现。

It was a sleek and slender curve and Shinji quickly looked down as if he had just looked at the sun, but Asuka took his head and made him look up, forcing Shinji to stare at the cleavage of her low hanging top.
那曲线流畅纤细，真嗣急忙低头，犹如直视了烈日，然而明日香却抓住他的头，硬是让他抬头，迫使真嗣直视她低垂上衣下的乳沟。

And Shinji had nothing else to do but close his eyes, until Asuka let go of his head.
真嗣别无选择，只能闭上眼睛，直到明日香放开他的头。

Asuka kept staring at the tips of his bangs, cutting small bits and pieces, she had done rather well so far and she did not want to screw it up. She stared intently at the tips falling, before she brushed them, when she noticed it.
明日香全神贯注地盯着他的刘海尖端，细心地修剪着碎发，目前为止她表现得很出色，不想出任何差错。她凝视着发梢缓缓飘落，正准备梳理时，她察觉到了异样。

Shinji was asleep. 真嗣正在熟睡。

Asuka smiled at him, shaking her head; Shinji had always have the rare ability of being able to fall asleep anywhere he chose, he never needed a bed, never missed his pillows, he could be on the train and simply drift off into a pleasant sleep, and while Asuka would never accept this out loud, she purposely always took the seat next to him to enjoy the quiet moments when his head will roll and rest on her.
明日香对着他微笑，轻轻摇头；真嗣总有一种罕见本领，能在任何地方随心所欲地入睡，从不依赖床铺，也不怀念枕头，他能在火车上轻易进入梦乡。虽然明日香不会明说，但她总是特意坐在他旁边，享受他头不经意间靠在她肩上的静谧时光。

But this time it was different for some reason; it felt different because they were here, and they were alone and his lips were slightly parted, and his soft snores only made him seem much more younger.
然而这一次，不知何故，感觉迥异；他们在场，孤身相对，他微启的双唇，以及那轻柔的鼾声，反倒让他显得更为稚嫩。

She was almost kneeling in front of him, their faces apart by mere inches and Asuka felt her face inch slowly towards his, her eyes on his lips feeling the air from his mouth softly against her own lips, licking them reflexively as they opening softly to accept his before-
她几乎跪在他面前，两人的脸庞仅隔咫尺，明日香感到自己的脸慢慢贴近他，目光凝视着他的唇，感受着他呼吸的轻柔气息拂过自己的唇瓣，本能地舔了舔唇，轻启双唇，准备迎接他的吻——

"As... ka..." 好像... 卡住了...

Asuka blinked. She was sure he had said her name, softly, almost a mere whisper, but he had, she was su-
明日香眨了眨眼。她确信他轻声唤了自己的名字，声音细微得几乎像是耳语，但她确实听到了——

They were kissing. Shinji had somehow inched forward at the last moment, his lips bumping softly into Asuka's before she realized this soft gentle pressure was that kiss. She blinked, seeing Shinji's eyes opened and staring directly at her, a blush on his face as he tried to say something just as the sound of the door bell rang in the air, frozen on the air.
他们正在接吻。真嗣不知怎的，在最后一刻向前挪动，他的唇轻轻触碰到明日香的唇，直到她意识到这温柔的压力正是那个吻。她眨了眨眼，看到真嗣睁开眼睛直视着她，脸上泛起红晕，正要开口说些什么，突然门铃声响起，空气中仿佛凝固了。

Asuka felt her cheeks burning, an uncomfortable feeling coming over her before she growled and got up.
明日香感到脸颊发热，一阵不适涌上心头，她不禁低吼一声，站起身来。

"Wait a second, I forgot to rinse!"
稍等，我忘了冲洗！

Shinji's eyes shot open before his explanation was garbled by the water falling of top of him immediately thereafter.
真嗣的眼睛突然睁大，然而他的解释立刻被从上方落下的水打断，变得含糊不清。

Rei blinked and arched an eyebrow at the image of Shinji's head still wet and dripping when he walked out to greet her.
绫波眨了眨眼，眉头微挑，望着真嗣湿漉漉的头发滴着水珠，迎面走来。

"It rained. A lot." Shinji explained simply.
"下了一场大雨。" 新二简单地解释说。

Rei nodded quietly before she looked away, simply to look back at Shinji again.
绫波默默地点了点头，目光短暂移开，很快又重新投向了真嗣。

"I-is something wrong Rei?"
丽，是不是有什么问题？

Rei looked at Shinji's face with cold, clinical eyes before she inched forward and stared at him more intensely, getting his head in her hands and making him look left and right.
绫波丽冷冷地审视着真嗣的面庞，随后她缓缓上前，目光愈发专注地盯着他，双手扶住他的头，让他左右转动视线。

"Your hair appears to be cut, the length of the sides are now asymmetrical." Rei observed simply, before nooding her approval. Shinji sighed at that before Rei threw offhandedly over her shoulder one last observation.
"你的头发刚剪过吧，两侧长度现在不对称了。" Rei 简单观察后点头表示赞同。Shinji 对此叹了口气，而 Rei 最后不经意地从肩上抛出一句观察。

"Also your lips seem to have some gloss on them."
你的嘴唇看起来也涂了些唇彩。

Shinji coughed at that before going to his room while Asuka kept strangely quiet watching TV while Rei simply flashed herself a small little enigmatic smile before she went to her room and changed as well, taking out her books before all three teenagers eventually sat to finish their homework assignments.
真嗣咳嗽一声后，便回房去了，明日香却异常安静地看着电视，零则神秘地微微一笑，也回房更衣，取出书本，不久，三位少年都坐下来专心完成作业。

"C'mon Shinji!" Mari said laughing wildly as Shinji carried her over his shoulder, eliciting shrieks and screams of the little girl while Asuka held Nozomi's hand, the smaller Horaki sighing but not being able to hide the smile from watching her friend so happy.
"加油，真嗣！" 玛丽放声大笑，真嗣将她扛在肩上，小女孩的尖叫和欢笑声此起彼伏，而明日香则牵着希望的手，小堀北虽然叹气，却掩不住看到朋友如此开心时的微笑。

Shinji ran twice as fast, being careful to hold Mari tightly against himself. The girl in turn held onto his forehead, eyes wide open as saucers, moth agape and the childish, pure sound of her laughter filling the otherwise quiet walk home.
真嗣加快了速度，几乎是平时的两倍，同时小心翼翼地紧紧抱着玛丽。玛丽则紧抓着他的额头，眼睛睁得大大的，嘴巴微张，她那纯真无邪的笑声在回家的路上回荡，打破了周围的宁静。

"So Mari seems happier than yesterday." Asuka began as she and Nozomi let those two race farther down the street, Shinji's screams and Mari's laughter blending seamlessly into the other against the warm sunny day.
"看来玛丽今天比昨天更开心了。" 阿苏卡开口说道，她和野美看着那两人在街上越跑越远，真嗣的尖叫与玛丽的笑声交织在一起，与温暖的阳光下形成和谐的背景。

"Yeah. She had to apologize to Aki for making her cry..."
没错。她得向 Aki 道歉，因为她把 Aki 弄哭了……

"Oh!" Asuka said mildly surprised. "So is Aki alright?"
哦！" 明日香有些惊讶地说。"那阿秋没事吧？

"She's better; Mari and her started playing together again." Nozomi answered with a shrug. "Mari was mad at Aki because Aki had to do a project with Ma-" Nozomi clasped her hands over her mouth, trying to stop herself from divulging a secret.
"她已经好多了；麻里和她又重新玩在一起了。"希美回答时耸了耸肩。"麻里对秋生气，因为秋得和真-"希美突然捂住嘴，试图阻止自己泄露秘密。

"Ma..?" 妈..?

"Uh... with some boy." 呃...跟某个男孩在一起。

"Oh... so Mari likes that some boy?" Asuka pressed smiling.
"哦...这么说玛丽喜欢那个男生了？" 阿苏卡笑着追问。

Nozomi simply nodded, biting her lip and looking down at her feet. "B-but I promised her no to tell."
希子默默地点了点头，咬着下唇，目光落在自己的脚上。"可...可是我向她保证过，不会说出去的。"

"Don't worry I won't tell."
放心吧，我不会泄露的。

Nozomi looked at her with uncertainty and doubt before Asuka flashed her a dazzling smile, extending her pinky to promise it.
望月带着犹豫和疑虑注视着她，紧接着飞鸟绽放出灿烂的笑容，伸出小指做出承诺。

"Swear?" 发誓吗？

"Pinky swear." Asuka said in a low, secretive whisper, like conspirators planning an attack, and Nozomi smiled the same smile and nodded, locking her own pink onto Asuka's and shaking it, before they both heard Shinji's screams and Mari's crazed cackles as they neared again, and Asuka stood up, brushing her knees from any imaginary dust as she held her hand to Nozomi.
"小指拉钩。" 明日香低声神秘地耳语，宛如密谋者策划着什么，希美也以同样的微笑点头，两人的小指紧紧相扣，摇晃着。这时，真嗣的尖叫和真理疯狂的笑声再次逼近，明日香站起身，轻拍膝盖，仿佛拂去尘土，然后向希美伸出手。

"Sometimes we all need to keep our secrets." She said, looking at Shinji and smiling a different smile.
"有时，我们都得守住自己的秘密。"她对真嗣说道，脸上挂着一抹别样的微笑。

And for once, Nozomi agreed with Asuka on something.
难得有一次，希美和明日香在某件事上意见一致。

Once they had arrived at the apartment building, and Shinji had walked into his own, Asuka herded Nozomi and Mari inside. Before entering, Shinji gave them a small smile and his eyes lingered far longer on Asuka who held his look for a second or two before she simply turned and opened her door.
抵达公寓楼后，真嗣回到自己的住处，而明日香则带着望美和茉莉进了屋。进门前，真嗣对她们露出一个浅笑，目光在明日香身上停留了片刻，明日香也回应了他的目光，稍作停顿后，她才转身开门。

"So is Shinji still an idiot?" Nozomi asked innocently at Mari who smiled at him, waving.
"那么，真嗣还是那么傻吗？"希美天真地问玛丽，玛丽则对他微笑着挥手。

"Yeah." Mari aid getting inside and taking her shoes, shrugging like she always did. "But sometimes he's a cool idiot, right Miss Asuka?"
嗯。"玛丽进屋脱鞋，习惯性地耸了耸肩。"不过，他偶尔也挺酷的，你说呢，飞鸟小姐？

Asuka smiled. 明日香露出了微笑。

"Sometimes." She repeated softly, as she checked her watch. "Ok squirts, remember that we have to meet your brother and sister in the train station before eight, so you better have all your homework finished before then or no ice cream."
有时候。"她柔声重复，边看手表边说。"小家伙们，记住了，我们得在八点前赶到火车站和哥哥姐姐碰头，所以你们的作业得在那之前做完，不然冰淇淋就别想了。

Asuka ignored Mari's groans as Nozomi simply took out her notebook and began to do her own homework quietly. She smiled before walking to her room and changing out of her uniform before she saw her phone vibrate to life.
明日香对真希的呻吟置若罔闻，希美则默默地掏出笔记本，开始安静地做作业。她微微一笑，走进房间换下校服，此时手机突然震动了。

Smiling at the displayed caller number, Asuka opened it and spoke into it.
看着来电显示的号码，Asuka 微微一笑，接通电话后便开始交谈。

"Hey, we'll be leaving at around seven thirty."
嘿，我们大概七点半出发。

"How funny, I'll be taking the garbage around that time."
真巧，我那时正好要去倒垃圾。

Asuka smiled, falling back on her bed and staring at the ceiling, her hand trailing and scratching at the plaster of the wall against which her bed head rested. "That really is a coincidence, but I will be going to the station, not the incinerator."
明日香微笑着躺倒在床上，目光投向天花板，手指在床头倚靠的墙壁上轻轻划过，抓挠着石膏。“这确实是巧合，不过我要去的是车站，并非焚化炉。”

"Oh..." She could almost see the blush on his face as he tried to come with another excuse. "W-well, I could go buy some groceries, I had this guest yesterday..."
哦……" 她仿佛能看见他脸上泛起的红晕，他正努力再找个借口。"我、我其实可以去买点菜，昨天家里来了客人……

"Oh really? A pretty girl maybe? You're such a Casanova." Asuka smirked, expecting him to stutter and mutter an apology, already forming the words Idiot, I'm playing on her lips.
"哦，真的吗？是个漂亮姑娘吧？你可真是个情场老手。" 明日香嘴角勾起一抹戏谑的笑意，等着他支支吾吾地道歉，心里已经酝酿好那句“傻瓜，我逗你玩呢”。

"Actually, she's a crazy girl who ate the last pack of ramen and now I need to get some more."
说真的，她这姑娘挺疯的，把最后一包拉面都吃光了，我得再去补点货。

Asuka smiled softly at herself, glad that he was getting in the mood to be teased and tease her back.
明日香对着镜子中的自己温柔一笑，心中暗喜他已准备好接受逗弄，并能回以同样的乐趣。

"Maybe you should accompany us then, there are a lot of perverts out during the night for a couple of grade-schoolers and a cute defenseless little girl like me."
或许你该陪我们同行，夜里变态不少，对几个小学生和我这样手无缚鸡之力的小女孩来说，实在不安全。

"Uh... but I'm not good at fighting or any th-"
呃... 可我实在不擅长打架或任何类似的事情。

"Idiot." Asuka chuckled into the phone. "You know I never hold back on a fight... but someone's gotta protect the poor perverts..." She said smiling.
"傻瓜。" 明日香对着电话轻笑道，"你知道我从不手下留情...但总得有人保护那些可怜的变态..." 她笑着说。

"Then I guess I should go then." Shinji said with his phone cradled against his neck, stirring the last package of instant ramen to have a light snack.
"那我想我该走了。" 真嗣边说边把手机夹在颈侧，搅动着最后一袋速食拉面，打算简单垫垫肚子。

"Yeah, you should." Asuka's voice was giddy. "Besides, Mari thinks you're kind of cool now."
对，你确实应该这么做。" 明日香的声音里透着兴奋。"而且，玛丽现在觉得你挺酷的。

Asuka finished the sentence before turning onto her back, seeing the smiling, giggling faces of Mari and Nozomi peering at her from the door to her room, realizing she was screwed.
明日香说完这句话后才翻过身，只见玛丽和希美正从她房间门口探出头来，笑得前仰后合，她顿时明白自己处境不妙。

"Oh, Verda-" 哦，绿意盎然-

"Newlyweds, newlyweds, newlyweds, newlyweds!"
新婚燕尔，新婚燕尔，新婚燕尔，新婚燕尔！

"S-shut up! we're not like that!"
S-别说了！我们才不是那样的人！

"Asuka and Shinji sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-"
Asuka 和 Shinji 坐在树上，亲吻中——K-I-S-S-I-

"Sh-shut up twerps!" Sh-shut up, you brats!

On the other side of the line, Shinji laughed before pressing the end button. He stared at his reflection on the window and looked right, then left before striking an Elvis-esque pose, both hands going to the side of his head, slicking the hair back.
电话那头，真嗣笑出声后按了挂断键。他透过窗户凝视自己的倒影，左右张望一番，接着模仿猫王的经典动作，双手抚头，潇洒地将头发往后一抹。

"I'm kind of cool, yo." He said in what he hoped was a deep, rumbling sexy voice, before the smell of burning ramen reached his nose, making him squeak in terror and run to the kitchen to turn off the stove, tripping on a couch, and stubbing his toe, jumping on one foot and howling in pain before his last words replayed in his mind again.
"我挺酷的，不是吗？" 他试图用一种深沉而性感的声音说道，但随即被烧焦的方便面味吓得尖叫，急忙跑向厨房关火，途中绊倒在沙发上，脚趾狠狠撞了一下，痛得单脚跳着大叫，最后那句话再次在脑海中回响。

I'm kind of cool, yo.
我挺酷的，对吧。

AN: I despise sequels; a good story has to be told in one go, not endlessly revised and tied-in, or retconed into existence. There are quite a handful of movies whose sequels rock the boat however; The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings, I know what you did last summer (If only for the promise of seeing Jeniffer Love Hewwit do the Americanized version of the Gainax Bounce TM).
我对续集向来不感冒；好的故事应当一气呵成，而非不断修改、牵强附会，或通过“重启”强行延续。然而，也有少数电影的续集表现出色；例如《教父》、《指环王》，以及《我知道你去年夏天干了什么》（单是为了欣赏詹妮弗·洛芙·休伊特演绎的美版“Gainax Bounce”也值得一看）。

Short side stories are an exception because they exist in a self contained world, however this short side stories can become stories unto themselves, and to illustrate this point, I will tell you one:
短篇故事之所以特殊，是因为它们自成一体，但这些短篇故事本身也能独立成篇。下面我就来讲述一则，以说明这一点：

There once was a princess who lived in a far away land; she was cute and sweet and was dubbed the idol of her kingdom. She wasn't really sure about it, because she felt herself to be of a rare species who would identify themselves as tsunderes, which came from an ancient and superior kick-ass land where tsundere literally meant "I will kick your ass and then nurse you back to health because I like/love you but I am not sure of how to explain my feelings, thus I need to act tough in front of everyone but when we are together I will sometimes show you a more vulnerable side of me."
从前，有一位公主居住在遥远的国度；她可爱甜美，被尊为王国的偶像。然而，她对此并不十分确定，因为她自认为属于一种稀有类型——“傲娇”，这个词源自一个古老而强大的国度。在那里，“傲娇”意味着“我会先严厉对待你，然后再温柔地照顾你，因为我喜欢/爱你，但我不确定如何表达我的感情，所以我在众人面前必须表现得坚强，但当我们独处时，我会偶尔向你展示我更脆弱的一面。”

Or, something like that; in any event, the princess was categorized as a tsundere.
或者，大概是这样；总之，这位公主被划分为傲娇属性。

One day, a wandering minstrel (i.e. a loser) came about town and was introduced to the princess by fate itself (or by some unknown and highly coincidental way). Unbeknownst to the minstrel(or loser), the princess had heard about said minstrel (the loser) by word of mouth of others, but him being the shy minstrel (once again, loser) he normally was, decided to keep to himself.
某日，一位流浪的吟游诗人（即所谓的失败者）意外踏入小镇，命运之手（或是某种难以解释的巧合）让他与公主相遇。这位吟游诗人并不知晓，公主早已从旁人口中听闻过他的事迹，然而他天性内向（再次点明，是个失败者），选择保持沉默。

Until the princess began to speak to him.
公主开始与他交谈。

She found his stories (or lies) to be, for some reason, somewhat entertaining (code for not as boring) ... and when she heard about a quick small little story of no more than 2000 words he had cooked up but had to sing as a stand alone piece because it wouldn't fit an epic story he was working on that was so epic he just couldn't play it out of the story's sheer epicness (because it didn't seem like it would ever be finished anytime soon) , she liked it so much she began to ask (i.e. bug) him for a second part.
她觉得他的故事（或是谎言）不知何故，颇具娱乐性（意即不那么枯燥）。当她得知他创作了一个不超过 2000 字的短篇故事，因无法嵌入他正在撰写的那部宏伟史诗而独立成篇，那史诗太过庞大，使得这个小故事难以从中剥离（因为那部史诗似乎短期内难以完结），她对此喜爱有加，便开始频繁向他索求（即纠缠）续集。

The asking (bugging) became pleading (whining), the pleading (whining) transformed into a solicitation (pestering), the solicitation (pestering) soon was a royal decree (demand) and soon the minstrel (loser)was faced with the option of doing the continuation the princess had liked so much, or be asked to compose said story by the princess herself (and be parted from his dear and lovely head).
起初的请求（纠缠）逐渐变为恳求（哀诉），进而演变成恳请（烦扰），最终升级为皇家的命令（要求）。不久，这位吟游诗人（失败者）便面临抉择：要么继续创作公主深爱的故事，要么接受公主的亲自委托来编写此故事（否则他的可爱脑袋将不保）。

So the minstrel worked on this for 3 days and 3 nights, living off from nothing more than water (and cold ale) and the thought of the princess smiling face (and stale bread) and begat a story that seemed to be on the same tenure (and equally as lame) as the original one.
就这样，吟游诗人连续三天三夜沉浸在创作中，仅以清水（和冰镇麦酒）以及公主那令人心动的微笑（还有干硬的面包）为生，最终编织出一个故事，其质量（同样乏善可陈）与原作如出一辙。

No one really knows if the minstrel managed to get anything in return from the princess, and truthfully, since minstrels are a dime a dozen, no one seemed to care.
没人确切知道那位吟游诗人是否从公主那里得到了什么回报，实际上，吟游诗人随处可见，大家对此似乎并不在意。

But if the princess was able to smile and not be bored for any amount of time, the minstrel would then smile softly to himself and say "job well done".
倘若公主能面露微笑，不觉厌倦，吟游诗人便会心满意足地微微一笑，自言自语道：“干得漂亮。”

Plus, he got to keep his head.
不仅如此，他还得以保全性命。

The scene is based on the "Kaname cuts Sousuke's hair" scene from "Scene 6: Edge of heaven" of FMP:TSR and ties directly into the 6th kiss of this collection entitled "Of keeping secrets."
此场景取材自《全金属狂潮：TSR》第 6 幕“天堂的边缘”中“卡奈美为宗介理发”的一幕，与本系列中名为“关于保守秘密”的第 6 个吻紧密相连。

Now, all you snickering fools going "this guy is a dork" kindly remove yourself from my lawn and wait patiently for whatever other hair brained, half cooked story I have on the works.
现在，那些窃笑嘲讽“这家伙真是个呆子”的人，请你们离开我的草坪，耐心等待我即将讲述的其他那些天马行空、尚未成熟的故事。

Eric lo prometido es deuda y te digo por favor dale continuacion a este Chapter, si bien se son OneShot pero por favor hazlo.
埃里克，承诺重于泰山，恳请你继续推进这一章节，尽管它们是独立短篇，但请务必完成。
I LOVE THIS CHAPTER 我非常喜欢这一章
Please Continue... 请继续...

Como me podria negar? Kaname, espero te haya gustado; fue por ti, y es para ti.
我怎能拒绝你呢？Kaname，愿你喜欢；这全是为了你，也是属于你的。

作者按：我将在此声明免责：伊娃及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

Based on the Short story "appointment with love" by S. I. Kishor.
源自 S. I. Kishor 的短篇小说《与爱有约》。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

Twenty before five. 四点四十分。

With a sigh, Shinji looked out the train station, frowning as he noticed the perfect blue skies he had seen this morning had been changed into gray melancholic ones over the course of the day, and it seemed like the rain wasn't letting off.
真嗣叹了口气，望向火车站外，眉头紧锁。他注意到，早上那片完美的蓝天，如今已变成了一片灰暗忧郁的天空，雨似乎没有停下来的意思。

It was one of the usual rainy days in the city of Tokyo-3; it felt cool, and brisk, even if Shinji knew that as soon as the rain would stop, the humidity and warmth would make walking around clothed seem like a chore.
东京-3 市又是一个惯常的雨天；凉爽而清新，但真嗣清楚，雨一停，湿热便会袭来，穿着衣服走动将变得如同负担。

But right now, Shinji simply sighed and let the soothing sound of rain falling and splashing the sidewalk lull him into a sense of calmness that he didn't really feel before checking his cell phone's clock, before he realized that it seemed like time had remained still.
此刻，真嗣只是轻叹一声，任由雨滴敲打人行道的声音抚慰心灵，沉浸在一种前所未有的宁静中。直到他查看手机上的时间，才恍然觉得时间似乎停滞了。

It was still twenty before five.
离五点还差二十分钟。

Sighing once more, Shinji looked at the letter's header, wondering if this was just a show, somebody's idea of a prank, or just another cosmic joke in the never ending series of unfortunate events he called life, unfolding the piece of paper and staring at the note, delicate penmanship that seemed to flow from within the stripped cellulose as if it were a river of black.
真嗣再次叹了口气，盯着信件的抬头，心中疑惑这是否只是一场表演，某人的恶作剧，或是他那充满不幸的生活中又一个宇宙玩笑。他展开纸张，凝视着那细腻的笔迹，仿佛黑色的墨水从纸张纤维中自然流淌而出，宛如一条黑色的河流。

For some reason, the letter had been waiting for him in his shoebox, just before school let out. Shinji had walked straight to the locker and opened it to get his normal tennis shoes out before he saw the pink envelope, still fragrant with perfume, fall on the floor while Shinji simply stared at it as if it had been an alien probe; not really sure of what to do, before he felt a presence next to him, turning around to the see Rei Ayanami, staring along with him at the envelope.
不知为何，那封信一直静静躺在他的鞋盒里，直到放学前。真嗣直奔储物柜，正要取出常穿的网球鞋，一个散发着香水味的粉红信封突然掉落。他愣愣地盯着它，仿佛面对的是外星来的神秘物体，一时不知所措。此时，他察觉到身旁有人，转头一看，绫波丽正与他一同凝视着那封信。

"Will you pick it up?" Rei asked quietly, making Shinji gulp and immediately do as he was told, bending at his knees and snatching the envelope, before holding it out to Rei, who simply took it, gave it a cursory glance and handed it back to him.
"你来捡一下好吗？"绫波轻声问道，真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，随即弯腰捡起信封，递给绫波。绫波接过后，只是随意地看了一眼，便又递回给了他。

"It is not addressed to me; You should be the one opening it." The blue-haired girl said in the same velvety soft monotone she always used while Shinji frowned, holding the letter up against the light and trying to catch sight of whatever it was that had been written on the paper it contained, being able to make out words here and there before sighing once more.
"这封信并非给我的；你才应该打开它。"蓝发女孩依旧用她那柔和而单调的嗓音说道。真嗣皱着眉，将信对着光举起，试图窥见纸上所写的内容，零星辨认出几个词后，再次叹了口气。

"It's probably a mistake; no one would have sent me a letter." Shinji said quietly as he turned the envelope around, making Rei realize there was no name, no anything inside.
"这恐怕是个误会；应该没人会寄信给我。" 碇真嗣低声说着，转动着手中的信封，绫波丽这才注意到，信封内空无一字，没有任何标记。

"You might be correct; however, the envelope was located inside of your shoe box. That makes it your possession." Rei said with what Shinji could only describe as a bemused tone, not really smiling, or smirking, but you could notice the change in the girl's voice; subtle, like the sound of water moving down a stream; the kind of effortless, natural way a sound progresses, so simple and graceful that one would never know there had been a change of pitch if it weren't for a careful listening.
"你或许没错；但信封是在你的鞋盒内发现的，因此它属于你。" Rei 说道，语气中带着一丝难以捉摸的戏谑，既非微笑也非嘲讽，但你能感受到她声音的微妙变化，宛如溪水轻柔流淌，那种自然而然、毫不费力的声音推进，如此简洁而优雅，若非细心聆听，几乎察觉不到音调的转变。

Shinji looked at Rei again, and swallowed hard, before he caught the corner of the envelope and ripped it open with trembling fingers, blowing into the envelop and extracting the letter, noticing it was written on ruled paper, and the first thing that caught Shinji's surprise was the way the words had been written; ever since he had been left to live with his sensei by his father, Shinji had watched as the old man would spend his afternoons sitting in front of white Hanshi scrolls with a vat of Sumi and practice calligraphy over and over and over.
真嗣再次凝视着绫波，艰难地咽了口唾沫，随后用颤抖的手指捏住信封一角，将其撕开，对着信封吹了口气，从中抽出信件。他注意到信是用横线纸写的，而最让他惊讶的是文字的书写方式。自从父亲将他托付给老师后，他常常见到老师在午后，面对着白色的汉诗卷轴，手持墨桶，一遍又一遍地练习书法。

Shinji would focus on the way his face became beatific, how his arms and wrists and hands would seem to move, almost gliding over the parchments with such simplicity and beauty, the boy would literally spend his afternoons watching this happen, sitting in silence and allured at the way creation slowly took form and shape, with the only sounds coming from the room being the occasional wet scratches the Fude would make when sliding on the surface, or the when his teacher would scrape the Sumi against Suzuri, both actions a prelude to his teacher leaving behind a part of his body, mind and soul with each stroke.
真嗣会凝视着他的面容如何流露出祥和之态，手臂、手腕与双手仿佛在羊皮纸上轻盈滑过，动作简洁而优雅。他常常整个下午都静静坐着，全神贯注地观察创作如何逐渐成形，房间内仅有的声响是毛笔在纸面滑动时的细微摩擦，或是老师用墨条在砚台上磨墨的沙沙声，每一次挥毫，老师都仿佛留下了自己的一部分身体、心灵与灵魂。

"Are you not going to read it?"
你不打算读它吗？

Rei's voice brought Shinji back from his contemplation, before he realized something. Ayanami was staring at his face, but her eyes would sometimes look down quickly to the paper in his hand, a mere split of second glance that made Shinji realize something that, in itself, was odd.
绫波的声音打断了真嗣的沉思，他突然意识到一些事情。绫波正盯着他的脸，但她的眼神不时快速地瞥向他手中的纸张，那瞬间的一瞥让真嗣察觉到了一件颇为奇怪的事情。

Rei Ayanami was curious about what the letter held.
绫波丽很好奇信里写了什么。

"Sure." Shinji stammered as he carefully unfolded the letter, reading it quickly before he realized that the letter was brimming with feelings; the way the lines were made, wavy, and curved, and the tension of the lines easily noticeable when it came to the feelings within: he could see the way the pen tip had been dragged, pressing, and sweeping at the lines with no outlining or drawing.
"当然。" 碇真嗣有些结巴，他小心翼翼地展开信件，快速浏览后才察觉到信中满溢的情感；线条的波折、弧度，以及线条间的张力，无不透露出书写时的情感起伏：他清晰地观察到笔尖是如何在纸上拖曳、按压和滑动的，没有任何预先的勾勒或描绘。

As soon as they have been done, Rei had stayed silent, looking at Shinji's back as the boy carefully folded the paper and put it back inside the envelope, before almost reverently placing the letter inside his school bag.
任务一完成，绫便默不作声，目光紧随真嗣，见他细心地将纸张折好，放回信封，随后郑重其事地将信件收进书包。

"The letter…" Rei began quietly, making Shinji turn at her with a sad, melancholic look in his eyes. "Do you know who wrote it?"
那封信……" Rei 轻声说道，令 Shinji 转头看向她，眼中流露出悲伤而忧郁的神色。"你知道是谁写的吗？

Shinji opened his mouth, about to say a name before he realized that could never be true; it was nothing but wishful thinking and hoping against hope.
真嗣张开嘴，正要吐露一个名字，却猛然醒悟那不过是虚幻的愿望，是绝望中的徒劳期盼。

"No, not really." 不，其实不是。

"Will you go and meet her?" Rei prodded once more, staring at Shinji who looked at her conflicted, almost unsure of what to do or say.
"你打算去见她吗？" 绫再次追问，凝视着真嗣，后者显得犹豫不决，似乎不知该如何是好。

That was about thirty minutes ago, Shinji thought to himself as she checked his cellphone once more, noticing the time.
真嗣心想，那大约是三十分钟前，他再次查看手机，留意到时间。

Fifteen before five. 五点差十五分。

Shinji looked to his left and then to his right, noticing the way the rain was still falling.
真嗣左右张望，留意到雨依旧淅淅沥沥地下着。

Truth be told, Shinji had always liked the rain; it had a certain element, something ethereal, barely there, present and almost taunting, but always beyond one's grasp. It was something magical, hope abound, rebirth, something the cleansed the heavens above and the earth below.
老实说，真嗣向来对雨情有独钟；它蕴含着一种特殊的韵味，飘渺而难以捉摸，仿佛近在咫尺却又遥不可及。雨是神奇的，它孕育着希望，象征着新生，能洗净苍穹与大地。

And now, as Shinji stood in the middle of the train station huddled under an umbrella, he glanced at the node once more, as if to make sure he had gotten the message right.
此刻，真嗣站在火车站中央，蜷缩在雨伞下，再次望向节点，似乎在确认自己是否准确无误地接收到了信息。

Meet me at the Kasuga train station, by the Lawsons.
春日火车站旁的罗森便利店见。

Shinji looked back and forth once more, this station was a fairly known one within the students of the Tokyo 3 metropolitan middle school, about 10 minutes away, and in the middle of the Hakusan Dori avenue, and sure enough, a lot of familiar faces were there, some of the students baring the familiar middle school uniforms, while others wore the traditional High school ones, tall, dark and strict-looking Prussian collars for boys, feminine and playful sailor suits for girls.
真嗣再次环顾四周，这个车站对东京 3 市立中学的学生来说颇为熟悉，距离学校大约 10 分钟的路程，坐落在白山大道的中心位置。确实，那里聚集了不少熟面孔，有的学生身着熟悉的中学制服，有的则穿着传统的高中制服，男生是那种高大、深色且显得严肃的普鲁士领，女生则是柔美而活泼的水手服。

Ten minutes to five. 差十分钟五点。

Shinji began to breath in and out, long, calming gulps of fresh air that would oxygenate and cleanse his body, forcing himself to focus on the here and now, before he, once more, took out the letter and re-read it, feeling once more the sense that had been all encompassing, powerful, yet fleeting.
真嗣开始深呼吸，缓缓吸入清新的空气，以此来充氧并净化身体，努力让自己专注于此时此刻。接着，他又一次取出那封信，重新阅读，再次体会到那种强烈却又稍纵即逝的感觉。

Because Shinji had never believed that anyone could see into a hiss heart so tenderly, so understandingly. Because the words all seemed to muddle together, bluring onto each other like a work of art so pure and simple yet so abstract and engrossing, he had never had a doubt he would be here, waiting for that girl, even if he felt everyone was staring at him, even if it seemed like the people around him was about to jump and scream and laugh and point their fingers before the quiet, shy boy realized it had all been a joke.
因为真嗣从未相信有人能如此温柔、如此理解地洞察他的内心。所有的话语仿佛交织在一起，如同一件既纯净简单又抽象引人入胜的艺术品。他从未怀疑自己会在这里等待那个女孩，即便感觉所有人都在注视他，即便周围的人似乎即将跳起、尖叫、大笑并指指点点，直到这个安静、害羞的男孩意识到这一切不过是个玩笑。

Even if… 即便…

I love you so much and you just don't know it. Shinji began reading in silence. Sometimes I get scared to show it. It feels like when you come around me my mouth becomes grid-locked and all the words I want to say just stop.
我深爱着你，你却未曾察觉。真嗣默默地开始阅读。有时我害怕表露心迹。仿佛你一靠近，我的嘴就像被锁住，所有想说的话都凝固了。

Shinji frowned, realizing that it felt more like an auto-biographic letter, like someone had looked inside his soul, reaching for the words that lay there before writing them down, feeling how countless other times, his own lips would clutter, because the words would turn into granite and salt, and just couldn't come out.
真嗣皱眉，意识到这封信仿佛是自传式的，似乎有人深入他的灵魂，捕捉到那些深藏的词句，在书写之前，他感受到无数次，自己的嘴唇会因这些凝重的文字而打结，它们如同花岗岩和盐一般，难以启齿。

Sometimes I want to open up to you and tell you how I feel - I guess I am too scared to open up and be real.
有时我真想向你倾诉心声，告诉你我的真实感受——恐怕我是太害怕坦露心迹，展现真我。

The letter continued for a few more lines, pleading silent feelings and words that couldn't be said out loud, instead placeholding them on paper, and exchanging the sound of voice for the sight of ink, the cadence of syllables being overridden by the space between the words, and the way the lines would tilt up, or travel down… almost as if whoever had written that had first visualized where each line would start, where each word would stop, and where the symbols would meet before even touching the paper.
信件又延续了几行，默默传达着难以启齿的情感，将这些心声寄托于纸上，用墨迹的视觉替代了声音的听觉，音节的节奏被字间的空白所取代，字行或上扬或下行……仿佛写信人在落笔之前，已在心中规划好每行的起始、每词的结束，以及符号的交汇点。

Five more minutes to five.
还有五分钟就到五点。

Shinji looked at the clock on top of him, even after seeing in his phone the same time reflected, before he once again lost himself into the penmanship, into the words, the collage of clashing feelings that seemed to erup before he looked up, startled. A girl passed closer to him, and Shinji started after her, following her with his eyes, a small, shy smile almost threatening to break into his lips before he stopped, the corners of his lips moving south ever so slightly when he noticed she was wearing a pair of hair ribbons, but they weren't the little blue ones She had stated she would be wearing to be identified.
真嗣抬头望向头顶的时钟，即便已在手机上确认过相同时间，他仍再次沉入书写，沉入文字，沉入那仿佛突然迸发的情感交织中。抬头间，一位女孩从旁经过，真嗣的目光追随着她，嘴角几乎要浮现出羞涩的微笑，然而他突然停下，嘴角微垂，因为他发现她佩戴的发带并非她曾提及的用来识别的小蓝发带。

Besides, this girl was about 18, and she crossed from the train station into the opposite side of the Lawsons, into the café located in front, the word velocce shining in bright red lights as the rain kept pounding away, making the night sky arrive earlier than anticipated, which in turn began to make the lights of the city begin to glow, slowly, like a thousand eyes blinking gently to be fully awakened in mere minutes.
此外，这位约莫 18 岁的女孩，从火车站横穿至罗森便利店对面的咖啡馆。“velocce”几个大字在鲜红灯光下熠熠生辉，雨势不减，夜色提前笼罩，城市的灯火随之渐次亮起，仿佛千只眼睛温柔地眨动，即将彻底醒来。

One minute to five. 差一分钟到五点。

Suddenly, Shinji heard the rattling sound of the five o'clock train, before it made its way noisily inside the station, stopping before the doors opened and a sea of people began to pout out of the containing cars, like a great force of nature, moving forth, pushing forward, girls and boys and women and men each talking on the phone and leaving quickly outside, the whooshing sound of their collective voices and conversations changing from a loud, droning sound into a quiet lull, almost like the rain that was beginning to die away, the sounds and the drops falling on his head like a memory long forgotten before two more persons walked out of the last car, walking resolutely, one a few feet behind the other, making Shinji follow them with his eyes to find a sopping wet Asuka Langley Soryu making her way towards him.
突然，真嗣耳边响起了五点钟火车的咔嗒声，火车嘈杂地驶入车站，在车门开启前停稳。紧接着，人群如潮水般从车厢中涌出，宛如一股不可阻挡的自然之力，向前推进。男孩、女孩、男人、女人，每个人都边打电话边匆匆离去。他们集体的声音和交谈从喧闹的嗡鸣逐渐转为轻柔的低语，几乎像开始消退的雨声，雨滴轻落在真嗣头上，唤起久远的记忆。此时，又有两人从最后一节车厢走出，步伐坚定，一前一后，吸引了真嗣的目光。他看到了浑身湿透的惣流·明日香·兰格雷她向着他缓缓走去。

Shinji shifted slightly, his brows creased in mild confusion, noting that, even though the redhead was dressed in her usual school uniform, she was instead walking, not minding the drizzle falling as she focused her eyes on the sky.
真嗣稍稍动了动，眉头微蹙，带着一丝困惑，发现红发女孩虽依旧穿着校服，却选择在细雨中步行，目光凝视着天空，毫不在意雨滴。

Even from here, Shinji could count the rivulets of water as they rolled gently down the redhead's neck and onto her clothing, which was thoroughly stuck to her body, and when she finally reached his side, the half American-half Japanese teen slowed, stopping eventually while her eyes remained focused on the clouds above.
即使站在这里，真嗣也能清晰地看到水珠沿着红发女孩的脖颈轻轻滑落，浸透了她紧贴身体的衣服。当她终于走到他身边时，这位拥有一半美国血统一半日本血统的少年逐渐放慢脚步，最终停了下来，她的目光依旧凝望着天际的云彩。

She refused to meet his eyes yet again, staring upwards as the rain continued to pound her body. Silence stretched between the two.
她又一次避开他的目光，仰头凝视着不断落下的雨滴，任其打湿全身。两人间是一片静默。

Without thinking, Shinji started to move towards her, forgetting to notice that she was wearing no hair ribbons, and as he moved, a small smile curved her lips.
真嗣未加思索便向她走去，忽略了她的发间未系丝带，随着他的靠近，她的唇边浮现出一丝淡淡的微笑。

"What are you doing here..?" Asuka asked with a small tone of hostility, clearly not in the mood to talk to him, but clearly in such low spirits that her usual shrilling tone was replaced by a soft tone.
"你在这儿干嘛呢？" 明日香语气中带着些许不悦，显然无心交谈，情绪低落使得她往日尖锐的嗓音变得柔和。

Shinji looked at her but said nothing; he had learned just by watching Asuka's and Kaji's interaction that sometimes, it was wiser to remain quiet with the red head, and remaining quiet was something Shinji had always been good at.
真嗣默默地注视着她，没有开口；他从观察明日香与加持的互动中领悟到，面对这位红发少女，有时沉默是金，而沉默恰恰是真嗣的拿手好戏。

"I... I m-mean…" Shinji stammered, not being able to look at her, but also trying to look at the hordes of people that were still loitering around the station, trying to find the elusive girl with blue ribbons, wondering if…
"我...我是说…" 真嗣支支吾吾，目光躲闪，却又忍不住扫视车站附近依旧逗留的人群，寻找那个扎蓝丝带的女孩，心中揣测着是否…

"You're going to catch a cold if you stay out there in the rain." Asuka muttered eventually, turning her attention back to the water drops that were collecting on the tin metal roof on top of them both before she dropped her head after a moment, staring ahead with a thoughtful look on her face; a small, sad smile flickering across her lips before she walked away and outside of the station.
"你再这样淋雨，会感冒的。" 明日香终于开口，目光从头顶锡金属屋顶上滴落的水珠移开，低头沉思，脸上掠过一丝哀伤的微笑，随后她便离开了车站。

He made one step closer to her. Then he saw her. She was standing almost directly behind Asuka; looking quiet and calm, red ruby eyes staring at him, piercing into his fark blue ones.
他朝她走近了一步，这才看清了她。她几乎紧贴着明日香站立，神态安详，红宝石般的双眼直视着他，仿佛能洞穿他那深邃的蓝眸。

Rei Ayanami stood in front of Shinji, in the space where Asuka Soryu had just stood, with her blue hair tied up with twin blue hair ribbons on either side of her head, almost as if they had been a headband.
绫波丽站在真嗣面前，恰好是明日香·索蕾尤刚才所在的地方，她那蓝色的头发用两侧的蓝色双发带束起，宛如佩戴了发带一般。

Despite himself, Shinji realized that Asuka was walking quickly away, feeling as though he was being split in two; so deep his desire to follow the redhead girl, even as he saw her quickly cross the avenue, and enter the café, while Ayanami took another step forth, remaining equally calm and passive, not really saying anything, simply staring at Shinji with her big red eyes.
尽管真嗣内心抗拒，他还是意识到明日香正快步离去，心中犹如被撕扯。他强烈地想要追随那位红发少女，眼见她迅速穿过马路，走进咖啡馆，而绫波则静静地再迈一步，依旧保持着平静与沉默，未发一言，只是用她那双大红眼睛默默注视着真嗣。

Shinji understood then that Rei had been the girl to send him the letter, the girl who had been able to read into his soul so easily, that it finally made sense; those feelings he had felt for her, so clear and cut, so deep was his longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and upheld his own…
那一刻，真嗣恍然大悟，原来绫波丽就是寄信给他的女孩，那个轻易洞察他内心的她，一切豁然开朗；他对她的情感，如此明晰而深沉，对那位真正与他灵魂相伴、给予支持的女子的渴望，是如此强烈……

And there she stood. 她就这样站在那里。

He could see her pale face was gentle and sensible; her red eyes had a warm twinkle.
他注意到她那苍白的脸庞既温和又理智，红红的眼睛中透着一丝温暖的光彩。

"Ayanami! You should have told me you were the one who sent me the letter." Shinji began as he walked towards Rei, he smiled softly to the girl whose face never changed, even though when he spoke, Shinji could feel the bitterness of his disappointment.
"绫波！你早该告诉我，那封信是你寄的。" 碇真嗣走向绫波时说道，他向始终面无表情的女孩温柔一笑，尽管如此，从他的话语中，仍能感受到失望的苦涩。

Rei remained there, staring at him, her face never betraying an emotion before she finally spoke in a soft, quiet tone.
丽依旧站在那儿，目不转睛地看着他，脸上波澜不惊，直到最后才轻声细语地开口。

"I do not know what this is all about, Ikari." She answered.
"我真搞不懂这是什么情况，碇。" 她回应说。

Shinji's smile faltered, before looking at Rei's face for any sign of… anything.
真嗣的微笑僵住了，他随即看向绫波的脸，试图捕捉任何可能的迹象。

"Y-you sent me the love letter, didn't you?"
你发给我的那封是情书，对吗？

Rei shook her head. 瑞摇摇头。

"Then why are you wearing the ribbons?" Shinji asked with perplexity.
"那你为什么要戴着这些丝带呢？" 真嗣不解地问道。

"Soryu told me I was to wear them." Rei said calmly, as if she were discussing the weather. "She also said that if you asked me to go out with you, I should tell you she is waiting for you in that establishment across the street."
Soryu 让我穿上这些。" Rei 平静地说，就像在谈论天气一样。"她还提到，如果你邀请我出去，我得告诉你，她在街对面那家店里等你。

Shinji stared at Rei's face, silently asking her a question before Rei nodded, hearing it as clearly as if the boy had asked it aloud.
真嗣凝视着绫波的脸，默默地向她提问，绫波点头示意，仿佛听到了男孩清晰的话语。

"She said it was some kind of test."
她说这是某种测试。

The silence stretched between them again, Asuka's attention once again fixated on the clouds above. After a moment, her lips parted slightly, the quiet dissipating with her words while Asuka held her breath, trying to silence the small gasp that threatened to explode inside her chest. She kept her face low, her red tresses obscuring her face, not allowing Shinji to see her wide eyes, how they were hanging on that small phrase.
沉默又一次在他们之间拉长，明日香的目光再次被头顶的云朵吸引。过了一会儿，她轻启双唇，随着话语的出口，静谧被打破，而明日香则屏息凝神，竭力压制住胸中即将涌出的微弱惊声。她垂下头，红色的秀发遮掩了面容，不让真嗣窥见她那双紧盯着那句简短话语的睁大眼睛。

Shinji lifted his head and looked straight into Asuka's eyes. She could see a thousand conflicting emotions boiling underneath, just dying for him to let go and let them be free and allow himself to finally feel something other than contempt and despair and resentment and sadness.
真嗣抬起头，直视着明日香的眼睛。她能察觉到他心底涌动着千丝万缕的复杂情绪，迫切希望他能释放这些情感，让它们自由流淌，使他能够体验到除轻蔑、绝望、怨恨和悲伤之外的其他感受。

Asuka stood there, taking this all in, feeling for once that the tag of bitch was justly deserved on her, because she felt the same way, and because she knew that if she gave him a chance he would prove her wrong on most of her thoughts about boys.
明日香站在那里，将一切尽收眼底，首次感到“贱人”这一标签对她而言实至名归，因为她内心亦有同感，并且她深知，若给他机会，他多半能证明她对男生的诸多看法是错误的。

She had felt tempted, she had felt so tempted.
她感到诱惑难挡，实在是难以抗拒。

But in the last moment, Asuka had backed down, turning around and walking away, wondering if Shinji would chose right…
就在最后一刻，明日香退缩了，她转身离去，心中疑惑真嗣是否能做出正确的抉择……

And Shinji had stood by his choice; even if she had seen the way the boy had stared at her, even if she had seen the imperceptible way his body had started to move towards her… Shinji had stood his ground, and made a stand, staying behind with Rei.
真嗣坚守了自己的选择；即便她注意到那男孩凝视她的目光，即便她察觉到他身体不自觉地向她靠近的微妙动作……真嗣依旧坚定不移，选择留下来陪伴绫波。

It was then that Shinji walked up to her with an unreadable expression on his face, hair drenched wet, sticking to his face, silently grabbing Asuka's hand, making the redhead girl yelp in surprise before Shinji, in an uncharacteristic show of spine, pulled her out of the café, not bothering or caring about the people staring at them, walking out and into the alley between the café and the Family Mart, before Asuka finally regained her usual sense of self and snapped her hand free, opening her mouth to start berating Shinji before one look into his eyes made her keep quiet.
就在那一刻，真嗣带着难以言喻的表情走向她，湿漉漉的头发紧贴着脸庞。他默默地握住明日香的手，令红发的她惊呼一声。紧接着，真嗣出人意料地展现出坚定，拉着她冲出咖啡馆，全然不顾旁人的目光，直奔咖啡馆与全家便利店间的巷子。直到明日香恢复了往日的冷静，用力抽回手，正欲开口责备，却在看到真嗣眼神的瞬间，选择了沉默。

They were both wet, drenched by the rain, tired and angry; but most of all, they were both scared.
两人都浑身湿透，被雨水淋得疲惫不堪，既累又气；然而，最让他们感到的是恐惧。

It was then Asuka realized this was going to be a do or die situation; a final stand.
那一刻，Asuka 才明白，这将是生死存亡的关键时刻，必须做最后的抗争。

With hesitation, she raised her face towards Shinji, staring once again deep into his eyes, before she gasped audibly, eyes wide in shock and surprise, blush rising into her cheeks, drenched uniform sticking to her body in an almost undignified way.
她犹豫着，缓缓抬头望向真嗣，再次凝视他的双眼，突然间，她惊讶地倒吸一口气，眼睛瞪得大大的，脸颊上泛起红晕，湿漉漉的制服紧贴在身上，显得颇为狼狈。

He regarded her neutrally, and Asuka could almost swear she could see more than a passing resemblance with Rei: expression empty and vacant, eyes cold and unblinking, almost as if he was tired with the whole world.
他以一种中立的目光审视着她，明日香几乎可以肯定，她从他身上看到了与绫波丽不止一星半点的相似之处：面无表情，眼神冷漠而凝滞，仿佛对周遭世界已感疲惫至极。

For what seemed like a minute they both stood there; Shinji with the same face he had had in the train station, while Asuka just looked at him from the rain. The silence became something physical; a tangible wall between them, one Shinji had built in this moment, one for which Asuka had no means to pass it, other than the one which was what made Asuka who she was herself.
似乎过了一分钟，两人依旧僵立原地；真嗣保持着在车站时的神情，而明日香则在雨中默默注视着他。沉默仿佛化作了实体，在他们之间竖起了一堵墙，这堵墙是真嗣此刻筑起的，明日香除了依靠自己的本性，别无他法穿越这道隔阂。

Her indomitable spirit. 她那坚韧不拔的精神。

In a clear '"appearances be damned'" action, Asuka pushed her lips together, and walked towards Shinji; small, deliberate steps that seemed to echo with the rumble of thunder and the sound of water puddles being stepped in before the rain began to fall again.
在一场明显的“形象全抛”的行动中，明日香紧抿着嘴唇，迈着小而坚定的步伐向真嗣走去；她的脚步声似乎与雷鸣和踩踏水坑的声音交织，就在雨水再次倾泻之前。

Letting a small cry, Asuka made her way to Shinji, standing there, breathing deeply in an out, and catching her breath.
轻声啜泣着，明日香走向真嗣，站在原地，深深地吸气又呼气，努力平复呼吸。

And then just as Shinji was about to ask her what she was doing, just before any sound escaped from his lips, Asuka made the second most important choice in her life.
就在真嗣正要开口询问她在做什么的那一刻，声音尚未从他唇边溜出，明日香便做出了她人生中至关重要的第二个决定。

She decided she had talked more than enough, she had heard more than enough; Asuka had always prided herself of taking actions when actions were needed.
她觉得已经说得太多，听得也够多了；明日香向来以在关键时刻采取行动而自傲。

So she did. 她确实做了。

Asuka simply grabbed Shinji and pushed him towards the nearest wall, letting water pour down on them both, enveloping his lips with her own, kissing him deeply, giving her all, all the words she couldn't say, all the feelings she had bottled deep within in that kiss.
明日香猛地抓住真嗣，把他推向最近的墙，任由水流冲刷着两人，她的唇紧紧贴上他的，深吻中倾注了所有未曾说出的话和深藏的情感。

Both of them now completely drenched, feeling the water trickling down their chins, by their lips, thru their faces, as Shinji's hands slowly found Asuka's own, silently, slowly, deliberately intertwining their fingers with each other, letting the letter he had held in his hand, now a crumpled piece of paper, fall into the ground, touching the water, changing the color from stark white into damp gray, while the ink that held Asuka's feelings slowly began to fade away.
两人此刻浑身湿透，水滴沿着下巴、唇边、面庞缓缓流淌。真嗣的手悄然寻觅到明日香的手，静默而缓慢地，他们手指交缠，仿佛有意为之。他手中那封曾紧握的信，现已皱成一团，悄然落地，触水后，洁白纸张转为黯淡的灰，承载着明日香情感的墨迹也逐渐淡去。

I know you love me and you have hidden feelings inside too, but sometimes it seems like it is easier for you to express yourself to me than it is from me to you.
我明白你爱我，你心中也藏着深情，然而有时候，你向我倾诉似乎比我从你那里得到回应要容易得多。

Shinji, I love you, and know that I will always have hidden feelings for you.
真嗣，我爱你，这份情感将永远深藏我心。

From the entrance to the alleyway, Rei stood there, watching both pilots slowly come to terms with their feelings for each other, while she covered herself with an umbrella, before the rain began to fall again, falling on her head like a memory long forgotten, like a tragedy she never knew existed, while Shinji and Asuka simply kept kissing each other harder, deeper…
站在巷口，绫波静静观察着两位驾驶员逐渐坦诚相对的情感。她撑开伞，雨再次悄然降临，滴落在她头上，仿佛一段尘封已久的记忆，或是一场她未曾知晓的悲剧。与此同时，真嗣和明日香正愈发深情地拥吻着彼此……

As the rain kept falling down, cleansing everything, making everything start anew.
雨水持续倾泻，洗净万物，赋予一切新生。

AN: like I said before, this was based on the short story "appointment with love" by S.I. Kishor. This is also a sort of happy birthday for Asuka; may she have many more of these days.
正如之前提到的，这个故事源自 S.I. Kishor 的短篇小说《爱情约会》。同时，这也是对明日香的一份生日祝福，愿她未来的日子里充满这样的美好时光。

As a side note, yes… I'm still here.
顺便说一句，没错…我依然在。

### Chapter 13 Themes: K#28 (Wada Calcium CD3), W#03 (Shopping)
主题：K#28（Wada 钙片 CD3），W#03（购物）

Title: Untitled. 标题：未命名。

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
作者按：我将在此声明免责：伊娃及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

Laughter echoed on the streets with a ringing texture, while the giant television set on top of the department store began to boom with the sound of two boots, one red, one blue tapping simultaneously against the floor before the light-toned ringing of Christmas bells began to march in a happy, joyful melody and two pretty girls dressed appropriately in Santa outfits, one red, one blue jumped into the stage and began to sing happily.
街道上回荡着清脆的笑声，百货公司顶部的巨型电视屏幕中，一红一蓝两只靴子同时敲击地面的声音响起，紧接着是轻快的圣诞铃声，奏出欢快的旋律。两位身着圣诞装的美丽女孩，一红一蓝，跃上舞台，开始欢快地歌唱。

"This is stupid." Asuka muttered to herself as she looked left and right, noticing with a bit of bitterness and sadness there weren't many places open, all of them were actually closing up, the clerks and boys and girls inside doing so earnestly, diligently as they were getting ready to end the half a day tradition of working on this day before going off to their families, off to enjoy the holidays, while the redhead watched them with a little bit of envy, and a small amount of sadness behind her bright blue eyes as she kept walking, hearing the conversations mixing, overlapping, names and wishes and laughter and sounds converging, collapsing and convexing everything into a happy cacophony of sounds that made Asuka feel even more vulnerable to the seasons and the memories, even as she held her hands inside the pockets of her coat, walking with her face down as another gust of chilly air blew against her, making the ends of her scarf fly around with her red hair before she finally stopped on a corner, looking up at the bright tree, green and shiny but artificial and fake, like everything in this country she had seen so far.
这真是太蠢了。明日香喃喃自语，左右顾盼，心中泛起一丝苦涩与忧伤，发现周围店铺大多已打烊。店员和年轻人们正认真地结束这半日的工作，准备回家与亲人共度佳节。红发女孩目送他们离去，眼中闪过一丝羡慕与淡淡的哀愁，继续前行。耳边是交织的谈话声、祝福语、欢笑声，汇成一片热闹的喧嚣，让她在季节与回忆面前更显脆弱，即便她紧握双手。她低着头，双手插在风衣口袋中，迎着又一阵寒风，红发与围巾的末端随风飘扬。终于，她在拐角处驻足，抬头凝视那棵明亮的树，绿意盎然、光彩夺目，却是人工的假象，正如她在这个国家所见的一切。

Asuka looked at the streets once more, noticing that now the volume of people had dramatically dropped, from being so packed it resembled a living sea of people, so packed one could hardly walk to it just being a trickle of pedestrians, most already making their way to the train stations or catching whichever other form of transportation they could find, before Asuka once again walked out of the corner she had kept to herself, walking back aimlessly, without a clear destination until she reached a bench near the fountain by the tree she had just passed, sitting and folding her arms to her chest to keep warm as the condensation of her breath escaped from between her lips.
明日香再次凝视街道，发现人群已大幅减少，从之前拥挤如潮，几乎寸步难行，变为如今只有零星行人，多数人已赶往火车站或寻找其他交通方式。她从藏身的角落走出，漫无目的地游荡，直至来到刚才路过的树旁的喷泉边，坐在长椅上，双臂紧抱胸前以抵御寒意，呼吸间的水汽从唇边飘散。

She never knew how long she stayed there, before another figure walked up to her and sat down, the wooden planks creaking heavily at the shifting of the other occupant's weight.
她记不清自己在那儿待了多久，直到另一人走过来坐下，随着对方体重的转移，木板发出沉重的吱嘎声。

"This isn't a night for someone like you to be alone."
像你这样的人，今晚不该独自一人。

Asuka almost audibly rolled her eyes as she groaned inwardly, not turning around, letting the living cascade that was her hair fall on top of her, coating her face as she spoke in a tired but angry tone.
明日香几乎能听见自己翻白眼的声音，她内心呻吟着，没有回头，任由那如瀑布般的长发披散下来，遮住脸庞，用疲惫却带着怒气的口吻说话。

"I'm not looking for a date, so you can go and try to pick up some other bimbo down the street."
我并非在寻找约会对象，你大可去街上找其他女孩试试。

The rumbling laughter behind her made the redhead snap up her head, turning sharply around to come face to face with an obese man staring at her with a twinkle in his eye, making Asuka frown as she began to slowly speak his name.
她身后响起的轰笑声让红发女子蓦地抬头，迅速转身，迎面是一个胖男人，眼中闪着光，这让明日香不禁皱眉，缓缓念出他的名字。

"Santa..?" 圣诞老人...？

And then, her alarm clock sounded.
接着，她的闹钟响了起来。

"Hey kids, are you ready for today?" Misato said happily, bouncing like a little girl which was a shocking contrast in itself, apart from the fact that she was still dressed in her usual sleeping getup of boxer shorts and a long, short-sleeved shirt.
"嘿，孩子们，准备好迎接今天了吗？" 三乡开心地问道，像个活泼的小女孩般蹦跳着，这副模样与她依旧穿着的日常睡衣——短裤和长袖 T 恤——形成了鲜明对比。

"Today? What's so special about today?" Shinji asked while trying really hard not to stare at his guardian's body, and how her boxer shorts were hiking up just so with the way Misato was standing on her tip-toes trying to reach for the cereal box.
"今天怎么了？今天有什么特别的吗？" 真嗣问道，他尽力避免直视监护人的身体，尤其是她踮脚去拿麦片盒时，短裤因姿势而略微上移的情景。

"Do you need to get closer to get a better look, perv?" Asuka asked Shinji in an angry whisper, knowing full well that if she asked the same question aloud, Shinji's embarrassment would be followed up by Misato teasing him, which would then turn into the purple-haired woman teasing her.
"你是不是得凑近点才能看得更清楚，小色鬼？" 明日香带着怒气低声质问真嗣，她心知肚明，若大声说出，真嗣的窘迫会招致美里的戏谑，随后那紫发女子也会转而取笑她。

And Asuka Langley Soryu was in no mood to be teased or made fun of right now.
此刻，惣流·明日香·兰格雷全无被戏谑或嘲弄的心绪。

"Today? Why, it's Christmas, of course!" Misato said still without turning, using the English name of the festivity, her natural Japanese accent making the word come out thick and slow, like amber or syrup, which made Asuka growl before she spoke once more, as she began to quickly and quietly eat her breakfast, ignoring Misato's tease, and Shinji's blustering excuses, and Pen^2's excited warks, before finally having enough, slamming her hands on the table and dragging her chair sharply against the floor, screeching sounds that seemed to quench the otherwise happy morning making her roommates turn to the redhead as she walked to the sink and placed her plates inside, making them clatter nosily before she walked away towards the door.
"今天？当然是圣诞节啦！" 葛城美里头也没回，用英语说出这个节日名，她那日式口音让这个词听起来厚重而缓慢，仿佛琥珀糖浆一般，惹得明日香不满地哼了一声。接着，她又开始迅速而安静地吃早餐，对葛城美里的调侃、真嗣的辩解以及 Pen^2 兴奋的叫声置若罔闻。最终，她忍无可忍，猛拍桌子，用力拖动椅子，刺耳的声音打破了原本欢乐的早晨氛围，让室友们都看向这位红发少女。她走向水槽，重重地放下盘子，发出一阵嘈杂声，然后转身朝门口走去。

"Uhh… is something wrong Asuk–"
呃…明日香，有什么不对劲吗？

Asuka got up and walked to the door, not even letting Misato finish saying her name before she turned her head a little to the side, glaring at them both over her shoulder before she finally spoke.
明日香起身走向门口，未等美里叫完她的名字，便稍稍侧首，用余光冷冷地瞥了两人一眼，这才开口。

"It's Christmas, Misato, not Ku-Ri-Su-Ma-Su." Asuka said coldly, punctuating the syllables of the Japanese pronunciation before turning around and leaving as fast as she could.
"这是圣诞节，明日香，不是'库里斯马斯'。" 她冷冷地说着，刻意强调了日语发音的每个音节，随即转身快步离去。

Shinji looked at the space Asuka had just left vacant with a distant look, opening his mouth as if trying to stop her even as the door had already closed behind the redhead, making the blue-eyed boy turn to Misato who simply gave Shinji a small smile and a shrug.
真嗣凝视着明日香刚离开的空位，眼神迷离，他张口欲言，仿佛想挽留她，尽管门已随着红发少女的背影紧闭。他转头看向美里，美里只是对他微微一笑，耸了耸肩。

"Want to help me put up the tree?" Misato asked while trying to maintain a happy face, even if inside, her own face seemed to be a mirror image of Shinji's own concern, while they both began to take out the small artificial tree out of the closet, while Shinji helped as much as he could, pulling out bags and boxes with tinsel and garnishes that were probably from last year's, and knowing Misato, she would go to the store shortly to buy new things to put.
"能帮我一起布置圣诞树吗？" 美里尽力维持着笑容，尽管内心她的表情与真嗣的担忧如出一辙。两人开始从壁橱中取出那棵小型的假树，真嗣也尽力帮忙，拖出装着去年剩余的金属丝和装饰品的袋子和箱子。了解美里的习惯，她不久后肯定会去商店添置新装饰。

Both worked in silence, talking here and there with small chuckles and polite laughs but one could easily tell it felt forced, contrived.
两人默默地工作，间或交谈，夹杂着几声轻笑和礼貌的笑声，但不难察觉，这一切显得颇为勉强和刻意。

"Hey, I know! Why don't you come with me so we can buy new things for the tree?" Misato asked suddenly, making Shinji blink slowly, staring up at her while Misato kept putting on tinsels and spheres and lights and ornaments before turning to Shinji with a big, easy smile. "We can go and buy some more things for the tree and the house, and even start buying the things for dinner!"
嘿，我有个主意！你何不跟我一起去给圣诞树添置些新装饰呢？" Misato 突然提议，让 Shinji 眨了眨眼，抬头看向她。Misato 正忙着往树上挂彩带、球饰、灯饰和各种装饰，随后转向 Shinji，露出一个轻松的笑容。"我们可以去采购更多装饰品，顺便开始准备晚餐所需的食材！

Shinji nodded with the same small smile he had showed before; a sad smile of sorts, the kind of smile one flashes when you force yourself to smile because others expect it from you, simply going through the motions as he and Misato left her apartment, walking the small distance towards the nearest Family Mart, before they both went inside and instantly made a bee-line for the Christmas presents and as the colorful Christmas carols kept playing over and over overhead in bright, happy notes, lights shining bright overhead, blinking in and out while nearby little plush dolls were singing in squeaky high voices.
碇真嗣带着之前那种淡淡的微笑点了点头，那是一种略带哀伤的微笑，仿佛是为了回应他人的期待而勉强挤出的笑容。他和美里一同离开公寓，走向最近的 Family Mart。一进门，两人便直奔圣诞礼物区。店内，欢快的圣诞颂歌循环播放，五彩灯光闪烁，旁边的小毛绒玩偶发出尖细的歌声。

But while the music and lights weren't enough to make Shinji smile, Misato could only stare in amazement at the display of Christmas presents that were in front of her; there were packages with assortments of cookies, and coffee; salad oils and fruit juices, canned seafood, before one particular pack caught her eyes, grinning mischievously as she pulled it out and showed to Shinji.
虽然音乐和灯光未能让真嗣露出笑容，美里却对眼前展示的圣诞礼物惊叹不已；各式包装的饼干、咖啡，还有沙拉油和果汁，以及罐装海鲜，其中一件特别的包裹吸引了她的注意，她狡黠地笑着，将其取出展示给真嗣看。

"For your dad." 送给你爸爸的。

"Wada Calcium… CD3? I don't think he'd like those." Shinji said as confusion slowly melted into perplexity as he looked from Misato to the packaged box claiming to have a full year's supply, claiming it was the needed supplement to make bones strong and healthy, encouraging calcification and bone cell growth, as well as promoting the production of vitamin C for the development and maintenance of scar tissue, blood vessels, and cartilage.
"Wada 钙片…CD3？我觉得他不会喜欢这些。" 碇真嗣说道，困惑逐渐转为迷茫，他目光从葛城美里转向包装盒，上面宣称含有足够一年的供应量，声称这是增强骨骼强度和健康所需的补充剂，促进钙化和骨细胞生长，同时促进维生素 C 的产生，以支持瘢痕组织、血管和软骨的发育和维护。

"Maybe we should give it to Rei; she's still taking all those pills…" Misato smiled lighlty as Shinji gave her the universal look that meant this wasn't a good plan.
"或许该把它交给丽，她还在服用那么多药物……" 美里轻笑一声，而真嗣则用那普遍表示这不是个好主意眼神回应她。

"Ok, so maybe he'll see through my ruse altogether. Maybe we can give those to Asuka instead!" Misato giggled before turning around to the displays that contained a plethora of items like small rolled hams and cheeses, toiletries and candies as well as a wide variety of product packs like a 20-piece soap package, while Shinji simply shook his head, giving Misato a small smile as they waited patiently in line, before he heard Misato uttering a small whimper, like surprise and yearning combined into a sharp intake of air.
"好吧，或许他会彻底看穿我的小把戏。不如把这些给明日香吧！" 美里咯咯笑着，转身望向陈列着琳琅满目商品的显示屏，那里有小卷火腿、奶酪、洗漱用品和糖果，以及各式产品套装，比如 20 块装的肥皂。真嗣只是摇了摇头，对美里报以淡淡的微笑，两人在队伍中静静等待。突然，他听到美里发出一声轻微的呜咽，像是惊讶与渴望交织的急促呼吸。

"Shinji~" Misato said softly, elongating the last syllable of the boy's name as she tugged at his shirt, making Shinji turn to see what the older woman had seen.
"真嗣~" 美里柔声唤道，拉长着少年名字的尾音，同时轻扯他的衣角，促使他转头望向她所注视的方向。

"Misato, you're drooling." Shinji said dryly as he saw Misato's current object of attraction; a 15-can beer package which made the mauve-haired woman's eyes twinkle and mouth hang open, lips smacking as if she could just taste the flavor of Kirin while Shinji rolled his eyes, ignoring Misato's whimpers and silent, pleading looks for Shinji to loan her some money, who simply ignored her before they paid and then made their way back home where they began to gather the various decorations, pulling out lights and shiny flecks and tinsel and various other ornaments.
"三笠，你口水都流出来了。" 真嗣冷冷地说，目光落在三笠眼前的那包 15 罐啤酒上，那啤酒让她的眼睛闪烁着光芒，嘴巴微张，嘴唇咂吧着，仿佛已尝到麒麟啤酒的美味。真嗣对此不以为然，对三笠的呜咽和无声的求助视而不见，她希望真嗣能借她点钱。真嗣对此置之不理，他们付了钱，然后一起回家，开始布置各种装饰，拿出彩灯、闪亮的碎片、金银丝带和其他装饰品。

"Why was Asuka so angry?" Shinji asked quietly after a while, not looking up at Misato turned back at him with a conflicted look in her face, sighing, before shrugging slowly, focusing on the twinkling lights being wrapped around the veranda bars.
"明日香为何如此生气？" 片刻后，真嗣低声询问，并未抬头望向美里。美里回过头，面露纠结，轻叹一声后缓缓耸肩，目光投向了缠绕在阳台栏杆上的点点灯光。

"She just has a very rough Christmas, Shinji… you know that…" Misato whispered quietly, looking down. "Her mother…"
她刚度过了一个十分艰难的圣诞节，真嗣……你明白的……" 三笠轻声说道，垂下了目光。"她的母亲……

Shinji nodded, knowing all too well how Asuka must be feeling, because he was in the same position.
真嗣点头表示理解，他完全能体会到明日香的心情，毕竟他自己也经历过类似的情况。

"I just wanted to give you two a chance to have a nice Christmas." Misato said softly, almost as if she wanted only herself to hear that, before Shinji looked up and gave her two things; the small, plastic star filled with lights that should go on top of the tree and a small, but honest, open smile, a little unsure here and there, but still a smile nonetheless.
"我只是想给你们俩一个机会，共度一个温馨的圣诞节。" 碇真嗣轻声细语，似乎只想让自己听见，随后碇真嗣抬头，递给她两样东西：一颗装点着灯光的小塑料星星，应置于树顶，以及一个虽小却真诚的微笑，虽带些许犹豫，但依旧温暖人心。

"I know…" Misato said, accepting the star and winking at Shinji who blushed almost on the spot and looked away with a small squeak. "Do you know the story of Christmas?"
我明白…" 三佐接过星星，向真嗣眨眼示意，真嗣立刻脸颊绯红，轻声惊叫后别过头去。"你了解圣诞节的传说吗？

"It's like Monk Hoeiosho, right?" Shinji said after thinking for a while, making Misato utter a smile and ruffle his hair.
"就像僧侣 Hoeiosho 那样，对吧？" 真嗣沉思片刻后说道，美里听后微微一笑，伸手揉了揉他的头发。

"Not quite, kiddo… that's for Santa Claus. The story of Christmas is slightly more complicated than that." Misato said as she grabbed some loose silvery flakes form the tinsel, cupping them in her hand and blowing softly into them, making them fly out, twinkling and falling ever so slowly while Shinji stared at it with eyes shiny and wide, mouth open in awe and surprise, before a small contended smile escaped from his lips.
"不完全是这样，孩子…那是给圣诞老人的。圣诞节的故事其实更复杂一些。" 三笠托说着，从装饰带上抓起一些松散的银色亮片，用手掌捧着，轻轻吹气，让它们飞舞起来，闪烁着缓缓飘落。真嗣睁大眼睛，目不转睛地看着，嘴巴因惊讶而微微张开，随后嘴角露出一丝满足的微笑。

"It's just like snow!" 就像下雪一样！

"Yes, but this is more of a setting." Misato began quietly as she turned the little tree, pushing it back and beckoning Shinji to come sit next to her as she turned on the TV, which made Pen^2 look outside of his fridge and waddle up to his owner, plopping down on his feathery tummy and leaning his beak on Misato's knee.
"是的，不过这更像是一个场景。" 三笠轻声说着，边转动小树边示意真嗣坐到她身旁。她打开电视，Pen^2 见状便从冰箱里探出头，摇摇晃晃地走到她跟前，一屁股坐在羽毛般的肚子上，用喙轻轻倚在三笠的膝头。

"A long time ago in a place very, very far from here, a young lady and her husband were traveling." Misato began while Shinji nodded, paying attention while still finishing putting the lights on the tree. "Now, the husband was kind of poor, and the lady was about to give birth, and they were asking people to let them stay the night in their houses, and every time they did, people would tell them no."
很久以前，在一个遥不可及的地方，一位年轻女士与她的丈夫踏上了旅程。Misato 开始叙述，Shinji 边听边继续给圣诞树挂灯。'这位丈夫颇为贫困，而女士即将临盆，他们恳求人们留宿一晚，却屡遭拒绝。'

Shinji smiled, closing his eyes, for some reason imagining the lady had short brown hair and was somewhat of a ditz, but still meant well and was kind and gentle, while her husband would have a stern face and will talk like he was always giving orders, or smile like he knew something you didn't know; he would have a jaw-line beard and a stern grimace and the lady would bicker and tell him he should learn how to smile more.
真嗣微笑着闭上眼，脑海中浮现出这样的画面：那位女士留着棕色短发，虽有些迷糊却心地善良，温柔可亲；她的丈夫则面容严肃，说话时总带着命令的口吻，或是露出一种深知内情的微笑；他下巴留着胡须，神情严肃，而女士则会与他斗嘴，提醒他应该多学会微笑。

But when he wasn't looking, she would blush and look at him with such adoration, and he would look back at her in a way that would melt the hard lines of his face away, leaving in them both only warm soft eyes.
每当他不注意时，她便脸颊泛红，满怀深情地凝视他，而他回望的眼神亦能融化脸上的冷峻，两人眼中只剩下温柔与暖意。

"Just like Dad." Shinji said, making Misato look at the boy while giggling to herself.
"就跟爸爸一样。" 真嗣说着，美里看着他，忍不住笑了起来。

"Not really, Shinji… these two people were giving birth to the savior of mankind."
其实不然，真嗣……这两位正在诞生人类的救星。

Asuka grumbled to herself as she looked at the night sky, lying on her back on the roof of Misato's apartment building.
明日香躺在美里公寓楼的屋顶上，仰望着夜空，嘴里不满地嘟囔着。

She hadn't meant to act nasty, but the season and the month and the dates were just getting to her and she…
她本无意刻薄，然而季节的变迁、月份的更迭以及那些特定的日子，正悄然影响着她的情绪，她……

"I miss you mama." Asuka muttered quietly as she felt her eyes tearing up, before she angrily shook her head and willed herself not to cry, because crying was a sign a weakness, and because of that, Asuka had vowed to herself she would never show weakness, or be taken advantage of.
"妈妈，我好想你。" 阿苏卡轻声自语，眼眶不禁泛起泪光，但她立刻愤怒地摇头，强忍泪水，因为哭泣意味着软弱，她早已立誓绝不示弱，更不会让人趁虚而入。

Because Asuka believed she could not allow herself to be vulnerable; because not allowing herself to cry was her way of proving she was strong and could handle what life handed her.
明日香坚信自己不能示弱；她认为不让自己流泪，正是她展现坚强、能够承受生活挑战的方式。

Because she needed to be strong.
因为她必须坚强。

So, because of that, she would not let herself cry.
所以，她不允许自己流泪。

But right now, today, Asuka felt an ache in her heart; it had started like a small, little pressure in the morning when she woke up, before it started growing, and pretty soon, it was like walking around with a weigh glued to her body; feeling heavy and sluggish, like everything took twice as much energy and thrice as much will to happen.
然而就在今天，明日香感到内心一阵隐痛；这痛楚起初只是清晨醒来时的一点点压迫感，随后逐渐加剧，不久便如同身上被重物紧紧粘附，感到沉重且行动迟缓，仿佛每件事都需耗费双倍体力与三倍意志力才能推进。

It was not something that Asuka had been conscious of at first, since everything had been subtle, but lately, Asuka had began to notice how her surroundings took on a different tone at certain times.
起初，明日香并未察觉到这一点，因为一切变化都十分微妙，但最近，她开始留意到周围环境在特定时刻会呈现出不同的氛围。

At night, the shadows seemed more somber, and in the mornings the sunlight felt flat and even annoying. The walks she and Shinji would take back from school progressively started to feel more like a chore, like something that was needed to be done instead of the small amount of joy walking home always brought the redhead, even if she had never told Shinji so.
夜幕下，阴影愈发显得沉重，清晨的阳光则平淡无奇，甚至有些恼人。她和真嗣放学后一同回家的路途，渐渐变得像是一种不得不完成的任务，失去了往日步行归家时带给红发女孩的那份小小喜悦，尽管她从未对真嗣提及。

And just lately, there were moments during late afternoon when a kind of panic and anxiety seemed to loom over her.
近来，每到傍晚时分，她总会莫名感到一阵恐慌和焦虑袭来。

It felt like she was trapped in amber, watching time and people slowly waste away and all that she could feel was sadness and a subtle pain that seemed to seep inside her bones.
她仿佛被封存在琥珀里，目睹着时光与人们缓缓流逝，内心充斥着无尽的悲伤和一种深入骨髓的隐痛。

And she felt tired… so very tired.
她感到疲惫不堪。

Sighing, Asuka closed her eyes, and slowly drifted off to sleep, before her mind began to dwell back to a few days…
明日香轻叹一声，闭上双眼，渐渐沉入梦乡，思绪却不自觉地飘回到几天前……

It had been warm, one of those weird pockets of warmth that came before the rain had made itself present, coating the city with a blanket of coldness that no one had been ready for; making Misato and Shinji and herself open up boxes of forgotten clothes, pulling out coats and sweaters and leggings to ward themselves.
曾有一阵温暖，是那种在降雨前突如其来的暖意，紧接着雨水便席卷城市，带来了一层出乎意料的寒气；这迫使美里、真嗣和她不得不翻找遗忘的衣物箱，取出外套、毛衣和打底裤以御寒。

But right then, Asuka would still remember the oppressive warmth vividly through the eye of her mind, feeling so real, so vivid and true she could almost feel the freezing vapor hit her face like a cold curtain when she had opened up the freezer door as soon as she and Shinji had gotten back from school; Shinji going straight to his room to take off his uniform and change into his normal lounging clothes while Asuka grabbed a popsicle, instantly feeling some sort or relief from the oppressing heat that had been feeling before going to her room to change as well, walking back to the living room and sitting on her favorite spot in the couch.
就在那一刻，明日香依然清晰地记得那种令人窒息的温暖，感觉如此真实、如此鲜活，仿佛能感受到她和真嗣放学回家后，一打开冰箱门，那股冰冷的蒸汽如同冷帘般扑面而来；真嗣径直回房换下校服，穿上家居服，而明日香则取了一根冰棍，顿时从之前的闷热中得到一丝缓解，随后也回房更衣，再回到客厅，坐在沙发上她最钟爱的角落。

Shinji had walked out, and Asuka was giggling as the boy did the same thing she had done before; opening the door and closing his eyes and letting out a small, whimpered murmur of enjoyment as he savored the moment, letting the coldness touch his sweaty skin while his light, sleeveless shirt and shorts stuck to his body, before remembering why he was there, and began groping around the frozen fish that Misato bought to feed her pet penguin.
真嗣走了出去，明日香在一旁咯咯笑，看着他重复自己之前的动作：打开门，闭上眼，发出一声轻微而愉悦的呜咽，享受着寒冷触碰汗湿肌肤的瞬间，轻薄的无袖上衣和短裤紧贴身体。随后，他记起此行的目的，开始摸索美里买来喂宠物企鹅的冻鱼。

Asuka could clearly remember the goofy smile Shinji had on his face; summer break was here, finally, and while it might meant that the heat wave was going to be a daily situation and that he would be forced to wear shorts and shirts, something Asuka clearly knew Shinji despised due to his skinny, scrawny frame…
明日香清晰记得真嗣那傻笑，暑假总算来临。虽然这意味着酷热将成常态，他得穿短裤和 T 恤，但明日香知道真嗣因自己瘦削的身形对此颇为反感……

But it also meant no more classes, no more homework or exams, no more standing and bowing and sitting.
然而，这也意味着告别了课堂，告别了作业和考试，告别了那些起立、鞠躬和就坐的仪式。

It meant Asuka was free to lounge around the apartment, and watch TV, or play videogames, or…
这意味着明日香可以自在地在家中闲坐，看看电视，玩玩游戏，或是做些别的

Uh oh… Asuka thought to herself, noticing how Shinji was frowning, as if he had noticed that what he had been rummaging around for inside the freezer wasn't there. He felt around again, and came out empty handed again, and that was when he leaned into the freezer and looked around, noticing the empty box inside.
哎呀… 明日香心想，注意到真嗣眉头紧锁，似乎察觉到他在冰箱里翻找的东西不见了。他再次伸手摸索，仍旧一无所获，于是他探身进冰箱仔细查看，发现了那个空盒子。

Just as Asuka was unwrapping the popsicle Shinji had just been looking for, making the boy turn around to the soft sound of a wrapper being torn, seeing Asuka sitting in the bean chair in front of the TV, dressed in her usual light blue tank top and blue/white shorts. Her legs were crossed, and he could see her jiggling her top foot, a small laughter and giggle would sometimes come from within her, and she would afterwards go back to making soft humming sounds, followed by a low popping noise.
就在真嗣寻找冰棍之际，明日香恰好拆开了它，那撕开包装的细微声响让真嗣转过身来。只见明日香坐在电视前的豆袋椅上，依旧是那件天蓝色背心搭配蓝白短裤。她双腿交叠，不时轻晃着脚尖，偶尔发出几声轻笑，随后又沉浸在柔和的哼唱中，间或传来一声低沉的爆裂声。

She would smack her lips and then 'hmm' a song open mouthed as she picked a magazine that was next to her, looking at it, flipping the pages before looking up again and watching the TV.
她会咂咂嘴，接着张嘴'嗯'地哼唱，同时拿起身旁的杂志，边翻阅边抬头看电视。

"Hey, is that the last popsicle?" Shinji asked as he made his way to the beanbag chair, as Asuka looked back from her place, the icicle in her mouth, a deep blue hanging haphazardly as she held onto it and her mouth gave it another lick.
"嘿，那是最后一根冰棍吗？" 真嗣问道，同时走向豆袋椅，而明日香从她的位置转过头来，嘴里叼着冰棍，深蓝色的一端随意垂挂，她紧握着冰棍，又舔了一下。

"I don't know…" She answered back shrugging. "I guess."
我也不太确定…" 她边说边耸肩。"可能吧。

"B-but you know that is my favorite."
可是，你知道那是我最爱的。

"Sorry." Asuka said simply, shrugging her shoulders but not even bothering to turn around.
"不好意思。" 明日香随口说道，耸了耸肩，却连身子都没转过来。

Shinji's face and eyes began to water as if this had been what he had been looking for the whole time, words already coming out of his mouth in bubbling phrases, mentioning how this was his last popsicle, and how he really liked the flavor, making Asuka roll her eyes, but slowly try to see what was so good about this frozen treat.
真嗣的脸庞和双眼开始泛起泪光，仿佛他长久以来寻觅的正是这一刻。他口中不由自主地冒出断断续续的话语，提到这是他最后一根冰棍，并且他非常喜欢这个味道。这让明日香不禁翻了个白眼，但同时也渐渐地想要探究这冰冻甜品究竟有何魅力。

Because Asuka had seen Shinji's face every time he had one, how he would close his eyes, and blissfully enjoy it, as if were a little bit of heaven, something elusive, something meant to be for him and him alone, and it piqued Asuka's curiosity.
每次真嗣享用时，明日香总能瞥见他的表情——他闭上双眼，满是幸福地品味，仿佛那是天堂的一隅，飘渺而专属，这勾起了明日香的好奇。

And now that she tasted it, she could understand it… it tasted like one of her lip gloss, very berries; it tasted of strawberries and blueberries and raspberries and blackberries all rolled in one; it tasted to her like summer, those summers that felt so long and yet so close she would spend in Germany with mama, and the times she would spend with her in the backyard of their house, picking berries to make jam and Rote Grütze…
如今她尝到了，终于理解了那味道……它尝起来就像她的一款唇彩，充满了浆果的香甜；草莓、蓝莓、树莓和黑莓的味道交织在一起；对她而言，这味道让她想起了夏天，那些悠长而又亲近的夏日，她与母亲在德国共度的时光，还有在后院一起采摘浆果制作果酱和红果羹的温馨时刻……

It tasted of nostalgia: of hands held, and fingers intertwined, feeling her mother's long, delicate fingers on top of her head, Kyoko's own hair as dark as the bark of the trees while Asuka would look up holding onto her sun hat, smiling and giggling and it ached.
它带着怀旧的味道：手牵手，手指交织，感受母亲纤长细腻的手指轻触头顶，京子的黑发深沉如树皮，而明日香抬头紧握太阳帽，笑容中带着咯咯的笑声，心中却隐隐作痛。

It hurt in ways she couldn't understand, because it hurt to think of her mom and think of their house.
这种痛苦让她难以理解，因为每当想起母亲和那个家，心就隐隐作痛。

And for some reason, the hurt was mirrored in Shinji's eyes.
不知何故，那份伤痛在真嗣的眼里映现了出来。

And Asuka was rolling her eyes hard at him, while Shinji's head was held low, because her lips were puckering because of the sugar not the berries that were still dangling in her tongue and lips, making the taste cloud her, envelop her, making it harder and harder to stop herself from thinking and leaning forth, even as her mouth began to move and she could only stare at Shinji's face.
明日香对真嗣翻了个大大的白眼，而真嗣则低头不语。她的嘴唇因糖分而非舌尖上残留的浆果而微微撅起，这甜味让她沉浸其中，难以自拔，越来越难以抑制自己不去思考，不去靠近，即便她的嘴唇开始动起来，目光也只能停留在真嗣的脸上。

Shinji looked up form the way he was staring at his feet, pathetically and lost in love, before his senses began to talk to him…
真嗣从呆呆地盯着脚尖的状态中回过神来，带着几分可怜，沉溺于爱意之中，接着他的感官开始向他传递信息……

Before his eyes told him Asuka's eyes were a brighter blue than he could imagine…
在他眼前，明日香的眼睛蓝得超乎他的想象……

Before his ears told him she was speaking in a very small, whispered, soft voice.
他耳边传来她那细小、低语般柔和的声音。

"So all you want is a taste?"
你只是想尝个鲜吗？

Before his nose smelled the bitter sweet smell of very berries, and his lips felt the soft pressure of Asuka's lips on his, a very small, innocent, childish peck even as she was touching the back of his neck, running her fingers through the soft hair of the nape of his neck…
在嗅到那苦甜交织的野莓香气之前，他的唇已感受到明日香唇上的轻柔触碰，那是一个极其微小、纯真、孩子气的吻，同时，她轻抚他的后颈，手指穿梭于他颈后柔软的发丝间……

Before he blinked quickly, even as Asuka was sitting back again in the beanbag chair, staring at the TV while Shinji's tongue darted out to unconsciously lick his lips, tasting the very berries from the popsicle on his lips, sweet and sour and sugary and bitter and just like he always thought Asuka would taste.
就在他快速眨眼之前，明日香已重新坐回豆袋椅，目光紧锁电视屏幕。此时，真嗣无意识地伸出舌头舔了舔嘴唇，唇上残留的冰棍浆果味，甜酸交织，既甜蜜又带一丝苦涩，恰如他心中对明日香味道的想象。

Asuka giggled softly to herself as she remembered Shinji's dazed look; how he looked like walking in a straight line was a superhuman effort to him, as he began to slowly make his way to the front door.
明日香轻声自笑，脑海中浮现出真嗣那迷糊的表情；对他而言，走直线仿佛是超乎常人的挑战，他开始步履蹒跚地向门口挪去。

"I'm gonna go to the corner shop." He half said, half stated, but whispered all along, as if saying it in a bigger volume would break the spell he was in. "I need to buy groceries anyway."
我打算去街角的小店。"他半说半陈述，声音始终压得很低，似乎大声一点就会打破他所处的魔咒。"反正我也得买点食品杂货。

"A'ight." Asuka said absentmindedly, still enjoying Shinji's last popsicle before she turned around, letting a startled cry. "Oh Shinji!"
行吧。" 明日香漫不经心地应了一声，还在吃着真嗣的最后一根冰棍，突然她转过身，惊呼道："哎呀，真嗣！

Shinji looked up, frowning when he caught sight of Asuka's smirk.
真嗣抬头，看到明日香那得意的笑容，不禁皱起了眉头。

"Could you bring me some chips and a tea? You know the kind I want."
能帮我拿些薯片和一杯茶吗？你知道我喜欢的那种。

Shinji's frown held for a second, before he saw Asuka's eyes were tingling, and her tongue was sneaking out to lick her lips, making the boy blush deeply as he looked away quickly, nodding before he walked out.
真嗣的眉头紧锁了一瞬，紧接着他察觉到明日香的眼中闪烁着泪光，她的小舌轻巧地舔过唇瓣，这一幕让男孩的脸颊瞬间染上了红晕，他匆忙别开目光，点了点头便匆匆离去。

And as she heard the door close with a soft 'whoosh', Asuka turned as the TV erupted in a fit of studio laughter, smiling.
听到门轻轻“呼”地一声关上，明日香转过身，电视里传来录音棚的阵阵笑声，她不禁微笑起来。

Just as the sound of a rustling bag being opened and a bottle cap being twisted and opened made her open her eyes and look up to her side, as Shinji walked next to her and silently placed a bag of chips and a bottle of tea next to her, and sat next to the redhead's body, staring out the at the bluish-indigo colored sky.
就在塑料袋沙沙声和瓶盖旋开的声音让她睁眼抬头望向身旁之际，真嗣悄然走到她身边，放下一袋薯片和一瓶茶，随后坐在红发女孩身旁，凝视着那片蓝紫色调的天空。

Asuka smiled as she noticed the proffered offerings were just the brand she liked.
明日香露出微笑，因为她发现递过来的东西正是她钟爱的品牌。

"Hey…" Shinji began in a small, unsure way as Asuka simply got up and picked up the bag of chips, eating them slowly before taking a gulp from the tea bottle.
"嘿…" 真嗣开口时声音微弱，带着些许不确定，而明日香则站起身，拿起那袋薯片，慢条斯理地吃着，随后又从茶瓶中大口饮茶。

"How angry is Misato?" Asuka asked after a long stretch of silence, looking down and letting her hair coat her face, before Shinji sighed and looked up, shrugging.
"美里到底有多生气？" 经过一段漫长的沉默，明日香开口问道，她垂下头，任由发丝遮掩面容，而真嗣则叹息一声，抬头耸肩，显得有些无奈。

"Not that angry. I think she actually expected you to be angry this time of the year, what with everything that has happened…" Shinji said softly, quietly, gently; sounding like a soft gust of wind blowing against a hill, like time trying to soothe, like sounds trying to heal. "You should tell her you're sorry anyway…"
并没有太生气。她可能已经预料到你在这时候会发火，毕竟最近发生了这么多事……" 碇真嗣轻柔地说着，声音宛如轻抚山岗的微风，仿佛时间在抚慰，声音在治愈。"你还是应该向她道个歉……

Asuka's wry smile was all the confirmation Shinji needed that was as far away from the redhead's mind as anything, before she ate another chip, this one more noisily, almost as if the way she ate the snacks was a barometer to how she was feeling; the louder she munched, the more upbeat she felt.
明日香那抹苦笑，让真嗣立刻明白，这根本不是红发少女所考虑的。接着，她又吃了一片薯片，这次吃得更加响亮，似乎她吃零食的声音大小，正是她心情好坏的晴雨表；咀嚼声越大，她的心情就越欢快。

"Yeah well… it'll be a cold day in hell when I say I'm sorry." Asuka said boastfully, while Shinji simply sighed and got up, picking up the brown paper bag and taking it with him.
"哼，除非地狱结冰，否则我才不会道歉呢。" 明日香得意洋洋地说道，而真嗣只是叹了口气，起身拿起那个棕色纸袋便离开了。

"Hey wait! Where are you going?"
嘿，等一下！你要去哪儿？

"Home…" Shinji said simply, without turning around before Asuka finished her chips and got up with a jump, running after Shinji, instantly catching up to him and grabbing the bag he held dearly and close to his chest.
"家…" 真嗣简单地说着，并未回头。此时，明日香刚好吃完薯片，她一跃而起，迅速追上真嗣，一把抓住了他紧抱在胸前的袋子。

"What'cha carrying there?"
你拿着什么呀？

Shinji paled visibly as he heard Asuka's soft question, teasing him as she looked over his shoulder, making the boy hug the bag closer to his chest as he tried to get away.
听到明日香轻声的戏谑提问，真嗣脸色顿时苍白，她从他肩后探头，逗弄着他，让男孩不由自主地将怀中的书包抱得更紧，试图抽身离去。

"N-Nothing! I just got something for myself!" Shinji said as Asuka's hands seemed to encircle his frame, grabbing a hold of his own hands clutching the paper bag while slowly pressing her body against Shinji's own, a small, playful smile stretching on her lips.
"没什么！就买了点自己的东西！" 真嗣说着，明日香的手悄然环抱住他，握住了他紧抓纸袋的手，身体也渐渐贴近，脸上挂着一抹俏皮的笑容。

"C'mon… you can tell me…" Asuka said gently, softly, while Shinji sighed knowing full well the battle had been lost the minute Asuka had decided to focus her attention on him, before he let her open the bag greedily, staring into it and extracting a frozen popsicle, the kind he liked, the flavor he loved…
"说吧…你告诉我吧…" 明日香轻声细语地说，而真嗣叹息着，他知道一旦明日香将注意力转向他，自己就已无胜算。他只好任由她急切地打开袋子，目光紧盯着，从中抽出一根冰棍，正是他钟爱的那种口味…

The type she and Shinji had enjoyed back then.
她和真嗣当时喜欢的那种类型。

Time stretched for a moment, and the silence made it something visible and palpable, before Shinji began in a soft whisper, repeating the words Misato had told him before she had smiled at him, encouraging the boy to go after Asuka.
时间似乎凝固了一瞬，寂静让这感觉变得清晰可触。接着，真嗣轻声细语地重复起米莎托在他微笑鼓励他去追明日香之前对他说的话。

"Hey, did you know…" Shinji began in a small, unsure voice, making Asuka look up from the bag into his blue eyes, noticing the way he was blushing and looking away.
"嘿，你知道吗…" 真嗣用微弱而不确定的声音开口，明日香从包上抬起头，对上他那双蓝眼睛，发现他脸颊泛红，目光躲闪。

"What?" The redhead said softly, unconsciously mirroring Shinji's tone of voice, taking a small, dainty step closer to him without her knowing while Shinji did the same, standing in front of her, and fidgeting, trembling ever so slightly as he spoke again.
"什么？"红发女孩轻声回应，无意中模仿了真嗣的语气，不知不觉间向他靠近了一小步，而真嗣也同步地站在她面前，显得有些紧张，声音微颤地再次说话。

"Make a wish." 许个愿望吧。

"Huh? Wh-why?" Asuka's asked loudly, as she looked at Shinji with questioning eyes and his lips mirrored the same uncertainty that was showed in his eyes, before the boy smiled at her with his usual smile; shy and small, like a puppy unsure of its surroundings while still trying to play.
"啊？什么？为什么？" 明日香大声问道，她用质疑的眼神盯着真嗣，他的嘴唇也透露出与眼神相同的不确定。随后，男孩对她露出了他那惯常的羞涩微笑，微小而怯生，就像一只对周围环境不太确定却仍在尝试玩耍的小狗。

"Close your eyes." Shinji said as he grabbed the popsicle, catching a little bit of the icicles in the wrapper and smearing the frozen water on Asuka's nose. "Imagine this is a snowflake falling on your face…"
闭上眼睛。" 真嗣边说边抓起冰棍，不慎触碰到包装纸上的冰凌，将冰凉的水珠涂在了明日香的鼻尖上。"想象一下，这是飘落在你脸上的雪花……

And Shinji's voice made Asuka start hearing Misato's voice as he told her their purple-haired guardian's favorite Christmas story, the same she had told Asuka so long ago when they had been in Germany.
真嗣的声音让明日香仿佛听到了美里小姐的声音，他向她讲述了那位紫发监护人钟爱的圣诞故事，这故事美里多年前在德国时也曾向她讲述过。

"Feel as they melt away when touching your cheeks… smell the snow, hear it crunching under your soles…"
感受它们轻触脸颊时的融化...嗅到雪的芬芳，聆听它在你脚下嘎吱的声响...

"If you close your eyes and make a wish during the first snow of Christmas Eve, and the snow keeps falling…"
在圣诞夜初雪之际，若你闭目许愿，雪花依旧飘落……

"Your wish will come true." Asuka finished Shinji's sentence, before she opened her eyes, smiling at him while Shinji smiled back, as both turned up to look at the twinkling stars up above them, and the wind rustled and flowed, sounding like the childish laughter of a million happy children, making the silent night seem all the more serene and peaceful, before Shinji turned to Asuka, looking at her happy, smiling face and quickly looking away as he tried to fight the sudden warmth spreading through his cheeks and nose.
"你的愿望定会成真。" 明日香接过真嗣的话，睁开眼，对他微笑，真嗣也报以微笑，两人一同仰望繁星点点。风声呼啸，犹如无数孩童的欢笑声，使得静谧的夜晚更显安宁。真嗣转头看向明日香，见她满面笑容，幸福洋溢，随即又匆匆别开目光，努力抑制住脸颊上突如其来的温热。

"So what did you wish for?" The brown haired boy asked finally, bringing Asuka out of her reverie, making the redhead look at Shinji, before she quickly shrugged, but now her face was sporting a small smile as she leaned quickly over and kissed Shinji's cheek.
"那你到底许了什么愿呢？"棕发男孩终于开口，打断了明日香的沉思。她转头看向真嗣，随即轻快地耸了耸肩，脸上浮现出一抹微笑，紧接着她倾身在真嗣的脸颊上轻轻一吻。

"If I tell you, the wish won't come true." She said with a ringing tone in her voice, making Shinji look at her with wide blue eyes, dark and shy against her own blue eyes; bright and merry, before they both stayed like that, in silence; comfortable… homely, the kind of silence only being comfortable with each other can achieve, the kind where not a word is needed to explain to the other how you feel, because they already knew.
"如果我告诉你，愿望就不会成真了。" 她语气中带着一种清脆的响亮，让真嗣睁大了那双深邃而羞涩的蓝色眼睛，与她自己明亮欢快的蓝色眼睛相映成趣。两人就这样静静地坐着，享受着只有彼此感到舒适时才能拥有的宁静，无需言语，彼此的心意已了然于心。

They simply knew. 他们就是知道。

And just like that, in silence, Asuka and Shinji got up after a while, and made their way back to Misato's apartment, and walked in, before the mauve-haired woman began once again with her smiles and teases, and Pen^2 began warking and waddling around, and Shinji and Asuka shared a small smile among themselves as they began to put up the rest of the Christmas decorations up.
就这样，在一片静默中，不久后，明日香和真嗣起身，一同返回美里的住所。一进门，那位紫发女子便又绽开笑容，开始逗趣，而 Pen^2 也汪汪叫着，摇摇摆摆地四处走动。真嗣和明日香相视而笑，着手继续布置剩下的圣诞装饰。

"Glub…glub…GLUB…YEEEE-HAWW! This is the way to start the morning!"
咕噜咕噜…咕噜咕噜…耶耶-哈！这样迎接清晨真是太爽了！

Shinji, Asuka and Pen^2 continued eating without bothering to look at the not-quite-buzzing-but-getting-there Misato as she finished downing her third beer in less than 30 minutes, before she proceeded to eat what was on her plate at an alarming rate.
真嗣、明日香和 Pen^2 继续埋头吃饭，对即将开始喧闹的葛城美里视而不见，她不到半小时就灌下了第三瓶啤酒，随后以惊人的速度扫光了盘中的食物。

"So, kids," Misato began in between mouthfuls, slurping noisily the noodles on her plate. "Vacation time, finally?"
那么，孩子们，" 三佐嘴里塞满面条，吸溜吸溜地吃着，"终于迎来假期了？

Asuka finished eating before replying. "Why? Do you have something else in mind besides hanging out here, getting beaten by me in the videogames?"
明日香吃完后才开口：“怎么了？你除了在这儿消磨时间，被我在游戏里虐，还有别的打算吗？”

Misato blinked, trying to come up with a retort before remembering last night Asuka had won with a 56-3 running and instead decided to change tactics.
美里眨了眨眼，本想反驳，却想起昨晚明日香以 56 比 3 大胜，便转而考虑改变策略。

"Actually, I was gonna propose that we head somewhere within the city; it's been too quiet and I know I need some relaxing. Shinji?"
其实，我原本打算提议我们在城里找个地方逛逛；这里太静了，我确实需要放松放松。真嗣，你觉得呢？

Shinji looked up from his plate, smiling a small smile. "I was planning on going to the arcades with Toji and Kensuke and just, hang out."
真嗣从餐盘中抬起头，嘴角勾起一抹浅笑。"我计划和东治、健介去游戏厅，随便玩玩。"

"Hang out?" Misato smiled at him the smile of a cat in front of a tasty plate of milk. "Is that how they are referring now to pick up cute girls?"
出去玩吗？" 葛城美里朝他微笑，那笑容宛如一只猫对着一盘诱人的牛奶。"现在都流行这样搭讪可爱女生了吗？

Shinji blushed, stammering to tell Misato it wasn't like that before the major switched sight to the next victim. "And what about you Asuka? Planning on trying to impress the boys?"
真嗣脸颊泛红，结巴着向美里解释并非如此，此时少校已将目光转向下一位受害者。"那么你呢，明日香？打算去吸引男孩子们的注意吗？"

"I'm not interested in boys Misato, and you know it."
Misato，你知道我对男孩没兴趣。

"Yeah, yeah… Kaji is the blah, blah, blah…" Misato weaved dismissively at Asuka as the redhead squeaked in a very unladylike fashion, a full blush coloring her face while Misato got up and pulled another beer form the refrigerator handing on to Pen^2 who warked demanding a drink before the bird extracted one for herself.
"对对，卡吉就是那一套说辞…" 米萨托不以为然地对明日香摆手，红发少女尖叫起来，举止全无淑女风范，脸颊涨得通红。米萨托起身又从冰箱里取出一瓶啤酒，递给 Pen^2，这只鸟儿嘎嘎叫着索要饮料，随后自己也取了一瓶。

"Anyway, I was thinking on hitting this new mall; it has tons of shops and it even has a hot bath on it." Misato smiled sweetly at the red head and at Shinji. "So, wanna come? It'll be fun~"
我正琢磨着去逛逛新开的那个商场，那里店铺众多，还设有温泉浴场。" 真嗣对红发女孩和真嗣露出甜美的微笑，"怎么样，要不要一起来？肯定很有趣~

"What? What about all those beer you just drank!? Why the heck would you willingly put me and the dummy here in peril like that!?" Asuka asked lividly, while Shinji blushed and kept looking down, before mumbling something about 'cleaning up', as the boy quickly picked up the plates and everything and made his way to the kitchen sink.
"什么？你刚喝的那些啤酒怎么算！？为什么要故意让我俩陷入危险！？" 明日香怒气冲冲地质问，而真嗣则脸红低头，嘟囔着要'收拾一下'，便迅速收拾起盘子等物，走向厨房水槽。

"What are you talking about? I'm not drunk." Misato said giggling as she ruffled Asuka's red mop of hair, making the girl growl under her breath before she slapped her guardians hands away.
"你在说什么呀？我可没醉。" 三乡笑着，伸手揉乱明日香那头红发，惹得女孩不满地低吼一声，随即拍掉了她的手。

"Of course you are! You just drank like 3 beers in record time!"
你当然醉了！刚才你可是以破纪录的速度喝了差不多 3 瓶啤酒呢！

"Oh! Pffft~! They're light… I need three to feel like I've drank a regular one." Misato said as she waved her hand derisively, giving Asuka a wide smile making the redhead roll her eyes just as Shinji did the same while he was scrubbing away at the plates.
"哎呀！噗~！这酒太淡了…得喝上三瓶才抵得上一瓶正常的。" 渚薰说着，不屑地挥了挥手，向明日香露出一个灿烂的笑容，红发少女见状也翻了个白眼，恰如正在洗盘子的真嗣。

"So? What do you say?" Misato said gently, making Shinji and Asuka look at each other; it wasn't very common for Misato to offer driving them, because it meant she had to drive and that clashed with her normal routine of drinking placidly in her apartment, but both Shinji and Asuka simply nodded before they all got ready, and got inside Misato's little blue car driving to this new place.
"那么？你怎么说？" 渚薰温柔地问道，使得真嗣和明日香互望一眼；渚薰很少主动提出开车送他们，因为这会打乱她通常在公寓里悠闲饮酒的习惯，但两人只是点了点头，随后大家准备妥当，一同坐进渚薰那辆小蓝车，驶向那个新地方。

Shinji and Asuka had dozed off during the ride, waking up when Misato shook their shoulders, smiling at them before they both blinked and frowned, looking at each other as they realized where they were, their faces quickly going from confusion to comprehension to a huge big grin and smile as they all but ran inside, dodging people right and left, before they finally arrived to the line delimiting the access site, even as familiar faces made their ways out to greet them.
真嗣和明日香在车上打盹，直到美里轻摇他们的肩膀，微笑着唤醒他们。两人醒来后先是眨眼皱眉，互相对视，随即恍然大悟，脸上迅速从迷茫转为明朗，绽放出灿烂的笑容，几乎是跑着进入，灵活地避开人群，最终抵达了入口界线，此时，熟悉的朋友们也纷纷出来迎接。

Shinji squealed happily before he ran full force to where Rei was, hugging her tightly, making the shy, quiet and soft spoken girl blush before her hands slowly gave Shinji back the hug he was giving her, even as Yui and Gendo descended on their son and Yui began to dot at him, while Gendo tried, and failed to keep a stern face, even as the corners of his lips would curve upwardly in a small smirk.
真嗣兴奋地尖叫一声，全力奔向绫波，紧紧拥抱她，让这位羞涩、寡言、声音柔和的女孩不禁脸红。她缓缓抬起手，回应了真嗣的拥抱。此时，由里和元渡也来到儿子身边，由里亲昵地亲吻他，而元渡虽努力维持严肃表情，却难掩嘴角上扬的微妙笑意。

"Mama!" 妈妈！

But Asuka was the one who screamed the loudest. As she ran to the legs of her mother, not even letting Kyoko let go of her bags as she small redhead girl hugged her tightly, a few tears already starting to form on her eyes, while Misato saw all this from a few meters behind, glad that the kids' family had been able to come back in time for Christmas.
然而，明日香是叫得最响的那个。她奔向母亲的腿边，不让京子放下手中的包，紧紧地抱住她，眼角已泛起泪光。美里站在几米外，目睹这一切，心中感到欣慰，庆幸孩子们的家人能及时回来共度圣诞。

Just as the purple haired sitter was about to walk towards the other adults who were still talking with their daughters and sons, her cell phone began to vibrate, making her pull it out and open it quickly, swiftly placing it against her ear, already knowing who it was.
紫发保姆正要走向那些还在和子女交谈的成人时，手机突然震动起来。她迅速掏出手机，熟练地接听，心中已猜到来电者。

"Hey Kaji, merry Christmas."
嘿，卡吉，圣诞节快乐。

"Hey 'Sato." Kaji said warmly in the other line. "Merry Christmas to you too… have the Ikari's and Mrs. Soryu arrived already?"
嘿，'Sato'。" 加治在电话那头亲切地说，"也祝你圣诞快乐……碇家和索龙夫人已经到了吗？

"Yeah." Misato said as Asuka began to talk quickly with her mom, the little redhead's hands waving around, gesticulating as she began to tell her mother, who was and older, more mature version of her 10 year old self, how well she had done at school, as well as every other small detail that had transpired while Kyoko had been away. Meanwhile Shinji kept holding onto Rei's hand, talking to his sister and his mom, both of which stared at him: Rei with a calm, and somewhat bemused face, while Yui's was warm and loving, the way a mother's should be.
"嗯。" 碇真嗣应声道，此时明日香正与母亲急切地交谈，小红发的手势随着话语起伏，生动地向母亲——一位比她 10 岁时更为成熟稳重的女性——讲述自己在学校的出色表现，以及母亲不在时发生的点点滴滴。与此同时，碇真嗣紧握着绫波丽的手，与妹妹和母亲交谈，两人都注视着他：绫波丽面容平静中带着些许好奇，而碇唯则满眼温柔与慈爱，尽显母性光辉。

"Well, I have everything ready for them here… you can come by when you want to."
我这边已经准备妥当，随时欢迎你过来。

And as Misato ended the call, all she could hear was the soft, choral voices of the background music in the airport, intermixing with the people who were here to greet their loved ones making the trip to Tokyo for Christmas Eve.
当碇真嗣挂断电话后，耳边萦绕的仅是机场背景音乐中那柔和的合唱声，与前来迎接亲友、共赴东京欢度平安夜的人群声交织在一起。

AN: another X-mas one; a couple of thanks go to SL4 and Maj for their assistance pre reading. This chapter is one of those that may be simple to me, but might be confusing to others, so... the ending of the story is Asuka and Shinji, who are 10 years old, going to receive their family (Yui and Gendo and Rei for Shinji, Kyoko for Asuka) at the airport; no over the top theatrics or waff, just two kids who were waiting for their parents to show up. The kiss comes from a small one page four-panel comic about Asuka taking Shinji's last lolipop from Haru Akebono, a.k.a. Monkey's Taste, translated by some loser over at .
AN：又是一篇圣诞节的作品；感谢 SL4 和 Maj 在预读时的协助。这一章对我来说可能很简单，但对其他人来说可能会感到困惑，所以……故事的结局是 10 岁的明日香和真嗣，他们将去机场迎接他们的家人（对于真嗣来说是唯和元渡以及零，对于明日香来说是京子）；没有夸张的戏剧性场面或废话，只是两个等待父母到来的孩子。这个吻来自一个一页四格的小漫画，内容是明日香从春·曙光，又名 Monkey's Taste 那里拿走了真嗣的最后一颗棒棒糖，由某个失败者在翻译。

Anyway, I hope this counts as a Christmas (or Kwanzaa, or Hanukkah, or whatever) present of sorts to some of you; hope you all liked and enjoyed it, and hope you're having a great time with your family. Season's greetings, and a happy new year.
不管怎样，希望这能成为给你们中一些人的圣诞（或宽扎节、光明节，或其他节日）礼物；愿你们都喜欢并享受它，与家人共度美好时光。祝节日愉快，新年快乐。

EB, out! EB，离开！

### Chapter 14 Themes: K#12 (In a good mood), W#01 (Chocolate)
主题：K#12（心情大好），W#01（巧克力）

Title: Honmei. 标题：挚爱。

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
作者按：我将在此声明免责：伊娃及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

"Explain to me again why are we doing this?"
能再解释一下我们为什么要这么做吗？

Hikari rolled her eyes, but her smile never left her lips; she had grown used to Asuka whining, using that overly nasal tone of voice she always liked using to convey annoyance and boredom in the only way the redhead could deliver it, but right now, Hikari knew that if she turned around, she would catch Asuka sporting a full body blush, making her cheeks seem all the more rosier and making a striking contrast against the German's normally peaches-and-cream-colored skin.
光翻了个白眼，但笑容依旧挂在唇边；她早已习惯了明日香的抱怨，那种她惯用的、带着鼻音的方式来表达不耐烦和无聊，但此刻，光知道如果她回头，定能看到明日香满脸绯红，使得她的双颊更加红润，与她平日里桃色的肌肤形成鲜明对比。

"Well… many women give chocolates to all their male friends out of obligation."
嗯…许多女性出于义务感，会给所有男性朋友赠送巧克力。

"That's retarded." Asuka shot back as she looked at several boxes of chocolates, squared and circled and shaped in the form of hearts with lace and tinsel, all of them in girly colors such as red and white and pink. "So what are we doing here?"
这太荒唐了。" 明日香反驳道，目光扫过几盒巧克力，有方形的、圆形的，还有心形的，点缀着蕾丝和闪光装饰，尽是红、白、粉这些少女色调。"我们来这儿到底干嘛？

"Well, as class representative it's my obligation to give out a chocolate to each and every male in our class; a boy's popularity is measured by how many chocolates they receive." Hikari said as she grabbed a small bag with assorted pieces of chocolate, checking the brand and the type before smiling and placing it with some other groceries she had picked.
"作为班长，我有责任给班里每位男生发一块巧克力；一个男生的受欢迎程度，就看他收到的巧克力多少了。" 光说着，从小袋中取出各式巧克力，仔细查看品牌和种类后，微笑着将其与其他采购的物品一并放置。

"So what's that about?" Asuka asked disdainfully as she turned to a group of older girls, probably High school seniors, judging by their uniforms as the three of them grabbed some boxes and chatted among themselves in soft, melodious tones while Hikari smiled at a giant Hershey's Kiss.
"那是什么意思？" 明日香带着轻蔑的语气问道，随即转向一群看起来像是高中生的年长女孩。她们三人正拿着盒子，用柔和悦耳的声音交谈着，而光则对着一个巨大的好时巧克力微笑。

"Well, the amount of chocolate received is a touchy issue for any boy, and even grown men." Hikari said while picking another bag, examining its contents critically and then putting it back. "And they'll only say how much chocolate they got after making sure the amount is never made public."
哎，收到的巧克力数量对任何男孩都是个敏感话题，成年男性也不例外。" 光说着，又拿起一个袋子，仔细审视里面的东西后放回。"他们只有在确保数量不会被公开时，才会透露自己究竟收到了多少巧克力。

"That sounds even lamer." Asuka grumbled crossing her arms and looking like a petulant child while Hikari let out a long suffered sigh and turned to the redhead, eyes narrowing as she looked at her friend, wondering how to go around and say it in a way the foreigner could understand.
"这听起来更没劲了。"飞鸟嘟囔着，双臂交叉，一脸孩子气的倔强，而光则无奈地叹了口气，转向红发女孩，目光锐利地审视着她的朋友，琢磨着如何用外国人能理解的方式表达。

"Look, when you went to school in Germany didn't anyone ever give you any candy or cards or something during Valentine's day?"
你在德国读书的时候，情人节那天没有人送你糖果、贺卡之类的礼物吗？

"Yeah, lots of times" Asuka answered after a moment of silence and looking away, not sure of why she had lied to Hikari about her schooling; having graduated from university at an early age, being called a child prodigy, a genius in her own right wasn't something Asuka would normally consider something to be ashamed of, or something to be kept a secret from her best friend.
"嗯，确实很多次。"飞鸟回答时，沉默了一会儿，目光移向别处，心中疑惑自己为何要向光隐瞒学业成就；年纪轻轻就大学毕业，被誉为神童、天才，这些本不是飞鸟会感到羞愧或需要对挚友保密的事。

And yet… 可是…

"Well, this is just the same! Imagine the face of the boy or girl who never got a Valentine's Day card, or candy! It's the same thing for boys and chocolate." Hikari said as she nodded to herself, a self-satisfied smile gracing her lips while the pigtailed girl nodded.
"哎，这情况如出一辙！设想一下，从未收到过情人节贺卡或糖果的男孩女孩，会是怎样的表情！男孩与巧克力的遭遇，亦是如此。" 光自得地点头微笑，而那位扎着马尾的女孩也跟着点头。

"Ok, so what about all these ingredients to make chocolate?" Asuka said as she picked up the chocolate and eggs and butter and milk, staring at Hikari whose face became a bright shade of red as she squeaked like a mouse getting caught by a predator, making Asuka give her friend a small smile growing incipient on her lips.
"那么，这些做巧克力的材料该怎么处理呢？" 明日香一边说，一边拿起巧克力、鸡蛋、黄油和牛奶，目光落在光身上，只见光的脸颊涨得通红，紧张得像被捕食者逮住的小鼠般发出细小的声音，这让明日香不禁对朋友露出了淡淡的微笑。

"W-well… I th-think that buying chocolate for Valentine's day is not enough; I like making it, you know… putting my heart and soul and prepare it by myself."
嗯…我觉得光买巧克力过情人节还不够；我更喜欢亲手制作，你知道的…倾注我的全部心血，亲手准备。

"Heart and soul huh?" Asuka repeated softly as she held another box, different, yet the same as the other, same color hue, same chocolate contents, same intention clearly etched on the whole package, before she turned to Hikari, a charming, mischievous smile playing on her lips, making Hikari's own smile slowly fade away, disappearing when Asuka spoke.
"心与灵魂，是吗？" 明日香轻声重复，手中捧着另一个盒子，虽与之前的相似却有微妙差异，同样的色彩，同样的巧克力，包装上明确传达着同样的意图。她转向光，嘴角挂着一抹既迷人又狡黠的微笑，让光的笑容渐渐褪去，直至明日香开口。

"So, are you gonna make it for a special someone?"
那么，你是要为某个特别的人做这件事吗？

"Huh?" Hikari said swiftly, turning to look at Asuka, noticing how the redhead bowed her head to the side, looking like a playful kitten about to pounce.
"嗯？" 光迅速反应，转头看向明日香，只见她红发轻垂，头微微侧向一边，宛如一只即将跃起嬉戏的小猫。

"Come on, Hikari, don't play coy." Asuka said as they both began to make a line to pay for the contents in the small basket, coming at the cashier, ringing their total while Hikari extracted her pocketbook from inside her own leather carrier, counting carefully and giving the exact amount to the older girl who had a very big, very wide, very bright but ultimately very fake smile on her lips, the kind of smile one puts on their face because they are paid to do so, ordered to do so, like an artificial flower, pretty and eye catching, but devoid of texture, and slippery and glassy to the touch.
"来吧，光，别装模作样了。" 明日香催促着，两人开始排队结账。光从自己的皮包里小心翼翼地取出钱包，仔细数好钱，将准确数额递给那位年长女孩。她脸上挂着夸张的笑容，宽阔而明亮，却明显是职业性的假笑，就像一朵人造花，虽美丽夺目，却毫无生气，触感滑腻而冰冷。

"I-I'm not! Honestly!" the class rep stammered while both girls exited the store, walking towards the alley and then following the small distance that separated them from Hikari's house, reaching the place quickly and stepping inside.
"我-我真的不是！" 班长结巴着辩解，两位女孩离开商店，走向小巷，沿着短短的路程迅速抵达光的家，随即步入屋内。

"So you're not planning on making chocolate for a certain idiot who you have set your eyes on?"
所以，你不打算为那个你心仪的傻瓜做巧克力了？

To say that Hikari blushed would be an understatement: the freckles on the pigtailed girl's cheeks were more prominently showed due to the contrasting color of her skin, now a bright red, lips quivering nervously, almost as if they she were about to cry.
说光脸红了都算轻描淡写：扎着双马尾的女孩，脸上的雀斑因肤色转为鲜亮的红色而更加突出，她的嘴唇紧张地颤抖，仿佛快要哭出来似的。

"Asuka! Knock it off!" Hikari half pleaded, half ordered her friend, making Asuka giggle before she nodded.
"Asuka！别闹了！" 光半是恳求半是命令地说，Asuka 听后咯咯笑了起来，随即点了点头。

"Ok, Ok! I won't tease you anymore."
行了，行了！我不再逗你了。

Hikari nodded while she took of her shoes and put on her slippers, putting the bags on the table as Asuka put on an extra pair of slippers herself while Hikari walked towards the kitchen, pulling out pans and pots to begin cooking.
光一边点头，一边脱掉鞋子换上拖鞋，顺手将袋子搁在桌上。明日香也给自己添了一双拖鞋，而光则径直走向厨房，拿出锅具准备开始做饭。

For a long time, none of them said a word, the silence feeling like a heavy curtain, creeping on them both while Hikari continued measuring and grinding the coca, pulverizing it into a fine dust before slowly she began to mix in the cocoa and milk and eggs slowly, humming softly to herself while Asuka simply watched from the table, fidgeting and biting down on her lip, as if she were pondering what to do or say before finally, the redhead spoke, making the pigtailed girl look up.
良久，两人都未发一言，沉默如厚重的帘幕般悄然降临。光仍在仔细地称量并研磨古柯叶，将其磨成细腻的粉末后，再慢慢掺入可可、牛奶和鸡蛋，口中轻柔地哼着小曲。明日香则坐在桌边，焦躁地咬着下唇，仿佛在斟酌着该如何行动或开口。终于，红发少女打破了沉默，使得扎着马尾的女孩抬起了头。

"Hey Hikari…" 嘿，光…

Hikari stared at Asuka for a long time without saying anything, the only sound coming from her actions as she continued to beat together everything into a mixing bowl, making Asuka look away, not really saying anything, or making any movement but Hikari knew this was the redhead's way of accepting it silently, causing the freckled girl to sigh and put the bowl down.
光默默地凝视着明日香，久久无言，唯有她不断将食材搅入碗中的声响，令明日香不由得移开视线，未发一语，亦未有动作，然而光明白这是红发少女无声的接纳，于是她轻叹一声，将碗搁置一旁。

"I uh… I need your help…"
我…我需要你的帮助…

"What happened?" 怎么了？

"Ready to go ho –"
准备出发啦 –

The words died in Shinji lips while Asuka rose from her chair after putting her books and pencil case inside her leather carrier before flinging it over her shoulder, flipping her hair in the process as she turned around, walking towards the door with slow, deliberate steps as she spoke.
真嗣的话还未出口，明日香已从椅子上起身，将书本和铅笔盒装进皮包，随手一甩搭在肩上，转身时秀发随之飘扬。她迈着从容的步伐走向门口，边走边开口。

"I'm going to be hanging out with Hikari for the afternoon."
下午我会和光一起出去逛逛。

Shinji's barely-there smile seemed to vanish, like someone blowing out smoke, wispy but tangible one second, only to slowly grow thin and disappear altogether in the blink of an eye.
真嗣那微弱的笑容仿佛烟消云散，一瞬间还依稀可见，转眼便渐渐淡去，最终在眨眼间无影无踪。

"Oh." The boy said as he frowned and continued packing his bag before walking after the redhead a few feet behind, already knowing that Asuka was in one of her moods and distance was a necessary precaution if he wanted to avoid incurring the wrath of the redhead.
"哦。"男孩皱眉说道，一边继续整理书包，一边跟在几步之遥的红发女孩身后，他清楚明日香又陷入了情绪中，保持距离是避免触怒她的必要之举。

"Yeah…" Asuka continued as she exited the room, followed by Shinji, walking down the rapidly deserting halls "So just… run along to Misato's and make sure she's not home when you start to go through her underwear drawer."
嗯…" 明日香说着，走出房间，真嗣紧随其后，两人穿行在逐渐冷清的走廊中，"你就赶紧去美里那儿，趁她不在时翻翻她的内衣抽屉。

This made Shinji yelp, shivering, trembling and blushing as he tried to recover from that mental picture.
这使真嗣忍不住叫了出来，他浑身颤抖，面颊绯红，努力从那幅心理画面中恢复过来。

"Ah! I'd… I me-mean I would never…" The boy stopped, taking a few deep, calming gulps of fresh air before he tried again, speaking in a soft, barely heard tone, his voice laced with a quiet dignity that only Shinji Ikari could muster.
"啊！我…我其实是想说，我绝不会…" 男孩顿了顿，深吸了几口清新的空气，努力让自己平静下来，随后再次开口，声音低沉而微弱，却透着只有碇真嗣才有的那份静谧的庄重。

"I would never try to steal Misato's underwear."
我绝不会去偷葛城小姐的内衣。

"Oh, so then you'd be going after mine?" Asuka said in a quick retaliation, turning around and leveling Shinji with an iridescent gaze from her bright blue eyes that made Shinji feel like, if this were one of those countless animated series Kensuke and Toji were so fond of, he was being reduced to cinder and ash on the spot.
"哦，这么说你是要追我了？" 明日香迅速反击，转身用她那明亮的蓝眼睛直视真嗣，眼中虹彩般的光芒让真嗣觉得，如果这是常和东治钟爱的那些动画片中的场景，他此刻恐怕已被化为灰烬。

"N-no! I mean, I would never go after your underwear!"
不，不！我指的是，我绝不会去碰你的内衣！

"Why's that!? Don't you think I'm not cute enough?"
怎么这样！？难道你不觉得我不够可爱吗？

"N-no!" Shinji squealed quickly, before the look in Asuka's eye made it obvious this was a very bad choice of answer, making the brown-haired, blue-eyed boy hurry to change it as quickly as possible. "I mean yes! You are cute!"
不，不！" 真嗣慌忙叫出声，但一瞥见明日香眼中的神色，他立刻明白这个回答大错特错，于是这位棕发蓝眼的少年急忙改口。"我是说，对！你很可爱！

"So you WOULD go after my underwear then!"
这么说，你真的会去追我的内衣啊！

Shinji stayed there, quiet, before finally realizing Asuka had been toying with him all along, but there had been a slight difference.
真嗣静静地留在原地，直到最后才明白，明日香一直在捉弄他，不过这其中有些许不同。

Today, Shinji hadn't been in the mood for the redhead's teasing games.
今天，真嗣对那位红发女孩的挑逗游戏毫无兴致。

Today, Shinji hadn't been in the mood for Asuka's constant bickering, the snap-crackle-and pop routine they both knew so well, both teens seemed to slide effortlessly into it, like a familiar scene being played, improvisation and chemistry taking them to familiar places that felt different at the same time; as if the whole world had been a stage for them and only them and the director that had put them together had taken all of the little nuances and things that made them themselves into account, making both teens perform the same roles over and over, something that, if truth be told, they both liked most of the time.
今日，真嗣对明日香无休止的争吵感到厌烦，两人都太熟悉这种噼里啪啦的日常了。他们仿佛自然而然地进入这种模式，如同重复上演的熟悉剧情，即兴与默契引领他们到达既熟悉又陌生的境地；仿佛世界只为他们搭建了舞台，只有他们和那位巧妙安排他们的导演，将他们的个性细节尽数考虑，让两个少年反复扮演相同角色，坦白说，他们多数时候对此乐此不疲。

But not this particular time.
但这次例外。

Asuka stopped, looking at Shinji's face, at how his hand seemed to close and open itself, as if he were squeezing an imaginary ball in his fist, before she sighed and shrugged, turning around, boredom quickly replacing the mischievous look in her face from before.
明日香停下脚步，凝视着真嗣的脸，注意到他的手似乎在不停地握紧又松开，好像在捏着一个看不见的球。她叹了口气，耸耸肩，转身离去，脸上的调皮神色很快被无聊所替代。

"God, you're such a kid sometimes Shinji, lighten up! No wonder you probably won't get any chocolate tomorrow."
真嗣，你有时候真像个孩子，放轻松点！难怪你明天可能收不到巧克力。

That was Asuka's typical attack; go straight for the jugular, spare no one. She had always had that deportment about herself; always the one to deliver the first, preemptive blow, or always the one to finish it with a second, quick placed one; but fighting with Asuka was always something that felt more like a snake biting at you, lightning fast, in a blink of an eye; she could go from happy, smiling cute foreign girl to angry, shrieking gaijin-banshee before anyone knew what had happened, which left Shinji, Misato and almost everyone who knew the redhead, but mostly Shinji and Misato, staring at the red-head's back, as Asuka swung her hips with each step she took when she was angry and strutting, hand in her hip and the other holding her leather briefcase still.
明日香的攻击向来直截了当，毫不手软。她总是这样，要么抢先出击，要么迅速补上致命一击；与她交手，仿佛被毒蛇突袭，速度之快令人措手不及。她能从笑容可掬的异国少女瞬间化作怒吼的外国女妖，让真嗣、美里以及所有认识这位红发少女的人，尤其是真嗣和美里，都只能望着她愤怒离去的背影，看着她每一步都带着怒气的扭动，一手叉腰，另一手紧握着皮质公文包。

Before something made Shinji speak up.
在某种因素促使真嗣发声之前。

"Why do you have to be such a bitch?"
你为何如此刻薄？

They were feet apart, but the words felt like they had been whispered against Asuka's ear, making the redhead stop dead in her track, turning around slowly as she looked at Shinji who held his head and eyes straight ahead, trembling a little, like a young tree, barely a twig with tender, fresh roots in the ground trying to brave an incoming storm, but firmly planted against the ground, before he managed to look at Asuka's face.
他们虽相隔咫尺，那些话语却似在明日香耳畔轻语，令她蓦然止步，缓缓回眸，凝视着真嗣。真嗣紧握着头，目光坚定向前，身躯微颤，犹如一株初生的树苗，虽是柔枝嫩根，却勇敢地迎向即将到来的风暴，稳稳扎根于大地，最终他鼓起勇气，与明日香四目相对。

It was like her normal face, maybe a bit surprised from Shinji calling her something harsh, something he had never said before, but what the boy couldn't deny was that her face was a beautiful face; cute at times, but it was what some people would call a 'classical beauty'; a mixture of both her eastern and western heritage on her: eyes slanted upward so very slightly, noticeable different from the way all of the other girls that Shinji knew had them, framed by long eyelashes and thin eyebrows that were perhaps a tad darker in color than her hair.
这就像她平时的面容，或许因为真嗣突然用严厉的称呼叫她而略显惊讶，这是他以前从未说过的。但男孩无法否认的是，她的面容非常美丽；有时显得可爱，但这就是有些人所说的“古典美”；她的东、西方血统在她身上交融：眼睛微微上扬，与真嗣认识的其他女孩明显不同，长长的睫毛和细眉，眉毛颜色或许比她的头发略深。

Shinji had to admit Asuka's penchant for calling herself "the cutest girl at school" was spot on, not only because of her hair color, which was an eclectic mixture of red and brown that at dusk seemed like a dark-red shade of brown, and in the early morning felt copperish-red, and sometimes, during the summer and when sun was just so, Shinji could almost swear it was a darker shade of strawberry blond.
真嗣不得不承认，明日香自称“学校里最可爱的女孩”确实有她的道理，她的发色是一种独特的红棕混合，黄昏时看起来像是深棕红色，清晨则泛着铜红光泽，夏日阳光正好时，真嗣几乎觉得那是更深的草莓金色。

It also had to do with the frame of her face, the small nose affix atop full pouty lips that were now pressed together so firmly, they seemed to almost disappear into a single line, the rest of the remarkable face framed by her slightly-pointy chin.
这同样关乎她的脸型，小巧的鼻子坐落在丰满的嘟唇之上，此刻双唇紧闭，几乎化作一条直线，而她那微尖的下巴则为这张非凡面容增添了轮廓。

But what a lot of students would accept readily was that the most striking of Asuka's traits were her eyes; almost almond shaped, and with bright, sea-blue irises that seemed to encompass the dueling nature of Asuka; turbulence and tranquility all in one spunky package that was now staring at her with something that seemed almost like sadness and surprise mixed together into one single feeling.
然而，许多学生很容易认同的是，明日香最引人注目的特点莫过于她的眼睛：近乎杏仁形状，拥有明亮的海蓝色虹膜，仿佛蕴含着明日香性格中的矛盾——既狂野又宁静。此刻，这双眼睛正带着一种交织着悲伤与惊讶的复杂情感凝视着她。

Before she turned with a huff and stomped away not even bothering to give Shinji a parting quip.
她气鼓鼓地转身，重重地跺着脚离开，连给真嗣留下一句临别嘲讽都嫌麻烦。

"Wait, so you just walked away?" Hikari asked as she poured some of the chocolate into the oven pan, carefully making sure it landed on the aluminum figure makers, shaped like starts and hearts and human-like figures while Asuka did the same on her own pan, having been convinced by the pig-tailed girl to help her instead of just moping around in her house.
"等等，你就这么走了？"光一边问，一边小心地将巧克力倒入烤盘，确保它们准确地落在铝制的星星、心形和人物形状的模具上。飞鸟也在自己的烤盘上做着同样的事情，她被这位马尾辫女孩说服，决定参与进来，而不是独自在家郁郁寡欢。

"Well, what else could I do?"
那我还能怎么办呢？

"Normally? You would have given him hell, either pushed him, or called him an idiot, or just… you know…" Hikari trailed off, focusing on the chocolate as it poured agonizingly slowly to fill one of the molds, sticking her tongue out as if that would help the thick, viscous liquid fall faster, while Asuka stood there, staring at her, before finally the redhead cleared her throat noisily, making the class representative look back at her.
"平时？你早该对他发火了，不是推他一下，就是骂他笨蛋，或者干脆……你懂的……" 光说着说着就停了，全神贯注地看着巧克力缓慢地填满模具，她伸出舌头，好像这样能让那黏稠的液体流得更快似的。而明日香则站在一旁，目不转睛地看着她，直到最后，这位红发少女故意大声清了清嗓子，让班代表不得不回头看向她。

"Or just… what?" 还是说…什么意思？

"Look, Asuka, I know you have your own way of being, and I respect you because of what you do; I can't possibly begin to imagine what your daily life is like, being a pilot and fighting those things and dealing with Nerv and school and all that but…"
听着，明日香，我明白你有自己的处世之道，我尊重你，因为你承担的一切；我实在难以想象你既要驾驶机甲与那些怪物战斗，又要应付 NERV 和学校等事务的日常生活，但是……

Again, Hikari trailed off, while her hands went to her apron, wiping them as if they had been filthy but Asuka knew this was her friend's way of dealing with her nervousness, this was the way her friend dealt with being in the spotlight.
又一次，光的声音渐渐减弱，她双手不自觉地伸向围裙，擦拭着，似乎手上沾了脏东西，但明日香明白，这是她朋友缓解紧张的习惯动作，是她面对众人注视时的自然反应。

"But..?" 可是..?

"But Shinji is the same… he's also a pilot and he deals with Nerv too, and he also goes to school." Hikari said slowly, solemnly before a small dinging sound, as plain and crisp as a glass breaking in a deserted room, reverberated in the room, loud and clear and there was nowhere to hide from it, making Hikari turn to the oven, opening the lid and extracting one of the pans with a kitchen glove, putting it on the table and picking one of the figures out and handing it to Asuka, who took it wordlessly and bit into it, munching with a slow, deliberate pace.
"但真嗣也是一样……他同样是驾驶员，也与 NERV 有交集，还照样去上学。" 日香缓缓地说，语气庄重。突然，一声清脆的叮当声响起，宛如空荡房间里玻璃碎裂的回音，响亮而清晰，无处遁形，让日香转向烤箱，打开盖子，戴上厨房手套取出烤盘，放在桌上，从中拿起一个小人形状的食物递给明日香，后者默默接过，缓慢而有节奏地咀嚼着。

"Don't you think you should cut him some slack?"
你不觉得应该对他宽容一些吗？

Asuka grumbled noncommittally as she continued to eat the confection, before she blinked, looking up at Hikari with her lips covered in some of the chocolate that had melted away.
明日香含糊地嘟囔着，一边继续享用甜点，忽然眨眼抬头望向光，唇边还残留着些许融化的巧克力。

"This is very good, Hikari!"
非常棒，光！

"I know, this isn't the first batch I've done, you know?" The pig-tailed girl beamed, proudly, realizing that Asuka was wordlessly asking her to let it go, and Hikari, being the dutiful friend that she was could do nothing but accept it, turning back once again to the counter top as she began to mix another batch of chocolate.
"我明白，这已经不是我第一次做这个了，你懂的。" 扎着马尾辫的女孩自豪地笑着，察觉到明日香是在无声地暗示她放手，而作为尽职的朋友，光只能接受，她再次转向柜台，开始搅拌另一批巧克力。

And in doing so, she missed Asuka's thoughtful expression as she took another nibble of the chocolate bar, eyes pensive, while her face kept a blank expression.
她这样做时，并未察觉到明日香那深思的神情，她再次轻咬巧克力棒，目光沉静，脸上却毫无表情。

The sky was already darkening when Asuka made her way back to the apartment, feeling herself, her body and her heart so heavy… as if someone had poured lead over her, encasing her body and asphyxiating her soul, before the small ding of the elevator made her look up, noticing in a daze that she had reached Misato's floor, stepping out and walking down the hall until she reached the door, entering her key code and stepping in from what felt like an oppressive heat into the relative coolness of the apartment itself.
天空渐暗，明日香带着沉重的心情和身体返回公寓，感觉自己仿佛被铅水浇灌，身体沉重，灵魂窒息。电梯的叮声让她回过神来，意识到已到达美里的楼层。她走出电梯，沿着走廊前行，直至门前，输入密码，从闷热的外界步入公寓的清凉之中。

Only to be greeted by the sight of Shinji caught in a headlock by Toji, whimpering softly as he repeated over and over the word 'help' while the jock mumbled something about how they were just playing professional wrestle.
映入眼帘的是真嗣被东治用头锁制住，他轻声呜咽，反复呼喊“救命”，而东治则含糊其辞，声称他们只是在进行职业摔跤的嬉戏。

Before Asuka simply glared at both boys, staring straight into Shinji's eyes as she stomped back into her room, talking aloud about how those two idiots were stinking up the place with their sweat.
阿苏卡先是狠狠地瞪了两个男孩一眼，然后直勾勾地盯着真嗣，一边跺脚回房，一边大声抱怨那两个蠢货满身汗臭，把地方都熏臭了。

Shinji sighed as he looked at the spot where Asuka had been just moments ago, something that did not go unnoticed by Toji; while his first reaction was to tease Shinji about staring for too long, a part of Toji actually felt like this was one of those rare moments Shinji had opened himself up, perhaps unaware or forgetting that he was there.
真嗣叹息着，凝视着明日香方才所在之处，这一举动并未逃过东治的注意。东治本想取笑真嗣盯着看太久，但内心深处却觉得这是真嗣难得流露真情的时刻，或许他自己都未察觉或忘记了东治的存在。

"Yo, Shinji…" Toji began lazily, in the relaxed way he spoke, a bit of his heritage slipping in, making his words come out casual, familiar, like someone who is so used to speaking with a good buddy, how they start cutting corners around the spelling and pronunciation, eating syllables, rushing words, speaking in a way that was like a secret code among friends.
"嘿，真嗣…" 东治懒洋洋地开口，语气轻松，不经意间带出些许家乡口音，让他的话语显得随意而亲切，仿佛在与好友闲聊，不拘小节，省略发音，语速加快，用一种朋友间特有的默契方式交流。

"Yeah?" 真的吗？

"What do you and the devil talk about when you're here at home?"
你在家时，和魔鬼都聊些什么呢？

Shinji turned to Toji from his place on the kitchen sink, already getting busy with cleaning up the small amount of plates he and Toji had left from their light lunch, before he turned back towards the water running down from the faucet, feeling as the warm liquid mixed itself with the viscous liquid soap, quickly diluting it, turning it into a slippery concoction that began to generate a lot of suds and bubbles.
真嗣在厨房水槽边转向东治，着手清理两人轻午餐后剩余的几个盘子。接着，他再次面对水龙头，感受着温水与液体洗洁精交融，迅速形成滑腻泡沫，泡沫不断增多。

"Nothing really." Shinji said softly as he continued washing the dishes. "Just normal stuff I guess."
没什么特别的。" 碇真嗣轻声说着，继续洗碗。"大概就是些日常琐事吧。

"Does she ask you about what you and Ayanami talk about at school?" Toji said with an impish grin while Shinji blinked, before he realized the loaded question, his mind registering very slowly what was happening before his eyes shot wide open, and his hands began to tremble making him almost drop the dish he had been washing before quickly recovering himself.
"她有没有问过你，你和绫波在学校聊些什么？" 东治带着一丝狡黠的笑意问道。真嗣先是眨了眨眼，随后才反应过来这个问题的微妙之处。他的思绪迟缓地捕捉着眼前的一幕，双眼猛地瞪大，双手不由自主地颤抖起来，差点让手中的盘子滑落，好在及时稳住了自己。

"Wh-what!? W-we… we never really t-why!?" Shinji began before cutting himself off.
"什么！？我们…我们从未真正明白…为什么！？" 真嗣刚开口，却又戛然而止。

There a pause that slowly grew into a beat, eventually germinating into a great expense of silence before Toji spoke again, only this time, the normally brash, loud young man used a small, soft tone, almost shy, almost as if it was Shinji the one talking.
一段停顿缓缓转化为节拍，继而延展成一片深沉的静默，直到东治再次发声。这次，平日里粗鲁喧哗的他，却用了一种细弱而柔和的声调，带着几分羞涩，宛如真嗣在说话一般。

"I… Hikari… she's been coming to my house…" Toji spoke quickly, his words coming out like rapid gunfire, running over each other, intersecting and confusing before he stopped, remembering how to breath, taking big gulps of air through his mouth as he looked away, shrugging his shoulders, trying to appear like it wasn't a big deal.
"我…光…她最近常来我家…" 东二急促地说着，话语如连珠炮般接连不断，相互交织，令人困惑，直到他停下，意识到需要呼吸，便张大嘴巴深吸几口气，目光移向别处，耸耸肩，试图显得这并非什么大事。

"We live nearby so she uh… she brings us food sometime, for me and sis… I mean, I'm sure her sister makes the class rep do it. It's not like Hikari would do it for me… she's been so full of herself ever since she became class rep…" Toji said in an angry tone before he looked down once more, whispering.
"我们住得近，所以她有时会带食物来给我们，给我和我妹妹……我猜是她妹妹让班长做的。光才不会为了我做这些……自从她当上班长后，就变得自大了……" 透二带着怒气说道，随后又低下头，轻声细语。

"Anyway, she's gonna be coming over tomorrow and I was wondering what we should talk about." Toji said sheepishly, as he scratched his cheek, back hunched and looking up with a slight tinge of red coloring his cheeks before Shinji blinked.
"反正她明天要来，我在琢磨咱们该聊点啥。" 东治略显局促地说，他挠着脸颊，驼着背，脸上泛起一抹红晕，抬头望向真嗣，而真嗣只是眨了眨眼。

"Hikari's coming over… to your place?"
光是要来你家吗？

"D-don't be an idiot!" Toji exclaimed as the red tinge became a full blown blush on his face, the outside of a tough delinquent student evaporating as if it were the morning mist, leaving behind a child not unlike Shinji, and something about the way he was denying everything loudly, looking like a chicken squawking loudly, hands flapping by his side as if the physical act of denial would give him more credibility.
"别犯傻了！"东治大声说道，脸上的红晕转为满脸通红，平日里不良学生的强硬外表仿佛晨雾般消散，露出一个与真嗣相似的稚嫩面孔。他大声否认着，样子活像一只咯咯叫的鸡，双手在身旁挥舞，似乎通过肢体动作能增加他的可信度。

"A-and don't say it like that!" Toji exclaimed before changing the way he was speaking, making the words come out as if they had been bitten and chewed and spit out. "I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!"
A-别那么说！" 东治急忙纠正自己的语气，话语中带着一种被咬碎、嚼烂后吐出的感觉。"我可没做任何错事！

Shinji slowly raised his hands in a placating manner while Toji took a few seconds to breath in and out, face red either out of anger or embarrassment, or maybe both before he crossed his feet and interlaced his fingers in his lap, staring down at his toes.
真嗣缓缓举起双手，试图安抚对方，此时东治深吸一口气，脸颊因愤怒或尴尬而涨红，或许两者皆有。他随后交叉双腿，双手交叠置于膝上，低头凝视着脚趾。

"Hikari… she told me she'd come over and cook some dinner, and since I can't cook as good as you…" Toji sighed. "I was thinking y'know? What could we ever talk about? What should I tell her? And I figured I'd ask you how you and Soryu do it… how are you able to talk to the other like you do."
光…她说要过来做饭，毕竟我做的饭不如你。" 透二叹息道。"我在琢磨，我们能聊些什么呢？我该跟她说些什么？于是我就想问问你，你和苏龙是怎么做到的…你们怎么能那样自如地交流。

"Wh-what do you mean?" 你指的是什么意思？

Toji scratched his chin, staring at the ceiling, looking like someone trying to reach a higher evolutionary stage before he looked down and shrugged with practices eased, twisting his neck while he did so, cracking the bones and muscles, feeling as the tension dissipated from his body with that small action.
透二挠着下巴，凝视天花板，仿佛在追求某种进化上的飞跃，而后他垂下目光，轻松地耸肩，扭动脖颈时传来骨骼与肌肉的脆响，随着这一动作，他感到身体的紧绷感随之消解。

"I mean, even when you two are fighting, it looks like you're both enjoying it." the tanned boy said before he shrugged once more, only this time it was a different shrug, one that seemed to hold in itself the complexity and perplexity that was the unique Ikari-Soryu dynamic.
"我是说，即便你们俩在争执，也像是在乐在其中。" 那皮肤晒得黝黑的男孩说完，又一次耸了耸肩，这次的动作却别有深意，仿佛承载着伊卡里与索吕之间那种独特而复杂的互动关系。

"I really envy you; I wish I had it like that with Hikari…"
我真是羡慕不已，真希望我和光之间也能如此美好……

Shinji stood there as Toji said those words, staring at his friend with a dumb look in his face, not sure of what to say or do, but feeling he should at least try something, even if he wasn't sure of what.
真嗣站在原地，听着东治的话语，脸上挂着茫然的表情，不知所措。尽管不确定该如何是好，他内心觉得总得做点什么，哪怕只是尝试。

"It's not…" 这不是……

So instead Shinji kept himself focused on the task at hand, rinsing and drying the dishes before he finally spoke in a small voice.
因此，真嗣专注于当前的任务，洗完并擦干盘子后，才轻声开口。

"If that's the way you see it, then you're wrong; my relationship with Asuka is…" Toji looked up, watching only the blinding white that was Shinji's shirt while the boy kept scrubbing and washing. "It's not what you think it is, Toji."
如果这就是你的看法，那你误会了；我和明日香的关系……" 东治抬头，目光落在真嗣那件白得刺眼的衬衫上，而真嗣仍在继续搓洗。"东治，实际情况并非你所想。

With a slow, deliberate movement, Shinji closed the water, and with an even slower move, he turned to his friend, looking down and to his right, almost as if he were ashamed of talking, of expressing himself.
真嗣缓缓地、小心翼翼地关上了水，接着以更加缓慢的动作转向朋友，低头望向右侧，仿佛因开口说话、表达自己而感到羞愧。

Almost as if he were embarrassed of having to admit this wasn't the typical relationship everyone expected them to have.
他似乎有些尴尬，不得不承认这并非大家所期待的那种典型关系。

Because… 由于…

"Most of the time, I really don't have a clue about what Asuka is thinking, or what I should say to her."
很多时候，我完全摸不透明日香的心思，也不知道该跟她说些什么好。

Toji opened his mouth, looking as if he was going to say something before he frowned and blinked.
透二张开口，仿佛要说些什么，却突然皱眉，眨了眨眼。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"I mean Asuka… she doesn't really talk to me." Shinji said softly. "Lately, even when she comes back from Nerv, she won't even talk to me."
我是说，明日香……她最近都不怎么理我了。" 碇真嗣轻声说道，"哪怕是从 NERV 回来，她也不愿和我多说一句话。

There was something in the way Shinji said that; a twinge of pain, a throbbing ache that was so visible and palpable that Toji could almost reach out and touch it; it radiated from Shinji's body, echoed in his voice, permeated every aspect of himself, his actions, the way he would look at his hands, the way his fingers would twitch as if they were trying to encapsulate themselves into a tight fist.
真嗣说话时带着一种难以言喻的痛楚，那跳动的痛感如此强烈，仿佛东治伸手就能触及；它从真嗣体内散发，声音中回荡，渗透进他的每一个动作，他凝视双手的眼神，以及手指不由自主的抽搐，仿佛在努力握紧拳头。

"Even if we're living together here with Misato, Asuka… she sometimes feel as if she's far away…" Shinji finished with a melancholic look in his face, mirroring the tone of his voice and his overall posture, before he added to himself in his mind.
"尽管与美里同住一个屋檐下，明日香……她偶尔会让人觉得遥不可及……" 碇真嗣带着忧郁的神情说完，他的声音和姿态都透露出这种情绪，随后他在心中暗自思忖。

It's almost as if we were separated by an AT field.
简直就像我们之间隔着一道 AT 力场似的。

Toji sighed, nodding at Shinji's last words, for some reason feeling the same way.
东治叹息着，对真嗣最后的话语点头表示认同，不知何故，他也有同样的感觉。

"Hikari's changed too." 光也发生了变化。

"Happy Valentine's day!" 情人节快乐！

Shinji gasped. 真嗣深吸了一口气。

Actually, he choked first, and would probably have passed out due to asphyxia if Toji hadn't been around, eating from the blue-eyed boy's own lunchbox, and after Shinji stopped coughing and hacking, and after he stopped seeing little white dots dancing inside his eyelids due to Toji's palm slamming on his back with more force than needed, Shinji remained with eyes and mouth wide open, before Toji summarized his feelings adequately by asking one simple question.
事实上，他一开始是被噎住了，若非东治在旁，从那位蓝眼少年的午餐盒中取食，他恐怕早已因窒息而昏厥。在真嗣停止了咳嗽与干呕，以及因东治用力过猛的拍背而眼前不再闪现白点之后，真嗣依旧瞪大双眼，张着嘴。此时，东治通过一个简单的问题，恰如其分地表达了真嗣的感受。

"Are you… are you serious?"
你…你真的吗？

To say Toji was surprised, would have been an understatement; he was staring at the small flat box that had been pushed against Shinji's hands, wrapped in red and with a red and white bow on top of it, while Kensuke simply kept staring with same look his friends had, even when his hand, holding onto his ever present camera had slowly slid down.
说冬二感到惊讶，那简直是轻描淡写；他目不转睛地看着那个被推到真嗣手中的小扁盒子，盒子用红纸包裹，顶上还系着红白相间的蝴蝶结，而剑介则保持着与朋友们相同的表情，就连他那只握着从不离身的相机的手也缓缓垂了下来。

"Well? Aren't you gonna say thank you!?"
怎么了？你难道不打算说声谢谢吗！？

Shinji blinked quickly, looking back at the girls in front of him; Hikari was staring at him as if he was the lowest life form in the planet, a thought Shinji entertained more often than not, before the pigtailed girl quickly turned her gaze to his other companions, eyebrows knitted together in frustration.
真嗣快速眨眼，回头望向面前的女孩们；日向正盯着他，眼神中流露出一种他常自嘲的低等生物的意味，随后那位扎着马尾的女孩迅速将视线转向他的其他同伴，眉头紧蹙，显得颇为不悦。

Asuka, on the other hand, kept the look of boredom in her face, arms locked behind her head and turning over to where the door back to the school building was, almost as if she was considering whether to stick around or leave, but there was something amiss, something off… something Shinji quite out his finger on before the boy turned to the last one.
另一方面，明日香脸上依旧带着无聊的神情，双臂枕在脑后，转身看向通往教学楼的门，似乎在犹豫是否该留下，但总感觉有些不对劲，有些异样……新治一时也说不上来，直到他转向最后一个人。

Rei wasn't with Asuka and Hikari, more like she had decided to walk down the same route and sit here, enjoying the warm breeze, the shade of a tree, and the light of the sun to read, and for some reason, she reminded Shinji of a cat; the type of animal that was quiet, mysterious, enigmatic, and that would always do whatever it wanted; dancing to its own little tune in its own little world; disconnected, always an outsider.
绫并非与明日香和光同行，她更像是选择了同一条路，独自坐下，沐浴在暖风、树荫与阳光中阅读。不知怎的，她让真嗣联想到了猫——那种静谧、神秘、难以捉摸的生灵，总是按照自己的意愿行事，在自己的小天地里自得其乐，与外界隔绝，始终是个旁观者。

Hikari and Toji had began bickering while all of this had taken place; Toji had made a rude comment about girls and chocolate, before Hikari had bonked him in the head, demanding him to apologize which made the tall, tanned boy reply with a more colorful remark, and for a brief moment, Shinji entertained the idea of both Toji and Hikari being elementary kids; the kind that have been good friends almost since coming out of the womb, like the kind of friendship Toji and Kensuke obviously had, but this one was more… perplexing.
在这期间，光和冬二开始拌嘴；冬二对女生和巧克力发表了不礼貌的言论，光随即敲了他的头，要求他道歉，这使得高大的黝黑少年以更加尖锐的话语回应。那一刻，真嗣脑海中闪过他们像小学生般争吵的画面——那种几乎从出生起就形影不离的友谊，就像冬二和健介之间显而易见的关系，但光和冬二之间的这种互动，却更显得复杂难解。

Because when they were at the arcade, or whenever Toji would drop by Misato's apartment to do a "study group", even though Shinji knew very well Toji was trying to catch a glimpse of Misato and nothing else.
每当他们在游戏厅，或是东治借“学习小组”之名造访美里小姐的公寓时，真嗣心知肚明，东治的真正目的不过是想偷看美里小姐一眼而已。

In Shinji's peripheral vision, he noticed Rei stand up, quietly, like a cat deciding to catch a better spot or patch of light, before walking in silence towards the main school building, leaving both girls and the three guys in the courtyard during lunch hour, before Asuka did the same thing, wordlessly walking after Rei inside the school while Hikari continued to berate Toji.
在真嗣的视线边缘，他察觉到绫波悄然起身，动作轻盈如同猫咪寻觅更佳的阳光角落，随后无声地朝主教学楼走去，留下庭院中吃午饭的两位女生和三名男生。紧接着，明日香也默不作声地跟随绫波进入校舍，而光则继续对东治进行训斥。

"You're supposed to say thank you when a girl gives you chocolate, you insensitive jerk!"
女孩给你巧克力时，你得说声谢谢，你这不懂感恩的家伙！

This made Shinji turn back as Toji and Hikari began to grumble and make faces at each other, while Kensuke laughed good naturedly, taking video of everything.
这使得真嗣转过头，只见东治和光开始互相嘀咕并做鬼脸，而健介则好脾气地笑着，把这一切都录了下来。

"Says who!? And it's not like I didn't say thanks anyway!" Toji exclaimed as he grabbed a hold of the box when he felt Hikari tugging at it.
"谁说的！？再说，我也不是没道谢啊！" 当东二感觉到光在拉扯箱子时，他一把抓住了箱子，大声说道。

"You haven't said thanks! That's the whole point!" Hikari said in a loud voice before she took the chocolate back, and a tug-of-war on the poor, abused box ensued.
"你还没道谢呢！这正是关键所在！"光大声强调，随即她夺回了巧克力，一场关于那可怜又饱受折磨的盒子的争夺战随即展开。

"Hey! This is mine! You can't take it away!"
嘿！这是我的东西！你不能拿走！

"Yes I can, Suzuhara! This chocolate is for people who appreciate it!"
没错，Suzuhara，我做得到！这款巧克力专为懂得欣赏它的人准备！

"Well let me take a bite outta it and I'll tell ya if it sucks or not!"
那我先尝一口，再告诉你味道如何！

Shinji and Kensuke both had a small smile as they saw their friend and the class rep's back and forth as if it were a tennis match, one side serving a volley, the other one answering with an overhead slam, before they both began to walk away towards the courtyard while behind them both the pigtailed girl and the tanned boy kept at it.
真嗣和健介面带微笑，目睹好友与班长之间的互动，宛如观赏一场网球对决，一方发球，另一方则以扣杀回击，随后两人一同走向庭院，而他们身后，那位扎着马尾的女孩和皮肤黝黑的男孩依旧争论不休。

"I think this qualifies as a screw-up mating ritual." Kensuke began with a chuckle while Shinji shrugged but smiled, glad at, for once, not being the focus of his friends jokes, especially when it had to do with anything romantic, because this would only lead to someone asking about…
"我觉得这简直是一场搞砸了的求偶表演。" 健介笑着开场，而真嗣虽然耸肩，却面带微笑，庆幸自己这次不是朋友玩笑的靶子，尤其是当话题涉及浪漫时，因为这往往会引来别人对……的追问。

"I do not understand; why would those actions constitute a mating ritual?"
我实在不懂，这些行为怎么就成了求偶仪式呢？

Both children froze as they hard the soft whisper that was Rei's voice, making Shinji look up at the normally stoic girl who was now standing in front of him, face still stoic, even though Shinji could make out a slight increase in her breath, and her lips were parted ever so slightly, and her eyes were just a little bit wider, and for some reason, her skin looked all the more colored around her cheeks and nose.
两个孩子听到绫波那轻柔的低语，顿时愣住了。真嗣抬头望向平日里总是面无表情的她，此刻她正站在他面前，面容依旧平静，然而真嗣注意到她呼吸略显急促，双唇微启，眼睛略微睁大，脸颊和鼻尖周围似乎泛起了淡淡的红晕。

Kensuke and Shinji turned to each other, almost unsure of what they were going to say, or how they were going to start explaining this concept to Rei, before the glasses wearing boy coughed into his hand, clearing his throat and lifted his glasses up the bridge of his nose with his index finger, making the sunlight bounce on them, and missing the way this made Shinji shudder against his will, while Rei simply tilted her head to the side, like a lost puppy.
健介和真嗣面面相觑，几乎不知从何说起，如何向绫波解释这个概念。这时，戴眼镜的男孩轻咳一声，清了清喉咙，用食指推了推鼻梁上的眼镜，阳光在镜片上闪烁，他未察觉这举动让真嗣不由自主地打了个寒颤，而绫波则像迷路的小狗一样，歪着头好奇地看着。

"This is all yours, Ikari." Kensuke said before turning around and exiting the school, walking towards the gym at a pace that was a cross between power walking and a full out sprint.
"碇，这都是你的了。" 健介说完，转身离开学校，步伐介于快步走与全力冲刺之间，径直朝体育馆走去。

Thankfully, Just as Rei was about to say something, the school bell rang.
就在零正要开口之际，幸好学校的铃声及时响起。

"Soryu seemed upset." Soryu 看起来有些不高兴。

Shinji let out a small breath of air but simply nodded, resting against the mop as he and Rei finished cleaning up the room.
碇真嗣轻呼一口气，点头示意，倚着拖把与绫波一同完成了房间的打扫。

"I am not fluent in German, or English, but it seemed like she was asking you to put away the chocolates you received in your body, though she never mentioned consumption."
我德语和英语都不太流利，但听起来她好像是让你把收到的巧克力藏进身体里，虽然她并未明说需要食用。

"I know." Shinji responded as he wringed the mop and looked at the classroom, surveying the area to make sure nothing was left amiss.
"我知道了。" 碇真嗣一边回答，一边拧干拖把，仔细巡视教室，确保一切妥当。

"She did mention she hoped you 'choked on the truffles' Aizawa gave you."
她确实说过，希望你'被相泽送的松露噎着'。

"Yeah, but I'm… I don't think I wanna taste them." Shinji said as he looked at the boxes in his desk from various girls both form this room and several others; most of the chocolates were small and inexpensive, even if they were decorated in tin and foil and papier-mâché.
"嗯，但我...我觉得我不想尝这些。" 真嗣边说边看着桌上的巧克力盒，它们来自本房间和其他几个房间的女孩们；尽管用锡纸、箔纸和纸浆装饰得很精致，但大多数巧克力体积小且价格低廉。

"Do you not like chocolate?" Rei asked as she twisted the washcloth in her hand several times before standing up as both she and Shinji walked outside the room to the water drain just around the corner to dump the dirty water there.
"你不喜欢巧克力吗？" 绫波边问边拧着手中的抹布，随后起身与真嗣一起走出房间，到拐角处的水槽倒掉脏水。

"It's not that I don't like it, it's just that I don't see what the big deal is." Shinji saod, even if he felt a bit hypocritical about it.
"并非我不喜欢，只是我不太理解这有什么值得大惊小怪的。" 真嗣说道，内心却有些自相矛盾。

"Chocolate is used as a gauge to see how very well liked you are by your school mates." Rei rationalized coldly. "The fact you got such an amount means you aren't disliked."
巧克力成了衡量你在同学中人气的标尺。" Rei 冷静地推理，"你收到这么多，足以证明你并不惹人厌。

"Yeah, but still, I mean… Misato gave me a chocolate bar today in the morning, and when Kaji and Ritsuko came to pick her up and drive her to Nerv, even Ritsuko left some chocolate for us." Shinji said as both teens grabbed their book bags and walked towards the stairs, down the floor and towards the hall, stopping to put away their in-school slippers and put back their regular shoes on.
"嗯，不过，我的意思是……今天早上，美里给了我一块巧克力。后来，加持和律子来接她去 NERV，连律子也给我们留了些巧克力。" 碇真嗣边说边和同伴拿起书包，走向楼梯，下楼来到走廊，停下脚步换上日常鞋，收好室内拖鞋。

"She mentioned she was doing so because she was trying to understand the correlation of chocolate and synch ratio increase, but all the while Kaji and Misato were snickering behind her back." Shinji continued while Rei stood up and began walking, prompting Shinji to follow her, talking to her back.
"她提到这么做是为了探究巧克力和同步率提升之间的联系，然而加持和美里却在她背后偷笑。" 碇真嗣边说边跟着站起身来走动的绫波丽，对着她的背影继续交谈。

"Dr. Akagi did give me a small chocolate yesterday after my synch testing." Rei added with a small voice. "It was… different."
阿加吉博士确实在昨天的同步测试后给了我一小块巧克力。" 绫小声补充道，"那感觉……挺特别的。

"Yeah, but what I mean is… what is the big deal about chocolate? Why do boys always get so worked up over this day?" The boy asked as both him and Rei entered the train station and waited patiently for Rei's train, due in 3 minutes, according to the overhead clock.
"是啊，我就是想知道，巧克力到底有什么特别的？为什么男孩们一到这天就特别兴奋？" 男孩边说边和 Rei 一起走进火车站，静静地等待着 Rei 的火车，头顶的时钟显示还有 3 分钟就到站了。

"Chocolate does have a certain chemical reaction in the human brain, similar to euphoria, and caffeine is considered an addictive substance; perhaps they are simply craving the chocolate because they are addicted to it."
巧克力在人脑中确实会引起一种类似欣快感的化学反应，咖啡因则被视为一种成瘾物质；他们可能仅仅是因为对巧克力产生了依赖而渴望它。

It was Shinji's turn to look down and shrug, staying quiet since there wasn't anything he could say, before Rei continued.
轮到真嗣低头耸肩，沉默不语，因为实在无话可说，接着绫波继续说道。

"I read that chocolate is considered to be linked to this date because candy manufacturers have invested a sizable part of their budget into the marketing scheme; however there is another theory, even though I do not understand it." Rei said in that same tone of voice, before she turned to Shinji, staring at him with her blood-red eyes.
"我了解到巧克力与这个日期挂钩，是因为糖果厂商在营销上投入了大量资金；不过，还存在另一种理论，虽然我不太明白。" Rei 依旧用那不变的语气说着，随即转向 Shinji，用她那双血红的眼睛紧紧盯着他。

"Love and chocolate have been linked because they both are something that can be both sweet and enjoyable."
爱情和巧克力之所以常被相提并论，是因为它们都兼具甜蜜与愉悦的特质。

Shinji waited for a moment for Rei to say something more, but the girl remained quiet.
碇真嗣稍等片刻，期待绫波继续开口，然而女孩依旧默不作声。

"So what don't you get?"
你到底哪里不明白？

Rei blinked before turning her head to gaze at Shinji, just as the train rolled into the station, before the girl turned to look at the doors, hearing in the distance the announcements before the blue-haired girl finally spoke.
绫波丽眨了眨眼，随即转头望向真嗣，此时列车正缓缓进站。她接着又看向车门，远处广播声依稀传来，最后那位蓝发少女终于开口说话。

"I do not understand how love can be like chocolate."
我无法理解爱情怎么可能像巧克力那样。

Before Shinji could register what all this meant, the train rolled out of the station, the sound of metal against metal making everything else inaudible, and just like that, Shinji found himself alone in the station, before he sighed and made his way to the other side of the tracks, waiting for his train to come.
在碇真嗣反应过来之前，火车已驶离站台，金属摩擦的轰鸣声淹没了一切，他就这样孤零零地留在站内。叹息一声后，碇真嗣穿过轨道，静候下一班列车的到来。

The sun was setting down when Shinji finally arrived to the station, feeling angry at himself for sleeping on the train, which meant a 20 minute train ride had turned into a 1 hour and 20 minutes one; he was hungry, he was thirsty, and he remembered that there was nothing in the pantry left to eat.
真嗣到达车站时，夕阳正缓缓下沉。他因在火车上打盹而自责，原本 20 分钟的行程因此延长至 1 小时 20 分钟。此刻，他饥肠辘辘，口干舌燥，又想起家中橱柜已空无一物。

It had been Misato's turn to buy the groceries again, an even though Shinji knew better and he normally would do it himself instead of bothering Misato about it, the boy had been so worried about school and Nerv he had completely forgotten about it, so that was how he found himself right now standing outside the convenience-mart down the street, patting himself down before taking out his wallet, checking how much money he had left to make sure he had enough to buy the list that was already forming in his mind.
这次轮到葛城去买菜，真嗣本该自己去而不打扰她，但因忙于学校和 NERV 的事务，他竟忘了这茬。结果，他此刻站在街角的便利店外，掏出钱包查看余额，确保有足够的钱来购买脑海中已规划好的购物清单。

"What are you doing here?"
你在這兒幹嘛呢？

Shinji looked up, coming face to face with Asuka who was holding a green twill bag with the logo of the place printed on it, standing outside the store
真嗣抬头，正巧与站在店外、手提印有店铺标志的绿色斜纹布袋的明日香四目相对

"I uh… I came to buy the groc-"
我…我是来买杂货的-

"I already got that taken care of." Asuka said as she lifted the basket that was half way filled with instant meals, bottled waters and assorted drinks, as well as fruits and vegetables packets of sardines and showing it to Shinji who looked form the basket to Asuka and back again before the redhead frowned.
"这事我已经搞定了。" 明日香边说边提起装着半篮子即食餐、瓶装水、各式饮品，以及水果、蔬菜和沙丁鱼包的篮子，向真嗣展示。真嗣目光在篮子和明日香之间来回移动，随后红发少女微微皱眉。

"What!? Don't look so surprised! I may not look like, but I actually can do this sort of stuff."
什么！？别这么惊讶！别看我这样，其实我真能做这种事。

"N-No, it's not that." Shinji said quickly, stuttering as Asuka shook her head and rolled her eyes before she walked past Shinji, pressing one of the bags onto him without saying anything more, as both children walked in silence towards their apartment.
"不，不是那样。" 真嗣连忙解释，有些口吃，而明日香则摇头翻了个白眼，径直从他身边走过，默默地将一个袋子塞到他手里，两人便沉默地一同走向公寓。

Shinji sighed, and it seemed like it was something he was used to doing for so long, like it had taken a space reserved for actual words or actions; if something happened, he would sigh, it was like a preamble for any kind of activity that was about to be undertaken by him, be it cooking or cleaning, or walking to school or Nerv or the apartment or simply walking with his friends while they would tease and pick on him.
真嗣叹了口气，这动作他似乎早已习以为常，仿佛它占据了一个本该属于实际言语或行动的位置；每当有事发生，他总是先叹气，这成了他即将进行的任何活动的序幕，无论是做饭、打扫，还是步行去学校、NERV 或公寓，甚至是在与朋友同行时，他们取笑他。

But in this case, it had to do with the redhead walking two steps ahead of him.
然而，这次情况特殊，与他前方两步之遥的那位红发女子息息相关。

Shinji looked like he was ready to do... something, but the problem was he himself wasn't sure of what, and looked torn between leaving the redhead, running to the apartment with an angry look on his face, grumbling under his breath after what Asuka had said to him at school, or talk to her, and make her feel just like he had felt then, trying to relieve the disbelieving look of hurt on her face.
真嗣似乎准备采取行动，但内心却一片迷茫，不知所措：是抛下那位红发少女，怒气冲冲地跑回公寓，一边低声咒骂学校里明日香对他的嘲讽，还是上前与她沟通，让她也尝尝自己当时的滋味，努力抚平她脸上那错愕而痛苦的表情。

The problem was that Shinji was one of those who never had the perfect comeback.
问题在于，真嗣总是那种临场反应不够机敏，说不出完美回击的人。

Until today. 至今。

But for some reason, Shinji felt like he had become the worst version of himself; that he had opened his own personal Pandora's Box full of all the secret hateful parts he never knew he had: arrogance, spite, condescension, letting them vault out and into the open with just that one small phrase, all those feelings summed up nicely in just one little word that kept repeating and replaying themselves over and over in his mind, because normally, when anyone would provoke him, Shinji would simply look down and utter an apology before walking away.
不知何故，真嗣感到自己变成了最不堪的模样；他似乎开启了自己的潘多拉魔盒，释放出那些未曾察觉的阴暗面：傲慢、怨恨、轻视，这些情绪因一句简单的话而喷涌而出，暴露在光天化日之下。所有这些感受都浓缩在一个反复在脑海中回响的词汇里，因为通常面对挑衅，真嗣只会低头道歉，随即离去。

Because, normally, when Shinji found himself in such a situation he would get tongue-tied, and his mind would go blank, and hours after all of this had happened, he would spend all night tossing and turning trying to think of what he should have said, finding himself thinking about it as he did the house chores assigned to him, while he cooked, or while he cleaned, or did the laundry, or basically did anything trying to make his mind not think about that.
通常情况下，真嗣若陷入此等境遇，往往会语塞，脑海一片空白。事后数小时，他整夜辗转难眠，反复思索本应出口之言。无论是做家务、烹饪、清扫还是洗衣，他都在竭力转移思绪，避免沉浸于那段回忆之中。

But right now, Shinji could see the truth behind that; Now that he had finally had the pleasure of saying the thing he meant to say at the moment he meant to say it… now all he could see was Asuka's hurt look in her eyes, and the way her mouth had been left open, in surprise, open and vulnerable and Shinji could only feel the numb feeling of remorse that inevitably followed as the trip back home was made in silence, and the ride in the elevator up to Misato's floor too… the small trip from the end of the hall down to Misato's apartment was made in the same, absolute suffocating silence that had been the only sound to be made by both teens ever since school
然而此刻，真嗣洞悉了背后的真相；既然他终于得以在恰当的时刻倾吐心声……如今，他眼中只剩下明日香眼中的伤痛，以及她因惊讶而微张的唇，显得如此无助。真嗣心中涌起的是随之而来的麻木悔意，归途中的沉默如影随形，电梯上升至美里所在楼层时亦是如此……从走廊尽头到美里公寓的短短路程，同样沉浸在这令人窒息的绝对寂静中，这是两个少年自学校以来唯一的交流

"Asuka…" 阿苏卡…

"Shut up." The redhead said quickly, swiftly cutting him off. "I know what you're gonna say, and don't."
别说了。"红发女子急忙插话，打断了他。"我知道你想说什么，别说了。

Both children continued walking in silence, crossing the street, entering the apartment building, walking up to the elevator and riding it up to their floor; all of this was made in silence; both teens entered the apartment, and Shinji went immediately to put away the groceries in their place, while Asuka put away the rest of the things she had bought.
两个孩子默默地继续前行，穿过街道，进入公寓楼，搭乘电梯直达他们的楼层；全程无言。进入公寓后，真嗣立刻去安置买来的食品，而明日香则整理她购买的其他物品。

"So…" Asuka began conversationally. "How much chocolate did you get?"
那么…" 明日香随口问道，"你拿到多少巧克力了？

"W-well, not much… I mean, Hikari gave me some, and so did some other girls from school…" Shinji began in a small tone, careful not to turn around to show Asuka his reddening cheeks. "And Misato surprised me with some chocolate too in the morn–"
嗯，其实没多少……我是说，光给了我一些，还有学校里其他几个女生也给了……" 真嗣小心翼翼地说着，生怕转过身让明日香看到他泛红的脸颊。"还有，早上美里也给了我一个巧克力惊喜——

"Yes, I was there, I saw Misato give you the chocolate and give Kaji some chocolate scented body wash… and I also saw Ritsuko-san give you some chocolate as well." Asuka began bored as she walked to the cupboard and extracted a small cup. "I just don't get what's the big deal about the whole chocolate thing."
没错，我当时在场，目睹了美里给你巧克力，还给了加持一些巧克力香味的沐浴露……另外，律子小姐也给了你巧克力。" 明日香说着，显得有些不耐烦，她走向橱柜，取出一个杯子。"我就是搞不懂，巧克力这东西有什么好大惊小怪的。

Shinji sighed before he answered.
真嗣叹了口气，才开口回答。

"People think that chocolate and love are alike because they're both sweet and enjoyable." The boy began, as he continued busying himself on putting away the things in the cupboard while Asuka opened the fridge to take out some things.
"人们常觉得巧克力和爱情有相似之处，因为两者都甜蜜而令人享受。" 男孩边说边继续整理橱柜里的东西，与此同时，飞鸟打开冰箱取出了几样食材。

"And you?" 那你呢？

"Huh? M-me?" 啊？我吗？

"You said 'people think'…" Asuka said as she shrugged her shoulders. "That means you don't believe in that."
你提到'人们认为'……" 明日香耸耸肩说道。"看来你并不认同这一点。

"I actually think love is like chocolate… it can be sweet, but there's some kind of chocolate that can also be bitter." Shinji said in the same distant tone of voice, as if he were talking through a tunnel or a paper tube, the words sounding alien in his mouth, before he took a big gulp of air and turned to Asuka.
"我真心觉得爱情犹如巧克力……它本应甜蜜，却也不乏苦涩之味。" 渚薰依旧保持着那遥远的语调，仿佛话语穿越了隧道或纸筒，显得有些异样，随后他深吸一口气，目光转向了明日香。

"If I told you that I liked you, would you take it as a joke?"
如果我说我喜欢你，你会不会觉得我在开玩笑？

Asuka turned to Shinji, giving him a surprised look; but Shinji wasn't aware, since his eyes were still glued to the floor, seeing as his toes curled and twitched, as if they were scratching one feet with the other, the socks he was wearing making small, soft scratching sounds as the cotton fabric rubbed against each other, a silent impasse reigning over them both, with only the sift humming of the refrigerator in the background, running smoothly while the soft sounds of crickets and cicadas drowned the warm summer night before Asuka finally spoke.
明日香转向真嗣，惊讶地注视着他；然而真嗣并未察觉，他的视线依旧紧盯着地板，只见他的脚趾蜷缩并微微颤动，仿佛在用一只脚轻挠另一只脚，他穿的袜子因棉质面料摩擦而发出细微柔和的声响。两人间弥漫着无声的静默，唯有冰箱在背景中平稳地嗡鸣，而蟋蟀与蝉的鸣叫声渐渐淹没了这温暖的夏夜，直到明日香终于打破沉默。

"Yeah, I guess I would."
嗯，我想我会的。

Shinji's shoulder slumped as he heard this answer, even if a small part of his brain had already braced itself for it, expecting nothing less from Asuka, knowing full well that there was no way, no chance and no remote possibility she would ever see him under a different light.
听到这个回答，真嗣的肩膀不由得垂了下来，虽然他内心的一角早已有所准备，料到明日香不会给出别的答案，他清楚地知道，她绝无可能用另一种眼光看待他。

Because Shinji knew that, as far as Asuka was concerned, he would always be Stupid Shinji, Idiot Shinji, meek little Shinji who was never able to show some spine or do anything right, silly little Shinji who would always try and never do, who would always cry and never fight back.
因为真嗣清楚，在明日香眼里，他永远是那个愚蠢的真嗣、笨拙的真嗣、怯懦的小真嗣，永远挺不起脊梁，做不好事情，总是徒劳尝试，只会哭泣而从不反抗的傻真嗣。

Stupid, idiot Shinji who was nothing more than a thorn at her side, an annoyance in her life, beneath her, below her, not even fitting to be called by his name, instead always being referred to as Idiot Shinji, or Stupid Third.
那个愚蠢至极、白痴一样的真嗣，不过是她身边的一根刺，生活中的累赘，地位远在她之下，连他的名字都不配被提及，总是被贬称为白痴真嗣，或是愚蠢的第三。

And yet… 可是…

Why?

Somehow… somehow the word formed in his mind, like a small tear in the fabric of one's shirt; a small little thread that one notices and is unable to stop from pulling at, taking it between thumb and forefinger, and making the fabric unravel with each subsequent pull.
不知何故，这个词在他心中悄然成形，宛如衬衫上的一道细微裂痕；那根微小的线头，一旦被察觉便让人欲罢不能，用拇指和食指轻轻捏住，每一次拉扯都让布料逐渐松散开来。

"Why?" 为什么呢？

The word was uttered softly, not even a whisper could be used to describe it, but for Shinji, it felt like he had screamed it, echoing loudly into his ears, like a cacophony of sounds mixing with the loud, accelerated beating of his heart, and the short, quick breaths of his nose, feeling like a white-hot spike being driven between his lobes, pushing them apart, making them bleed, making him scream inside in agony as tears began to swell and form like little pearls on his eyes, and his right arm ripple with involuntary movement, and his right hand twitched before Shinji forced his arm to remain put, pressing it against his side and making his fingers ball into a fist, still looking down, still breathing quickly, as his mouth drew back into an angry snarl, but his voice never climbed a single pitch.
那个词轻得几乎连耳语都算不上，但对真嗣而言，却仿佛在他耳边轰鸣，与急促的心跳和短促的呼吸交织成一片嘈杂。他感觉像有根炽热的尖刺刺入太阳穴，撕裂般的痛楚让他内心尖叫，泪水在眼角凝成珠状。他的右臂不由自主地颤抖，右手抽搐了一下，随后真嗣强迫手臂紧贴身体，手指紧握成拳，依旧低头，呼吸急促，嘴角因愤怒而扭曲，但他的声音始终未曾提高演讲提纲。

"Why?" 为什么呢？

Finally, Shinji looked up, staring at Asuka before his eyes, narrowed into slits opened themselves as big and wide as he could, before his snarl disappeared and was replaced by a small round 'O' forming in his lips, before his nose was immersed into the soft scent of strawberries and peaches, and before his eyes were flooded by the coppery-red hair, Bright-blue eyes and cream-colored skin of Asuka's face.
最终，真嗣抬头凝视着面前的明日香，他的双眼从微眯逐渐睁大，嘴角的怒容消散，转而双唇微张成一个小小的圆形，鼻尖随即沉浸在草莓与桃子的馥郁香气中，眼前则被明日香那铜红发丝、湛蓝眼眸和奶油般肌肤的面容所占据。

Before his lips felt a small, gentle pressure on themselves.
他的嘴唇感受到一股轻柔的压力。

Before he realized Asuka was kissing him.
他还没反应过来，明日香就已经吻上了他。

Before he heard her voice.
他听到她的声音之前。

"Because I know you don't like me." Asuka said softly, looking down and twisting her hands, holding a small box before her.
"因为我知道你对我没有好感。" 明日香轻声说着，目光低垂，双手不安地扭动着，面前放着一个小盒子。

It was wrapped in a dark pink color, but the creases on the paper, and the way the wrapping itself was done showed that whoever had done it hadn't been able to do a proper job with it, as if a kid with untalented fingers had tried to do it, only to find the paper had been cut shorter from one side, uneven and ripped and pasted hastily one over the other, and bits and pieces of the brown cardboard underneath showing as if they were patches of dry land against a shrub of grass.
它被深粉色纸张包裹着，但纸上的折痕和包裹手法透露出，包裹者并未能妥善完成这项工作，仿佛是一个手指笨拙的孩子所为。纸张一边被剪得过短，边缘参差不齐，匆忙间粘贴在一起，棕色硬纸板的碎片斑驳可见，宛如干涸土地上零星的草丛。

There was something endearing, Shinji realized, about the way Asuka held the box close to her chest, as if she were afraid it would break, fearing it would be alive and escape from her; that was what made Shinji stop, and gently, very gently reach forth, arms trembling as Asuka hugged the small, beaten box tighter against her, biting her lip, but trying to remain calm, trying hard not to leash out, not to push Shinji away, shouting and calling him a pervert like she always did.
真嗣察觉到，明日香紧抱盒子于胸前的样子有种说不出的可爱，仿佛担心它会碎裂，又怕它活过来逃走似的；这让他停下脚步，小心翼翼地伸出手，手臂因紧张而微微颤抖。而明日香则愈发用力地将那个破损的小盒子紧贴在胸前，咬着嘴唇，努力保持镇定，极力克制自己不爆发，不把真嗣推开，像往常那样斥责他是变态。

"I wanted to surprise you."
我想给你一个惊喜。

Asuka said simply before Shinji finally succeeded in taking the box away from her hands very gently, before he saw the little note that was taped haphazardly on the wrapping, written in the beautiful, flowing, western penmanship that Asuka possessed.
明日香简短地说完后，真嗣终于轻柔地从她手中取走了盒子，紧接着他注意到了包装上随意贴着的小纸条，上面是用明日香那优美流畅的西式笔迹写就的。

I know you love me.
我明白你爱着我。

And Shinji smiled, because he knew that was the way things were.
真嗣笑了，因为他明白事情本就如此。

AN: Para ti baby, esperando que te la estes pasando feliz en san Valentin.
亲爱的，愿你情人节快乐无比。

### Chapter 15 Themes: K#01 (Look over there), W#12 (Hobbies)
主题：K#01（瞧那边），W#12（兴趣爱好）

Title: P.O.S. 标题：销售点系统

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
作者按：我将在此声明免责：伊娃及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

The small group of girls continued giggling and teasing, relaxing as the school day, thank god, was about to end, which made Asuka's lips break into a small, contended smile. Friday would usually do that to her, make her smile a little, make her remember sometimes how good it felt to be a teenager.
一小群女孩依旧咯咯笑着，互相逗趣，随着学校的一天即将结束，她们感到放松。这使得明日香嘴角不由自主地浮现出一抹满足的微笑。星期五总是有这样的魔力，让她心情愉悦，偶尔让她回味起青春的美好。

Asuka let out a sigh as she looked up front, noticing Hikari as the pigtailed, freckled girl finished and stood up, walking behind her, the sounds of aimless chatting from other students who were still out in the hallways, talking aimlessly as they waited for their friends from other classrooms to be let go after the usual Stand. Bow. Sit.
明日香抬头望向前方，轻叹一声，此时她注意到双马尾、脸带雀斑的女生光已经结束并起身，走到她身后。走廊里，其他学生仍在漫无目的地闲聊，他们正等待着其他教室的朋友在完成例行的“起立、鞠躬、坐下”后被放行。

Both girls walked slowly, making their way to the school entrance and saying "hi" to the other students: Hikari in a demure, polite tone, while Asuka would openly smile and giggle, enjoying the attention she received.
两位女孩缓步前行，朝着学校大门走去，一路上向其他同学打招呼：光以一种温文尔雅的口吻说“你好”，而飞鸟则是开朗地笑着，享受着众人的瞩目。

Until she saw him. 直到她看到他。

Hikari felt Asuka's whole body tense, and the redhead's face instantly began to glow a color similar to her hair, before the half German, half Japanese teenager let out a small growl, stomping her way across the hall, making Shinji let out a deep sigh, grumbling before he began to change his in-school slippers for his regular tennis shoes, focusing on the simple task to take his mind of the day, something for which he was glad as all of the past days had been nothing less than depressing.
光察觉到明日香全身紧绷，她的脸颊迅速染上了与发色相近的绯红。这位德日混血的少女低声咆哮，踏着重步穿过走廊，让真嗣不禁深叹一声，嘟囔着换下室内鞋，穿上网球鞋，专注于这简单的动作以暂时忘却这令人沮丧的一天，他对此感到一丝庆幸。

That was until Asuka had made Shinji painfully aware of how angry she was still at him by ignoring him all through the day, even going so far as leaving before he could say a thing while both her and Hikari walked away, the prospect of Asuka being more vocal, and perhaps physical with her anger, hanging on top of Shinji's head like Damocles' sword pending from a fragile thread just by the fact alone of Shinji walking into Misato's apartment.
直到明日香让真嗣深切感受到她对他的怒火未消，她整日对他视而不见，甚至在真嗣开口前便与光一同离去。明日香可能会更加直言不讳，甚至可能用行动来表达她的愤怒，这种可能性如同悬在真嗣头顶的达摩克利斯之剑，仅因他踏入美里公寓的那一刻便摇摇欲坠。

In short, he was very much screwed.
说白了，他真是倒了大霉。

But the good news were that classes were over for the day, which meant only one more day to go, but it really was a formality, since it was going to be the cultural festival, which meant no classes.
好消息是，当天的课已经上完了，也就是说，只剩最后一天了。不过，这更多是走个形式，因为接下来是文化节，那天不会安排课程。

Sighing again, only this time a more calm, almost happy sigh; the kind one does when realizing they had survived the worst and there was, indeed, a light at the end of the tunnel, Shinji began to make his way towards the entrance, thinking of doing nothing but hanging out with Toji and Kensuke, maybe going to the arcade, before inevitably going back home to face the insatiable teasing of his roommates.
再次叹气，这次却是平静中带着一丝欣慰，仿佛在庆幸自己已熬过最艰难的时刻，前方终见曙光。真嗣迈步向入口走去，心中只想着和东治、健介简单聚聚，或许去游戏厅消遣，之后再无奈地回家，迎接室友们那没完没了的玩笑。

"Yo, chief, you ready or what?" Shinji smiled at the sight of Toji, clad in his track suit, as always, the strap of his book bag rested against his head like he normally did to lodge his hands inside the pockets of his windbreaker.
"嘿，老大，准备妥了吗？" 真嗣笑着望向东治，他依旧穿着那身运动服，书包带子像往常一样搭在头顶，双手则习惯性地插在风衣的口袋里。

"Yeah," Shinji answered shyly, almost uncomfortably shrinking as if by instinct, trying to make himself be a smaller target against others' prying eyes. "Sorry to keep you waiting."
嗯，" 真嗣有些腼腆地回应，身体不自觉地微微后缩，仿佛本能地想在旁人好奇的目光中缩小自己的存在。"不好意思，让你久等了。

"Ah think nothing of it, buddy." Toji said before he caught Shinji in a headlock, brushing his knuckles against the brown haired boy's head, laughing loudly and not caring of anyone looking their way. "This just means you're gonna pay for me and Kenny at the 'cade."
哎，别往心里去，哥们。" 东治说完，一把将真嗣搂进怀里，用手指轻敲他的头，大声笑起来，全然不顾周围人的目光。"这就意味着你得在游戏厅请我和肯尼了。

"Ow, ow, ow! Toji! Cut it out!" Shinji said half joking, half serious before pushing the bigger boy away. Toji smirked and flexed his knees, hands going up, assuming the first position a wrestler would take before grappling with an opponent.
"哎哟，哎哟，哎哟！东治！别闹了！" 真嗣半开玩笑半认真地说着，一边推开了那个大个子男孩。东治咧嘴一笑，屈膝摆好架势，双手举起，准备开始与对手的摔跤较量。

"Ha! So Mr. big shot pilot has grown a set on him? Think you can take on me, Shin-man?" Toji said chuckling, moving around like he had seen the wrestlers on TV do.
"哈！看来这位大人物飞行员胆子大了？以为你能对付我，真嗣？" 东治笑着说，模仿着电视上摔跤手的动作。

"What's up with the standing up?" Kensuke smirked, as Toji threw him his book bag, putting it aside to prevent before sitting on the grass and watching their antics.
"都站起来干嘛？" 健介咧嘴笑着，接过户木扔来的书包放在一旁，随后坐在草地上，饶有兴致地观看他们的表演。

"Yeah! What up Shin? Are ya trying to impress someone? Maybe someone like Ayanami or the devil?" Toji's face lit up as his eyes began fluttering, his hands cradling his face as he sing-song in a high pitched voice while Shinji blushed and looked down.
"耶！真嗣，怎么了？你想讨好谁吗？比如绫波那样的，还是恶魔？" 东治一听这话，脸上顿时放光，眼睛眨巴着，双手捧脸，用尖细的声音唱着，而真嗣则脸红地低下头。

"N-no! it's not like that!"
不，事情不是那样的！

"C'mon Shinji." Kensuke smiled a toothy smile at his friend. "You and them missed on the trip to Okinawa, but we saw both you and Soryu looked like you had been basking in the sun."
真嗣，别这样。" 健介对朋友露出灿烂的笑容。"虽然你和他们在冲绳之旅中错过了，但我们看得出你和索琉都晒得挺黑的。

"More like a volcano." Shinji muttered loud enough for him to hear but for his friends to ignore.
"更像火山爆发。" 真嗣低声自语，声音刚好让他听见，却又不引起朋友们的注意。

"So come clean." Kensuke said lazily, taking his camcorder from within his school bag and setting it on Shinji's face, ready to record what ever Shinji might say or slip out. "Where exactly did you and the devil ran off to that made you sport matching tans?"
坦白从宽。" 健介懒洋洋地说着，从书包里掏出摄像机，对准真嗣的脸，准备捕捉他可能透露的任何信息。"你和恶魔究竟去了哪儿，晒得肤色都一样了？

"How do you even know we have matching tans?" Shinji said sighing, something that was rapidly becoming a normal occurrence on his life, it seemed.
"你怎么确定我们的肤色相配呢？" 真嗣叹息道，这样的叹息似乎在他的生活中越来越常见了。

"Gym class." Kensuke smiled easily, while Toji winked at Shinji's surprised face. "We managed to score some more glamour shots of your new girlfriend while she was bragging to Hikari about her awesome tan."
体育课上，健介轻松地笑着，透二则对真嗣惊讶的表情眨了眨眼。\"我们趁你新女友向光炫耀她那绝妙的晒黑时，又抓拍了几张她的靓照。\"

"Yeah, I gotta admit, Soryu does fill the gym uniform nicely, see?" Kensuke added, fiddling with his camera before the small screen showed still photos of the girl's gym class.
"确实，Soryu 的运动服穿得挺合身的，你看呢？" 健介边说边调整相机，屏幕上展示着女生体育课的照片。

Shinji's eyes narrowed as he sneaked a glance into the camcorder, only to be greeted with the image of Asuka, captured as the redhead was riding her shorts a little higher over her hind quarter to expose a patch of untanned skin, contrasting vividly with the healthy tan of the rest of her leg, the sight of it making Shinji's mouth hang open, cheeks blushed as his eyes fixated on the exposed skin.
真嗣眯起眼睛，偷偷瞄向摄像机，画面中明日香正轻轻提拉短裤，露出一块未晒黑的皮肤，与她腿部的健康肤色形成强烈对比。这景象让真嗣目不转睛，脸颊泛红，目光牢牢地定格在那片裸露的肌肤上。

"Hey chief, don't wanna sound like a pusher or nothing but if you wanna see you gotta pay." Toji's heavy "tough-boy" accent and flashy smile signaled that he was now in "business mode" while taking the camera of Shinji's eyes, staring at it and whistling appreciatively.
"嘿，头儿，我可不是想催你，但要看就得掏钱。" 东治带着浓重的"硬汉"口音和灿烂的笑容，显然已切换到"营业模式"，他盯着真嗣的镜头，吹着口哨，一脸赞赏。

"Toji, my camera." Kensuke whimpered as he stepped behind Toji, knowing that finesse and carefulness were two activities that would never be identified with Suzuhara, but Toji simply ignored the glass-wearing boy, talking away.
"东治，我的相机。" 健介呜咽着躲到东治身后，深知细腻和谨慎与铃原毫不相干，但东治对那戴眼镜的男孩视而不见，自顾自地说着话。

"I mean I pity your soul and all, chief, but if you like the red pill better than the blue pill, who are we to judge?" He snickered as Shinji blushed again, scrambling to deny any and all accusation, implied or otherwise, against his character.
"我是说，我对你这灵魂也挺同情的，头儿，但如果你真觉得红药丸比蓝药丸好，我们又凭什么去评头论足呢？" 他窃笑一声，真嗣的脸又红了，慌忙否认所有针对他品性的指控，无论是明摆的还是暗含的。

"To-Toji! My camera." 冬至到了！我的相机。

"After all, if you like hell over heaven… I mean personally, if I were you I'd go with Misato, but she already has that what's-his-name sniffing her panties, so I guess the best option is Ayanami." Toji finished, trying to sound like a guy who had seen it all and done it all, winking at Shinji as if he held the ultimate answer to picking up girls, almost like a master pick up artist. "Sure, she's quiet and submissive, but you know what they say… It's always the quiet ones."
说到底，如果你宁愿选择地狱而非天堂…打个比方，如果我是你，我会倾向于美里，但她身边已经有那个谁在打她的主意了，所以看来最佳选择还是绫波。" 东治说完，试图装作一个阅历丰富、无所不知的人，对真嗣眨了眨眼，仿佛握有追女孩的绝妙策略，俨然一位搭讪高手。"确实，她话不多且温顺，但常言道…往往就是那些沉默寡言的人。

"Toji! My camera!" Kensuke's voice and actions became more and more frantic as he saw the jock play with his camera as if it were a basketball, dribbling and throwing it up and catching it with one hand before Kensuke pushed him to the ground, making the tall teen land loudly on his ass.
"东治！我的相机！" 看到那个运动员像玩篮球一样戏弄他的相机，又是运球又是单手抛接，剑介急得声音和动作都失控了，最后一把将那高个子推倒在地，摔得他屁股着地，声音响亮。

Shinji could almost swear he heard Kensuke snarl as he hugged his precious camera against his chest, hunching over it, the setting sun glaring into his glasses, making Shinji shiver for some unknown reason while Toji simply guffawed loudly from the grass.
真嗣几乎可以肯定，他听到健介在紧抱心爱的相机时发出低沉的咆哮声，身体蜷曲着护住相机，夕阳的余晖直射进他的眼镜，让真嗣莫名感到一阵寒意，而东治则躺在草地上大声嘲笑。

"So how about it chief? You and Asuka got a little busy getting busy while we were in Okinawa?" Toji snickered as he motioned to Kensuke. "Because if you did, then you're more advanced than this guy; all the time, we had countless cuties in bathing suits... never once did he ask one out."
怎么样，老大，在冲绳的时候你和明日香是不是趁机亲热了一番？" 东治窃笑着向真嗣示意，"因为如果真是这样，那你可比这家伙会玩多了；我们那会儿周围都是穿着泳装的可爱女孩...他可是一次都没敢约。

"Ah, don't listen to him, Shinji. He didn't get a piece of the action either." Kensuke countered, instantly branding together with Shinji, but staying behind the boy, grabbing his precious hardware to prevent anything from happening to it and ready to run should Toji get up and try to exact revenge. "After all, Toji was staring at the class rep when she pulled her own shirt down to show Asuka how tanned she was."
哎，别听他的，真嗣。他也没分到一杯羹。" 健介立刻与真嗣结成同盟，却仍躲在真嗣身后，紧握着自己的珍贵器材以防不测，并随时准备逃跑，以防东治起身报复。"要知道，当班长拉下自己的衬衫向明日香展示她的晒黑程度时，东治可是目不转睛地盯着班长呢。

Instantly, almost as if someone had pulled a lever or pressed a button from a remote control, Toji blushed before getting up in a jump, chasing after his friends while Shinji watched all this and let out his usual annoyed sigh.
仿佛有人远程操控般，东治的脸颊瞬间泛红，他一跃而起，追赶着朋友们。真嗣在一旁目睹这一切，不禁发出了一贯的无奈叹息。

"God Misato! What the hell was she even thinking!" Asuka said under her breath as she took out her slippers, not even bothering about the cascade of love letters and cards erupting from her shoe box.
"天哪，美里！她究竟是怎么想的！" 明日香低声自语，一边换上拖鞋，对从鞋盒里散落一地的情书和卡片视若无睹。

"Why? Did she make dinner again?" Hikari said as she opened her own locker and put her shoes in, extracting her slippers, already aware of Misato's legendary awful cooking skills.
"怎么了？她又下厨了？" 光一边说着，一边打开自己的储物柜，换上拖鞋，心中早已对美里那出了名的糟糕厨艺了然于胸。

"Please! I don't have the stomach for you to remind me of her spicy curry ramen nightmare." Asuka mumbled as she covered her face with her hands.
"求你别说了！我真受不了你再提她那辣咖喱拉面的噩梦。" 明日香嘟囔着，双手掩面。

"I thought you said that any one who is actually too much of an idiot to taste her cooking should suffer the consequences and take it like a man." Hikari continued, adopting Asuka's harsh, self-assured tone of voice to better deliver her lines, hopping to gain a small smile from the usually voluble girl, only this time her joke fell on deaf ears.
"我记得你说过，真要是笨到尝不出她手艺的人，就该自食其果，像个男子汉一样承受。"光继续模仿明日香那严厉而自信的口吻，本想逗得那平时话多的女孩微微一笑，不料这次却碰了壁，没人领情。

"I-is something wrong?" 我-是不是出了什么问题？

"Huh? No." Asuka said all too quickly, blushing but looking down to her shoes, hiding swiftly her face under the curtain of her hair.
"啊？不会吧。" 明日香急忙否认，脸颊泛红，低头盯着鞋子，迅速用垂下的发丝遮掩住表情。

"Really?" 真的吗？

"I'm good, really." The redhead finished quickly as she looked up and half jumped, half stood up, resting her hands on her hips, and her body on her heels.
"我确实很好。"红发女孩迅速说完，随即抬头，半跳半站地起身，双手叉腰，身体微微后仰，稳稳地站在脚跟上。

"Alright, if you say so..." Hikari shrugged, as both girls made their way to the classroom with the rest of the girls from gym class.
"行吧，你说了算……" 光耸耸肩，和体育课的其他女生一同前往教室。

"It's not a big deal, ok?" The German teen said as she shuffled behind Hikari, threading sluggishly towards the classroom. "And remind me again why the hell am I doing this?"
这没什么大不了的，好吗？"德国少女跟在 Hikari 身后，拖着沉重的步伐走向教室，嘴里还嘟囔着："再告诉我一遍，我到底为什么要这么做？

Hikari rolled her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose; her voice coming out in a long suffered sigh.
光(Hikari)翻了翻白眼，捏着鼻梁，长叹一声，语气中透露出深深的无奈。

"Well, for starters, that's because you need the extra points that are given to students who help on the Cultural Festival Committee." She said matter-of-factly, rounding the corner and walking into a storage room, before they both emerged carrying out several cardboard boxes and placing them on the floor.
"嗯，首先，这是因为帮助文化节委员会的学生能获得额外分数。"她直截了当地说，拐过弯走进储藏室，随后两人一起搬出几个纸箱放在地上。

"Well, yeah there's that." Asuka said, having the decency to blush as she was reminded of her poor grades… not like she would ever agree or accept it.
"嗯，确实如此。" 明日香说着，脸上泛起羞涩的红晕，被提醒到自己不尽人意的成绩……她可不会轻易承认或接受这一点。

"Also…" Hikari continued tiredly as she grabbed a box overflowing with fabric and placed it on top of the others waiting for them in a dolly. "It's because you're such a good friend that wouldn't allow me to deal with all these by myself."
再说…"光疲惫地接着说，她拿起一个装满布料的箱子，放在手推车上其他待处理的箱子之上。"正因为你是个好朋友，才不会让我一个人承担这些。

"Yep." Asuka grinned to herself, complacently as she snickered right along side with Hikari, a familiar crooked smile blossoming on her lips before the redhead grabbed onto her friend's arm and both began walking down the hallway.
"没错。" Asuka 得意地笑了，与 Hikari 一同窃笑，熟悉的歪斜笑容在她唇边绽放。接着，红发女孩抓住好友的胳膊，两人一同沿着走廊走去。

"But mainly…" Hikari said as they reached classroom 2-A, hearing the amicable chatter and sounds emerging from within as several other girls were busy inside. "You said yes because it'll be fun."
主要是……"光说着，他们走到了 2-A 教室门口，耳边传来里面友好的谈笑声和其他几个女孩忙碌的动静。"你之所以答应，是因为觉得这事儿挺有意思的。

"Yeah.. fun." Asuka frowned, muttering quietly to herself.
"是啊..真有趣。" 明日香皱眉，低声自语。

"Yes. Fun." Hikari smiled but her voice was firm as she opened the door to the classroom. "By the way Asuka... what happened between you and Shinji?"
是的，挺有趣的。" 光微笑着，声音却很坚定，她推开了教室的门。"对了，明日香……你和真嗣之间出了什么事？

Shinji rolled his eyes and shrugged.
真嗣翻了翻白眼，又耸了耸肩。

"It's nothing really." 其实没什么。

"C'mon Shin-man… we know ya." Toji said as all 3 walked towards the arcade. "Something has your panties in a twist… after all, Soryu barely looked at ya when we passed by her and the class rep."
走吧，Shin-man…我们还不了解你吗？" Toji 边说边和另外两人一起走向游戏厅。"你肯定有什么心事…毕竟，我们经过时，Soryu 几乎没理你，连班长也没怎么注意你。

"Yeah, normally she would at least give you her glare of death." Kensuke agreed. "Today she simply looked away."
对，平时她至少会用那死亡凝视瞪你一眼。" 健介附和道，"今天她却只是把目光移开了。

Shinji sighed and slumped against the wall, sliding down to sit on a nearby bench; if he had to be completely honest, this had all started with that onsen trip, and the trip back home.
真嗣叹息着，背靠墙壁缓缓坐到一旁的长椅上；说实话，这一切的起因正是那次温泉之旅和归途。

No, wait… It had started when Asuka had arrived from...
不，等等… 事情是从明日香从... 抵达时开始的。

Shinji sighed and corrected himself.
真嗣叹息一声，纠正了自己的错误。

It had started when he had opened that letter his father had sent; everything had started to slide downhill from there, slouching towards some sort of cosmic joke he never got, didn't understand, but was fairly sure was centered around him, Shinji Ikari, making him the punch line.
一切始于他拆开父亲寄来的那封信；自那刻起，他的生活便开始一路下滑，仿佛滑向一个他始终无法理解的宇宙玩笑，尽管不明所以，但他确信这个玩笑是围绕着他，碇真嗣，让他成为笑柄。

"Well?" 怎么样？

Shinji closed his eyes, letting out a breath of air before remembering the events that had brought upon him this particular punch line.
碇真嗣闭上双眼，缓缓呼出一口气，脑海中浮现出那些导致他此刻遭遇尴尬笑点的往事。

"Well, it all started with Misato… after she made us all miss on the trip to Okinawa, she took both Asuka and me to an onsen." Shinji began. "When we came back home…"
一切始于美里……她让我们错过了冲绳之旅，随后带我和明日香去了温泉。" 真嗣开始讲述，"回到家后……

"Ah! Nothing like a trip to the onsen to clear one's mind!"
啊！去温泉旅行真是让人心旷神怡的最佳选择！

The silence that greeted her made Misato turn around to her right, throwing a quick glance at her copilot. She had expected at least a thank you from any of them, but mostly from him, after going through all the trouble of booking the open air bath since neither Shinji nor Asuka were able to go to Okinawa.
面对她的沉默，Misato 不禁向右转头，快速地瞥了一眼副驾驶。她原以为至少会有人向她表示感谢，尤其是他，毕竟她费尽周折才订到了露天浴池，因为 Shinji 和 Asuka 都去不了冲绳。

"You're awfully quiet today. Something on your mind?"
你今天怎么这么安静，有心事吗？

Again she saw his eyes turn to her and blink, take in a breath and just as he was about to say something, turn to his right and look out the window, blinking at the orange hue of the setting sun.
她又一次注意到他的目光转向自己，眨了眨眼，深吸一口气，正准备说话，却突然转向右侧，凝视窗外，对着夕阳的橙色光辉眨眼。

"Oh fine, be that way!" Misato said, sticking out her tongue at him before looking back on her rear view mirror, noticing how Shinji and Asuka were asleep; the redhead resting against Shinji's shoulder, while the boy's head was laid back, the only audible sound on the car being the soft, light snoring coming from them both.
"行吧，随你便！" 美里说着，朝他做了个鬼脸，随后瞥了一眼后视镜，发现真嗣和明日香已经进入了梦乡；明日香的红发倚在真嗣肩头，而真嗣的头则向后仰着，车内只剩下他们两人轻柔的鼾声。

"So what do you think? Do they make a cute couple?" The tone in her voice left little intentions of Misato's plan to tease both teens as soon as they arrived home, but she needed something more… incriminating.
"你怎么看？他们看起来是不是很般配？"Misato 的语气中并没有透露太多意图，她打算等两个孩子一回家就逗逗他们，不过她还需要更确凿的把柄。

Smiling devilishly, Misato fished into her purse and extracted her mobile phone, flicking the camera to get a good view of the two teens, head in head. Biting her lip to stifle a throaty chuckle, the major slowly lowered the back windows so that the cold night air entered the car, making Shinji and Asuka, both still clad with their short sleeve shirts, or in Asuka's case a white frilly sundress, tremble and snuggle on each other for added warmth.
葛城美里邪魅地笑了笑，从包里掏出手机，调整好摄像头，对准两个头挨着头的少年。她咬住嘴唇，强忍住笑意，缓缓降下车后窗，让冷冽的夜风涌入，使得穿着短袖衫的真嗣和身着白色蕾丝连衣裙的明日香不禁打了个寒颤，彼此依偎以取暖。

The sound of the electric shutter signaled that Misato had already taken the picture, and looked at it, enjoying the sense of innocence and tenderness it held before she noticed how close their faces were.
电子快门的咔嚓声宣告了 Misato 已按下快门，她端详着照片，沉浸在那份纯真与温情之中，片刻后才察觉到两人的面庞竟如此贴近。

That was when her plan took a whole new dimension.
那一刻，她的计划迈入了全新的境界。

Noticing that a curve was nearing, Misato quickly saved the picture, preparing again. Using the mirror to focus the camera-phone she let the car go straight before giving it a hard turn and pressing the "capture" button.
察觉到前方即将出现弯道，Misato 迅速保存了照片，随即重新做好拍摄准备。她借助后视镜调整手机摄像头，先让车辆直行，随后猛打方向盘，并及时按下“拍照”键。

Shinji had been dreaming of Pen-Pen... somehow the penguin had decided to sit on top of his chest, which made Shinji realize he was quite heavy... and for some unexplainable reason, his voice sounded like Ayanami's.
真嗣梦到了企鹅彭彭……不知何故，这只企鹅竟坐在他的胸膛上，让他感觉到它颇为沉重……更奇怪的是，它的声音竟酷似绫波的。

Asuka had been dreaming about a date with Kaji.
明日香一直梦想着和加持先生约会。

That in itself wasn't surprising for the petite redhead; she had been walking hand in hand with Kaji through a very normal setting of a park, trees lining the road, letting only a faint stream of sunlight before Kaji, without saying anything, dipped down his face and meet her lips with a soft peek.
对于那位娇小的红发女孩而言，这并不出奇；她和 Kaji 手牵手漫步在公园的寻常景致中，路旁树木成行，仅让一丝微光洒落。突然间，Kaji 未发一言，俯身轻柔地吻上了她的唇。

Some where along the line, Shinji realized that Pen-Pen was leaning over him, with a fish in his beak, staring at him expectantly, unblinkingly, as he slowly, ever so agonizingly slowly got closer and closer, the smell of fish faint but strong enough to make Shinji aware that a dead fish was inches away from his mouth.
不知何时，真嗣察觉到企鹅彭彭正俯身在他上方，嘴里衔着一条鱼，满怀期待地凝视着他，眼睛一眨不眨，慢慢地，极其缓慢地逼近，那微弱的鱼腥味虽不刺鼻，却足以让真嗣意识到一条死鱼近在咫尺。

Why is Pen-Pen trying to feed me as if he were my... mom?
为什么 Pen-Pen 要像妈妈一样喂我呢？

The pressure on her lips had caught the German girl by surprise, but she had quickly recovered by deepening the kiss using the innate human reaction to a kiss; she parted her lips and savored Kaji's mouth, noticing the texture of his lips. For someone who looked so rough and world weary, Kaji had amazingly soft lips, almost like a young boy's. She moaned softly as she felt the older man's lips move in unison to her own, reacting as well making the kiss more powerful, and deep and breathtaking.
德国女孩被突如其来的唇压惊了一下，但她迅速用人类接吻的本能反应调整过来，她轻启朱唇，细细感受加治的唇，发现他的唇竟异常柔软，与外表的粗犷和沧桑形成鲜明对比，宛如少年。她轻声呻吟，感受到这位年长男子的唇与自己的唇同步移动，同样地回应着，使这个吻愈发强烈、深邃且令人陶醉。

Shinji decided that, for a dead fish, this fish was actually a very good kisser, there was a lot of passion put behind the kiss, and while his mind knew on a detached way that he should be screaming horrified about the situation and it's repercussions, his body was acting on it's own, pressing more, enjoying the faint taste of strawberries and mint, so unlike a dead fish that Shinji had to wonder just what had this dead fish been eating, as well as possibly congratulate it for amazing oral hygiene.
真嗣觉得，这条死鱼在接吻方面出奇地出色，吻里充满了激情。虽然理智告诉他应该对这荒诞情景及其后果感到恐惧，但身体却不由自主地更加贴近，品味着那草莓与薄荷的微妙滋味，全然不像一条死鱼。他不禁好奇这条鱼生前究竟吃了什么，或许还得为它那惊人的口腔卫生点赞。

When Asuka opened her eyes to see Kaji's face she noticed that is features seemed much younger than she remembered. She also noticed that his usually uncombed messy mop of hair seemed smaller and combed differently.
明日香睁眼见到加持的面庞，发觉他的容貌比记忆中更显年轻。他那往日里总是乱糟糟的头发，如今也似乎短了些，梳理得别有一番模样。

As Shinji licked his lips, enjoying the last remnants of the strawberry flavored lip-gloss he never knew fish liked to wear, he realized that the fish was now staring at him, blinking quickly and the red tuft of hair and bangs making it look actually kind of cute and adorable, in a familiar, loud, over bearing, Germanic kind of way.
真嗣舔了舔嘴唇，品味着草莓味唇彩的余韵，他没想到鱼儿也会涂唇彩。这时，他注意到那条鱼正盯着他，快速眨眼，红色的发束和刘海让它显得颇为可爱，透着一种熟悉、喧闹、霸道的日耳曼风情。

Asuka noticed Kaji's eyes opening slowly, only instead of dark chocolate brown, they seemed darker and… bluer…
明日香察觉到加持的眼睛慢慢睁开，颜色不再是深棕，而是变得更加深邃，透出一种蓝调……

Almost like Shinji's… 简直就像真嗣的一样…

And Shinji began to realize the dead fish was actually a very much alive German-loaned evangelion pilot.
真嗣逐渐明白，那条看似死去的鱼，其实是来自德国、充满活力的福音战士驾驶员。

Asuka blinked as she slowly began to realize she was in Misto's car, she was kissing Shinji.
明日香眨了眨眼，渐渐意识到自己身处米斯托的车中，正与真嗣亲吻。

And he was staring back…
他正凝视着，回望着……

As the redhead had heard Misato's telltale snicker, it took her a couple of seconds before she finally realized the compromising position she was in, her mind booting up, almost sluggishly realizing and adapting quickly to her surroundings before she finally had a delayed reaction, transformed into words, screech or scream by her mind.
红发女子听到碇真嗣那标志性的窃笑后，过了几秒才恍然大悟自己陷入了尴尬境地。她的大脑迟缓地启动，逐渐意识到并迅速适应了周围环境，随后才有了迟来的反应，她的思维将其转化为一声尖叫。

"MISATO!" MISATO!

And so, she screamed. 于是，她尖叫出声。

"Yeah, I still can't believe she would get so angry over a kiss." Kensuke said as he continued to play one of the first person shooter games he favored so much. "I mean, I'll never get why girls get so freaked out about their first kiss, even in anime and dating sims."
是啊，真没想到她会因为一个吻气成那样。" 健介一边继续玩着他钟爱的第一人称射击游戏，一边说道。"说真的，我始终搞不懂为什么女生对初吻这么敏感，连动漫和恋爱游戏里都这样。

"Wait, first kiss?" Toji said with a slight shrug as he heard the buzzer and began to shot as fast and in target as he could, ball after ball landing, bouncing, scoring and rebounding quickly getting as many shots in as the amount of seconds that had elapsed while Shinji was still struggling to land at least more than one. "I never got why chicks get so hung up on stuff like that... first kiss."
等等，初吻？" Toji 说着耸了耸肩，听到蜂鸣声后立刻开始快速而精准地投篮，球一个接一个地命中、弹跳、得分、回弹，迅速投出的球数与流逝的秒数相当，而 Shinji 还在挣扎着试图投中不止一个。"我真搞不懂，为什么女生们对初吻这种事这么纠结...

"Well, I mean, it's kind of logical." Kensuke supplied, grumbling as he put more tokens on his game before starting again. "It's like an achievement... a medal or something. Like how you keep remembering the first time you beat up that guy in grade school."
嗯，我是说，这挺合乎逻辑的。" 健介嘟囔着，往游戏里又投了些代币，然后重新开始。"这就像是一种成就...一枚奖章之类的。就像你始终记得小学时第一次打败那个家伙的情景。

"Yeah." Toji nodded, a dreamy smile coming over his face as he remembered that time, cracking his knuckles reflexively. "That was awesome, I got Kai good with a punch to th-"
对，没错。" Toji 点头微笑，沉浸在回忆中，不经意间活动了一下手指。"那次真是痛快，我一拳打中了 Kai，让他——

"A punch to the nose and then a kick to the gut." Kensuke said in a bored tone. "I know, I was there, and I've heard you bragging since then."
先是一拳打中鼻子，随后一脚踹在腹部。" 健介漫不经心地说道，"我当然知道，当时我就在场，之后也没少听你炫耀。

"Well, I can understand someone like class rep getting bent out of shape about it, but Soryu ain't Japanese... aren't western girls supposed to think more about their first time than their first kiss?" Toji continued undaunted, realizing the timer was going down and asking his actions faster, forgetting to line his shot and instead focusing on sheer volume of balls flying over towards the net.
"嗯，我能理解班长对此大发雷霆，但苏龙并非日本人...西方女孩不是应该更看重她们的初夜而非初吻吗？" 东二继续毫不畏惧，意识到计时器在倒数，便加快了动作，忽略了调整射击角度，只顾着让更多球飞向网对面。

"I don't really think about it." Shinji answered with a slight bluish, fidgeting and feeling uncomfortable as he always did whenever the topic of conversation veered towards girls or sex... or both.
"我其实不太去想这些。" 真嗣略显局促，不安地动来动去，每当话题涉及女生或性方面时，他总是如此感到不自在。

"C'mon Shin-man..." Toji began as he placed his hands squarely on Shinji's shoulders. "Are you saying you've never once thought about it? You live with Katsuragi who's a babe, and Asuka is actually kind of cute."
真嗣，你听我说……" 东治说着，双手搭在真嗣肩上，语气认真。"你真的从没考虑过吗？你和葛城小姐同住一个屋檐下，她可是个大美人，还有明日香，其实也挺俏皮的。

Shinji simply groaned, realizing there was no way he could win that argument as all three continued to play in the arcade, trying to change the conversation.
意识到这场争论自己毫无胜算，真嗣只是叹了口气，三人便继续在游戏厅里嬉戏，试图改变话题。

"You know, I fell kind of bad for not staying behind and helping the others." Shinji said as he tried to score with the basketball in his hand, looking to his right at Toji who was the image of presence of mind; focused and in control, legs slightly bent, arms held high over his head, elbows pointing inwards while his eyes zeroed in on the basket itself.
"说起来，我有点后悔没留下来帮大家。" 真嗣说着，一边尝试投篮，一边向右看向东治，只见他神情专注，姿态稳健；双腿微屈，双臂高举，肘部内收，目光紧锁篮筐。

"Ehh, I'm sure the other guys are working hard enough for all three of us." Toji wondered out loud as he placed some coins and began to play the basketball game again, quickly getting the amount of tickets he needed after just one try while Shinji shrugged, playing Kensuke's game and doing surprisingly better than him.
"哎，我敢肯定其他人已经够拼了，足以代表我们仨。" 东治边说边投入硬币，再次挑战篮球游戏，一次尝试便迅速集齐了票数。与此同时，真嗣耸耸肩，接手了健介的游戏，表现竟比健介还要出色。

"Besides, if we had stayed there, you would have to stay an' suffer the ire of the red devil." Suzuhara continued as he collected a fist-full of tickets, folding them carefully and putting them with the other bunch he had, counting them before looking at the prize booth and sighing as he shook his head, realizing he needed more tickets to get the prize he wanted.
"况且，若我们留在那儿，你只能留下承受红魔的怒气。" 铃原边说边抓起一把票券，细心地折叠好，与之前收集的票券堆放在一起，数了数，然后望向奖品摊位，叹了口气，摇头意识到还需更多票券才能换得心仪的奖品。

Shinji nodded, frowning but choosing to remain silent; for all of Toji's and Kensuke's good intention, he still had to live with said red devil, so he was simply postponing the inevitable.
真嗣点头表示理解，眉头微皱却保持沉默；虽然东治和健介是出于好意，但他终究得面对那个红色恶魔，此刻的沉默不过是将不可避免的冲突暂时搁置。

But for the meantime, Shinji decided to focus on having fun with his friends before making his way back to Misato's apartment.
暂时，真嗣决定先享受与朋友们的欢乐时光，然后再回美里家。

"Hey Ken! Aren't you done yet?"
嘿，肯！还没搞定吗？

"I wanted to go check out the new deliveries in the shop across; I need to see if they've received the latest Dangeki Hobby." Kensuke siad, signaling with his thumb to the hobbies store in front of the theater as Toji collected his tickets and then walked to the attendant's desk, exchanging his them while Shinji both got their school bags, waiting for Toji to finish. "Why? What's your rush?"
我想去对面店里看看新到的货，得确认一下他们是否收到了最新一期的《电击爱好》。" 健介说着，拇指朝剧院前的爱好商店一指，东二此时正收好票，走向服务台换取，而真嗣则拿起两人的书包，在一旁等待东二办完手续。"怎么了？这么急干嘛？

"You guys go ahead, I'll meet you there in a bit." Toji said as he turned to Shinji and Kensuke, nodding jamming the toy he had gotten from his tickets into his book bag. "I just remembered I have to be somewhere else."
你们先去吧，我稍后就来。" 东治对真嗣和健介说完，一边点头一边把用票券换的玩具塞进书包。"突然想起我还有个地方得去。

And just like that, Toji was gone, walking quickly out of the arcade and down the street before disappearing around the corner
就这样，东治匆匆离开了游戏厅，沿着街道快步前行，一拐弯便不见了踪影

"He is so weird sometimes." Kensuke said as he and Shinji's walked out of the arcade and down the street towards the hobby store, Kensuke talking animatedly about the newest models for ships and airplanes and the like while Shinji decided not to say anything, and instead simply nodded at Kensuke, trying to appear like he was interested in it all.
"他有时真让人摸不着头脑。" 健介边说边和真嗣离开游戏厅，沿着街道走向爱好商店。健介兴致勃勃地谈论着最新的舰船和飞机模型，而真嗣则选择沉默，仅以点头回应，尽力装出感兴趣的样子。

"I mean sometimes, I call him and he's playing by himself, or staying after school to clean up, or whatever..." Kensuke continued, while Shinji simply nodded, grunting noncommittally, not really interested, and in fact thinking about what had happened earlier today.
"我是说，有时我打电话给他，他正独自玩耍，或是放学后留下来打扫，或是忙些别的……" 健介继续说着，而真嗣只是简单地点头，含糊地应了一声，实际上并不太关心，心里还在琢磨今天早些时候的事。

"-ike you and a Soryu." Shinji blinked, stopping in his place, half realizing his name and Asuka's were linked together before his mind began to wander, thinking about what had happened in the trip, unconsciously clenching and unclenching his hands while Kensuke simply gave him a sidelong glance. "I mean, if you think about it, Soryu is all bark and no bite."
就像你和一艘 Soryu。" 真嗣眨了眨眼，停下脚步，半意识到自己的名字和明日香的名字被联系在一起，思绪开始游离，回想着旅途中的经历，无意识地握紧又松开双手，而剑介只是向他投去一瞥。"我是说，如果你仔细想想，Soryu 只是虚张声势，没有实际行动。

Shinji sighed, before he realized this wasn't going to end well unless a compromise was made; it wasn't so much that he had wanted to hang out with Toji and Kensuke in the first place; true, they were his friends, but this was mostly something done out of sheer selfishness, since the alternative was going back to Misato's, and Shinji knew very well this would mean he'd have to face Asuka, which wasn't something he really wanted to.
真嗣叹了口气，意识到除非达成妥协，否则情况不会好转；他本就不太想和东治、健介出去，虽然他们是朋友，但此举更多是出于自私，因为回去见美里就意味着要面对明日香，而这正是他极力避免的。

"You know, Shinji... if it bothers you so much, just tell Soryu." Kensuke said after a moment of silence, shrugging, and looking away. "Girls like her, they just keep pushing and pushing until one finally snaps; I bet that if you stood up to her and told her to take a hike, she'd do that."
你知道，真嗣...如果这事让你实在受不了，就直说给 Soryu 听。" 健介沉默片刻后开口，耸肩并移开视线。"像她这样的女孩，总是步步紧逼，直到有人忍无可忍；我敢说，你若坚决反抗，让她别再纠缠，她肯定就会退缩。

"You don't..." Shinji began, stopping before he sighed. "You don't know Asuka..."
"你并不了解明日香，" 真嗣开口道，中途顿了顿，轻叹一声。

"Probably." Kensuke said more to himself than anyone else as he entered the shop and walked over to where a clerk was setting up some magazines. "But I've seen you two when you fight... and even when you fight, it seems like you both enjoy it..."
或许吧。" 健介低声自语，步入店内，径直走向一位正在摆放杂志的店员。"不过我注意到，你们俩争执时……即便如此，你们似乎还挺享受那种过程的……

"Enjoy it?" Shinji asked with disbelief in his voice. "It's not like that!"
你享受这个吗？" 真嗣的声音中带着怀疑。"事情不是你想的那样！

"I'm just saying what it looks like... Don't kill the messenger." Kensuke looked at Shinji and shrugged once more. "Besides, you two did kiss..."
我不过是陈述所见...别迁怒于传话者。" 健介望向真嗣，又一次耸肩道，"况且，你们俩的确是亲过了...

Shinji closed his eyes and let out a low groan.
碇真嗣闭上双眼，低低地呻吟了一声。

"Not this again..." 怎么又是这一套...

"Wait, wait, wait... Rewind." One of the girls said as she looked up from the center table she was arranging, staring at Asuka and Hikari. "So you kissed h-"
等等，等等，等等...慢着。"其中一个女孩从正在整理的中央桌子旁抬起头，盯着飞鸟和光说："所以你亲了 h-

"No! I didn't kiss anybody!" Asuka said as she tried hard to fight the blush on her cheeks, which only succeeded in making her face seem the much redder.
"不！我没亲任何人！" 明日香极力掩饰着脸颊上的红晕，不料却让她的脸更加绯红。

"Lip locking is kissing, you know?" Hikari said helpfully, while trying to hide a smirk behind some leaves and flowers.
"接吻就是亲嘴，你明白的吧？"光热心地解释着，同时试图用几片叶子和花朵掩藏起嘴角的窃笑。

"The hell it is! It was Misato being her usual normal retarded self!" The redhead said out loud as she shook her fist for emphasis, which made Hikari and a couple of other girls giggled at Asuka's expense, making her glare at her former best friend turned traitor.
"这算什么！那是美里一如既往的正常愚蠢表现！"红发女孩大声说道，挥舞着拳头以示强调，这让光和其他几个女孩忍不住笑出声来，明日香怒视着曾经的好友，如今却成了叛徒。

"Wh-what? You have to admit as far as pranks go that one was funny." Hikari said holding her sides, the snickering and smiling like a pandemic infecting the nearby girls who had stopped measuring fabric to put as table cloths or arranging flowers into table centers.
"什么？你得承认，就恶作剧来说，那次真是挺逗的。" 光边说边捂着肚子笑，她的笑声和笑容仿佛有传染性，让周围原本在量布做桌布或摆弄花束的女孩子们也跟着笑了起来。

"As if!" Asuka shrieked as she sat down on a spare chair, grumbling and not bothering to pay attention, much less help the rest of the students working on this years "Student Café" for class 2-A, sticking out her tongue and scrunching her eyes tightly, her face clearly expressing her dislike. "The only reason why you're saying that is because you've never had the horrible experience of having to kiss a boy…"
好像似的！" 明日香尖叫着坐到一张空椅子上，嘟囔着，对其他同学为 2-A 班今年的“学生咖啡馆”活动忙碌的样子视而不见，更别提帮忙了。她伸出舌头，紧闭双眼，脸上满是不悦。"你这么说，只是因为你从未尝过被迫亲吻一个男孩的苦头……

"W-well your first kiss isn't something to be handed out slightly." Hikari said, blushing at the mention of boys and kisses, as she began to pull at the curtains and fidget with the floral arrangements. "I mean it's your first kiss, a-and it's something very important for a girl."
嗯，初吻可不是随便就能给的。" 光说着，脸颊微红，提到男生和亲吻，她开始拉扯窗帘，摆弄花束。"毕竟，那是你的初吻，对一个女孩来说，这可是非常重要的。

"Oh brother." Asuka whispered, toying with the idea of comparing a first kiss with something equally poignant, but choosing for Hikari's sake to drop the issue.
"哦，兄弟。" 明日香轻声细语，本想将初吻与某件同样触动心弦的事相提并论，但顾及到光的感受，她决定不再提及此事。

Besides, Hikari would die of embarrassment if I so much as uttered the words "virgin", "sex" and "first time".
再者，我要是说出“处男”、“性”或“第一次”这些字眼，光肯定会羞得无地自容。

"That's beside the point! The point is that my first kiss is non-existent! Both that idiot and me were asleep, so it really wasn't that big a deal a-and besides shouldn't you be working on this student festival thing?"
那不是关键！关键是我的初吻压根就没发生！我和那个傻瓜都睡着了，所以其实没什么大不了的，再说，你不是应该忙着筹备这个学生节吗？

"We." Hikari corrected snidely, letting a box fall into Asuka's lap, making the other girls giggle and chuckle once more while Asuka tried to save face with as much dignity as she had left.
"我们。"光带着一丝刻薄纠正道，顺手将一个盒子抛到明日香腿上，引得其他女孩再次窃笑，而明日香则竭力维持仅剩的尊严，试图挽回面子。

"I mean surely it could have been worse." Asuka said in a gruff voice as she kept working with one of the girls, Ayase, on an arrangement while she tried to hide a slight blush around her cheeks from being so close to her idol; she had been one of the first girls to rally around Asuka, not exactly a groupie since she was prone to going away every now and then but she was almost always around the small group, fluttering around Asuka while the rest of the girls made fun of her, even going so far as to try and dye her hair in the same hue as Asuka's but coming out more dark reddish brown than her idol's natural redhead color.
"我意思是，情况总归没那么糟。" Asuka 嗓音沙哑地说着，一边与女孩 Ayase 继续安排事务，她努力掩饰因与偶像近距离接触而脸颊上泛起的微红；Ayase 是最早支持 Asuka 的女孩之一，虽不算狂热粉丝，偶尔会离开，但她几乎总在小团体周围，围绕 Asuka 转悠，其他女孩则取笑她，甚至尝试将头发染成与 Asuka 相同的色调，但出来的颜色比偶像的天然红发更偏深红棕色。

"I agree; kissing Ikari is some cruel and unusual punishment." Kagura, another one of the classmates, added as she folded a table cloth, pulling behind her ear a lock of black hair that had fallen of her high short ponytail as she made sure the design was placed neatly in the center before placing the floral arrangement in it and moving on to the next table to repeat the process.
"我同意；亲吻碇真嗣确实是一种残酷且不寻常的惩罚。" 神乐，另一位同学，一边说着，一边整理桌布，将一缕从高束的短马尾中滑落的黑发挽至耳后，确保图案居中后，再细心摆放花艺，随后走向下一张桌子继续布置。

"Hey Hikari…" One of the other girls, Matsuri, said aloud as she walked towards where the rest were after making sure the rest of the tables were already set. "Have you thought about our theme for this year's cultural festival?"
嘿，Hikari，" 另一个女孩 Matsuri 边走边大声说，她在确认所有桌子都已布置妥当后，向其他人走去。"今年文化节的主题你考虑过了吗？

"Hmm not really." Hikari said softly. "Almost all the good ones have been taken already… there was that animal farm idea…"
嗯，其实不太行。"光轻声说道，"几乎所有好点子都已经被挑走了……之前提到的那个动物农场的想法……

"Yeah, I wanted to do that one." Ayase said with a slight smile, brushing her bangs from her eyes while blushing as she imagined how cool it would have been for all the girls to wear head bands with assorted fluffy animal's ears and tails attached to their backs.
"嗯，我原本是想那样做的。" 绫濑微笑着说，边说边将刘海从眼前拨开，脸上泛起红晕，想象着所有女孩都戴上装饰有各式毛绒动物耳朵和尾巴的头带，那场景一定很帅气。

"And then there was also that Anna Miller's idea…" Hikari mumbled, blushing unconsciously as she imagined how she would have looked dressed in that jumper-type miniskirt, already feeling her chest constricted imagining the high cut waistline, just below her breasts. Although I'm sure the heart-shaped name tag and the apron would look really cute.
"还有安娜·米勒的那个主意……" 光低声说着，脸上不自觉地泛起红晕，脑海中浮现出自己穿上那件套头迷你裙的模样，胸口因想象中的高腰设计而感到紧绷，恰好在胸部下方。她确信，心形的名牌和围裙一定会显得非常可爱。

"Oh please!" Kagura said in a low grumble, as she managed to finally arrange one of the ornaments the way she wanted. "Those are nothing but stupid wet dreams for perverts; animals and maid uniforms… I'm sure someone out there already suggested for us girls to do it dressed in our gym clothes or swimsuits…"
哦，得了吧！" 神楽低声嘟囔着，好不容易把一个装饰品摆成了她心仪的样子。"那些不过是变态的荒唐幻想；又是动物又是女仆装……我敢打赌，肯定有人提议过让我们女孩子穿运动服或泳装来搞这些……

There was a deep silence as everyone turned to Kagura who turned from left to right before shrugging.
众人纷纷望向神乐，四周陷入深深的沉默，她左右环顾一番后，不置可否地耸了耸肩。

"My boyfriend's loser older brother is into that kind of stuff; that's why I never go to visit him at his place."
我男友的哥哥不务正业，偏爱那些玩意儿，所以我从不去他家。

While the rest of the girls began to talk about ideas and themes one of them raised her hand, making Hikari look up and raise her hand, gradually quieting the room before she nodded.
其他女孩开始讨论想法和主题时，其中一位举手示意，Hikari 见状也举起手，逐渐让房间安静下来，随后她点头确认。

"What is it Saori?" 沙织，这是什么？

"My cousin said she and her friends were thinking of coming over to check out our cafe; we could ask her to lend us some of her uniforms and make it a 'school girl cafe'." The normally quiet, mousy looking girl spoke as she rearranged her rounded glasses and brushed away the normally unruly bangs of brown hair from her eyes.
"我表妹提到她和她朋友们想来我们咖啡馆逛逛；我们可以借用她的校服，打造一个'校园风咖啡馆'。" 这位平日里文静、略显羞涩的女孩，正调整着她的圆框眼镜，并轻轻拨开挡在眼前的棕色乱发。

"Oh, really? She's coming to visit you?" Kagura asked, dropping the angry, tough girl attitude for a brief moment before Hikari cleared her throat noisily, preventing Saori from answering and making them look down in embarrassment.
"哦，真的吗？她要来看你？" 神乐惊讶地问道，一瞬间放下了平日的强硬态度。然而，日光突然大声清了清嗓子，打断了沙织的回答，两人顿时尴尬地低下头。

"What school does she go to?"
她就读于哪所学校？

"St. Mary's." Saori answered swiftly, making all the girls except Asuka 'ooh~' and 'aaah~' while the redhead simply stared at them all with a non-plussed look before grabbing a juice box from inside her book bag and sticking the straw inside, drinking noisily as the girls continued to chatter about the uniforms and how cute they were.
"圣玛丽学院。" 沙织迅速回应，除了飞鸟外，其他女生都纷纷发出"哦~"和"啊~"的赞叹声。飞鸟则一脸淡然地看着她们，随后从书包中取出一盒果汁，插入吸管，大声吸饮，而其他女生依旧兴致勃勃地讨论着制服的可爱之处。

"Alright, ask your cousin if they wouldn't mind lending us their uniforms then, or if she knows where we can get them on our own." Hikari nodded as she checked her watch. "I think we have enough money on the budget to buy enough for the girls who will be waitress, and if we hurry we can buy them before the end of the day. Now let's put all the arrangements and everything back in their boxes and go home, we'll meet tomorrow for the big day."
好的，问问你表姐是否愿意借给我们她们的制服，或者她是否知道我们可以在哪里自行购买。" 光点头看了看手表。"我们的预算应该足够购买女服务员所需的制服，如果抓紧时间，今天之内就能搞定。现在，让我们把所有安排和物品归位，然后回家，明天我们再为重要日子集合。

Every girl nodded as they began to get everything ready, Saori staying behind as she spoke on her phone while Asuka looked at Hikari.
女孩们纷纷点头，开始着手准备，纱织则留在后方，边打电话边与飞鸟一同注视着光。

"What's so awesome about this St. Mary's school?"
圣玛丽学校究竟有何过人之处？

"Well, it's an international catholic school, I don't know much about the religion, but something about it is so cool." Hikari gushed while Asuka rolled her eyes. "Besides, their uniforms are so cute! Red sweaters with checkered-green pleated skirts... it's like something out of a western movie."
这是一所国际天主教学校，我对宗教知之甚少，但总觉得它有些地方很吸引人。"光兴奋地说，而明日香则不以为然。"而且，他们的校服真是太可爱了！红色毛衣配上格子绿褶裙...简直像是西部电影中的画面。

"Yeah, yeah..." Asuka said simply as she shook her head, picking up her school bag while Saori nodded at both her and Hikari, and all three girls exited the classroom and the school to go get those uniforms. "You Japanese and your cult of cute are really weird."
嗯，嗯..." 飞鸟简单地应了两声，摇摇头，拎起书包，沙织则向她和光点头示意，三人一同离开教室，前往领取制服。"你们日本人对于可爱的狂热，真是让人费解。

"Can you pass the soy sauce?"
麻烦递一下酱油，好吗？

Misato prided herself of having an awesome woman's intuition; she instinctively knew when something was wrong; knew when Kaji was lying or when Ritsuko was trying to prank her... she even knew when Asuka was trying to use her things without her permission, or when Pen-Pen was stealing her beer.
真嗣自豪于自己敏锐的女性直觉；她总能本能地察觉到异常；识破加持的谎言，或是律子的小恶作剧……就连明日香未经允许动用她的物品，或是企鹅企鹅偷喝她的啤酒，她都能察觉。

"Did you finish everything?"
你把所有事情都做完了吗？

It truly was a blessing and a curse.
它既是天赐之福，也是祸根。

"Yes, and not thanks to you."
没错，但这与你无关。

So right now, as she ate in silence with her two charges and her pet was busy reading the newspaper, Misato had that weird tingling feeling when things were wrong; at any given moment, in any normal day in the Katsuragi household, dinner would include Shinji cooking. Check. Misato possibly pushing her 8th beer. Check again. Pen-Pen putting her to shame by drinking her under the table AND having a better stock portfolio than her. Also check, thanks for nothing, Nikkei. And it would also have Asuka simultaneously teasing and antagonizing Shinji, which would make Misato actually push past the self imposed 'only 8 during the week' beer rule.
此时，她与两位受监护人以及正埋头读报的宠物在静默中共进晚餐，葛城美里心中涌起一股不祥的预感；在葛城家平常的晚餐中，本应有真嗣下厨的身影。确认。美里可能已喝到第八罐啤酒。再次确认。企鹅 Pen-Pen 不仅在酒量上让她自愧不如，连股票投资组合都比她更胜一筹。同样确认，日经指数，多谢你毫无助力。此外，还应有明日香一边挑逗一边激怒真嗣，这会让美里打破自己设定的“工作日只喝八罐”的啤酒限制。

"-really wanted to help, but Toji had to uh... go to the hospital to check on his sist-"
-本想帮忙，但东司得去医院看看他的妹妹-

And, as Misato masterfully summarized, the last part was NOT checked.
正如 Misato 所精辟指出的，最后一部分并未得到检查。

"Save it, idiot; we actually managed to get more done with you morons out of the way."
留着吧，蠢货；你不在时我们反而效率更高。

That could mean anything: That Shinji had managed to finally grow a spine and tell Asuka off; that Asuka had finally toned down her being a brat and decided to cut Shinji some slack, that both teens were now involved in a secret, deeply committed relationship trying to keep it from her for fear that she would drive them apart, making both Shinji and Asuka be the modern day equivalent of star crossed lovers like the epic story of that guy and that girl...
这可能意味着各种情况：真嗣终于鼓起勇气，对明日香直言不讳；明日香终于收敛了她的任性，决定给真嗣一些宽容；两个青少年现在秘密地、深切地投入了一段关系，试图向她隐瞒，担心她会拆散他们，使得真嗣和明日香成为现代版的命运多舛的恋人，就像那个男孩和那个女孩的史诗故事一样...

"-sides, it's not like Hikari was expecting you losers to actually pull your weight around."
说到底，光本来就没指望你们这些家伙真能帮上忙。

No, not those Italian ones... the ones that became a cash-cow machine spanning countless remakes, movies, musicals, lunchboxes and even a Saturday morning cartoon. Misato thought as her brow furrowed deeper, trying to remember what was the tragic couple she was thinking off. What was their name?
不，不是指那些意大利的……而是那些衍生出无数翻拍作品、电影、音乐剧、午餐盒，甚至还有周六早间动画的摇钱树。Misato 眉头紧锁，竭力回想她脑海中的那对悲剧情侣究竟叫什么名字。

"-can help tomorrow clean up, th-that way you can come home early instead, Asuka."
明天我可以帮忙打扫，这样你就能早点回家了，明日香。

"Why thank you Shinji, this lowly wench thanks you for thinking about her." Asuka said with an over-sugary tone while her face betrayed her actual annoyance, making the boy look away as he tried to do something to get back on the redhead's good side before Misato slammed her hands on the table, propelling herself up, eyes staring straight ahead before the mauve-haired woman spoke.
"真嗣，谢谢你，我这个不起眼的小女子感谢你的关心。" 明日香用过分甜腻的语气说道，脸上却难掩不悦，让男孩尴尬地移开视线，试图做些什么来重新赢得红发女孩的欢心。就在这时，美里猛地拍桌站起，目光坚定地直视前方，随后那位紫发女子开口了。

"Popeye the Sailor and Olive Oyl!"
大力水手波派与奥莉芙！

Shinji and Asuka stared at Misato in confusion while Pen-Pen looked up from the news paper, shook his head and took a sip from his beer before going back to read.
碇真嗣和明日香一脸茫然地看着美里，与此同时，企鹅彭彭从报纸中抬起头，摇摇头，啜了一口啤酒，接着又埋头读报。

"Even your stupid bird thinks you're an idiot Misato." Asuka said flatly as she picked up her plates and walked to the kitchen sink, setting them down and washing them while Misato reacted like the mature woman she was, sticking out her tongue at the redhead while balancing her chair precariously on the two hind legs as she opened her fridge, pulling out two more beers before falling back into place and opening them in a quick, fluid motion, sliding one towards Pen-Pen who accepted it with his flipper but never looked up from the newspaper.
"就连你那笨鸟也觉得你是傻瓜，Misato。" Asuka 语气平淡，边说边拿起盘子走向厨房水槽，放下后开始清洗。Misato 则以成熟女性的姿态回应，对着红发少女吐了吐舌头，同时将椅子危险地倾斜在两条后腿上，打开冰箱取出两罐啤酒，然后迅速流畅地回到原位，打开啤酒，将一罐滑向 Pen-Pen，后者用鳍状肢接住，却始终没从报纸上抬头。

"So what's got her royal highness in such a foul mood?" Misato asked Shinji who opened his mouth before Asuka cut him off.
"到底是什么让这位皇家小姐心情这么差？" 碇真嗣正要回答，却被明日香抢先一步打断了。

"You still have to ask! Thanks to you, now the whole school thinks me and the idiot are dating!"
你还不明白吗？都是因为你，现在全校都误以为我和那个笨蛋在谈恋爱！

"Wh-what!" Shinji managed to squeak out while Misato flashed him a thumbs up, smiling.
"什-什么！" 真嗣结巴着说，美里则向他竖起大拇指，面带微笑。

"Way to go Shin-chan! Getting to be a grown up at such an early age, I'm so proud."
新酱，你真棒！小小年纪就如此成熟，我感到非常自豪。

"You're not supposed to feel proud! You're the reason why people have this stupid idea in the first place!" Asuka shouted as she pointed the spray gun at Misato menacingly. "It's thanks to your stupid prank that I'm in this position!"
你有什么好自豪的！都是因为你，大家才会有这种荒谬的想法！" 明日香怒吼着，用喷枪对准美里，显得咄咄逼人。"全怪你那无聊的恶作剧，我才落到这步田地！

"Well, it's both your fault for looking so cute while sleeping together, all I did was take a few pics for my photo album." Misato answered as she shrugged and took another drink, while still staring at Asuka, knowing full well the irate redhead could fire at her at the slightest provocation, making sure to defuse the situation in the only way Misato was sure that could work.
"哎，谁让你们睡觉时那么惹人爱呢，这可怪不得我。我只是随手拍了几张，留作相册纪念。" 美里边说边耸肩，又抿了一口酒，目光依旧锁定在明日香身上，她清楚这位红发少女脾气火爆，稍有不慎就可能引爆，因此她小心翼翼地用自己认为最有效的方式来平息事态。

"Besides, if you're gonna blame someone, it has to be Shin-chan; he's the one who kissed you."
再说了，真要追究责任，那得怪新君，毕竟是他亲的你。

By presenting a more suitable target.
通过呈现一个更为恰当的目标。

Shinji blinked, at first unsure of what his name being dropped meant, until he began to replay the conversation in his head, slowly realizing Misato had just set him up to be the scapegoat, something all the more obvious as Pen-Pen was nowhere to be found, and Misato was already half way into her room, smiling at Shinji over her shoulder while bringing her hands up at her face in a silent 'I'm sorry' gesture before leaving the poor boy to his fate.
真嗣眨了眨眼，起初没明白自己的名字被提及的含义。直到他开始在脑海中回放对话，才逐渐意识到美里刚把他推出来当替罪羊。随着潘潘不见踪影，美里已半只脚踏入房间，她回头对真嗣微笑，双手在脸前做出无声的“抱歉”手势，然后留下他独自面对这一切，这意图愈发明显。

"She's right you know." Asuka said dispassionately from behind Shinji, making him squeak in surprise before slowly turning over to where the redhead was, silently wondering not if she was gonna punch him, but actually how hard she was going to do it. "This is all your fault; everything! from the fact that I have to live with a stupid pervert like you to the fact that you stole my first kiss!"
她说的没错。" 明日香冷冷地从真嗣背后冒出这句话，吓得他惊叫一声，随后缓缓转头望向那位红发少女，心中暗自揣测的不是她是否会出手，而是她会下多重的手。"这一切都是你的错，从我被迫与一个像你这样的蠢货同居，到你夺走了我的初吻！

"I didn't mean to!" Shinji said hurriedly as she tried to get up, only to feel Asuka putting her hand on his shoulder, squeezing it, as her nails began to dig into the tender flesh, making him shut his eyes tightly, talking in quick, rushed sentences. "Be-besides, I..."
我不是故意的！" 真嗣急忙说着，正要起身，却被明日香按住肩膀，她的手指紧抓着，指甲刺入肌肤，让他不由得闭紧双眼，急促地连声道："再说，我……

"You what?" Asuka spoke in a low, dangerous hiss.
"你说什么？" 明日香压低声音，语气中透露出危险的气息。

Shinji stopped, looking up and staring into Asuka's eyes, before Kensuke's words came back at him, feeling them surge inside; he was right... even if Shinji didn't like confrontation, the time had come to tell Asuka to stop picking on him.
真嗣停下脚步，抬头直视明日香的眼睛，健介的话再次在心中回响，感觉它们在内心涌动；他是对的...尽管真嗣不喜欢冲突，但现在是时候让明日香停止欺负他了。

"And besides, you seemed to like it! You were moaning and grabbing my face! You're the one thinking more about that stupid kiss that I am!" Shinji said loudly in the otherwise silent apartment, and for a moment both teens could swear there had been a small, low sliding sound, alike when someone tries to push something to the side very, very slowly for fear of being caught, which made them both look in synchronicity towards where Misato's room was.
"再说，你明明很享受！你呻吟着，紧抓我的脸！你比我还在意那个愚蠢的吻！" 碇真嗣在一片寂静的公寓中大声说道。那一刻，两人都确信听到了轻微的滑动声，仿佛有人因害怕被发现而极慢地推动某物，这让他们不约而同地望向了美里的房间。

The small crack that had been visible a moment ago was closed quickly with a loud snap.
刚才还清晰可见的小裂缝，在一声清脆的响声中迅速闭合。

"I do not!" Asuka roared angrily, making Shinji falter for a bit but never backing down, instead, the boy stood his ground and stared down at the redhead, slowly the normally melancholic look that seemed to be forever etched in his face turning into an angry glare.
"我绝不！" 明日香怒吼着，令真嗣一时动摇，然而他并未退让，反而坚定地站立，俯视着红发少女，他脸上那惯常的忧郁神情逐渐转为愤怒的凝视。

Asuka knew it wasn't very common to see Shinji angry, and right now, it was obvious how angry the boy was.
明日香清楚，真嗣生气的情况并不多见，此刻，男孩的怒气显而易见。

"What did you mean by that!" Shinji asked, standing in front of her, the kitchen table separating them both while they glared at each other; Shinji was panting, breathing hard, mostly from speaking in a loud tone, as if he wasn't used to exerting this much energy, content with staying quiet instead while Asuka glared at him, fists clenched tightly, trembling even, from the force.
"你那话到底什么意思！" 真嗣站在她面前质问，厨房的桌子成了两人的分界线，彼此怒目而视；真嗣喘着粗气，显然是因为提高了嗓门，他似乎不习惯如此耗费精力，更愿意保持沉默，而明日香则紧握双拳，怒视着他，因愤怒而全身颤抖。

"Exactly what I said, you idiot! I am not thinking about that kiss as much as you'd like to think!"
我说的没错，你这傻瓜！我可不像你想的那样，对那个吻念念不忘！

"You've been bringing it up every chance you have!" Shinji said in disbelief. "It's like every time you see me, you think about that kiss!"
你一有机会就提这事！" 真嗣难以置信地说。"仿佛每次见到我，你都会想起那个吻似的！

"If I think about it, it's because you essentially raped me and stole my first kiss!" The redhead countered, raising her voice and succeeding in making the boy falter a bit, smirking victoriously before Shinji grimaced, looking away angrily after casting a furious look at Asuka.
"如果我深思，那是因为你实质上侵犯了我，夺走了我的初吻！"红发女孩反驳道，提高嗓门，成功让男孩有些退缩，她得意地笑了笑，随后真嗣皱眉，怒视明日香一眼后愤然转头。

"Who cares about your stupid kiss? It was an accident, so let it go already."
谁在乎你那无心的吻？既然是意外，就别再纠结了。

Asuka's mouth was open, her eyes stared straight ahead, but she was in shock, thoughts flaring angrily, thinking How dare he? How dare he say that about my first kiss! Of course IT matters!Heshould care! He took it from me!
明日香嘴巴微张，目光直直地盯着前方，内心却震惊不已，怒火中烧地想着：他怎么敢这样？竟敢轻视我的初吻！这当然重要！他本应珍视！是他夺走了我的初吻！

But all she could do was watch as Shinji walked away angrily from her, before he slid his own door angrily behind him.
她无能为力，只能目睹真嗣怒气冲冲地离开，紧接着他重重地关上了自己的房门。

"Third... don't you da- Hey! I'm talking to you!"
第三名...你别走-喂！我在跟你说话呢！

And in the silence and loneliness of the apartment at night, Asuka Langley Soryu vowed she'd get even at the idiot tomorrow, no matter what.
夜深人静，公寓里一片孤寂，惣流·明日香·兰格雷暗自发誓，无论如何明天都要找那个蠢货算账。

"Wow! This looks amazing!"
哇！真是太惊艳了！

Shinji looked first to his left and then to via right, scanning the raves of those around him.
真嗣先是向左一瞥，随即转向右边，仔细观察周围人的表情。

"Hey! Check that booth out! The girls are dressed as cave women!"
嘿！快看那个摊位！女孩们装扮成了原始时代的女性！

Quickly, he did a half-turn to look behind him, careful to cover all the possible angles and making sure Asuka wasn't trying to sneak past his blind spot before looking at Toji who let out a wolf whistle, low and full of appreciation at the girls in question while Kensuke kept recording everything and anything, making some of the boys smile and group together for a picture, the girls striking a pose while the boys did the same.
他迅速半转身，目光扫过所有可能的死角，确保 Asuka 没有趁机溜过他的视线盲区。这时，Toji 对那群女孩吹了一声低沉而充满欣赏的口哨，而 Kensuke 则继续用镜头捕捉每一个瞬间，引得几个男孩笑着聚拢，准备合影。女孩们摆好姿势，男孩们也跟着摆出同样的造型。

"She reminds me of Lum."
她让我想起了 Lum。

Both Shinji and Toji turned to give Keusuke a look while before they kept walking across the courtyard with the rest of the people attending, pointing and going from one booth to the other, bumping elbows with other children around their same age or older; some of them dressed still in their uniforms, some of them already changed into their street clothes while Shinji kept staring from side to side ever so often.
新二和东治同时向惠介投去一瞥，随后继续与众人一同穿行于庭院中，时而指向各个摊位，时而与其他同龄或年长的孩子擦肩而过；有的孩子仍穿着校服，有的则已换上便装，而新二则不时地左右顾盼。

"Yo, Shinji! Would ya stop doing that? You're getting on my nerves."
喂，真嗣！别再那样做了行吗？你快让我受不了了。

Until Toji asked him very nicely to stop.
直到东儿非常客气地请他停止。

"I'm sorry." Shinji mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck while looking away. "It's just that when I woke up today I was making breakfast and Asuka left early and she said that she was gonna get even about the whole kiss thing."
对不起。" 真嗣低声说着，一边揉着脖子一边把目光移开。"今天早上我起床做早餐时，明日香已经先走了，她说要就那次亲吻的事情跟我算账。

"She's still going on about that?" Kensuke asked absently as he turned from one booth to another, focusing on the short skirts the girls were wearing While Toji places his arm around Shinji's shoulder.
"她还在念叨那件事吗？" 健介漫不经心地问着，目光从一个摊位游移到另一个，却始终停留在女孩们的短裙上，与此同时，东治把手搭在了真嗣的肩上。

"Look Shin-man... if we see the red devil come, we'll tell you so you can make a quick exit." Toji said reassuringly as he patted Shinji with gusto, smiling widely at him. "Besides, knowing her, she's probably terrorizing the other students in our class."
瞧，真嗣...一旦红魔出现，我们会通知你，好让你赶紧撤。" 东治边说边用力拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，对他露出宽慰的笑容。"依我看，她八成又在班上吓唬其他同学了。

"Yeah." Kensuke chimed in, finally looking away from his camera. "I was there when they were about to dress up for the cafe theme and she turned to me and kicked me out of the room saying I wanted to tape them in their underwear."
对。" 健介接过话茬，目光终于从相机上移开。"当时她们正要换装去咖啡馆主题，她突然转向我，把我轰出房间，说我想要偷拍她们换内衣。

"She knows you so well..." Toji said as Kensuke focused his camera on a group of girls as some of them giggled and flashed him a peace sign while the others hid behind them in embarrassment. "Speaking of which, I heard there's some hot chicks from some other school visiting."
她对你真是了如指掌……" 东二说着，健介正将相机对准一群女生，几个女生咯咯笑着向他比出和平手势，其他人则害羞地躲在她们后面。"对了，听说还有其他学校的美女来访呢。

"Yeah? What school?" Kensuke asked not really paying attention as he noticed one of the girls, a black haired one, kept staring, brushing and hiding her face every time Kensuke would even turn towards her, which made the sandy-haired boy blush as well.
"哦？哪所学校的？"健介随口问道，心思却不在对话上，因为他察觉到一位黑发女孩频频投来目光，每当他转头望去，她便慌忙撩发掩面，这番举动也让健介不由得脸颊泛红。

"I dunno; they're wearing those checkered skirts and sweaters vests." Toji answered, oblivious to the fact those were the girls Kensuke was recording as his eyes laid on a delicious set of chicken skewers, licking his lips and savoring the smell before approaching the spot to buy some.
"我不太清楚；他们穿着格子裙和毛衣背心。" Toji 回答，并未察觉那些正是 Kensuke 正在录制的女孩们。他的目光被一串香气扑鼻的鸡肉串吸引，不禁舔了舔嘴唇，随后走向摊位准备购买。

"Maybe we should go to the classroom and see how the girls are doing." Shinji said with as much conviction as he could; it didn't bug him that there were a lot of people as none of them were paying any attention to him, but he felt bad about being outside enjoying himself while Rei and Hikari and Asuka were inside, cooped up and working hard.
"或许我们该去教室瞧瞧，看看女孩们情况如何。" 碇真嗣尽力表现出坚定；他并不在意周围人多，毕竟没人关注他，但他为自己在外享受而感到愧疚，因为绫波、光和明日香还在室内埋头苦干。

Besides, truth be told, Shinji was also curious about what was the theme the girls had chosen, and he hadn't been able to see the uniform yesterday and early today since Asuka gad left before he was even ready, but she did tell him to look out for himself, saying ominously to Shinji he should look forward to today .
其实，真嗣对女孩们选定的主题也颇为好奇，由于明日香在他准备妥当前就已离开，他昨天和今早都未能一睹制服的风采。不过，明日香临走前神秘兮兮地叮嘱他，让他对今天充满期待。

"Whatever, if they needed us I'm sure the class rep would have already sent someone after us." Toji pointed out as he busied himself chewing the chicken pieces in his bamboo stick while Kensuke tried hard not to make a fool out of himself while attempting to muster the courage to go and talk to the mysterious girl in question before he began to slowly walk towards the group of girls, as Shinji and Toji stared half smiling, half amazed and completely silent, watching in the distance.
"无论如何，若他们真需要我们，班长想必早该派人来了。" 东治边嚼着竹签上的鸡肉边说道。此时，健介正努力保持镇定，鼓足勇气准备去接近那位神秘女孩。他缓缓走向那群女生，而真嗣和东治则半是微笑半是惊讶，一言不发地在远处注视着。

Whatever Kensuke had said, it had made the girl nod quickly but the blush never left her face and when she spoke, she did in low tones, judging by the way the girls around them both were trying hard to hear while appearing to be doing something else before both Kensuke and the dark-haired, bespectacled girl left on their own to look around while the girls stated at the departing couple for a few seconds before all of them began to squee and giggle, even though more than one had a look of envy in their face.
健介的话让女孩迅速点头，但脸上的红晕一直未消。她说话声音很低，周围的女孩子们虽然装作忙碌，却都在努力偷听。当健介和那位黑发戴眼镜的女孩离开去逛时，其他女孩盯着他们的背影几秒，接着便开始尖叫和窃笑，尽管不少人脸上流露出羡慕之情。

"Did Kensuke just managed to get a date?" Toji said after a moment while Shinji simply nodded, still not entirely sure of what had just happened as both boys kept staring at the group of girls; one in particular catching both their, as well as several other boys, eyes.
"Kensuke 是不是刚约到人了？" Toji 片刻后问道，Shinji 只是点头，对刚才发生的事情仍感困惑。两人继续注视着那群女生，其中一位特别吸引了他们，以及周围几个男生的目光。

She seemed to be completely aloof, and would instead look every now and then towards where both boys were, and every time Shinji would gaze at this girl she'd smirk, as if knowing he was staring.
她显得异常淡漠，时不时地朝两个男孩所在之处瞥去，每当碇真嗣的目光落在她身上，她便露出得意的笑容，仿佛早已察觉到他的凝视。

To be honest, it was hard no to; she was tall and slender, with auburn hair done into a pair of long ponytails that dangled from the back of the base of her neck.
说实话，她实在引人注目：高挑而苗条，一头赤褐色的秀发扎成两条长马尾，从后颈处垂落。

Out of all the girls in her group she was the only one who wasn't wearing the red school blazer every other girl was wearing, instead showing of the crisp white shirt that had the school crest emblazoned on the breast pocket.
在她的团队里，她是唯一一个没穿红色校服外套的女孩，其他人都穿着。她选择展示的是一件胸前口袋上绣有校徽的笔挺白衬衫。

"Whoa." 哇塞。

Shinji wasn't sure who said that, Toji or someone else, but he nodded none the less; she wasn't the cutest from the group, and she seemed to be out of place as with the other girls, but there was something about her that seemed to make everyone around her stare.
真嗣没弄清楚那话是东治还是别人说的，不过他还是点了点头；她并非团队里最可爱的，看起来也与其他女孩不太合群，但就是有种说不出的魅力，让周围的人都不由自主地看向她。

Maybe it was the way her thigh-high stockings didn't seem to cover all of her legs; her skirt was obviously shortened, probably about 5 or 7 inches above her knee and her dark brown stockings seemed to stop several inches short below the edge of her skirt, with just barely enough exposed skin in such an absolutely minimal space it made every single guy stare.
可能是她那及大腿的丝袜未能完全覆盖双腿；短裙显然被改短，离膝盖约有 5 至 7 英寸，深棕色丝袜在裙摆下几英寸处便不再延伸，仅在极小的空间内露出些许肌肤，引得每个男生都目不转睛。

For some reason, this girl had turned, catching Shinji's wandering eyes, smirking once more in such a way that when Shinji looked up to realize he had been caught, it reminded the boy of Misato; a kind of 'come-hither' look in her eyes that made the smirk all the more enticing and alluring.
不知何故，这女孩转过身，恰好捕捉到真嗣游移的目光，再次露出那种狡黠的微笑。当真嗣抬头发现自己的目光被逮个正着时，那眼神让他想起了美里，眼中流露出一种“过来”的诱惑，使得那微笑愈发迷人，充满吸引力。

"Shinji? I think you just hit the jackpot."
真嗣？看来你真是走运了。

And now, the smirking girl was coming this way, locking eyes on him while Toji's words and voice echoed faintly and distantly, as if he had been speaking miles away and from the other side of a tunnel; all Shinji could see was this mysterious, alluring girl, noticing new things from her with ever single step she took towards him, passing him and throwing him a sideway glance before she walked inside the school.
此时，那位面带微笑的女孩正朝他走来，目光紧紧锁定在他身上。东治的话语和声音显得微弱而遥远，仿佛他在数英里之外、隧道另一端说话；真嗣眼中只有这位神秘迷人的女孩，她每迈出一步，他都能从她身上发现新的细节，经过他时投以一瞥，随后步入校园。

"Hey! You two! Stop slacking around and bring in some more soba noddles!"
嘿，你们俩别闲着了，快去拿些荞麦面条进来！

Hikari wasn't having a good time.
光并没有玩得开心。

"Katsuko! Go and tell Idane that we need to use 2 more brakers to cook."
加津子！去跟伊丹说一声，我们烹饪还需要再增加两个断路器。

Herding a number of students and making them do what they're supposed to be doing was tiring, and so was having to split her time between minding her classrooms, walking through the halls and checking on her section and on top of that making sure everyone in their student cafe pulled their weight.
管理一群学生，确保他们各司其职，本就费神；再加上要在照看教室、巡视走廊、检查负责区域以及监督学生咖啡厅的运营之间来回奔波，更是让人筋疲力尽。

"Class Representative Horaki?"
班级代表是堀崎吗？

As well as having to deal with the students themselves.
还需直接面对学生。

"Yes Rei?" 怎么了，零？

"Do I need to dress like this?" Rei pointed out to the school girl outfit that Hikari had given her, a slight, almost imperceptible frown marrying her face.
"我必须穿成这样吗？" 蕾指向光给她的校服，脸上掠过一丝难以察觉的不悦。

"Yes, Rei." Hikari said hurriedly as she turned around, looking for a certain redhead who was supposed to be in charge while she was out. "Everyone from the class agreed to wear that uniform."
是的，丽。"光急忙转身，寻找那位本应在她不在时负责的红发女孩。"班上所有人都同意换上那套制服。

"I did not agreed." Rei pointed out softly.
"我并没有同意。" Rei 轻声指出。

"You never spoke up, in fact, you left and said it was irrelevant or something, so those who don't speak up, agree by default." Hikari answered back before looking at Rei and frowning, noticing she wasn't wearing the wig or headpiece she had been assigned to wear. "Hey that wasn't the headpiece that was given to you."
你一直没表态，甚至直接走了，还说什么这事无关紧要之类的，所以那些沉默的人，默认就是赞同了。" Hikari 回应后，瞥见 Rei 并未佩戴指定的假发或头饰，眉头一皱，"喂，那不是给你的头饰啊。

"I exchanged it with Aragaki." Rei said, standing in front of Hikari perfectly straight, perfectly still, not a single muscle moving as if she were living statue.
"我与 Aragaki 进行了交换。" Rei 说道，她站在 Hikari 面前，身姿笔挺，纹丝不动，仿佛一尊栩栩如生的雕像。

"I don't have time for this now... where's Asuka?" Hikari grumbled as she rubbed her forehead, pinching the bridge of her nose for what felt like the 100th time today.
"我现在实在没空应付这个...飞鸟去哪儿了？" 光嘟囔着，一边揉着额头，今天不知已是第几次捏着鼻梁了。

"Soryu left after saying she needed to go and pay back Ikari for what he did to her." Rei answered impassively as she played around with the tie she was supposed to wear, unsure of how to make a proper Windsor knot, while Hikari was checking how many water bottles, noodle packs and other supplies were still left, before she blinked and rose up, Rei's words finally registering in her mind, before she turned to Rei while trying to keep a calm face as the reality of what was going to happen hit her.
Soryu 离开时表示，她必须去偿还 Ikari 对她所做的一切。Rei 面无表情地回应，同时摆弄着本应佩戴的领带，对于如何打出一个标准的温莎结感到困惑。与此同时，Hikari 正在清点剩余的水瓶、方便面和其他物资。她眨了眨眼，站起身来，Rei 的话终于在她的心中引起了共鸣。她转向 Rei，努力维持镇定的表情，因为即将发生的事情的现实感猛然袭来。

Asuka had gone to try and get even with Shinji.
明日香去找真嗣，试图与他一较高下。

Which could only mean that the redhead in question was gonna cause a huge scene, and that could mean that Hikari would be blamed for not maintaining order.
这只能说明，那位红发当事人即将掀起一场轩然大波，而光可能会因此被指责未能维持秩序。

And that was exactly the kind of situation that Hikari would never allow to happen; such a huge blow to her ego, and to her standing as class representative demanded her to take matters into her own hands.
那恰恰是光所不能容忍的局面；这般重创自尊与班长地位的打击，使她不得不亲自介入处理。

"Rei! We need to find ourselves a redhead." Hikari said as re-arranged her wig, grabbing Rei's hands and marching outside of the room. "You go look for her down the south wing, I'll look for her on the north wing and we'll meet outside by the big cherry tree, got it?"
Rei！我们得找个红发女孩。" 光一边调整着假发，一边拉着 Rei 的手，快步走出房间。"你去南边找，我去北边找，最后在大樱桃树下碰头，清楚了吗？

"You need to lighten up, Shin... I mean, Kensuke managed to pick up a girl here. I'm sure that if you wanted to, you could pick up her friend, the cute one with glasses." Toji pointed out as if was the simplest answer while he and Shinji continued to walk from one both to the other to which Shinji only blushed.
"真嗣，你得放松些。看，健介都能在这儿找到女朋友。你要是愿意，肯定也能追到她那位戴眼镜的可爱朋友。" 东治边说边和真嗣继续逛着摊位，而真嗣只是脸颊泛红。

"I'm not good with girls." Shinji answered back with as much conviction as he could, while still trying to be on the lookout of Asuka, to which Toji simply shook his head.
"我不太会和女孩子相处。" 真嗣尽量坚定地回应，同时不忘留意明日香的反应，而东治对此只是摇了摇头。

"You'll never know unless you try, man... next time we see that glasses chick, you go up to her and ask her out or something..."
不试试怎么知道呢，兄弟...下次再碰到那位戴眼镜的姑娘，你就大胆上前，约她出去或者聊聊天...

Shinji opened his mouth before he stopped walking in the middle of the quad, muttering something under his breath, making Toji look up and see in the distance the familiar shapes and hair styles, even from behind: Asuka's red hair a stark contrast to the normal shade of dark brown and black around her, still made in those peculiar twin tails of her, the tufts of red hair sticking out while next to her Rei stood with her usual short, page-boy cut and icy blue hair, also sticking out.
真嗣停下脚步，在校园中央喃喃自语，这使得东治抬头远望，即便只是背影，那些熟悉的身影和发型也清晰可辨：明日香那醒目的红发，在周围普遍的深棕色和黑色中脱颖而出，依旧是她标志性的双马尾，红发丝丝翘起；而她旁边的绫波，则保持着她那短齐的波波头，冰蓝色的发丝同样显眼。

Then it dawned on Toji. The best way to keep Shinji safe was to keep Asuka off him, and to do that, he would have to run some interception.
随后，东治恍然大悟。确保真嗣安全最有效的办法是让明日香远离他，为此，他需要采取一些拦截措施。

"Ok, Shinji, get inside and go to the roof, I'll make sure the devil follows me and I'll keep her busy." Toji said as he pushed Shinji inside of the school while keeping an eye on Asuka and Rei who were still looking around; while he had no clue what Rei was doing here, Toji could imagine the reason why Asuka was: to terrorize his friend some more.
"好的，真嗣，快进学校，直奔楼顶。我会引那个恶魔跟着我，并设法拖住她。" 东治一边说着，一边把真嗣推进校门，同时警惕地观察着还在四处搜寻的明日香和零；尽管他不了解零的来意，但能猜到明日香的目的：无非是想继续恐吓他的朋友。

And it was up to Toji to do something.
是东治该采取行动的时候了。

"Hey, devil! I heard you're looking for Shinji." Toji said as he pushed his way through the sea of people, advancing onto where both female pilots, grabbing Asuka's shoulder and pulling hard to get her attention in what, he now realized, was probably the stupidest, most suicidal move he could have done while Rei turned and stared at him with her red eyes, open and impenetrable at the same time.
"嘿，恶魔！听说你在找真嗣。" 东治一边喊着，一边挤过人群，向两位女驾驶员靠近。他猛地抓住明日香的肩膀，试图吸引她的注意，这时他才意识到，这可能是他做过的最鲁莽、最危险的举动。与此同时，绫波转过身来，用她那深邃的红眼睛凝视着他，眼神既清澈又难以捉摸。

And Toji could almost swear he saw Rei sport a small, minuscule smile on her lips.
东治几乎可以肯定，他瞥见了绫波唇边那抹几乎难以察觉的微笑。

Shinji blinked as he opened the door to the roof, closing it behind him and letting the sounds of the people inside die before he looked around, sighing; he had always liked to hang out in the rooftop since it was reasonably quiet, and not a lot of people seemed to come in here, so it had become the default hideout for Shinji, Toji and Kensuke.
真嗣眨了眨眼，推开通往屋顶的门，随后轻轻关上，隔绝了室内人群的喧嚣。他环视四周，轻叹一声；屋顶向来是他钟爱的去处，宁静而不受打扰，自然而然地成了真嗣、东治和健介的秘密基地。

"Why does she have to be so... like that?" Shinji wondered loudly to himself as he walked towards the rail to look at the quad, dragging his feet and hearing the crunching sounds they made as the soles scraped against the gravel of the floor, resting his arms on the hand rail and looking down, frowning as he tried to locate Asuka.
"她为何非得那样呢？" 真嗣自言自语，拖着沉重的步伐走向栏杆，俯瞰广场。他听着鞋底与碎石摩擦的声响，双手搭在栏杆上，眉头紧锁，努力在人群中寻找明日香的身影。

Because truthfully, he couldn't understand why she had to make such a huge deal out of this; he hadn't even decided to kiss the redhead; sure, once Shinji had realized what had happened, the kiss had been kind of nice, and Asuka did have kissable lips and the way she had began to gently suckle on Shinji's lower lip had been really, really, nice.
说实话，他不明白她为何对此反应过激；他甚至还没决定是否要吻那个红发女孩。不过，当碇真嗣意识到那个吻时，确实感觉不错，明日香的嘴唇确实诱人，她轻柔地吮吸他的下唇，那感觉真的很美妙。

Plus she is kind of cute. Shinji thought as he sighed closing his eyes and rubbing his head, easing down his bangs before blowing them off from his face as he continued to brood.
她还有几分可爱，真嗣这么想着，叹了口气，闭上眼，揉了揉额头，轻轻拨开遮住视线的刘海，吹走脸上的发丝，继续沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"I just wish..." 我只是希望...

Shinji sighed before casting one last glance at all the people underneath, noticing the familiar tracksuited figure of Toji as he stood in front of Asuka and Rei, before Toji looked up towards him and Shinji heard the sound of the door opening and closing again forcing him to turn around and noticing it was that strange girl who was holding the door closed, her back turned towards Shinji, panting hard as if she had ran before taking out a phone from inside her blazer.
真嗣叹息一声，最后环顾四周，看见穿着运动服的东治站在明日香和绫波面前。东治抬头望向真嗣，此时真嗣听到门再次开关的声音，转身一看，原来是那个神秘女孩正用背顶着门，她喘着粗气，似乎刚跑完步，随即从西装外套中取出手机。

"Yeah, it's me." The girl spoke on the phone in English too quickly for Shinji to understand but bits and pieces of the conversation itself; something about being here, that she had already gotten permission, that she would be back soon.
"对，是我。"女孩在电话中用英语快速交谈，新二难以完全理解，只断断续续听到一些内容；大概是她已经在此，已得到许可，不久便会返回。

Shinji simply stared quietly at her, letting her voice fill in the silence before Shinji decided to leave the roof, knowing full well that being around this girl would probably be like being around any other girl: awkward, and weird, and would lead to him being tongue tied and maybe tripping on his own feet and making an ass out of himself.
真嗣静静地凝视着她，任由她的声音填补沉默，随后决定离开屋顶。他清楚，与这位女孩相处恐怕和其他女孩无异：尴尬、别扭，自己会语无伦次，甚至可能绊倒，出尽洋相。

"Alright, see you soon." The girl said before she finished her conversation and shut her phone closed, taking off her glasses and rubbing her eyes tiredly, turning halfway towards Shinji just as the boy was walking next to her and about to ask politely for her to let him pass, both crashing down, Shinji landing on his ass and the girl losing her grip on her glasses.
"好的，待会儿见。"女孩说完便结束了通话，合上手机，疲惫地摘下眼镜揉了揉眼睛。就在她转身面向新二时，男孩正礼貌地请求她让路，两人不慎相撞，新二跌坐在地，女孩的眼镜也脱手而出。

"Ack! My glasses!" 哎呀！我的眼镜！

Shinji groaned as he looked up, staring at the girl as she tried to grab her glasses which had somehow ended underneath one of the ceiling fans, unwillingly giving Shinji a nice look of her butt , wiggling it as she tried over and over to reach them before finally achieving victory, putting them on and straightening her back, looking at Shinji out of the corner of her eyes as the boy remained quiet, staring at this strange girl, noticing her lips moving which made him blink quickly, finally registering she was asking him something.
真嗣呻吟着抬头，目光紧随那女孩，她正努力从吊扇下取回不知怎么滑落的眼镜。她一次次尝试，臀部随之摆动，无意中让真嗣瞥见了这一幕。最终，她成功戴上眼镜，挺直了腰杆，用眼角余光瞥向真嗣。男孩沉默地注视着这个陌生的女孩，注意到她嘴唇微动，这才恍然大悟，原来她在向他提问。

"Huh? What?" 啊？什么？

The girl looked at Shinji as is he had asked a question that was supremely 'stupid', staring at him through her glasses before she let out a sigh and shook her head.
女孩透过眼镜凝视着真嗣，似乎在暗示他问了一个非常愚蠢的问题，随后叹息一声，摇了摇头。

"I said don't you watch where you're going?" The girl asked again as she dusted herself, staring at Shinji who still stared up at her, too shocked to say or do something until the girl rolled her eyes and gave Shinji her hand.
"我不是说了让你看路吗？"女孩一边掸着身上的尘土，一边再次质问，目光紧锁在依旧愣愣地盯着她的真嗣身上。直到她不耐烦地翻了个白眼，向真嗣伸出手，他才从震惊中缓过神来，一时无言以对。

Shinji stared at it curiously, staring up at the girl and then down again, taking her in and noticing all of her: how her short-sleeved shirt fitted her frame perfectly, even somewhat tightly around her chest, the top buttons undone, letting her green tie fall casually; how her hair was kept back by a blue headband that had a couple of white berets almost on top of her ears and how her clear, bright blue eyes confined behind red-framed glasses, her lips curled into a mischievous, tantalizing little smirk.
真嗣好奇地凝视着她，目光从女孩的脸庞移至下方，又再次上移，细细观察：她身着短袖衬衫，紧贴身形，尤其胸部略显紧绷，最上面的扣子敞开，绿色领带随意垂落；她的秀发被蓝色发带束起，发带上点缀着几顶白色贝雷帽，几乎贴在耳际，透过红色镜框眼镜，可见她那双清澈明亮的蓝眼睛，嘴角勾起一抹俏皮而迷人的微笑。

Before he finally took her hand and the girl pulled him up.
最终，他握住了她的手，女孩用力将他拉了起来。

"Ugh! You're kind of heavy." She said pointedly before she walked to the hand rail and stared at the people there with a small smile playing in her lips while Shinji simply stared before he finally got the courage to speak up.
"哎呀！你还真有点重呢。"她直言后，走向扶手，嘴角微扬，含笑观察着那里的人们，而真嗣愣了一会儿，才鼓起勇气开口。

"You're that girl... the one I saw earlier."
你就是那个女孩吧...我之前见过的。

"Huh? What?" She asked, blinking before staring at Shinji who cautiously placed a hand on the rail.
"啊？什么？"她眨眼问道，目光紧随着小心翼翼扶住栏杆的真嗣。

"My friend... he asked your friend out?" Shinji said cautiously, slowly. "You know... glasses, sandy hair, freckles?"
我朋友...他是不是向你朋友表白了？" 碇真嗣谨慎地问道，语速缓慢。"就是那个...戴眼镜，头发沙色，脸上有雀斑的？

The girl remained quiet for a few seconds, narrowing her eyes at Shinji, as if trying to place his face before she looked up, index finger placed against her cheek.
女孩静默片刻，眯眼凝视着真嗣，仿佛在脑海中搜寻他的面孔，随后她抬起头，食指轻放在脸颊上。

"Hmm... oh right! The geek who asked Mayu out!" She said before turning to Shinji, giving him a smirk not saying anything, and making Shinji feel like he should do something.
"哦，想起来了！就是那个向真由告白的怪人！" 她转向新二，露出一抹坏笑，一言不发，却让新二感到自己得有所行动。

"Uh... I-I'm Shinji." 呃...我，我是真嗣。

The girl blinked, processing this before her smirk widened and she stood up, extending her hand.
女孩眨了眨眼，思索片刻后，嘴角的笑意更浓，她站起身，伸出手来。

"Mari... Mari Makinami." 玛丽... 真希波·玛丽。

"Makinami?" Shinji repeated, letting the syllables roll in his mouth before he let out a small laugh. "That sounds like a friend's last name."
Makinami?" 真嗣重复着，让这个名字在舌尖上打转，随后微微一笑。"听起来真像某位朋友的姓呢。

"Oh really? Is your friend by any chance really pale, with blue hair, red eyes and talks in a monotone?"
哦，真的吗？你的朋友是不是脸色特别苍白，有着蓝色的头发和红色的眼睛，说话语气单调？

"Y-yes, she is, why?" 是的，她就是，有什么问题吗？

"Look over there…" Mari said with a wide smile as she pointed out to a place near the big, imposing cherry tree in the quad.
"看那边…"玛丽笑着说，同时指向广场上那棵高大醒目的樱桃树旁。

From here, it was almost as if Asuka was berating Toji, while Rei simply stared impassibly while Toji seemed to be at loss for words, trying to defend himself while pointing at Asuka, then at Rei then back at Asuka and then towards the general direction of the school roof.
从这里望去，阿苏卡似乎在严厉指责东治，丽则面无表情地旁观，东治显得语塞，努力辩解，他先是手指阿苏卡，接着指向丽，又转回阿苏卡，最后指向学校屋顶的方向。

"Seems like she's in the middle of a boyfriend/girlfriend fight." Mari said cheekily, and for some reason that made Shinji frown; while he had never thought of them that way, the idea of Toji and Asuka being boyfriend and girlfriend didn't sit well on him, making his stomach churn, feeling the back of his throat burn, and his stomach tighten at its pit, as if someone had punched him there, taking his breath away.
"她似乎正卷入一场男女朋友间的争执。"玛丽调皮地说道，不知为何这令真嗣皱起了眉头；虽然他从未将他们视为情侣，但想到东治和明日香是男女朋友，他心里就感到一阵不适，胃里翻腾，喉咙后部发热，胃底紧缩，仿佛被人猛击一拳，让他几乎窒息。

"Th-they're not... Toji hates her." Shinji said softly, making Mari stare at him and then at the couple, sporting a knowing smirk, before she opened her mouth to say something but Shinji wasn't listening; instead he was staring straight at them both, knuckles turning white as he grabbed onto the rail with such force the muscles in his arms were straining, and trembling, making Mari blink and turn to where he was staring.
"他们其实...东治并不喜欢她。" 真嗣低声说道，真理先是看了他一眼，随后望向那对情侣，嘴角勾起一抹会心的笑意，正欲开口，却发现真嗣并未留意自己；他目光紧锁着那两人，双手紧抓栏杆，指节因用力而泛白，手臂肌肉紧绷至颤抖，真理见状，不由得眨眼，顺着他的视线望去。

That was when she noticed that the tall, brown-haired boy had been grabbed by the redhead; Asuka's hands were cupping Toji's face steadily before she leaned forth and planted her lips on his, kissing him firmly as he slowly began to kiss the redhead back, his arms slowly circling her waist, not letting her get away as onlookers stopped and looked at this, some of them cheering, some of them with their mouth agape, and others looking away in embarrassment.
就在那一刻，她察觉到那个高挑的棕发男孩被红发女孩紧紧抓住；明日香双手稳稳地托着东二的面部，随即倾身向前，将自己的唇坚定地印在他的唇上，他亦逐渐开始回应红发女孩的吻，双臂缓缓环绕她的腰肢，不让她有丝毫退却。旁观的人群纷纷驻足，有的鼓掌欢呼，有的惊讶得合不拢嘴，还有的则尴尬地别过头去。

And all the while, Rei kept staring at them both, unblinking and without betraying any emotion on her face before she looked in the distance towards the roof, noting the figures there, as one slowly slid down the rail, and it almost seemed as if the figure's shoulders began to shake to a somewhat rushed tempo.
在此期间，丽一直目不转睛地盯着他们，面无表情，随后她将目光投向远方的屋顶，留意到那里的几个人影，其中一人正沿着栏杆缓缓下滑，那人的肩膀仿佛随着一阵急促的节奏开始颤抖。

"So... you kissed her by accident, and when she said you had stolen her first kiss, you said it wasn't that big a deal, but now that she kissed someone else, you suddenly feel she... what?" Mari stopped before she looked at Shinji, frowning. "She cheated on you?"
那么...你意外吻了她，她指责你夺走了她的初吻，你却认为这没什么大不了的，可如今她吻了别人，你突然感觉她...怎么了？" Mari 顿了顿，看向 Shinji，眉头紧锁。"她这是背叛你了吗？

They had been sitting there for so long, Shinji felt his legs and his butt were numbed and cramped, and Mari was now standing up and leaning against the rail, staring at him while Shinji simply kept staring at the floor, as if something fascinating was there, even if the only thing he could see over and over was the moment Toji and Asuka were together, kissing.
他们久坐之后，真嗣觉得双腿和臀部都麻木且抽筋，玛丽此时已起身倚靠在栏杆上，目光紧盯着他。而真嗣依旧凝视着地板，仿佛那里藏着什么引人入胜的秘密，尽管他脑海中不断浮现的，只是东治和明日香亲吻的画面。

While all that he could do was watch from afar.
他只能远远地看着，无能为力。

After a few minutes of silence, and once she had realized Shinji wasn't going to say much more, Mari let out a frustrated sigh.
沉默了几分钟后，玛丽意识到真嗣不会再多言，便发出了一声沮丧的叹息。

"Well, this has all been really interesting but I really have to get going." Mari said as she pushed herself away from the rail and looked at Shinji who simply remained there, immovable and silent, just like he had before.
"嗯，这一切确实挺有意思的，不过我得先走了。" 玛丽边说边从栏杆旁起身，看向依旧静默不动的 Shinji，他一如既往地沉默着。

"Hey come on! Are you coming or not?"
嘿，快点啊！你到底来不来？

Shinji wondered if telling Mari to get lost would make the girl simply shrug and go away, or try harder to make him to stand up leave, before he realized he was too tired, emotionally spent and mentally weak to the point where even considering doing something felt like a monumental chore.
真嗣思忖，若让真理离开，她会是无动于衷地走开，还是会更加努力地催促他起身离去。他逐渐察觉到自己已心力交瘁，情感枯竭，精神脆弱至极，以至于连考虑行动都仿佛成了难以承受的重负。

"Hey! Are you stupid or something? Let's leave this roof already!" Mari tried once more and as soon as the words were said, Shinji looked up mechanically, looking at Mari, glaring at her with such unbridled anger Mari became quiet almost immediately before she clicked her tongue, making a 'tch' sound and shrugging her shoulders.
"嘿！你是不是傻啊？我们赶紧离开这个屋顶吧！" Mari 再次尝试说道，话音刚落，Shinji 机械地抬起头，怒视着 Mari，眼中怒火熊熊，让 Mari 几乎立刻闭上了嘴，她咂了咂舌，发出'啧'的一声，无奈地耸了耸肩。

"I don't understand why are you so angry about it." Mari tried once more, before her playful smirk returned, pouting her top lip and curling the lower one underneath it, looking like a cat's face would as she narrowed her eyes and walked playfully towards Shinji, who tried to back away, but ended up pressing his back painfully against the rail while Mari got on all four, invading his personal space and ignoring the worried look in his eyes, or the bright blush on his face, but aware of the faint breath coming from his lips and nose, his scent invading Mari's own nose.
"我不懂你为何对此大发雷霆。"玛丽再次尝试解释，随即她那俏皮的坏笑又浮现出来。她噘起上唇，下唇卷曲其下，眯起眼睛，活像一只猫的表情。她带着戏谑的步伐走向真嗣，真嗣本想后退，却不慎将背紧贴在栏杆上，感到一阵疼痛。玛丽四肢着地，逼近他的私人领域，全然不顾他眼中的忧虑和脸上的红晕，只专注于他唇鼻间传来的微弱气息，他的气味悄然侵入她的鼻腔。

"Unless... you like her..."
除非...你对她有好感...

Shinji's look faltered for a second before he looked away, keeping an obstinate silence before he felt Mari's hand on his cheek, making him look at her, and noticing how close her face was to his.
真嗣的眼神闪烁了一下，随即别过头，固执地沉默着。直到真理的手轻触他的脸颊，让他不得不看向她，这才察觉到她的脸庞近在咫尺。

"Is that it? Do you like her?"
就这些吗？你对她有好感吗？

Shinji swallowed hard before nodding slowly, while Mari's eyes danced mischievously.
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，慢慢地点了点头，玛丽的眼中则闪烁着调皮的光芒。

"Do you want to get even at her?" The brunette asked softly, and Shinji could feel her, all of her, her body making contact with his own body, legs bumping and thighs brushing and hands on top of hands with fingers meeting and cheeks touching lightly, breath upon breath as Mari's big, blue eyes were all he could see, and her breath was all he could taste, and her smell was all he could feel.
"你想对她进行报复吗？" 棕发女子柔声询问，真嗣能感受到她的一切，她的身体紧贴着他，双腿相碰，大腿轻蹭，手叠手，手指交缠，脸颊轻触，呼吸交织，玛丽那双深邃的蓝眼睛占据了他的全部视线，她的呼吸充盈他的感官，她的气息弥漫四周。

He didn't even got a chance to nod, or say anything; Mari had slowly pushed her free hand against the back of Shinji's head, fingers brushing and cupping the soft hair at the nape of his neck before her lips descended on him, in what he could only imagine had been a replay to the first kiss he had ever shared with a girl, and while the soft, gentle pressure on his lips felt warm and mellow and tender and delicate, all that Shinji could see when he closed his eyes was Toji kissing Asuka.
他连点头或开口的机会都没有；玛丽缓缓地用她空着的手按在真嗣的后脑，手指轻触并捧起他颈后的柔软发丝，紧接着她的唇便贴了上来，他猜想这或许是对他初吻的回应。那轻柔的吻带来的温暖、柔和、细腻的感觉让他陶醉，然而闭上眼，他脑海中浮现的却是东治亲吻明日香的场景。

And all he could imagine was how it had felt when he realized Asuka was kissing him.
他脑海中浮现的，全是意识到明日香亲吻自己那一刻的感受。

And that was when he had to run away, pushing Mari away and scrambling to his feet and running towards the door, opening it angrily and running down the flight of stairs as time and space seemed to collapse together in such a way that before Shinji could realize it, he was already out of the school.
就在那一刻，他不得不逃离，推开玛丽，急忙起身，怒气冲冲地奔向门口，猛地打开门，沿着楼梯疾跑，时间和空间仿佛交错重叠，真嗣还没反应过来，人已经跑出了学校。

And he never stopped running, until he reached Misato's apartment, opening the door, ignoring Pen-Pen welcoming him, as he ran to his room, shutting the door closed, and lying under his bed sheets, covering himself.
他一路狂奔，直到抵达美里的公寓，推门而入，对企鹅文的欢迎视而不见，直奔自己的房间，关上门，钻进被窝，将自己严严实实地裹了起来。

Before he finally realized what had happened, what he had lost, and what he was willing to do to get it back.
直到他终于明白所发生的一切、失去的东西，以及他愿意付出何种努力去挽回。

The light that was coming from the kitchen were what rose him from his sleep; the sound of a voice humming softly a song was what made him aware that Asuka was home.
厨房传来的灯光唤醒了他，而那轻声哼唱的旋律则让他察觉到明日香已经回来了。

Aska continued to hum as she went from pantry to pantry, taking out ingredients and putting them along with the ones she had already out, cutting and chopping vegetables as she put them on a pan, before the smell of her cooking began to fill the small kitchen, before she turned around and came face to face with Shinji, letting out a small squeak of surprise.
阿斯卡哼着小曲，穿梭于各个储藏室之间，取出食材，与已备好的食材一并摆放。她熟练地切剁蔬菜，置于平底锅上。随着烹饪的香气渐渐充满狭小的厨房，她一转身，迎面撞见了真嗣，不由得轻声惊呼。

For what felt like an eternity none of them moved, or said anything; in fact they didn't do anything at all, the only sounds in the apartment came from the clock as it ticked the seconds away, the pan as its contents sizzled, and the two teenagers breaths and beating harts, faint and impossible for each one to hear the others, even if they each felt like they were deafening loud, minimizing anything else that could be heard.
仿佛经历了永恒，他们一动不动，沉默无言；事实上，他们毫无动作，公寓中仅有的声响来自时钟的滴答、锅中食物的滋滋声，以及两位青少年的呼吸与心跳，微弱至极，彼此难以听见，尽管每个人都感觉自己的心跳和呼吸声震耳欲聋，淹没了其他一切声响。

Shinji licked his lips slowly while Asuka, who had been holding her hand to her chest and had been slightly hunched as if she had been expecting Shinji to attack her, slowly began to stand straight, before she spoke, but Shinji couldn't hear her; he knew she was saying something because her lips were moving, but it all came out distorted, unintelligible, the words crashing unto themselves, collapsing and becoming simply a mixture of sounds that held no real meaning because all Shinji needed to hear, all the words he needed to understand were written in Asuka's eyes, even if she wasn't aware of it.
真嗣缓缓舔了舔嘴唇，而明日香则一直手捂胸口，微微弯腰，仿佛预感到真嗣会攻击她，慢慢地站直了身子，然后开口说话，但真嗣听不见；他知道她在说话，因为她的嘴唇在动，但声音都扭曲了，难以理解，话语相互碰撞，崩溃，变成了一团毫无真正意义的声音，因为真嗣需要听到的所有话语，他需要理解的所有话语，都写在明日香的眼睛里，即使她自己没有意识到。

Which was how Shinji slowly began to walk towards Asuka, and the girl reflectively took a step back for each one the boy took forth, as if it were a rehearsed slow dance, full of cadence: one minute Shinji and Asuke seemed to be separated by a gaping void, the other he was so close he could slowly reach out and touch her.
就这样，真嗣缓缓向明日香走去，而女孩则本能地每退一步，男孩就进一步，宛如一场精心排练的慢舞，节奏分明：一分钟前，两人之间仿佛隔着一道深渊，转眼间，真嗣已近在咫尺，缓缓伸手即可触及她。

Asuka felt her backside pressed against the kitchen table, her arm pushing against the refrigerator, realizing she had nowhere else to go, her voice sounding with more urgency, louder and harsher, but Shinji kept walking to her with slow, deliberate steps, face calm, never stopping to stare directly into Asuka's eyes, before he was finally inches away from her.
明日香感到背部紧贴厨房桌，手臂顶着冰箱，意识到已无路可退。她的声音愈发急迫，音量加大，语气也更为严厉。然而，真嗣依旧不紧不慢地向她逼近，面色从容，目光始终直视着她，直至两人近在咫尺。

Slowly he reached up and cupped her face, while Asuka kept talking and Shinji kept ignoring her; maybe she was asking Shinji to stop it, maybe she was asking him what was wrong, maybe she was trying to find out why he hadn't stayed to help clean up.
他缓缓地伸手，轻轻捧起她的脸颊，而明日香依旧喋喋不休，真嗣却置若罔闻；也许她在恳求真嗣停手，也许她在探询他有何不妥，也许她在试图了解他为何未曾留下帮忙收拾残局。

It didn't really matter to Shinji, after that accidental kiss in Misato's car, he had never really stopped to think about Asuka in this manner; maybe he was as much of an idiot as the redhead constantly said he was, or maybe it was just that he had never felt she could be taken away.
那次在美里车中意外的吻之后，真嗣从未真正停下来，以这种方式思考过明日香；也许他正如那位红发少女常说的那样，是个傻瓜，或者只是因为他从未觉得她会离他而去。

Or maybe it had been the idea of her kissing someone else, someone he had never even considered to be a rival that had started this chain reaction inside of him.
可能是因为想到她亲吻了其他人，一个他从未放在眼里的对手，这一念头在他心中激起了一连串的反应。

Shinji probably didn't really know, and more than likely didn't even care.
真嗣或许并不知情，更可能的是，他根本就不关心。

Because right now, just as Asuka raised her hands to try and push him away, he simply grabbed them, not too harsh, but not really gently; just with enough force to make the redhead know he had something to say and he needed to say his peace.
就在此刻，当明日香举手欲推开他时，他轻轻抓住了她的手，既不粗鲁也不温柔，恰到好处地让这位红发少女意识到他有话要说，必须表达自己的立场。

"Asuka... I saw you kissing Toji today..." Shinji began in a small, shallow voice that made Asuka give Shinji a look that he wasn't sure if it was confusion, embarrassment, or annoyance, but before the redhead could say a word, Shinji kept talking, making the words rush out, pressing forward, and never letting go of the offensive.
"明日香...我今天看到你和东治接吻了..." 真嗣的声音微弱而含糊，让明日香投来的目光中夹杂着困惑、尴尬或恼怒，难以分辨。然而，不等红发少女回应，真嗣便急切地继续说下去，话语连珠，攻势不减。

"I didn't think it'd hurt, but then some other girl kissed me and I realized I didn't want another girl kissing me, I wanted you to kiss me, and I wanted to be the one kissing you."
起初我没觉得这有什么，直到另一个女孩吻了我，那一刻我恍然大悟，我并不希望别人吻我，我渴望的是你的吻，也渴望能吻你。

Asuka opened her mouth, but nothing came out, it was clear she was trying to string a sentence but for some reason she wasn't able to say what was on her mind, so Shinji continued, speaking in a calm, even tone, as if he had blindly found out something he wasn't even aware he had been looking for.
明日香张开嘴巴，却发不出声音，她显然在努力拼凑语句，却不知何故难以吐露心声。这时，真嗣接过话头，语调平和而稳定，仿佛不经意间触及了自己未曾察觉的寻觅之物。

"So that's exactly what I'm gonna do right now; in about ten second, I'm planning on kissing you and if you don't want me to kiss you..."
这就是我接下来要做的：大约十秒后，我会吻你，如果你不愿意，请告诉我……

Shinji faltered, swallowing and staring at Asuka who was now staring at him, quiet, chest heaving, taking deep breaths, face flushed and feeling a very peculiar heat coursing through her body, but still feeling compelled to stare defiantly at Shinji with a quiet sense of determination, as if daring him to finish his words.
真嗣迟疑了，咽了咽口水，目光紧锁在正凝视他的明日香身上。她沉默不语，胸膛剧烈起伏，深吸着气，面颊泛红，体内涌动着一股奇异的热流，却依旧带着一股坚定的沉默，挑衅地回望真嗣，仿佛在催促他继续说下去。

"I-if you don't want me to kiss you then I guess you're just gonna have to stop me..."
如果你不希望我吻你，那你恐怕得阻止我了……

Both teens stayed there, staring at each other, lips a breath apart, before Asuka finally opened her mouth, wetting her lips, still staring at Shinji before she spoke up.
两位少年留在原地，四目相对，唇间仅隔微弱的呼吸，直到明日香终于启唇，轻舔唇瓣，目光仍锁定真嗣，随后开口。

"Ten." 十个。

And then she kissed him.
接着，她吻了他。

And in the kitchen table, next to Asuka's book bag lay the brown wig with the blue head band and the red-rimmed glasses, along with the uniform from Seisen International School she had been wearing today all day at school as part of the classroom student cafe waitress staff.
厨房的桌子上，明日香的书包旁边，摆放着棕色假发，配以蓝色发带，还有一副红色边框的眼镜，旁边是她今天在学校作为学生咖啡厅服务员一整天所穿的圣泉国际学校的制服。

AN: Yes, I have watched it, no I didn't like it and didn't like Shikinami either, and yes, I subscribe to (and started) the crazy idea that Mari is really Asuka Soryu in deep cover.
是的，我看过那部作品，但并不喜欢，对式波也无感。我甚至开始相信并支持那个疯狂的猜测——真希实际上是碇真嗣的深度伪装。

Also, the title should stand for Power of Suggestion, but you are free to think the original thought fits it better.
另外，标题本意是表达“暗示的力量”，不过您也可以考虑原意是否更为恰当。

As far as the idea of "how couldn't Shinji recognize it was Asuka in a wig with glasses" I'll use the Superman-Clark Kent defense of 1969. There's precedent, look it up.
关于“真嗣怎么可能认不出戴假发和眼镜的其实是明日香”这一疑问，我打算借用 1969 年超人-克拉克·肯特的辩护策略。这有历史先例，不妨去查证一下。

### Chapter 16 Themes: K#07 (Good Morning), W#07 (superstar)
主题：K#07（早安），W#07（巨星）

Title: Red Threads 标题：红丝线

A.N.: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
作者按：我将在此声明免责：伊娃及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

"Akemashite omedeto gozaimasu"
新年好

Shinji looked over his shoulder as he finished cleaning the plates, noticing Pen-Pen was busy watching the TV as the weather girl, Miss Rie Anami, was making a report from the nearby shrine; while a lot of the shrine-goers were busy in the Gongen, the station seemed to be busy on the lesser known neighborhood shrines that seemed to be scattered around Tokyo-3.
真嗣洗完碗筷，回头一瞥，只见企鹅 Pen-Pen 正聚精会神地看着电视，屏幕上天气女郎安奈丽小姐正在附近神社现场播报；众多参拜者虽在神宫忙碌，电视台却聚焦于东京-3 区那些零星分布、鲜为人知的社区小神社。

"There's a small Shinto shrine nestled in this particular neighborhood," the attractive young woman began as she allowed the camera man to focus on the people as they walked around the small space, saying their prayers and giving their emoluments while Anami continued talking."Its stone pathway, a unique square stone path leading from the main building to the small graveyard adjacent has a beautiful moss-covered stone jizo-san, leading on a tranquil way towards the shrine; both the main building of the shrine and the bell building has a foot-thick roof made from natural grasses and sticks."
在这个街区中，有一座小巧的日本神社静静坐落。迷人的年轻女子开始介绍，摄像师捕捉着人们在小空间中行走、祈祷和献供的画面。她继续说道：'从主建筑通往邻近小墓地的石板路独具特色，是一条由方形石板铺就的小径，沿途有一尊被苔藓覆盖的美丽石制地藏菩萨，引领着一条宁静的路径直达神社。神社的主建筑和钟楼都覆盖着一层厚厚的天然草和树枝屋顶。'

Shinji had to give it to the news caster; she was cute, funny and had a nice voice; while Toji and Kensuke would watch her show due to the girl's penchant for using tight blouses and flowing skirts, Shinji actually liked to close his eyes and just listen to the soft melodic tones of Anami's voice, making him remember a thousand and one things from his past without trying, simply by the way she would speak about the water and the clouds and the trees and the city.
真嗣不得不承认，那位新闻女主播既可爱又风趣，声音也悦耳动听；每当东治和健介因她爱穿紧身衬衫和飘逸长裙而观看她的节目时，真嗣却喜欢闭上眼睛，只聆听阿波美那如旋律般柔和的声音，这让他不经意间回想起过往的点点滴滴，全因她谈论水、云、树和城市时的语调。

Pen-Pen warked and Shinji chuckled, imagining the penguin being a human, oohing and aahing at the sight as the on-screen personality continued walking past young girls and boys accompanying their parents or grandparents, some dressed in kimonos while others were dressed in a more western fashion.
企鹅 Pen-Pen 发出叫声，真嗣不禁轻笑，脑海中浮现出这只企鹅若为人形，定会为屏幕上的景象惊叹不已。画面中的人物继续前行，身旁是穿着和服或西式服饰的孩童，他们或由父母，或由祖父母陪伴着。

"These small neighborhood shrines are special because there is nothing elaborate or lavish about them, unlike the highly touristic shrines such as Tosho-gu or even the Gongen itself; these small shrines, however, are those that locals visit regularly, at which they pray and worship." Anami continued as she brushed one of her bangs; after almost fourteen years of nothing but summer and tropical climates in Japan, slowly the weather seemed to have began to stabilize, and a few weeks ago the air had began to slowly but consistently grow heavier, colder... giving it a winter feeling as she walked from her spot towards a random person who was busy praying, back against the camera as Shinji allowed himself a brief passing glance before going back to drying the dishes.
"这些社区小神社之所以特别，是因为它们朴实无华，与东照宫或神宫本身那种奢华的旅游景点截然不同。然而，正是这些小神社，成为了当地人常去祈祷和敬拜的地方。" Anami 边说边轻抚了一下刘海。在日本经历了近十四年的夏日和热带气候后，天气似乎开始趋于稳定。几周前，空气逐渐变得沉重而寒冷，透出冬日的气息。当她从自己的位置走向一个正在虔诚祈祷的陌生人时，Shinji 趁机回头匆匆一瞥，随后继续忙于擦干碗碟。

"While these small shrines may not have much historic or architectural significance, there is so much personal significance, and that personal significance is the beauty of travel, now, isn't it? What are you wishing for, miss?"
虽然这些小神龛在历史或建筑上或许无足轻重，但它们所蕴含的个人情感却极为丰富，这不正是旅行的魅力所在吗？小姐，您有何心愿呢？

"WARRK!" 努力工作！

Shinji blinked, hearing the penguin's cry as the same time as a familiar voice crossed the airwaves, feeling a slight case of migraine as Misato seemed to commander the camera man, taking the microphone away from the TV newscaster.
真嗣眨眼间，耳边响起企鹅的叫声，与此同时，一个熟悉的声音透过电波传来，让他感到一阵轻微的偏头痛。美里似乎接管了摄像工作，从电视新闻主播那里夺过了麦克风。

"I came here because we're supposed to come on the first day but I have to be at work. And I just want to give a shout out to Kaji and my roommates, Shinji and Pen-Pen, Hi guys! Look at me! I'm on TV!"
我之所以来，是因为按规定第一天就得来，可我得上班。借此机会，向 Kaji 还有我的室友们，真嗣和 Pen-Pen 打个招呼，大家好！看这里！我上电视了！

Shinji and Pen-pen turned to each other before turning back to the TV and watching as Misato and Miss Anami battled each other for the microphone, before a certain redhead walked behind Misato, giving her a swift bop to the head, and giving Anami back her microphone before angrily scolding Misato on TV.
真嗣与企鹅相视一眼后，目光又回到电视上，只见明日香和安奈小姐正激烈争夺麦克风。突然，一位红发女子悄然来到明日香背后，轻快地敲了敲她的头，夺回麦克风，并在电视直播中对明日香进行了严厉的训斥。

"Misato! Stop screwing around and get ready! It's time to get the back!"
Misato！别胡闹了，赶紧准备！该去取回东西了！

He didn't even need to see her to know her; Asuka's voice was as distinct as she was and the camera man had no choice but to focus on the redhead, and really; Shinji couldn't fault him.
他无需亲眼见到她，仅凭声音便能辨识出明日香；她的嗓音与她本人一样鲜明，摄影师不得不将镜头对准这位红发少女，而真嗣对此也无从指摘。

While Misato was dressed in her typical Nerv uniform of a black turtleneck sweater and matching flight jacket and skirt, Asuka had actually gone the extra mile and dressed in a kimono, pulling her hair in twin ponytails as opposed to the typical fashion she always wore.
三佐一如既往地穿着 NERV 的标志性制服——黑色高领毛衣与配套的飞行夹克及短裙，而明日香则别出心裁，换上了和服，并把头发扎成双马尾，一改往日风格。

But instead of using her A-10 neural connectors, she wore hair pins that resembled sakura cherry flowers; red with sparkling white; her white skin and bright blue eyes making a perfect match. Her hair was as vibrant and red as the kimono she wore; overall a deep dark crimson with speckles of white from the bottom in the form of sakura, closed around her waist tightly by a black and blue sash.
然而，她并未使用 A-10 神经连接器，而是选择了樱花樱桃造型的发夹，红白相间，闪闪发光；她那白皙的肌肤与明亮的蓝眼睛相得益彰。她的发色如她身着的和服一般鲜红夺目，整体呈深暗的绯红色，底部点缀着白色樱花花瓣，腰间则紧紧系着一条黑蓝交织的腰带。

Rie looked from Misato to Asuka as the redhead tugged angrily at the older woman, grumbling and chastising her before the news caster seemed to remember she was on air and turned to the camera to sign off.
理惠的目光在美里和明日香之间徘徊，只见红发的明日香气愤地拉扯着年长的美里，嘴里不满地嘟囔着，直到新闻主播突然意识到还在直播，这才转向镜头，准备结束播报。

"And so, in this last day of the year, we see how younger people are still tasked of taking care of their elders in a cycle that never seems to end. For T3TV I'm Rie Anami wishing you all aGood morning, and a happy new year."
在这一年的最后一天，我们注意到年轻人依旧肩负着照顾长辈的重任，这个循环似乎永无休止。我是 T3TV 的 Rie Anami，在此向大家道一声早安，并祝新年快乐。

"They're still showing that?"
那节目还在播吗？

Shinji turned towards the hallway, noticing Asuka walking in dressed in a less ornate way; just a simple yellow top and blue skirt; feet bare, of course, but Shinji figured Asuka would like to feel her feet free after having them encased in the tabi socks and zaori sandals they had been when she and Misato had come back.
真嗣朝走廊望去，见明日香穿着简朴地走进来，一身黄色上衣配蓝色裙子，脚上自然没穿鞋袜，真嗣心想，明日香大概想让双脚放松一下，毕竟之前她和美里回来时还穿着足袋和草履。

"Yeah, there's talk about how you and Misato are gonna be on the news at eleven as well." Shinji said with a small smirk, making sure to hide it from the redhead as he turned his back to her and busied himself further with the dishes while Pen-Pen was now warking happily to the tune of a beer commercial.
"听说你和美里也会在今晚十一点的新闻中亮相。" 碇真嗣嘴角微扬，为了不让红发女孩察觉，他转身背对她，继续洗碗，而一旁的企鹅 Pen-Pen 正随着啤酒广告的节奏欢快地叫着。

"It was all Misato's fault; she had to go and steal the microphone from that other bimbo and she was making a fool out of herself, I only intervened to make it stop when it crossed the line from funny to pathetic." Asuka said angrily as she walked into the kitchen, opening the refrigerator, bending at her waist as she extracted a can of juice before Pen-Pen warked at the redhead, making her roll her eyes, but extract a can of beer for the bird nonetheless, tossing it in a low arch as the penguin waited for it with outstretched claws and open beak.
"这都是碇真嗣惹的祸；她偏要去抢那个傻妞的麦克风，结果自己出尽了洋相，我只是在她从搞笑变成可怜时才出手制止。"明日香气冲冲地走进厨房，打开冰箱，弯腰取出一罐果汁，这时企鹅 Pen-Pen 对着红发少女叫了一声，让她翻了个白眼，但还是给鸟儿拿了一罐啤酒，以低弧线抛出，企鹅则张开爪子和嘴巴等着接住。

"Thank you Aka! I needed a beer just now."
多谢了，Aka！我刚才正好想喝杯啤酒。

Only for Misato to catch it at the last possible second, leaving Pen-Pen to stare angrily at his owner, warking angrily which only earned him a confused look from the older woman, before she quickly cracked it open and took a sip while Pen-Pen did something akin to a sigh before getting off his couch and waddling towards Asuka, standing on the tips of his flippers before taking out a beer, holding it by it beak before showing it to the redhead as she opened it and put a straw inside, giving it to the bird as it waddled happily back to the couch while Misato simply looked at it all without blinking an eye.
就在最后一刻，美里接住了啤酒，让 Pen-Pen 怒气冲冲地瞪着她，愤怒地叫了几声，却只得到美里一脸困惑。她随即打开啤酒喝了一口，Pen-Pen 则像是叹了口气，从沙发上起身，摇摇晃晃地走向明日香。它站在脚蹼尖上，用喙夹出一瓶啤酒向明日香展示，明日香打开啤酒并放入吸管后递给它，Pen-Pen 便高兴地摇摆着回到沙发，而美里则全程目不转睛地看着。

"Shouldn't you be getting ready for the big New Year's bash?" Asuka asked after a moment, eyeing Misato's outfit, cut-off jeans and strap tanktop as Misato walked towards the table, sashaying and smiling before bumping her hips against Asuka's shoulder
"你不是该准备去参加那个盛大的新年派对了吗？" 片刻后，明日香开口问道，目光落在美里身上的牛仔热裤和吊带背心上。美里走向桌子时，步态婀娜，面露微笑，还不忘用臀部轻碰了一下明日香的肩膀

"Ehh... we had the end of year party yesterday... it was funny seeing Sub-commander Fuyutsuki dressed as a shinto priest and making a fool out of himself willingly as opposed to accidentally, like that one time with the elevator and the lights..." Misato said happily, almost as if she were still a bit dazed from the drinking while Asuka and Shinji shook their heads respectively at the way their guardian was behaving.
"哎呀...我们昨天办了年终派对...看到副指挥官冬月扮成神道教祭司，故意出洋相，跟那次电梯和灯光事故时无意中出丑截然不同，真是逗趣极了..." 三佐开心地说着，似乎还带着几分醉意，而明日香和真嗣则各自摇头，对他们的监护人的行为表示无奈。

"Yeah, but we still have the other party, the one by the temple..." Asuka pointed out as she jumped on top of the kitchen counter top, leaning back while Shinji tried hard not to stare at the wiggling legs and hips of the redhead as Asuka let out a happy sigh when she finally grabbed an apple, taking a bite before she spoke again with her mouth half-full. "That's the one I'm talking about."
没错，我们还有另一个派对，就在寺庙旁边的那场……" 明日香说着，轻盈地跃上厨房台面，身体向后微倾。真嗣则尽力避免直视她那随着动作摇曳的红发下的双腿和臀部。明日香满意地叹了口气，伸手取过一个苹果，咬了一口，嘴里还含着食物，接着说："我指的就是这个派对。

"Ehh, there's enough time yet," Misato said, smiling and winking as she pointed at the clock hanging on the wall behind the children. "Besides, we still need to get some supplies before leaving! I need some grapes and a cup, and red and yellow panties..."
哎呀，时间还充裕得很，" 三佐笑着眨眨眼，指着孩子们身后墙上的钟说，"再说，出发前我们还得采购些必需品！我需要买些葡萄、一个杯子，还有红色和黄色的内裤……

Asuka and Shinji stared at each other as Misato trailed off, standing up and walking into her room, extracting a small plastic bag and smiling lazily at both children, pulling out a pair of panties, one red with a heart on the back and one yellow with a yen sign on the front from the bag inside while making her way into the kitchen.
明日香与真嗣目光交汇，此时美里起身走向房间，从一个小塑料袋中悠闲地笑着取出两条内裤，一条红色背后印有心形，一条黄色前面印有日元标志，随后她步入厨房。

"That's lame even for you, Misato." Asuka's tone was flat and bored while Misato stuck out her tongue at her.
"美里，这对你来说也太没劲了。" 明日香语气平淡，显得有些不耐烦，而美里则调皮地对她吐了吐舌头。

"Grapes and panties?" Shinji asked quietly to Asuka as the redhead watched it all with an uninterested look in her face, taking a small drink from her can while shrugging her shoulders.
"葡萄和内裤？" 真嗣低声向明日香询问，红发少女对此漠不关心，只是轻啜一口饮料，随意地耸了耸肩。

"Yeah! I read all about those New Year's traditions!" Misato's voice came muffled from inside the refrigerator as the mauve-haired woman tried to get some grapes before realizing she had forgotten to buy any. "Red panties for love, yellow for money; you sweep around the house to go on a trip with one of those consecrated bamboo brooms made of hemp and pine and uh..."
没错！我详细了解了那些新年习俗！" 美里的声音从冰箱里传来，有些含糊不清，她正试图取些葡萄，却突然想起自己忘了买。"穿红色内裤寓意爱情，黄色则象征财富；用那些由麻和松木制成的神圣竹扫帚清扫屋子，寓意着将和其中一把扫帚一起踏上旅途，还有...

"Those are western traditions! Aren't you Japanese?" Asuka asked angrily after a moment of seeing Misato make a fool out of herself as per usual. "Shouldn't you be cleaning the apartment instead? Or making a gate pine and an enclosing rope?"
那些不是西方传统吗！你难道不是日本人？"飞鸟在目睹美里又像往常一样出洋相后，生气地质问。"你不是应该去打扫公寓，或者准备门松和注连绳吗？

Misato stopped short as Shinji gave Asuka a bemused look, smiling gently while Misato pouted at the redhead before answering.
真嗣困惑地望向明日香，美里突然止步，嘴角挂着温柔的微笑，对着红发少女撅起嘴，随后才开口回应。

"Are you sure you're just half Japanese? I'm not sure even Shinji knows about the enclosing rope."
你真的只有一半日本血统吗？我甚至不确定真嗣是否了解这根围绳的情况。

"I'm just a quarter Japane- that's not the point!" Asuka talked back with an angry tone, just like she did every time her mixed origin was mentioned, and Shinji unconsciously clenched his hands into fists just like he did every time the subject was brought up.
"我只有四分之一日本血统——这并非关键！" 每当有人提起她的混血背景，明日香总是以愤怒的口吻回击，一如往常；而真嗣也总是不自觉地握紧拳头，每当这个话题被触及。

"Oh come on Aka, I'm only joking; if you keep this up, then we'll miss the red and white year-end song festival; besides, we did all we had to do today, we even went to the temple today and offered our new years, didn't we?" Misato said as she gave the redhead a surprise hug, pressing the young girl against her chest, as the girl tries to push herself away, her angry protests coming out as muffled sounds.
"哎呀，阿卡，我只是在开玩笑嘛；再这样闹下去，我们可就要错过红白歌会了哦。再说，今天我们该做的都做了，连神社都去祈福了新年，对吧？" 三乡说着，突然给了红发少女一个拥抱，将她紧紧搂在怀里，少女挣扎着想要推开，愤怒的抗议声变得含糊不清。

"God Misato! Stop screwing around!" The redhead finally managed to get out while pushing Misato away by her sholders as Shinji turned away with a blush on his face, trying hard not to look like he was watching all of this with more interest than it was needed as Asuka freed herself with a loud groan, finally succeeding in pushing the older girl away who immediately went limp, falling on top of the irate redhead. "Besides, baka Shinji stayed asleep... why did I have to wake up early today!"
天哪，美里！别胡闹了！"红发少女终于挣脱出来，用力推开美里的肩膀，而真嗣则转过脸去，脸上泛起红晕，努力装作对这一切并不太感兴趣。明日香发出一声响亮的呻吟，终于成功地将年长的女孩推开，后者随即瘫软，倒在了愤怒的红发少女身上。"况且，笨蛋真嗣还在睡...为什么偏偏我今天得早起！

"I needed someone to drive me after last night's party." Misato said carelessly as she began to open up the cupboard doors, looking for something to eat before turning to Shinji and giving him a smile that made the boy roll his eyes. The boy stood up, getting a bowl and pouring some cereal on it before serving it for Misato as she sat cross-legged in the table chair, looking rather pleased with herself. "And you wanted a chance to show off your brand new driver's license, didn't you?"
昨晚派对后我需要人开车送我。" 三笠随口说道，边说边打开橱柜寻找食物，随后转向真嗣，露出一个让男孩不禁翻白眼的微笑。真嗣起身，取碗倒上麦片，为盘腿坐在餐桌旁的三笠端上，她显得颇为自得。"你也想趁机展示一下你的新驾照吧？

"I was thinking more about going out at night with Hikari to the movies or the mall, and not going to the temple at the other side of town." The redhead grumbled while Shinji simply tuned them out and kept working on the sink, the soft sounds of scrubbing and washing intermixing with Asuka and Misato's words.
"我更倾向于晚上和光去看电影或逛商场，而不是去城另一头的寺庙。"红发少女嘟囔着，而真嗣则置若罔闻，继续埋头修理水槽，刷洗声与明日香和美里的交谈声交织在一起。

"So... how's the day been so far Shinji?"
那么... 真嗣，今天到现在为止过得怎么样？

"I woke up ten minutes ago..." Shinji said as she rubbed his eyes; the good thing about having a day off, was precisely that; being able to wake up late, do nothing around the house, just bum and lounge and think about silly little things while watching the minutes slowly tick away; with no schoolwork pending, and no impeding testings from Nerv, Shinji had done just that: he had woken up early, only to turns around and sleep again, waking again in mid afternoon, doing some light cleaning, and then going back to sleep.
"我十分钟前刚醒……" 真嗣揉着眼睛说道。放假最大的乐趣莫过于此：可以尽情睡懒觉，在家悠闲度日，无所事事地闲逛，思绪飘散在琐碎小事上，任由时间慢慢流逝。既然没有学校作业的压力，也没有 NERV 的紧急测试，真嗣便享受了这样的时光：他清晨醒来，翻个身又沉沉睡去，午后再次睁眼，简单打扫一番，随后又回到梦乡。

"Ahh~" Shinji stopped short as the tone form Misato's exclamation registered in his voice, normally, this tone could only mean one thing; tease.
"啊~" 真嗣话音一顿，从美里的语气中听出了端倪，通常这种语气只预示着一件事：她要开始逗弄人了。

"Did you have one of those dreams about me and Aka?" Misato said with a wink, ignoring Asuka's look and angry shout of "What?" as Shinji stood there in a stunned silence while Misato continued as if nothing was wrong. "Did you dream Asuka was dressed in nothing but a happy new year banner?"
你有没有梦见过我和阿卡？" 三笠眨眼说道，对明日香的惊讶表情和愤怒的"什么？"置若罔闻，而真嗣则愣在原地，三笠继续若无其事地说下去。"你梦见明日香只裹着一条新年快乐的横幅吗？

Asuka turned from Misato to Shinji, face growing more and more red with each passing second as Shinji tried valiantly to keep a straight face, something he found harder with each moment as Asuka kept giving him the evil eye.
明日香从美里转向真嗣，随着每一秒的流逝，她的脸颊愈发绯红。真嗣竭力维持着一本正经的表情，然而随着明日香频频投来犀利的目光，他感到越来越难以保持镇定。

Of course, that made Misato try harder still to embarrass both teenagers.
当然，这使得美里更加努力地想要让两位青少年感到尴尬。

"What about me? Shinji Ikari, you big Casanova you..."
那我呢？碇真嗣，你这个风流人物...

"Wh-what! I di-" Shinji exclaimed, only to be cut off by Misato ruffling Shinji's bangs, pushing his head down a bit forceful as Asuka turned to look the other way with her nose held high, and grumbling under her breath about perverts and guardians who were even more perverted which made Shinji glare at the redhead.
"什么！我，我……" 真嗣刚要开口，却被美里用力拨弄了一下刘海，把他的头稍微往下压了压。此时，明日香转过头去，高傲地扬起鼻子，嘴里不满地嘟囔着变态和更变态的监护人，这让真嗣不满地瞪了红发少女一眼。

"Well, in any event, are you two ready to party like it's 1999?" Misato exclaimed as she stretched before making her way towards her room, walking back out with a slinky black mini-dress, smiling broadly.
"不管怎样，你们俩准备好狂欢一番了吗？就像回到了 1999 年一样！" 真嗣兴奋地喊着，她伸了个懒腰，随即走进房间，换上一件性感的黑色迷你裙，满脸笑容地走了出来。

"Misato, that phrase was old in 1998." Shinji said dryly, not being the least bit concerned about the fact that he wasn't even born in that moment but Shinji knew about it, about life before the impact; about how before September 13th, 2000, the world changed without people having a say-so in it; simply by the designs of men that were in over their head at the time, and who had no other solution but to push forth.
"美里，那句话在 1998 年就过时了。" 碇真嗣干巴巴地说，全然不在意自己那时还未出生，但他对此了如指掌，了解冲击前的生活；了解在 2000 年 9 月 13 日之前，世界在人们无法干预的情况下发生了巨变；这全因那些当时力不从心的人们的决策，他们别无选择，只能强行推进。

Misato knew this as well, she had been there; she had a front row seat; and Shinji would sometimes wonder how can she live on, knowing what she knows, living what she lived... how can she look forward to a new year when the last ones had nothing but grief and pain?
三笠对此同样了然于心，她曾亲身体验；她拥有前排的视角；而真嗣有时会纳闷，她如何能带着所知所历继续前行...当过去的一年满是悲伤与痛苦时，她怎能对新的一年抱有期待？

Or Asuka, she seemed out of place celebrating anything; it's like all the time, the redhead had an axe to grind, something to keep her from being happy and full; it was silly little things that would make the redhead shout and explode at the smallest detail, but lately, she had began to mellow out as well.
飞鸟明日香似乎总与庆祝格格不入；她仿佛时刻心存芥蒂，有什么东西阻碍她获得真正的快乐和满足。那些琐碎小事足以让这位红发少女怒火中烧，对细微之处也大发雷霆，然而近期，她也开始变得柔和了。

And then, there was Rei...
接着，绫出现了……

"Anyway, I should really do the laundry or something..." Shinji finished, cutting himself off, not really wanting to go there, turning around and walking towards the washroom while Misato looked at Shinji with concern while Asuka tried not to look at him in the same way.
"不管怎样，我确实该去洗洗衣服或者干点别的……" 碇真嗣话音未落便打住了，不愿深谈，转身向浴室走去。葛城美里带着担忧的目光注视着他，而明日香则努力避免流露出同样的关切。

"Hey! No need to be so gloomy." Misato said in a childish tone of voice, as if she were trying to remind Shinji of the happiness of holidays, while the boy didn't answer, probably already busy separating the colors from the whites from the solids. "Come on Shinji, it's New Year's; you do that every day! One day won't put a cramp in your style."
嘿！别这么闷闷不乐嘛。" 碇真嗣用一种孩子般的语气说道，仿佛在提醒真嗣节日的欢乐，而男孩没有回应，可能正忙着将彩色衣物与白色及固体分开。"加油，真嗣，今天是新年；你天天都这么勤快，偶尔放松一下也无妨。

"Same procedure every year," Asuka added under her breath, grumbling before she got up and went to get herself a bottle of water, turning around and noticing Shinji was walking back to the kitchen.
"又是老一套，"飞鸟低声嘟囔着，站起身去拿了一瓶水，这时她注意到真嗣正从厨房回来。

The boy had a different look; it wasn't excitement, more like guilt; and knowing Shinji, it WAS guilt. Guilt about probably making Misato miserable in a holiday she seemed to enjoy, guilt about being the downer of the party, guilt about being himself.
那男孩的神情异于寻常；并非激动，倒更像是愧疚；而熟悉真嗣的人一眼便知，那正是愧疚。或许是因让美里在原本享受的假期中感到不快而愧疚，是在派对上成为败兴之人的愧疚，是作为自己存在的愧疚。

"I... I guess... what would we do, anyways?" the boy said as he sat down with a sigh and Misato turned to look from Shinji to Asuka before she flashed them both a smile.
"我...我想...我们又能做什么呢？"男孩叹了口气坐下，Misato 从 Shinji 转向 Asuka，随即向两人展露微笑。

"Well... Asuka was right... we need to make a Pine gate and put it in the corner near the door," the mauve-haired woman said as she got up, walked to one of the doors near the entrance and pulled out a box which contained ume and pine and bamboo, along with a roll of rope made from straw, still packed in cellophane with a sticker that said "newly woven". "You do know how they are done, right?"
嗯... 明日香说得没错... 我们得做一个松木门，放在靠近门口的角落里，"紫发女子边说边起身，走到入口旁的一扇门前，拿出一个盒子，里面装着梅子、松枝和竹子，还有一卷稻草编的新绳子，依旧用玻璃纸包着，贴着"新编"的标签。"你应该知道怎么弄吧？

Shinji's face was blank, but Asuka could see in his eyes how boring this seemed to him, not like she could say it wasn't, but the girl had lately felt... something; as if something she had never know was lacking had finally revealed itself, making the German-Japanese teenager realize she wasn't whole, that she needed something more, a void that she thought could only be filled by being an elite pilot of Eva.
真嗣面无表情，但明日香从他的眼神中察觉到，他对这一切感到多么乏味，虽然她也无法反驳。然而，最近这位德日混血的少女总有一种感觉……仿佛某个她未曾察觉的缺失之物终于浮现，让她意识到自己并不完整，她渴望更多，一个她认为唯有成为顶尖 Eva 驾驶员才能填补的空缺。

But it wasn't enough; there was something else, something missing; it was like a loneliness she could never stop feeling; like being alone in a crowd, seeing everyone walk past her, not caring, not turning around, as if she wasn't there at all.
然而，这还远远不够；总感觉少了些什么，一种无法摆脱的孤独感始终萦绕心头；仿佛置身于熙熙攘攘的人群中却依旧形单影只，眼见众人擦肩而过，无人驻足，无人回首，宛如她根本不存在一般。

"Ok, first, we get these bamboo shoots and arrange them from tallest to smallest," Misato announced as she began to fidget with the three bamboo pieces, placing the tallest one in the center, while the second tallest one was to the left and the smallest once was placed on the right, before securing them with the pine and ume at the base while pulling out a length of rope. "Then we get an enclosing rope and put it here so we can bind the evil spirits; after all, the fundamental function of the New Year ceremonies is to honor and receive the toshigami who will then bring a bountiful harvest for farmers and bestow the ancestors' blessing on everyone."
好的，首先，我们把这些竹笋从高到矮排列好，" 三乡边说边开始摆弄三根竹子，将最高的置于中央，次高的放在左侧，最小的放在右侧，随后用松枝和梅枝固定底部，并抽出一截绳子。"接着，我们用一根围绳在此处缠绕，以束缚邪灵；要知道，新年仪式的核心目的正是为了尊崇并迎接年神，年神会赐予农民丰收，并为所有人带来祖先的祝福。

Asuka rolled her eyes at the explanation, even if she knew a bit about the whole philosophy behind this; how the bamboo represented heaven, humanity and earth, and how the bamboo, pine andume represented represent longevity, prosperity and faithfulness; how all three represented the tenacity of humanity, living on earth, under heaven and trying to attain a better tomorrow.
明日香对这番解释不以为然，虽然她对背后的哲学略知一二：竹子象征天、人、地，竹、松、梅分别代表长寿、繁荣与忠诚；三者共同体现了人类在天地间生存，不懈追求美好未来的坚韧精神。

Angels... spirits... do I need to put a horseshoe on the door to protect us from time-travellers too?
天使啊，精灵啊，难道我还得在门上挂个马蹄铁，以防备那些穿越时空的旅行者吗？

Shinji frowned as he continued to put everything together for his pine gate, working diligently even if he didn't believe a lot in what he was doing, he was used to working and living through the motions; this wasn't any different from coming to Tokyo-3, and piloting the Evangelions; like many children born after second impact, living in a broken world, spirituality wasn't big on his list, and neither was traditional celebration, but Shinji did as he was told because Misato expected him to.
真嗣皱着眉，继续组装松木门，尽管内心对所做之事并无太多信念，但他习惯了机械式的工作与生活；这与前往第三新东京市、驾驶福音战士并无不同；和许多在第二次冲击后出生的孩子一样，在一个支离破碎的世界中，精神信仰和传统庆典并非他所看重，但真嗣还是遵从了美里的期望。

"Now, here in Japan, binding ropes represent a ward against evil spirits, but first we need to purify the rope and to do that we need to wave them together and then let them soak in sake before putting them on top of the door to ward the place." Misato added as she walked to one of the cupboards and pulled out a sake bottle and a small basin, pouring some on the container before she took a hearty swig, letting out a whoop and ignoring Shinji's and Asuka's annoyed but amused look, while they both started to weave the ropes together, Asuka complaining about how stiff and hard the rope was while Shinji pointed out that they should leave it soak for a few minutes, and Misato smiled at both children as she continued telling them how she and Kaji and Ritsuko used to do this a long time ago, so long it felt like an eternity and more.
如今在日本，捆绑的绳索被视为抵御邪灵的护符。首先，我们需净化这些绳索，方法是将其一同挥舞，随后浸泡于清酒中，最后悬挂在门上，以此守护居所。Misato 边走向橱柜边补充，她取出清酒和浅盆，往盆里倒酒后痛饮一口，欢呼一声，对 Shinji 和 Asuka 那既恼火又好笑的表情视而不见。两人开始编绳，Asuka 抱怨绳子硬邦邦的，Shinji 则建议先泡一会儿。Misato 微笑着看着他们，回忆起很久以前她和 Kaji、Ritsuko 也常这么做，那时光久远得仿佛隔世。

"Misato, don't drink the sake you're using to purify the rope," Asuka pointed out without even looking up while Shinji nodded, both children engrossed in what they were doing while Misato looked away, caught red-handed.
"Misato，别喝那用来净化绳索的清酒，" Asuka 提醒道，头也没抬，Shinji 也点头附和，两人都专心于手头的事，而 Misato 则尴尬地别过脸，被逮个正着。

"Hey, it's tradition! You need uhm... to take a quick drink to make sure the sake is not spoiled, otherwise the ritual won't work," Misato supplied quickly, making Asuka look up, blinking and turning to Shinji who simply shook his head silently as Asuka rolled her eyes, mumbling something about her being not really interested in the general culture lesson, while Misato kept talking about what the pines were supposed to mean before she began to twist and pull and braid together the rope.
"嘿，这是传统！你得先呷一口，确保清酒没坏，不然仪式就不灵了，" 美里急忙解释，让明日香抬头眨眼，看向真嗣，他只是默默摇头。明日香翻了个白眼，嘟囔着对这种文化课不感兴趣。美里继续讲解松树的象征意义，随后开始扭动、拉扯并编织绳子。

"Yeah, you know what is another tradition I miss? The Kotatsu." Misato said dreamily as she began to put the finishing touches in on one of the pine gates, before she looked up, smiling.
"对了，你知道我还怀念什么传统吗？就是被炉。" 三乡如梦初醒地说着，一边为松木门做最后的修饰，一边抬头微笑。

"Teacher used to have one of those..." Shinji said in a calm voice, almost as if the fact that he was picking up the conversation was the only natural thing to do; speaking in soft, even tones as both Shinji and Misato reminisced about the warm and cozy low table, Misato talking about how she enjoyed it in Germany while living there with Kaji and whenever Ritsuko would drop by and visit them, all three would share a nice time sitting around on the cold winter nights, a futon blanket sandwiched between the tabletop and the table framework, feeling as their legs stayed toasty warm while eating and drinking, studying and relaxing at the same time.
"老师以前也有一个那样的……" 真嗣平静地说道，仿佛接过话茣是再自然不过的事；他和美里回忆起那个温暖舒适的矮桌，美里谈及在德国与加持同住时，每当律子来访，三人便会在寒冷的冬夜围坐桌旁，享受美好时光。桌面上铺着一层被褥，夹在桌面与桌架之间，让双腿在用餐、饮酒、学习与放松时都保持温暖。

"Alright, I need to go buy some supplies for that thing at the shrine and pick up Rei to come here and get ready," Misato announced after some time before showing one of the finished pine gates to Shinji and Asuka, standing up and grabbing her keys and some money from her wallet. "Think you two can finish the other one by the time I return?"
好了，我得去采购神社活动所需的物资，顺便接绫过来一起准备，"美里稍作停顿后宣布，她向真嗣和明日香展示了一个完成的松木门，随即起身拿起钥匙和钱包里的钱。"我回来前，你们能搞定另一个门吗？

Both children said yes in their own particular way; Shinji nodding without saying anything as he wove the twine and hemp together, tying it off with some red thread to make sure the braided rope would stay in shape while Asuka grumbling a half-hearted yes, as she arranged the ume, pine and bamboo as if she had always taken the ikebana classes needed to do so, making Misato stop at the entrance and turn over to look at them both, smiling softly to herself before closing the door behind her but not before getting in a last word.
两个孩子都以各自的方式表示了同意：真嗣默默点头，同时将麻绳与麻线交织，用红线扎紧，确保编绳稳固；明日香则半是抱怨地应了一声“好”，她熟练地摆弄着梅、松、竹，仿佛早已上过插花课，这让美里在门口驻足回望，脸上泛起柔和的微笑，随后轻轻关上门，临走还不忘叮嘱一句。

"And afterwards... you two will have to hold a song-off!"
接下来...你们俩得来一场歌曲比拼了！

It started with something small and simple, like most things normally do.
它始于一件小事，简单而寻常，正如大多数事情的开端。

Shinji had been working nonstop, tying the rope and hemp over and over when and tried to reach for some more rope, just as Asuka reached over to grab some pine twigs, causing them both to brush hands.
真嗣连续工作不停，反复捆绑绳索和麻绳，当他伸手再去取绳时，正好明日香也伸手去抓松枝，两人的手因此轻轻相触。

Both felt it immediately; it wasn't like an electric shock, or anything like that, but more like a warm sense of familiarity, of reconnecting with something that had once been there... fingers moving slowly, almost as if they were doing so on their own accord before both teens realized it, noticing their finger tips pressing against one another and pulling their hands away immediately, as Asuka looked down on what she was doing and Shinji looked away, both children trying not to notice in this synchronic dance of theirs the way their faces were both red.
两人立刻有所感应；那并非电击般的冲击，而是一种温暖的熟悉感，仿佛重新触及了曾经存在的东西...手指缓缓移动，仿佛不受控制，直到两位少年意识到，注意到他们的指尖相触，随即迅速抽回手，Asuka 低头看着自己的动作，Shinji 则转过头去，两个孩子在这场同步的舞蹈中，都试图不去注意彼此涨红的脸颊。

"This... it doesn't feel right..."
这...感觉不太对头...

"Huh?" Shinji said without looking up, but already feeling the pit of his stomach growing with dread at the words filling him with the familiar feeling on not being wanted, reliving the way his father had walked away, the way the teacher that had been taking care of him had treated him; the cold looks, the clipped words, the anger and resentment so tangible they could be seen as some sort of miasma covering the people around him, pushing him away into loneliness and despair.
"嗯？" 真嗣没有抬头，却已感到胃中一阵恐惧升起，那些话语勾起了他不被需要的熟悉感觉，让他再次体验到父亲离去的冷漠，以及照顾他的老师对他的疏离；那些冰冷的目光，简短的话语，愤怒和怨恨如此强烈，仿佛形成了一层瘴气，笼罩在周围人身上，将他推向孤独和绝望的深渊。

But this time it hurt a bit more, perhaps more than Shinji would like to admit, because over the past months, he had slowly began to allow himself to feel like this was his family; his real family.
然而这次，伤痛似乎更深，或许超出了真嗣愿意承认的程度，因为在过去数月间，他已不知不觉将这里视作自己的家，真正的家。

Because family wasn't just calling someone 'father' or 'mother', or 'sister' or 'brother'; family meant hot baths when morning was just breaking, and toast and coffee and walks to school.
家庭之义，远非仅限于称呼某人为“爸爸”、“妈妈”、“姐姐”或“弟弟”；它代表着清晨初露曙光时的热水澡，以及香脆的吐司、香浓的咖啡，还有一同走向学校的步伐。

Family meant walking back from school and stopping to buy an ice cream, or drink something, or smelling warm food being cooked, even if it was instant; it meant late nights watching reruns on TV, and sleeping in until late in the afternoon during off days.
家庭，是放学后漫步归家，途中买一支冰淇淋，或小酌一番，或嗅着热食的香气，即便是速食也温馨；是深夜里重温电视剧，休息日慵懒地睡到午后。

Or at least, that what Shinji had thought, but it was obvious Asuka...
至少，真嗣原本是这么认为的，但很明显明日香...

"The kadomatsu... It doesn't look right."
这门松...看起来似乎不太合适。

"Huh?" Shinji said, blinking quickly as he looked up, staring at Asuka as she looked away, blushing and mumbling as she seemed to fidget with pine gate, noticing how the redhead was staring intently at it, but as far as the boy could tell, there was nothing wrong; the pine and ume were placed in a nice design along with the bamboo trunks, until he realized the twine tying it all together was a bit loose.
"嗯？" 真嗣疑惑地眨了眨眼，抬头望向阿苏卡，只见她脸颊泛红，目光躲闪，嘴里含糊其辞，手指不安地摆弄着松木门。他注意到红发女孩正目不转睛地盯着门，但在他看来，一切都很正常：松树、梅树与竹竿和谐地排列着，直到他发现绑扎它们的绳子有些松动。

"Here, let me hold it and you tie it tighter," Asuka ordered just as Shinji attempted to do the same, rubbing fingers once again, and as Shinji gulped but remained motionless, holding the pieces together, Asuka simply stared at their fingers pressing, rubbing... touching one another, before Shinji finally pulled his hand away.
"来，我握着，你把它绑紧点，" 明日香命令道，就在真嗣也打算这么做时，两人的手指再次相互摩擦。真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，却依旧稳稳地握着，明日香则凝视着他们紧贴、摩擦的手指...直到真嗣最终抽回手。

"So-sorry..." 真的很抱歉...

Asuka blinked as she slowly looked up and stared at Shinji, trying to keep a cool face even if inside it felt like someone had slapped her cheek; a sharp, stinging impact that seemed to echo in her center with memories of her life in Germany, of how it felt to not be wanted, to not have a family, even if her father and her new mother said the opposite, Asuka knew they were just words, words with no deeper meaning or feelings than the time her father had promised her mother to never leave her, only to abandon all hope and love as soon as Kyoko began to show the impact of the contact experiment on her mind.
明日香眨了眨眼，缓缓抬头凝视着真嗣，尽管内心如同被狠狠扇了一巴掌般刺痛，她仍努力维持着冷静的表情。那种尖锐的痛楚在她心中回荡，唤起了她在德国的记忆，那种被遗弃、无家可归的感觉。尽管她的父亲和继母口头上说相反的话，明日香深知那只是空洞的言辞，正如她父亲曾向母亲承诺永不离开，却在京子因接触实验影响心智时，彻底抛弃了所有的希望和爱。

"Come on idiot... let's get this one ready..."
快点，傻瓜...我们得把这个准备好...

But still, Asuka kept a straight face, peppered with some irritation, which meant she was glaring at Shinji coolly, noticing how as much as he tried to do a decent job straightening the bamboo, his hands were shaking so badly it was impossible to keep it straight
尽管如此，明日香脸上依旧保持着平静，只是略带怒意，她冷冷地盯着真嗣，注意到他虽然努力想把竹子弄直，但双手颤抖得厉害，怎么也弄不直

"So hopeless," Asuka said angrily, as if she had suddenly realized how she was supposed to act, grabbing a hold of Shinji's hands and ignoring his surprised look or how her cheeks felt like they were on fire before finally making Shinji hold the bamboo pieces straight and she began to tie it all with the rope.
"真是绝望透顶，" 明日香怒气冲冲地说，似乎突然明白了该如何反应，她紧紧抓住真嗣的手，不顾他惊讶的神情和脸颊上灼热的感觉，最后让真嗣稳住竹片，她开始用绳子将它们捆绑起来。

"Here, hold it like this," Asuka finished but her voice wavered a little, just as she let go of Shinji's hand before she brought all the pieces together and began to tie them tightly, sticking out the tip of her tongue as she did that, giving the redhead an air of playfulness and child-like innocence while Shinji simply stared. before Asuka stopped, smiling a small, faint smile and nodding, pleased with herself. "There! Now lets put it outside."
来，这样拿着，" 明日香话音刚落，声音略显不稳，就在她松开真嗣的手之际，她迅速将各部分拼合，开始紧紧地绑扎，过程中还俏皮地吐了吐舌头，显得既活泼又天真。真嗣则在一旁默默注视。绑好后，明日香停下手，脸上浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑，满意地点了点头。"搞定！现在我们把它拿到外面去吧。

"Ri- right." Shinji nodded, just as Asuka was already standing up and grabbing hold of one of the handles, waiting for the boy to do the same before they both began to wobble their way outside of the apartment, Asuka fighting with herself to not look too munch into this action while Shinji tried to not look too much at Asuka, just as them both reached the entrance of the apartment and putting the container housing the pine gate on the ground and staring at it for a long time in silence, until Asuka finally spoke.
"对，没错。" 真嗣点头回应，此时明日香已起身抓住把手，等待真嗣也抓住把手后，两人一同摇晃着走出公寓。明日香努力克制自己不去过分关注这一动作，而真嗣则尽量不去过多地看向明日香。他们到达公寓门口，将装有松木门的容器放下，沉默地凝视良久，直到明日香终于打破沉默。

"So this is how you celebrate New Year's?"
这就是你庆祝新年的方式？

The question was asked quietly, so unlike the normally loud voice from the redhead, which made Shinji grumble, pressing his lips tightly against the other and let out a sigh before he shook his head ever so slowly.
问题以异常轻柔的声音提出，与红发人一贯的洪亮嗓音大相径庭，真嗣不禁低声抱怨，紧闭双唇，轻叹一声后，缓缓地摇了摇头。

"I've never really celebrated..." Shinji said after a moment as he got down on his knee, staring at the pine gate, frowning before he continued after a beat. "My teacher generally went off to see his parents, and I was generally left at my old home..."
我从未真正庆祝过……" 碇真嗣顿了顿，跪在地上，目光紧锁着那扇松木门，眉头微皱，片刻后继续道："我的老师总是去探望他的父母，而我则常常独自留在旧居……

"I would spend it with Kaji." Asuka said in a small voice as well, standing next to Shinji's kneeling form, staring down at the pine cone as well, but her eyes had a glazed over expression, as the memories of how she used to spend this time before wormed it's way into the redhead's mind and soul.
"我会和 Kaji 共度时光。" Asuka 轻声附和，站在跪地的 Shinji 身旁，目光也落在松果上，然而她的眼神却透露出迷茫，往昔这段时光的记忆悄然涌上心头，触动了她的心弦。

Shinji thought about it for a moment; imagining a younger Asuka, smiling and spinning around as she would latch onto her parent's arm, just like he imagined he used to before that day, and ask her father with a childish pout and puppy dog eyes to take her there, feeling a tinge of jealousy that died immediately when Asuka spoke next, because even if she was smiling on the outside, the words held a tone the boy was too used and accustomed to not notice.
真嗣沉思片刻，脑海中浮现出年幼的明日香，她笑容满面，旋转着身体，紧紧依偎在父母臂弯中，宛如他记忆中自己曾经的模样。她带着孩童般的撅嘴和渴望的眼神，央求父亲带她前往某个地方，真嗣心中涌起一丝嫉妒，但随即被明日香接下来的话语所平息。尽管她面带微笑，但那话语中的语气，真嗣太过熟悉，无法不察觉。

"I would... ask Kaji to drive to Berlin so we could see the fireworks at the Brandenburg gate"
我想让卡吉开车带我们去柏林，在勃兰登堡门前观赏烟花

"That's... cool..." 那真是... 挺酷的...

"Yeah, but I... sometimes I would look at everyone there, and they would all look so happy... and... sometimes I would wonder why I couldn't feel like that." Asuka said with a small shrug as Shinji weighted her words; a part of him saying he should stay quiet, this was nothing of his concern, and Asuka clearly had said before she didn't need anyone besides her.
"嗯，但我...有时我会环顾四周，看到每个人都很快乐...而...有时我会纳闷，为什么我体会不到那种感觉。" 明日香说着，微微耸了耸肩，真嗣则在心中掂量她的话语；他内心有个声音告诉他应该保持沉默，这并非他该关心的事，何况明日香之前也明确表示过她不需要任何人。

But another part was there, waiting, holding his breath for Asuka's next words, hoping against hope for her not to shut off, not to push him away.
然而，另一部分情感却在那里静静守候，屏住呼吸，渴望听到明日香的下一句话，内心深处仍抱有一丝希望，希望她不要封闭自己，不要将他拒之门外。

Not to leave him alone.
别让他落单。

"Why not?" 何乐而不为？

Asuka blinked as she turned to her left, meeting Shinji's eyes for the first time; he was staring back at her with a calm, resigned look in his face, waiting for her answer, and silently daring her to not push him away.
明日香眨眼间转向左侧，首次与真嗣四目相对；他面带平静而略显无奈的神情凝视着她，静候她的回应，仿佛在无声地挑战她不要拒绝他。

And Asuka Soryu never liked backing away from dares.
惣流·明日香从不怯于接受挑战。

"I dunno... it just..." The redhead began before she looked quickly away, standing up and dusting her jeans before she shrugged with a blank stare. "It felt odd... being there, trying to be happy while..."
我也不清楚...只是..." 红发女孩刚开口，便迅速别开目光，站起身拍去牛仔裤上的尘土，随后无表情地耸了耸肩。"身处那里，努力让自己开心，感觉却异常别扭...而与此同时...

"While?" 什么时候？

Asuka opened her mouth, the words already forming even if her voice wasn't there; before she blinked and shook her head, as if she were waking up from a dream and was finally understanding what she had said, before her eyes and her face were closed once more.
明日香张开嘴巴，话语已在心中成形，尽管声音尚未发出；她眨眼摇头，宛如从梦中惊醒，这才领悟自己所言，之后她的目光与表情又重新收敛。

"Never mind that, it's not important."
没关系，那不重要。

There was a beat, and the silence grew exponentially, before Shinji spoke again.
一阵沉默后，寂静迅速扩散，真嗣再次打破了沉默。

"I think... the only way to be happy right now is not to think about what happens to us too much..."
我想...此刻要想幸福，或许就别太纠结于我们遭遇的种种。

Asuka blinked before she turned towards Shinji, wondering what he meant by that, noticing he was still kneeling down, staring at the pine gate, his fingers rubbing the leaves gently, almost reverently, before she stared at the pine gate, the memories of the past 36-odd days spent in this country intermixing; bitter memories, sweet memories, but most of all hurting memories.
明日香眨了眨眼，转向真嗣，心中疑惑他那句话的含义。她注意到真嗣依旧跪着，目光凝视着松木门，手指轻柔地抚摸着门上的叶子，仿佛带着一种虔诚。随后，她也望向那扇门，脑海中浮现出在这个国家度过的 36 天里的种种记忆：有苦涩，有甜蜜，但更多的是令人心痛的片段。

"I dunno... it's kind of hard to look forward to a new year after all the crap we've been living with, you know?"
说实话，经历了这么多不顺，现在要我满怀期待地迎接新年，还真有点难。你懂我的意思吧？

Shinji took a moment to rationalize this, trying to understand where the redhead was coming from remembering the sum of all that had happened in the year, the ways they had both fought; arguments as silly as who's turn it was to fed the penguin, and as serious as who would be the one to attack a certain angel.
真嗣稍作思考，试图理解红发人的出发点，回想起这一年来的种种经历，他们之间的争执，从琐碎的谁该喂企鹅，到严肃的谁去攻击特定天使，不一而足。

Sometimes, they would fight about who's turn it was to buy groceries, or do the dishes, or take the trash out, and sometimes, they would simply sit on the living room, wordlessly passing popcorn of chips or pocky while watching the Tv.
他们偶尔会为谁该去买菜、洗碗或倒垃圾而争执，有时则只是默默坐在客厅，无声地交换着爆米花、薯片或百奇，一同观看电视。

Like family... and... 如同家人般...还有...

"Well... at least we have friends, right?" Shinji said after a moment, making Asuka turn to him and frown before she answered, turning away.
"嗯...至少我们还有朋友，不是吗？" 真嗣过了一会儿说道，明日香闻言转头看向他，皱起眉头，随后回答，又转过身去。

"Yeah... you being here doesn't really suck that much, so I guess it's cool that you're here."
其实你在这儿也没那么糟，我觉得你在这儿挺好的。

Shinji looked at Asuka, thinking that maybe he should say something, but no words were coming to his mouth; instead, all he could hear was the dinging sound of the door from the elevator as it opened and Misato walked out, carrying a couple of bags on each hand as Rei followed the older woman with a bag of her own.
真嗣望着明日香，心中犹豫是否该开口，然而话语却哽在喉头；此时，电梯门开启的叮当声响起，美里提着几个袋子走了出来，零紧随其后，也拎着自己的袋子。

It only took a moment for them to realize how things were looking, and that topped with Misato's teasing smile made Shinji and Asuka look quickly away, the boy standing with a jump as the redhead simply took a couple of steps back as Rei simply watched the interaction, her face sporting a mixture of bemusement and... something Rei herself wasn't aware how to explain; all she knew was that it felt like scalding hot water, the type she used to make her tea, had splashed her chest and stomach, leaving behind a nasty sensation, like something was burning her, slowly corroding her skin, making it itch, and welt, and giving the blue-haired, quiet girl a sense of discomfort unlike anything she had felt.
他们瞬间明白了状况，美里那戏谑的笑容更是让真嗣和明日香急忙转移视线。真嗣一跃而起，明日香则退后几步，而绫波只是静静地旁观，脸上带着一种混杂着困惑和难以言说的表情；她只觉得仿佛滚烫的热水泼洒在胸腹，留下灼热感，仿佛有什么在侵蚀她的肌肤，令她痒痛难耐，让这位蓝发、寡言的女孩感受到了前所未有的不适。

Meanwhile, Shinji and Asuka shared an awkward glance before they walked inside the apartment with Misato and Rei attempting to work on the other pine gate as Rei sat awkwardly in the living room and Misato began to tell her about their day so far without anyone prompting her to do so.
与此同时，真嗣和明日香尴尬地交换了一个眼神，随后跟着美里和丽进入公寓。丽尴尬地坐在客厅，美里则主动向她讲述起当天的事情，尽管没人要求她这么做。

"So then, we were there and I was trying to sing, and then the news caster was all 'Give me back my microphone!' and I was all 'Nu-uh!' and she was all 'Yuh-huh!' and I was 'Nu-uh!' and she was 'Yuh-huh!'..." Misato paused as she took a drink from her beer and let out a whoop, before she continued her story. "Good thing Asuka was there to drive me for the first visit to the shrine."
当时，我们就在现场，我正试着唱歌，突然新闻播报员喊道：'把麦克风还给我！'我回应：'不给！'她坚持：'给我！'我又说：'不给！'她再次强调：'给我！'..." 三乡停下来，喝了一口啤酒，欢呼一声，接着讲述她的经历。"多亏了明日香，第一次去神社时是她开车载我去的。

Rei blinked before she stared at the two teenagers, frowning before staring back at Misato who was checking several of the bags to make sure she had gotten everything.
丽眨了眨眼，随后凝视着那两位少年，眉头微蹙，接着又转头望向正在核对几个袋子，确保没落下任何东西的葛城。

"I thought going to a shrine was on New Year's Day?"
我原以为去神社是在元旦那天。

"Uh... ye-yeah? It was?" Misato said as she sported a nervous smile now that the charade was out in the open, since she already knew Asuka's reaction was an incoming question in a high, shrill voice.
"呃...是、是的？真的吗？" 美里脸上挂着紧张的微笑，既然伪装已被揭穿，她已预感到明日香即将用尖锐高亢的声音提出疑问。

"What! Misato! You mean you made me wake up and drive you there on purpose!"
什么！美里！你是故意让我醒来，好开车送你过去的吗！

Shinji sighed as Rei stayed with the same expression she always had, while Misato began to try and appease the redhead, trying to find something to divert her attention with.
真嗣叹息着，绫波依旧面无表情，美里则开始安抚那位红发少女，试图找些事情来转移她的注意力。

"Not at all! It wasn't planned, really! Now come on... you two need to get the other pine gate ready so we can start going to the end of year party and have a song off... red vs. white!"
绝对不是！这完全是即兴的！快点吧...你们俩得把另一扇松木门准备好，我们好去参加年终派对，来一场红队与白队的歌曲较量！

"What do you mean a song off?" Asuka retorted while Misato attempted to explain, and Shinji simply wanted to get this done and over with and Rei just sat there, staring as everyone went about on their particular way.
"你说的'一首歌停了'是什么意思？" 明日香反驳道，美里正努力解释，真嗣只想尽快了结此事，而零则静静坐着，目睹众人各自忙碌。

"In Japan, it's customary to have a song off at the end of the year; there's a show for that called Kohaku Uta Gassen which revolves around this," Misato began as she pulled out her phone, shifting through the music it had stored before she put some upbeat tempo music. "In the show, you have the red team, and the white team, each one has music superstars! J-pop, Visual Kei,Enza…and they hold a song off! This year the red team's getting Mitsuishi!"
在日本，年末举行歌曲对决是一种传统；为此有一个名为'红白歌会'的节目，专门围绕这一传统进行。"Misato 边说边掏出手机，翻阅着里面的音乐库，随后播放了一些节奏欢快的曲子。"在节目中，分为红队和白队，每队都汇聚了众多音乐巨星，包括 J-pop、视觉系、Enza 等风格。他们将进行一场激烈的歌曲对决！今年红队将迎来 Mitsuishi 的加盟！

"That sounds silly." Asuka mumbled but Misato simply waved it off, before turning to Rei and making a motion with her head towards Shinji and Asuka.
"这话听着挺傻的。" 明日香小声嘀咕，美里却不以为意地摆了摆手，随即转向绫波，用头示意了一下真嗣和明日香的方向。

"Hey Rei, wanna help them?" Katsuragi asked as she tried to hold in the sad look and sigh she was feeling at Rei being alone even when sitting in a table with her teammates; sometimes it felt like the bluehaired girl was trying to do everything in her power to keep herself outside of reach, and other times, times like these, it felt like Rei just didn't really care about anything or anyone, not even herself.
"嘿，绫，想帮他们一把吗？" 葛城问道，同时尽力隐藏自己因看到绫虽与队友同桌却形单影只而感到的悲伤和叹息。有时，她觉得绫似乎在用尽全力与他人保持距离，而另一些时刻，比如现在，又觉得绫对一切漠不关心，连自己也不例外。

"If I'm ordered to, I will."
如果接到命令，我会执行。

"Well...if you don't want to, you don't have to." Asuka grumbled as she looked up ignoring Shinji's look and Misato's frown, even if it wasn't directed at the redhead, but rather at the rope she was now weaving.
"好吧...如果你不愿意，大可不必勉强。" 明日香嘟囔着，抬头忽略了真嗣的目光和美里的皱眉，虽然这并非针对她，而是她正在编织的绳子。

"Hey, that's wrong, you need to get a red thread in there."
嘿，这不对，你得在里面穿一根红线。

"Huh? What's that supposed to mean?" Asuka asked as she looked at the rope and then at Misato before staring back at the rope as Katsuragi grabbed the rope gently, setting it down on the basin and making sure it would soak the sake poured inside before extracting a length of red thread, staring at both girls with a toothy grin while Shinji kept working.
"嗯？这是什么意思？" 明日香疑惑地问道，目光在绳子和美里之间来回移动。葛城轻柔地将绳子置于盆中，确保倒入的清酒能浸透它，随后抽出一根红线，露出得意的笑容看着两位女孩，而真嗣则在一旁继续忙碌。

"Oh come on... you don't know that?" Misato chastised Asuka jokingly, while Rei closed the book she had been reading and placed it on her lap, staring at Misato, awaiting for the explanation.
"哎呀，别这样... 你真的不知道？" 美里带着笑意调侃明日香，与此同时，绫波轻轻合上书本，置于腿上，目光转向美里，静候其解释。

"It seems young people need to be reminded of that custom, wouldn't you agree, Katsuragi?"
看来年轻人得有人提醒一下那个习俗了，桂木，你说是吧？

"Kaji!" Both Misato and Asuka exclaimed at the same time, the redhead standing up and running to where the ponytail-sporting man was standing by the entrance while Misato offered him a small, shy smile.
"Kaji!" Misato 和 Asuka 异口同声地喊道，红发的 Asuka 起身奔向门口，那里站着扎着马尾的 Kaji，而 Misato 则向他投去一个略带羞涩的微笑。

"Where have you been? I missed you!" Asuka exclaimed while Kaji patted her head gently, smiling.
"你去哪了？我好想你啊！" 明日香激动地说，加持则面带微笑，温柔地拍了拍她的头。

"You know me, had some things to do, but I managed to get free for this end of year party," Kaji said with practiced ease as he walked towards and sat next to Misato, taking the red thread she was holding in her hand and began to twist it into the braided rope as if he had done this a thousand times.
"你知道的，我手头有些事，不过还是抽空来参加这个年终聚会了，" 薰说着，轻松地走到美里身边坐下，顺手接过她手中的红线，熟练地编起绳索，动作流畅得仿佛已重复过无数次。

"Whatever; I need to go take a shower before we leave." Asuka's tone was gruff, as if trying to tell Kaji she hadn't really missed him that much, and the Nerv agent simply smiled, letting it slide because he knew the redhead better; he could see the redhead was trying hard to not let anyone see her face, keeping her eyes down, and using her hair to cover her cheeks.
"不管怎样，我得先去洗个澡再出发。" 明日香语气中带着一丝不耐，仿佛在告诉加持她并没有那么想念他。然而，这位 Nerv 特工只是微微一笑，没有深究，因为他深知这位红发少女的性子；他察觉到她正努力掩饰自己的表情，低垂着目光，用发丝遮掩着脸颊。

"Alright, I just came to pick up some of the stuff anyway, so I'll see you at the party, right kid?" Kaji asked with a good natured tone as Asuka nodded looking over her shoulder and giving Kaji a small smile before disappearing inside the bathroom as Kaji sat next to Misato and asked her if all the things were ready before Rei spoke in a quiet tone of voice.
"行吧，我过来就是拿点东西，派对上见，小家伙。" 薰和蔼地问道，明日香点头回应，回头对薰微微一笑，随即走进浴室。薰在美里身边坐下，询问一切是否准备妥当，此时丽轻声开口。

"Agent Kaji... would you please inform me of the significance of this red thread?"
卡吉特工...能否告知这条红线有何重要意义？

Kaji blinked before turning to Misato, holding her hand in his, and interlacing his fingers with hers.
加治眨了眨眼，随即转向美里，握紧她的手，手指与她的交织在一起。

"Some people believe that when you are born, you are already predestined to be with someone and a red thread binds you to this person; it connects you, growing shorter and shorter with each passing day until you two are together," the spy said as she looked up and stared at Misato's eyes, smiling and speaking in a soft, gentle hush as he grabbed some of the leftover pieces of thread and began to wave them into a thin wristlet, before showing them to Shinji and Rei. "So, this red thread symbolizes the fate that binds us, and that makes us be together despite not knowing so."
有些人相信，从出生那一刻起，你便注定与某人相伴，一根红线将你们紧紧相连；随着日子一天天过去，这根线逐渐缩短，直至你们相遇。"间谍抬头望向碇真嗣，目光交汇，微笑着，用温柔的语气低声说道，同时拾起几缕余线，巧妙地编成一条细腕带，向碇真嗣和绫波丽展示。"这红线，便是象征着我们之间不可知的命运纽带，让我们终将相聚。

"On each new year, we weave a red thread on the rope, to remind ourselves of the other one... and hope that this year, is the last year we spent apart," Misato said in the same tone of voice, before she broke into a small, peaceful smile, strangely intoxicating and alluring, yet contagious, somehow making Rei and Shinji smile back at both adults. "The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of time, place or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break."
每年新年，我们都会在绳子上系上一根红线，以此提醒自己思念着的那个人...并期盼今年是我们分隔两地的最后一年。"Misato 用同样的语调说道，随后她绽放出一个宁静而迷人的微笑，这微笑既神秘又吸引人，且具有感染力，使得 Rei 和 Shinji 也不禁对两位成年人报以微笑。"被红线相连的两人，无论时空如何变迁，都是命中注定的爱侣。这根神奇的线或许会伸缩或纠结，但绝不会断裂。

The last words echoed nicely in the otherwise silent living room, only the background noise of Pen-Pen watching an old romance movie could be heard; the male lead vowing the female protagonist never to leave her, and that, even if in the past he had treated her badly, he would endure, and he would stay, while the female kept arguing, pushing him away before silence reigned, and all that could be heard from the Tv was the sound of moaning the came after a deep kiss.
最后一句话在静谧的客厅中回荡得恰如其分，唯有背景中 Pen-Pen 观看的老爱情片声音可闻；男主角向女主角承诺永不离开，尽管过去曾亏待她，他仍将坚守，不离不弃。女主角则不断争执，试图推开他，随后一切归于寂静，电视里只剩下深吻后传来的呻吟声。

"I should start to get ready as well," Shinji said as he got up and stared at the pine gate, before making his way to his room. Kaji stared at the boy's retreating back before he pulled the pine gate towards him, and began to finish tying everything up while Misato continued to talk with Rei.
"我也该准备起来了，" 真嗣边说边起身，目光停留在松木门上，随后朝自己的房间走去。加持目送着少年的背影，接着拉上松木门，着手完成最后的绑扎，与此同时，美里仍在与绫波交谈。

"Here Rei... this one's yours," Misato said as she placed one of the wristlets on the girl's hand, tying it while Rei simply stared at it as if the thing caused her a rash.
"绫波，这个是你的，" 葛城说着，将一个腕带轻轻戴在女孩手上，系好。绫波静静地凝视着腕带，仿佛它让她感到不适。

"I do not understand..." Rei's soft voice was heard after a moment as she grabbed the red thread tied around her wrist and turned to Misato, eyes full of child-like curiosity before she spoke again in an eerie, quiet tone. "What should I do with it? Leave it on my wrist for the whole year?"
我不太懂……" 片刻后，绫波轻声说道，她握住手腕上系着的红线，转向美里，眼中闪烁着孩童般的好奇，随后她以一种幽幽的、平静的口吻再次开口："我该拿它怎么办？就这样让它在我手腕上绑一年吗？

"Well, yeah... you have to keep it for this new year and you can give it back to me by the end of this New Year that is about to start," Misato answered with a small giggle while Rei stared at the offending red piece of fabric, as if wondering if she could take it off in this moment, even after Misato had said, and Rei herself had accepted the burden of wearing it for the next 365 days.
"嗯，没错...你得留着它直到这个新年结束，然后在新的一年开始之际还给我，" 三笠笑着回答，而丽则凝视着那块刺眼的红色布料，似乎在犹豫是否能立刻脱下，即便三笠已有言在先，丽也已接受了这个为期一年的负担。

"Why is that?" 那是为什么呢？

"See the way the red thread is mostly hidden?" Misato pointed out as she showed Rei how, indeed the red thread seemed to be woven into the tan rope, making it invisible to the casual look. "The legend says that whoever notices the red thread is the one who is destined for you."
看那红线是不是大部分都藏起来了？" 碇真嗣向绫波丽指出，并展示给她看，红线确实巧妙地被织入棕色绳索中，不仔细看几乎察觉不到。"传说里说，能发现这红线的人，就是命中注定与你结缘的人。

Rei looked at her wristlet once more, focusing on it, before turning to Misato, nodding calmly and then turning towards Kaji, bowing slightly.
绫再次凝视手腕上的带子，随后转向美里，平静地点了点头，接着又向卡吉微微鞠了一躬。

"I apologize for taking Lt. Col. Katsuragi away from you."
很抱歉，我带走了加藤木中校，给您添麻烦了。

Kaji blinked before he let out a hearty chuckle, followed by Misato's own curious but amused smile, just as Shinji and Asuka walked out dressed and ready to go to the party.
加治眨了眨眼，随即发出一阵爽朗的笑声，美里也露出了好奇而愉悦的微笑，此时真嗣和明日香已穿戴整齐，准备出发去参加派对。

"Ok, so everyone's ready?" Misato asked as she closed the door and turned to Shinji and Asuka who were holding the other pine gate between them, while Rei kept staring at the wristlet she was now wearing as Misato tied her scarf and buttoned her jacket up.
"好了，大家都准备好了吗？" Misato 关上门，转向 Shinji 和 Asuka 问道，他们正合力扶着另一扇松木门。与此同时，Rei 专注地看着她手腕上新戴的腕带，而 Misato 则系好围巾，扣上外套的扣子。

"Alright, Me and Rei are gonna go ahead and wait for Kaji to show up and then we're heading to the shrine," Katsuragi indicated as she grabbed Rei's hand and turned to Shinji and Asuka who were trying to get the pine gate exactly parallel to the other one, getting into a minor argument over if it was correctly squared out or not. "So don't be too late you guys, remember... sing off!"
好了，我和绫波先过去，等加持先生一到我们就去神社，"葛城说着，拉起绫波的手，看向正在为松木门是否与另一扇门完全对齐而争论不休的碇和明日香。"你们别太晚哦，记得... 唱完歌再走！

"I still don't get it why Kaji had to go on ahead," Asuka grumbled as both she and Shinji placed the pine gate on the ground, framing the entrance to Misato's home.
"我始终没搞懂，卡吉为何要先行一步，" 明日香不满地嘟囔，她和真嗣一同将松木门安置好，为美里家的入口添上了框架。

"He said he wanted to make sure the preparations were ready," Shinji answered back, and his tone of voice made it clear he wasn't really getting into the festivities of the moment... something that irritated Asuka to no end, and as such, she felt obliged to tell Shinji about her in her usual subtle way.
"他说要确认准备工作是否妥当，"真嗣回应着，语气中透露出他并未真正投入此刻的欢庆...这让明日香极为不悦，于是她便以一贯的含蓄方式向真嗣表达了自己的情绪。

"Hey! Stop moping around," Asuka exclaimed as she looked at Shinji out of the corner of her eye. "Isn't this supposed to be like the big celebration for Japanese people all over? You should be happy"
嘿！别垂头丧气的，" 明日香斜眼瞥向真嗣，大声说道。"这可是全日本人的盛大庆典啊，你该高兴点儿。

Shinji shrugged before he stayed where he was and turned to look out the railing of the hall and into the night sky, a reflexive look on his face before he sighed and turned to look at Asuka, digging his hands in his coat pocket.
真嗣耸耸肩，原地不动，转身透过走廊栏杆凝视夜空，脸上流露出本能的神情，接着轻叹一声，转头望向明日香，双手插进大衣口袋。

"Fine, if you wanna mope then do it; it's not like I care or anything."
行吧，你要是真想郁闷就郁闷去吧，我无所谓。

"It's not moping! I...uh...:"Shinji said, stammering as Asuka turned to him, not really saying anything which made Shinji self-conscious, staring quietly as the redhead faced him, closer... almost touching, which made Shinji blush as Asuka stared at him with a strange look in her face, focusing on his neck before she reached towards him.
这可不是消沉！我...呃...：Shinji 结结巴巴地说，当 Asuka 转过身来，并没有真正说什么，这让 Shinji 感到有些局促不安。他静静地注视着，红发的 Asuka 靠近他，几乎要触碰到，这让 Shinji 脸颊泛红。Asuka 用一种异样的表情凝视着他，目光聚焦在他的脖颈上，随后伸出手来。

"Hey, wait... you have something..."
嘿，等等...你好像有东西...

"Huh?" 嗯？

"You got some red stupid thread hanging out from your shirt." Asuka pointed out as she pulled the red thread Shinji had been using to tie the rope used to secure the pine gate away, showing Shinji the small piece of fabric.
"你衬衫上挂着一根红色的线头，挺碍眼的。" 明日香说着，顺手扯掉了真嗣用来固定松木门的那根红线，向他展示了那小片布料。

"Uh... that's my..." Shinji began but Asuka shushed him as she grabbed the collar of his button-down shirt with both hands, grumbling softly to herself as she pulled down the garment.
"呃...那是我的..." 真嗣正要解释，却被明日香嘘声打断。她双手紧抓他的衬衫领口，一边低声抱怨，一边用力拉扯着衣服。

Asuka said the last part with a little toss of her head, as well as a small sarcastic smile that somehow managed to take away all the bite and sting out of the words, leaving shinji with the sinking feeling of wanting to answer, before the redhead turned around and walked to the already waiting elevator.
明日香在说完最后那段话时，轻轻甩了甩头，脸上带着一丝讽刺的微笑，这微笑巧妙地化解了话语的锋芒，让真嗣心中涌起一股想要回应的冲动。随后，这位红发少女便转身走向了等候已久的电梯。

"That was a goood party. You kids... you two're gonna be stayin' alone tonight... so don' do n'thing I wouldn't do..."
那派对真不错。你们两个孩子今晚得单独在家...记住，别做我不会做的事哦。

Asuka rolled her eyes, frustrated, as Shinji tried not to buckle under the weight of Misato who was laughing as if her lungs were collapsing on themselves, struggling to carry the older, clearly drunken woman, deciding to readjust his right arm a bit higher to better keep her in an upright posi-
明日香不耐烦地翻了个白眼，而真嗣则竭力支撑着，不让醉醺醺的美里压垮自己。美里笑得几乎喘不过气来，真嗣只好将右臂稍作调整，以便更稳当地扶住她，让她保持直立

What's this soft, pillowy feeling in my ha-
我头发里这种柔软蓬松的感觉是怎么回事？

"Shinji-kun! You shouldn't cop a feel from a poor defenseless woman like me in my current stage." Misato giggled as Shinji blushed furiously and Asuka let out another long suffering sigh, while Kaji and Ritsuko simply smiled at their drunken friend's antics.
"真嗣君！在我这种无助的状态下，你可不能趁机占我便宜哦。" 美里咯咯笑着，真嗣满脸通红，明日香再次发出一声无奈的叹息，而加持和律子则微笑着看着他们那位醉醺醺的朋友的滑稽行为。

"I still can't believe you actually tried to drink all the sake in that big bottle, Misato." Ritsuko said, letting out an exasperated sigh as Misato giggled uncontrollably, like a child being told the funniest joke ever, while flashing a victory sign.
"我真是难以置信，你居然真的想把那大瓶清酒一饮而尽，美里。" 律子叹息着说，而美里则笑得像个听到绝妙笑话的孩子，还不忘比划着胜利的手势。

"Alright Katsuragi, you've clearly had more than enough to drink; time to take you home." Kaji exclaimed while Ritsuko knelt down and offered her friend some water, which Misato ignored to turn and stare woozily at Kaji, speaking in a quiet whisper of a voice, as if she were afraid of waking up someone, maybe herself.
"好了，葛城，你显然已经喝过头了；该带你回家了。" 卡吉大声说道，而律子蹲下身递给她的朋友一些水，但三佐却视而不见，转而醉醺醺地凝视着卡吉，用一种仿佛怕惊扰到谁，或许是她自己的轻声细语说道。

"Do I get a piggy back ride this time too, Kaji?"
这次我还能得到背背吗，加治？

"You know the rule... everytime you get drunk, you get a piggy back ride." The Nerv agent confirmed in a small voice before turning around, kneeling down and waiting for the officer to climb up his back, closing his arms in a half-circle and resting his palms under Misato's thighs to give her a better, more cushiony seat.
"你清楚规矩的...每次喝醉，就得享受一次背背服务。"NERV 特工低声确认后，转身跪下，等待警官爬上他的背，双臂环成半圆，手掌稳稳托住葛城美里的腿下，确保她坐得既稳当又舒适。

"Wait, wait, wait!" Misato exclaimed just as Kaji and Ritsuko were walking past the red Tori gate, complete with the pine gates at the entrance. Kaji stopped and looked at Misato who shuffled down form her place on his back, stumbling towards the gate, staring at it with a serious face and an intense look before clapping three times sharply, and bowing her head with respect, speaking in a mumbled tone, mostly to herself, even if Shinji could make out the phrase that his older roommate said.
"等等，等等，等等！" 就在加持和律子即将穿过那座红色的鸟居，以及入口处的松木门时，美里突然大声喊停。加持驻足，看着美里从他背上下来，步履蹒跚地走向鸟居，面容严肃，眼神凝重，接着用力拍手三下，低头致敬，用几乎只有自己能听见的声音低语，尽管真嗣还是捕捉到了他的室友所说的话。

"Please keep the three of them safe this year... please."
今年请务必保护好他们三个... 拜托了。

Kaji and Ritsuko, Asuka and Rei, they all heard it as well, and kept a respectful silence, as Misato slowly began to get up, her shoulders shaking ever so slightly as she let out a couple of sobs before turning over to Kaji and Ritsuko, extending her arms wordlessly as her on-again, off-again boyfriend simply welcomed her with arms wide open, picking her up and carrying the drunken woman in his back once more.
加持与律子，还有明日香和零，同样听见了这一切，他们保持着庄重的静默。美里慢慢站起来，肩膀微颤，几声抽泣后，她转向加持和律子，默默伸出双臂。她那关系时好时坏的男友则敞开怀抱，热情接纳，又一次将醉倒的她背负起来。

All three children remained quiet, watching as the adults walked away, Kaji smiling, carrying his precious cargo, Misato giggling, a bit embarrased, but clearly enjoying as Kaji showed his affection, while Ritsuko kept talking and arguing about things in her usual calm, detached, critical manner, before their voices slowly began to fade away.
三个孩子静静地站着，目送大人们离开，加持面带微笑，怀抱珍贵之物，美里则咯咯笑，虽有些尴尬，却明显享受着加持的宠爱。与此同时，律子保持着一贯的冷静、超然态度，批判性地讨论着各种话题，直到他们的声音逐渐消失在远处。

Shinji stared for a moment before turning to Asuka and Rei, shrugging.
真嗣凝视片刻后，转向明日香和绫波，轻轻地耸了耸肩。

"Guess it's time to go home as well."
看来也该回家了。

Rei nodded before she turned around and began to walk away, stopping shortly before turning to Shinji and Asuka, bowing at her waist respectfully and staring back at them calmly.
绫点头后转身离去，走了几步又停下，面向真嗣和明日香，恭敬地弯腰行礼，然后平静地注视着他们。

"Akemashite omedeto gozaimasu."
新年好，恭喜发财。

Both children blinked before Rei turned and walked away too, before they realized they were alone, in the middle of the night, a few hours away form the end of the year and they still had to go walking back to their home.
两个孩子眨了眨眼，Rei 随即转身离去，直到他们察觉到自己孤零零地站在深夜中，距离年末不过数小时，还得徒步返回住处。

Both of them turned to each other, seeing the people that was still waiting for the last part of the program; the voting has started, which meant it was 11:30.
两人相视，注意到还有人在等待节目的尾声；此时投票已启动，时间指向了 11:30。

"Guess this is it then..." Shinji began in a quiet voice as Asuka stood next to him, staring at the lights and smoke and hearing the cheers of the people that were still on the stage, before he noticed Asuka was staring at his wrist, before the boy noticed that the wristlet Kaji had left for him was in plain sight.
"看来这就是结局了..." 真嗣低声说道，明日香站在他旁边，目光穿过舞台上的灯光与烟雾，耳边是人们的欢呼声。他察觉到明日香正注视着他的手腕，这才意识到加持留给他的手环正暴露无遗。

"Hey Shinji, what is with your and the red thread?Is this one of your weird Japanese things?"
嘿，真嗣，你和那根红线有什么关系？这是不是你那些奇特的日本风俗之一？

Shinji opened his mouth before he realized that, like always there was nothing to say or add, the year was ending, and the red thread story, while good to pass the time, was nothing but that; a story. Shinji had never believed in destiny a lot; for him, life was just a series of events; some unfortunate, some not, but none were predestined to exist.
真嗣张开嘴，却发觉和往常一样，无话可说，也无事可补充。岁月将尽，那段红线故事虽能消磨时光，终究只是个故事。真嗣对命运并不笃信，他认为生活不过是一连串事件：有的不幸，有的则否，但无一事是命中注定。

And yet, sometimes... it felt like his life had been given to him for the express purpose of being here, in Tokyo-3, with the people that were around him, with everyone he knew.
然而，有时...他觉得自己的一生似乎就是为了来到东京-3，与身边的人共度时光，与所有他认识的人相聚。

For better or for worse, his destiny was linked to the city and the evas, to the secrets that Nerv held and the relationships he would find on the people sharing his life.
不论境遇如何，他的命运已与这座城市、与伊娃斯、与内尔所守护的秘密，以及他与共度时光的人们之间的纽带紧密交织。

And that included the redhead who was now staring at him smiling a mischievous smile before she stepped in front of him, staring at his eyes and making the boy involuntarily shrink away.
其中就包括那位红发女孩，她此时正盯着他，脸上挂着一抹顽皮的笑容，然后走到他跟前，直视他的双眼，使得男孩不由自主地往后缩了缩。

"Don't worry about it..." Shinji said and, in a rare occurrence, managed to give Asuka a smile, which made the redhead blink before she quickly looked away, crossing her arms under her chest and giving Shinji an angry look at something she had perceived, before they both heard the sound of the people that were no cheering for the red team.
"别担心..." 真嗣说着，难得地向明日香展露了笑容，令红发的她不禁眨眼，随即别开目光，双臂抱胸，对真嗣投去怒视，仿佛捕捉到了什么不悦。此时，两人耳边响起了那些不再为红队喝彩的人群声。

"You should leave it..." The redhead said after a moment before she gave Shinji a side way glance and shrugged her shoulders as if what she was about to say was as trivial as discussing the color of the grass. "Red kind of looks good on you."
你还是留着它吧..."红发女子顿了一下，然后侧目看了真嗣一眼，随意地耸了耸肩，似乎她即将说的话就跟谈论草地颜色一样平常。"红色挺衬你的。

The last words were accompanied by a small blush in the redhead's cheeks, which made Shinji chuckle to himself before he slowly relaxed and slipped into their natural routine of exchanging banter back and forth.
红发少女最后的话语让脸颊泛起淡淡红晕，真嗣见状不禁轻笑，随后他渐渐放松，两人又回到了你来我往的调侃日常。

"That's because you like red."
这是因为红色是你的最爱。

Asuka opened her mouth, but closed it quickly, before she looked away, shuffling her feet uncomfortably, looking away before she turned to Shinji and closed her eyes tightly, as if she was fighting herself and finally had decided to just give up.
明日香本欲开口，却又迅速合上双唇，她转头避开，脚尖不安地挪动，目光移开后，她面对真嗣，紧闭双眼，似乎在与内心的挣扎中选择了屈服。

Wordlessly, the redhead stepped in closer, entering Shinji's personal space, before she grabbed Shinji's hand, pulling it towards her face and showing Shinji the red thread within, before she spoke.
红发女子无声地靠近，踏入了真嗣的私人领域，紧接着握住他的手，将其拉至自己面前，向他展示那根红线，随后才开口。

"I want my red thread ."
我想要我的红色线。

That was all she said, that was all it took; Shinji tried to get a word or tow out but Asuka was quicker than him; she slid her hand behind his neck and pushed him towards, meeting him halfway, capturing his lips and kissing him gently, softly, and with new found need..
她只说了这些，仅此而已；真嗣本想插话，但明日香动作更快；她伸手轻抚他的后颈，将他拉近，主动迎上，温柔而充满新生的渴望，吻上了他的唇。

And as the clock struck twelve and the crowd cheered on, and the fireworks lit up everything around them, Asuka pulled Shinji towards her lips, sealing the last year with a kiss, and starting the new one in a different place than the one they both had been before.
随着午夜钟声的敲响，人群的欢呼声中，烟花绚烂地照亮了四周，明日香拉近真嗣，以一个吻结束了旧岁，并在一个全新的起点迎接了新年。

标题：领悟言外之意

Disclaimer: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
免责声明：我在此声明以自保：Eva 及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

Disclaimer 2: Based on the short story "The girlfriend dilemma" by Livek.
免责声明 2：取材自 Livek 所著短篇小说《女友的难题》。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

The sun had already gone down and the sky was just beginning to turn dark when Shinji blinked, realizing he had been staring at the window on top of the house's second floor for quite some time before he finally decided to knock on the door.
太阳已西沉，天色渐暗，真嗣眨了眨眼，意识到自己盯着二楼的窗户发呆了好一阵子，这才下定决心去敲门。

The first series of knocks went without an answer and the black-haired boy wondered, for just a moment, if he should stay here and try again, or if he should just leave.
首次敲门未获回应，黑发少年稍作迟疑，思索着是该留下再敲，还是索性离去。

Before he could make that choice, however, he heard the sound of rustling, followed by a couple of curses in German before a voice from inside finally answered Shinji.
然而，在他做出决定前，一阵窸窣声响起，随后传来几句德语的咒骂，紧接着屋内终于有人回应了真嗣。

"Alright, alright already! I'm coming!"
行了行了，别催了！我马上就来！

Shinji looked down, waiting for her to open the door while the memories of the events of the days replayed themselves on his mind, again.
真嗣垂下目光，静候她开启门扉，那几日的记忆又一次在心头回放。

And it was then that he realized his mind was still blanking out, and that all he knew was that he HAD to know; he just HAD to find out somehow.
就在那一刻，他察觉到自己的脑海依旧一片空白，他唯一清楚的是，他必须弄明白；他必须设法探知真相。

The sky... it's so blue...
天空啊... 真是蓝得深邃...

Shinji sighed as he lay on his back on the roof of school, covering half of his face with his right arm while holding his music player with his left hand, enjoying the feeling of being alone.
真嗣躺在学校屋顶，轻叹一声，右臂遮住半张脸，左手握着音乐播放器，沉浸在独自一人的宁静中。

The day had started kind of normal, boring even for him; he had woken up and before he had left his mom had told him that both his father and her would be out of the city for the weekend, attending some sort of company-sponsored retirement party or something.
那天开始得颇为寻常，对他而言甚至有些无聊；他醒来后，离家前，妈妈告诉他，她和爸爸这个周末都不在城里，要去参加一个公司举办的退休庆祝活动。

This meant, for Shinji at least, free time to lounge in the house; to do nothing but watch the TV or played games, already thinking about holding a late night free-for-all session inviting over his friends.
至少对真嗣而言，这意味着有了在家悠闲度日的自由时光；他除了看电视或玩游戏，还开始盘算着举办一场深夜的狂欢派对，邀请好友们共聚一堂。

Now that I think about it, where are Toji and Kensuke? Shinji's wondered, turning towards the roof access door, while still thinking about what games to video games to play later tonight.
仔细一想，东治和健介跑哪儿去了？真嗣一边这么想着，一边朝通往屋顶的门走去，心里还在盘算着晚上该玩哪款电子游戏。

That was before he felt a shadow over him, even if no one was near, but Shinji knew that simply by the top of the head, and how the hands were at the waist it could mean only one person.
那是在他察觉到头顶笼罩阴影之前，虽然四周无人，但真嗣仅凭头顶的感觉和双手叉腰的姿态，便知那只能是某个人。

"Hey idiot." 喂，傻瓜。

Asuka Langley Soryu. 明日香·兰格雷。

Shinji blinked before looking over at the redhead, keeping a neutral face as Asuka dropped a box on his stomach without saying anything.
真嗣眨了眨眼，转头望向那位红发少女，面无表情地看着明日香默不作声地将一个箱子砸在他的腹部。

The box made a hollow, foreboding sound making Shinji look at it as if trying to understand what this meant while Asuka stayed there staring at him as if to prevent him from standing up, locking her eyes against his.
盒子传出的空洞声带着不祥的预感，令真嗣凝视着它，试图揣摩其中含义。与此同时，明日香站在一旁，目不转睛地盯着他，仿佛在阻止他起身，她的眼神紧紧锁定了他的视线。

Shinji couldn't help but feel as if Asuka was expecting him to do something given the way she held her place, but she wasn't saying anything, so he got up half way as she stared at him expectantly before picking up the box, almost asking what it was.
真嗣感觉到明日香似乎在期待他有所行动，从她那保持的姿势中可以察觉到，然而她并未开口，于是他在她那充满期待的眼神下缓缓起身，拿起盒子，仿佛在无声询问这是何物。

"It's a box of course. What are you? A moron?" Asuka would say, rolling her eyes with a little smirk; the kind that she always used when stating the obvious even while he kept looking for that something he was supposed to intuitively know, feeling like a detective of sorts, even though it was eluding him.
"这显然是个盒子。你难道是傻子吗？" 明日香会带着一丝嘲讽的微笑，翻着白眼说道。每当她指出显而易见的事情时，他还在努力寻找那个他本应直觉知道的东西，感觉自己像个侦探，尽管答案总是躲着他。

And Shinji figured he wasn't going to be getting any answers from the box, feeling like something was missing something here, something that should be self-evident, he realized, turning the box over in his hands, looking for -
新二意识到从盒子里得不到答案，总觉得缺了点什么，本该不言而喻的东西。他翻来覆去地摆弄着盒子，试图找出——

What am I looking for?
我究竟在找什么？

The question was so existential and simple, it made Shinji wonder for a second if this was the ultimate question every man should ask and ponder for themselves, making him feel like one of those characters from the books his teacher would go on and on about.
这个问题既存在主义又简单，让真嗣不禁怀疑，这或许就是每个人应当自问并深思的终极问题，让他感觉自己仿佛化身为老师口中那些故事里的角色。

Kaji would go on and on about how those characters were deeply human and flawed, character that seem to always be the staple of the English literature works he seemed to like; the kind that were exiles and outcasts, yet aware of their destiny, sailing towards it with a sense of indolence that seemed to permeate in every single word used to explain how a man should stand and face the upcoming storm while still being the captain of his ship and master of his soul.
加治总是不厌其烦地讲述那些角色，他们深具人性且充满瑕疵，仿佛是他所钟爱的英国文学作品中的标志性人物；他们是流亡者，是社会的边缘人，却对自己的命运有着清醒的认识，带着一种似乎渗透在每个描述一个人应如何站立并面对即将到来的风暴的词语中的慵懒，同时仍是自己命运的舵手和灵魂的主人。

But it was hard to feel like that: Shinji was just an awkward teenager trying to stay in the shadows of the people around him, too scared of being the center of attention and that tended to shy away when the spotlight threatened to be above him.
但要感受到这一点并不容易：真嗣不过是个笨拙的少年，总想在他人影子里藏身，对成为焦点心存畏惧，一旦聚光灯可能照过来，他便本能地退缩。

He didn't have the required mysterious, magnetic and charismatic personality Kaji seemed to exude, or the disrespect for rank and privilege Toji showed.
他缺乏梶那种神秘、磁性且充满魅力的气质，也不像东地那样对等级和特权抱有轻蔑态度。

Except when dealing with Hikari.
除非涉及光（Hikari）的情况。

He wasn't cool or sophisticated and educated like Kaworu, or jaded and world-weary like Musashi; in fact, even Keita and Kensuke seemed to be a better cast as one of those heroes, what with their high level of intelligence and perception.
他既没有薰那种冷静、世故且学识渊博的气质，也不像武藏那样厌倦世俗、历经沧桑；实际上，启太和健介凭借其高智商和敏锐洞察力，似乎更适合扮演这类英雄角色。

Because the sad fact was Shinji could never visualize himself as anything BUT Shinji.
可悲的是，真嗣始终无法想象自己不是真嗣的样子。

Another sharp-sounding tap made Shinji look up, noticing Asuka's look of annoyance which made it very clear this wasn't a Zen-Koan riddle either, which made him painfully aware that this was something he was supposed to figure out by himself; if only Toji or Kensuke were here, Shinji was sure he would have a chance at getting an explanation, or maybe a good diversion thanks to Kensuke making an ass out of himself or Toji getting into a heated argument with the redhead.
又一声尖锐的敲击声让真嗣抬头，只见明日香一脸不悦，显然这不是禅宗公案的谜题，而是需要他自己去领悟的事情。他不禁想，要是东治或健介在场，或许能得到解释，或者因为健介出丑或东治与红发女孩激烈争论而转移话题。

But for some reason they were both later than usual, and Shinji realized time was a precious commodity he really didn't have, so he decided to bite the bullet and get it over with prompted by Asuka changing her stance as her hands went from being balled at her waist to being crossed at her chest and her glare deepened which, in turn, made Shinji began to try and work the box open, finally succeeding in doing so to reveal what was inside.
不知何故，他们俩都比往常晚到，真嗣意识到时间对他而言极为宝贵，便决定硬着头皮，速战速决。明日香此时将双手从腰间紧握改为交叉胸前，目光更加锐利，这一变化促使真嗣开始努力打开盒子，最终成功揭开了其中的秘密。

Chocolate. 巧克力。

"It's chocolate." Shinji managed to say after finding his voice as his tongue sneaked out to wet his lips and he kept his eyes glued on the box.
"是巧克力。" 真嗣终于开口说道，他不由自主地舔了舔嘴唇，目光始终未离开那盒巧克力。

"How perceptive." Asuka's voice was snide and biting.
"真是敏锐。"明日香的声音尖锐而带刺。

"Valentine's Day is tomorrow." Shinji pointed out, and the simplicity of the sentence made Asuka snort in a very unladylike way, and probably roll her eyes or shake her head with her arms still crossed at her chest because that was the way she normally reacted when someone pointed out the obvious.
"明天就是情人节了。" 碇真嗣的话简单明了，让明日香忍不住嗤之以鼻，她可能还翻了个白眼或摇了摇头，双臂依旧交叉在胸前，这正是她对别人指出显而易见之事时的惯常反应。

And Shinji felt that when it came to him and Asuka, he was always pointing out the obvious.
真嗣感到，一谈到他和明日香，他似乎总是在重复那些不言而喻的事实。

"Your intelligence leaves me speechless, dorkface..." She would start, before moving on, insulting him and then calling him an idiot like she usually did, making Shinji sigh as he mentally prepared himself for the incoming verbal onslaught.
"你的聪明才智让我哑口无言，书呆子。" 她总是这样开场，接着便是一连串的辱骂，最后照例骂他白痴，真嗣只能叹息，默默为即将到来的言语风暴做心理准备。

It's not like Asuka's always like tha- no, wait, she's always like that. Shinji reflected, knowing that for all the times she would berate him and make fun of him, she would equally try to mend it in some small way, because Asuka was unable to accept she was wrong unless it was something huge, and she was unable to say she was sorry, instead displacing the action of asking for forgiveness by doing something nice.
真嗣反思着，明日香总是这样——没错，她就是如此。他明白，尽管她多次责骂和取笑他，她也会在不经意间尝试弥补，因为除非犯下大错，明日香从不承认错误，也说不出“对不起”，而是通过做些好事来间接表达歉意。

"So what? It's not as if I'd get you anything... they're just..." Only this time, Asuka's voice wasn't as loud as she used to, and it sounded... strained... almost as if it had a bit of an edge. "Just eat them, okay?"
那又如何？我又不会给你什么...它们不过是..." 这次，明日香的声音不如往常响亮，听起来有些勉强...几乎带着一丝尖锐。"吃掉它们吧，好吗？

Shinji eyed the chocolates critically; they weren't anything special; just the usual chocolate bar, probably made out of any commercial or cheap mold and for a brief moment Shinji entertained the idea that Asuka had bought everything just for this occasion, before shaking his head, knowing full well that would be so unlike her.
真嗣审视着眼前的巧克力，它们并无特别之处，不过是市面上常见的巧克力棒，多半是用便宜的模具量产的。他脑海中闪过一个念头，或许明日香是为了这次聚会特意购买的，但很快他又否定了这个想法，因为他知道这并不符合她的性格。

"They're not poisoned or anything, are they?"
它们应该没有被下毒吧？

There was a small beat that grew into a pregnant pause, the kind that seem to come with the shock of something said or about to be said, and when he finally managed to force himself to lift his head, Shinji thought he saw a strange expression on Asuka's face.
起初是一阵微小的停顿，随后演变成意味深长的沉默，仿佛是因某句话或即将出口的话而震惊所致。当他终于鼓起勇气抬头时，真嗣觉得在明日香的脸上捕捉到了一丝异样的神情。

Her eyes seemed a little dull, and her shoulders appeared to be slumped and her usual cocky smirk was now a trembling line in her lips and Shinji realized that was something he'd seen before, just once in all the time he had known the redhead teen.
她的眼神略显黯淡，肩膀微垂，往常那股自信的坏笑如今在唇边颤抖成一条细线，真嗣意识到这一幕他曾目睹过，在认识这位红发少女的岁月里，仅此一次。

And it was something he never wanted to see there again.
这是他再也不愿在那里见到的。

Then, it was gone; as if someone had wiped a mirror full of condensation leaving behind a clean, crisp image that seconds ago hadn't been there and Asuka rolled her eyes, kneeling down to his level and locking eyes with Shinji, her hands tucking her skirt in and holding that position for a few seconds before she smirked at Shinji like she usually did before she lifted her right hand and pressed her fingertip against the boys forehead, pushing him down.
随后，那景象便消失了，宛如有人拭去了镜面上凝结的水汽，留下一片清晰明了的画面，而这一切在几秒前还不曾存在。明日香翻了翻白眼，跪下身来与真嗣平视，双手整理着裙摆，保持了几秒，随后一如往常地对真嗣露出一抹狡黠的微笑，接着她举起右手，用指尖轻触他的额头，将他推倒。

"It's just chocolate, got it you idiot?" The redhead said in a bored tone even if it was painfully obvious for Shinji the little comment had caught her off guard. "And it's not like I made them for you anyway, or you're the only one who's getting some! My mom had this silly idea to do German-style chocolate for Christmas, but she messed up the amounts so we ended with a ton of it."
这不过是巧克力而已，懂了吗，傻瓜？"红发女孩尽管语气显得漫不经心，但真嗣看得出，那句无心之语还是让她有些措手不及。"再说，我也不是特地为你做的，又不是只有你能享用！我妈妈心血来潮，想在圣诞节做德式巧克力，结果配比出了错，弄得我们手头多得是。

"So these are..." 那么，这些就是...

"Leftovers." Asuka said with a flick of her hair and a shrug of her shoulders.
"剩菜。" 明日香说着，一边甩了甩头发，一边耸了耸肩。

Oh. Shinji blinked as he looked at the bar again, for some reason feeling a bit let down. Figures it'd be something like that.
哦，真嗣眨了眨眼，再次望向酒吧，莫名感到一丝失落。果然不出所料。

Asuka kept talking, saying something about how she didn't want it to go to waste, so she had been giving it to her friends and had figured Shinji could use some as well.
明日香不停地说着，她提到不希望东西被浪费掉，因此一直在分给朋友们，觉得真嗣也应该用一些。

"-nly I won't give you anything tomorrow; half the school already assumes we are an on-again-off-again couple since middle school." The redhead pointed out as she looked away, frowning, while Shinji nodded, at loss for words.
"只有我，明天不会给你任何东西；半个学校的人都以为我们是中学以来分分合合的情侣。"红发女孩说着，转过头去，眉头紧锁，而 Shinji 只能点头，一时语塞。

"I-it's ok. I'll eat them." He replied hastily, rubbing his forehead, the same frown still in his face, since Asuka's poke had hurt him a little before he looked down and added softly, almost as an afterthought. "Sorry."
我-没事。我会吃掉的。"他匆忙回应，揉着额头，眉头紧皱未舒，因为刚才明日香的一戳让他略感疼痛，他低头轻声追加，仿佛是事后才想到，"不好意思。

Asuka looked back at Shinji with what could only be described as a half-smirk, half-smile on her face, before she caught herself and frowned, looking away quickly and covering her face with her hair as she walked back to the roof access door.
明日香回头望向真嗣，脸上挂着半是冷笑半是微笑的复杂表情，但很快她意识到自己的失态，眉头一皱，迅速别过脸去，用发丝遮掩住表情，快步走向通往屋顶的门。

"Whatever." She said, before opening the door, and just as she was stepping in, she looked over her shoulder at Shinji. "And don't get any stupid ideas. This is not Valentine's Day chocolate, and I don't want anything for White Day."
随你怎么想。" 她边说边开门，刚要进去时，她回头瞥了一眼真嗣。"别动歪脑筋。这可不是情人节送的巧克力，白色情人节我也不指望你回礼。

"I know." Shinji answered softly, mostly to himself, and didn't see Asuka's mask of indifference slip and show a small crack before she walked inside the school as he kept staring at the box, still frowning and feeling like he was forgetting something, something he knew was missing while behind Shinji, the heavy metal door slammed itself closing shut.
"我知道。" 碇真嗣低声自语，未曾察觉明日香冷漠的面具上悄然裂开一道细缝，她随即步入校园，而他依旧凝视着那个盒子，眉头紧锁，心中隐隐觉得遗忘了什么重要之事，就在他身后，沉重的金属门轰然关闭。

Shinji paid no attention and continued to stare at the box and the candy before giving it a small, tentative bite, letting the confection melt in his mouth slowly, feeling it pass from solid to oily-like and letting the flavor reach his taste buds before noticing that, for months-old chocolate, this tasted pretty good.
真嗣并未分心，依旧凝视着盒中的糖果，谨慎地咬下一小口，任其在口中缓缓融化，体验着它由固态转为油润，直至味蕾感受到那股风味，这才意识到，即便是数月前的巧克力，这味道也颇为可口。

So good, in fact, that Shinji was still smacking his lips while he tried to jiggle the door open to go back to his classroom once recess had been officially over; so good that it took some time for him to realize that he had been staring dumbly at the door Asuka had locked from the inside for quite some time.
味道实在太美妙，以至于真嗣在课间休息结束后，一边回味着一边试图推开教室门回去，过了好一会儿才恍然发现自己已经盯着明日香从里面锁上的门发呆了许久。

"She did what!" 她做了什么啊！

Shinji cringed and let out a sigh before he realized he had nowhere to go; Toji and Kensuke were flanking him, while Musashi and Keita were walking behind him down the halls once school had ended and they had changed back from their gym clothes to their usual school uniform, except for Toji who was still dressed in his tracksuit.
真嗣缩了缩身子，叹息一声，才发觉自己无处可逃；东治和健介一左一右地围着他，武藏和圭太则跟在他身后，放学后大家都已换下体育课的装束，穿回了平日的校服，唯独东治还穿着运动服。

"This is Asuka, right? Asuka Langley Soryu? You're talking about THAT Asuka?" Toji asked loudly while Musashi muttered something under his breath.
"这是明日香吧？明日香·兰格雷·索西尔，就是那个明日香？" 东治大声确认，而武藏在一旁小声嘟囔。

"Is it really that hard to believe Soryu would do something like that?".
真的难以相信索龙会做出那种事吗？

"Well, she mentioned that she was giving some to other people." Shinji added as an afterthought, making everyone stare at him, until Kensuke readjusted his glasses, making the sunlight bounce off them, giving him an imposing and intimidating look that evaporated as soon as he spoke in his usual squeaky, nasal voice.
"嗯，她提到她正在给其他人分发一些东西。" 碇真嗣补充道，引得众人纷纷注视他，直到洞木光调整了一下眼镜，阳光在其上反射，营造出一种威严而令人畏惧的氛围，然而他一开口，那惯常的尖细鼻音立刻打破了这种印象。

"Did you check them out first? Maybe she put something in it, like a lax-"
你事先检查了吗？她可能在里头加了点东西，比如泻药什么的。

"He has a point chief." Toji said as he grabbed the box, staring at it with the same mix of curiosity and wariness as everyone else. "I mean, this is Soryu we're talking 'bout; she ain't exactly sane."
头儿，他说的有道理。" 东二说着，抓起盒子，眼神中混合着好奇与戒备，和其他人一样。"毕竟，我们说的是苏龙；她可不是什么正常人。

"Don't say that!" Shinji said, sounding angrier than he should for some reason as he brought the box closer to him and inspected it as if it were a crime scene from one of those police shows on TV. "Besides, I gave Kaji-san one before gym class and he didn't look sick or anything."
别这么说！" 真嗣说道，语气中带着不应有的怒意，他将盒子拉近，仔细审视，仿佛面对的是电视警匪剧中的犯罪现场。"再说，我在体育课前给卡吉先生一个，他看起来并没有任何不适。

"Maybe he has some sort of super healing resistance to toxins and venom!" Keita said excitedly making everyone, even Kensuke, turned to give him a look that made the freckled boy let out an embarrassed chuckle as he scratched his cheek before Kensuke cleared his throat ominously, crossing his arms over his chest, closing his eyes and letting out a sigh.
"或许他具备某种超凡的毒素和毒液抗性，能迅速自愈！" 圭太激动地说，引得众人包括健介都转头看他。这让脸带雀斑的男孩尴尬地笑了笑，挠了挠脸颊。接着，健介故意清了清嗓子，双臂交叉胸前，闭目叹息，气氛顿时凝重。

"We're missing the point here; if Soryu made this, then it can only mean one of two things." He said over-dramatically, snatching the box away from Shinji holding it over his head as if it were some sort of lost trophy which made Toji cover his eyes with his hands, groaning something about a nerd-burst.
"我们在这里忽略了关键；如果这是 Soryu 所为，那只能说明两种可能。"他夸张地说着，从 Shinji 手中抢过盒子，高高举起，仿佛那是一件失落的珍宝，Toji 则捂住眼睛，呻吟着抱怨书呆子的爆发。

"Which is?" Shinji asked wearily as he attempted to take the box from the bespectacled boy; for some reason, the tone and topic of this conversation had been starting to bug him greatly, and seeing the box in someone else's hands was just not sitting right with him, as if the whole idea of the box not belonging to him was enough to make Shinji try and do something about it; try and take it to keep it safe.
"这是什么？" 真嗣疲惫地问道，试图从那戴眼镜的男孩手中接过盒子。不知为何，这次对话的语气和话题让他感到格外烦躁，看到盒子在别人手里，他心里就是不舒服，仿佛盒子不属于自己这一事实，就足以促使他采取行动，将其夺回以确保安全。

"Either she actually had these boxes lying around as leftovers and she wants to clear them out, or she used you as a guinea pig for the chocolate she's planning on giving Mr. Kaji tomorrow." Toji said with a snicker, which in turn made Kensuke and Keita snicker along with him, earning them a shake of Musashi's head and a dirty look from Shinji as a dead silence settled in, feeling like the words were clicking together like cogs in a wheel, moving together as one and circling around Shinji's mind, bringing out something he hadn't thought about, hadn't really stopped to consider.
"要么她确实留有这些盒子，想清理掉，要么她拿你当试验品，试吃她打算明天送给卡吉先生的巧克力。" 东治窃笑道，健介和圭太也跟着笑起来，武藏摇头，真嗣则投来不悦的目光，一时间气氛凝固，话语仿佛齿轮般紧密啮合，在真嗣脑海中旋转，让他意识到一个未曾深究的问题。

This made Shinji feel a sense of dread; this new idea made the pit of his stomach feel like he had a hole the size of lake Ashi in the middle of his body; a void so big it felt like it would swallow him whole.
这令真嗣心生恐惧；这个新想法让他感到胃中仿佛有一个芦之湖大小的空洞，巨大的虚空似乎要将他完全吞没。

He knew that Asuka wasn't trying to give Kaji any chocolate, what with the fact that he and Misato were a couple and all, and the realization of this being nothing more than obligation was something Shinji had entertained at some point.
他清楚明日香并非真心想送加持巧克力，考虑到加持和美里已是情侣，这种行为不过是出于义务，真嗣也曾有过这样的想法。

And yet being confronted by it left him speechless, with dry lips and tingling hands, weakened knees and a ringing in his ears that made it hard for him to focus and listen or understand to the people around him was saying, making the boy blink and fore himself into paying attention.
然而，当真正面对它时，他却哑口无言，嘴唇干裂，双手微微刺痛，膝盖发软，耳中嗡鸣不断，难以集中精神去聆听和理解周围人的话语，迫使他不得不频繁眨眼，努力让自己保持专注。

"-ny way, I'm sure it's nothing big, Chief." Toji said as he took the box from Kensuke's grasp, holding it over his own head which made Kensuke grumble, knowing full well he would never be able to take it from his taller friend. "Right 'Sashi?"
无论如何，我相信这不是什么大问题，老大。" 东治边说边从健介手里接过盒子，高举过自己的头顶，健介只能嘟囔着，心里明白自己绝不可能从这位高个子朋友手中夺回盒子。"对吧，'Sashi'？

"She probably did it to mess with your head." Musashi nodded, speaking in his usual calm, cold and calculating voice, almost as if he were explaining a math problem in the blackboard, analyzing the situation before finally arriving at the most obvious answer and explaining it as if he were trying to explain to an elementary kid the concept of the theory of relativity. "So don't think about it..."
她这么做，多半是想搅乱你的心神。"宫本点头说道，声音一如既往地冷静、冷酷且充满算计，仿佛在黑板上解数学题，分析着局势，最终得出最直白的答案，并像给小学生讲解相对论一样，将其解释得明明白白。"所以，别多想了……

Before, Shinji had been seeing it as an accident, something Asuka had decided she didn't really needed but couldn't very well throw away in good conscience so she had decided to give it to Shinji.
之前，真嗣一直认为那是个意外，明日香觉得那东西自己并非必需，但又觉得直接丢弃良心不安，于是决定转赠给真嗣。

But now, the idea that he had been used by her, topped with the fact that she had locked him outside, and that only the providential arrival of Mr. Kaji and Dr. Akagi to try and sneak a quick cigarette break had prevented him from being late for his next class, had managed to keep Shinji on the edge.
如今，意识到自己被她利用，再加上她将他锁在门外，幸亏卡吉先生和赤木博士恰巧来此抽空抽烟，才让他免于迟到下一节课，这一切让真嗣一直处于紧张边缘。

He had stayed in the class room a few minutes after everyone had left, just staring at the box for what felt like quite some time, feeling as if the people who had seen him walking with it had known all along, pointing their fingers and laughing at him, mocking him, denouncing him for being too stupid and dumb to actually believe Asuka had meant anything but the words she had said when she had tossed the box so carelessly at him.
他在所有人都离开后，独自在教室里呆了几分钟，长时间凝视着那个盒子，感觉那些目睹他拿着盒子的人似乎心知肚明，他们指手画脚，嘲笑他，讽刺他，斥责他太傻，居然真的相信明日香随意抛给他盒子时的话语有任何深意。

But right after that, Shinji would feel an immense sadness come over him, making him feel ashamed, as if the box was silently asking him how could he think that of her, after all the time they had been friends.
然而，紧接着，真嗣会被一股深沉的悲伤所淹没，感到羞愧难当，仿佛那盒子在默默质问他，经历了这么久的友情，他怎能对她有如此想法。

But that was when the problem started. Shinji figured as he got up, putting his books inside the bag on autopilot, distantly aware of the actions he was taking, but not really doing them consciously; as if his body was moving on muscle memory alone, as his mind kept replaying that time that felt so long ago and yet so recent.
问题正是从那一刻开始的。真嗣站起身来，一边想着，一边下意识地把书本塞进背包，虽然能感觉到自己的动作，却并非有意为之；仿佛身体仅凭肌肉记忆在运作，而他的思绪则不断重播着那个既遥远又近在咫尺的瞬间。

Shinji and Asuka had been best of friends in elementary school; a friendship that had started purely by accident on the first day that she had set foot in school after moving to Japan with her mom, but somewhere in the past year.
真嗣与明日香小学时是形影不离的好友，他们的友谊始于明日香随母亲迁至日本后第一天上学时的意外邂逅，然而在过去的一年里，这段关系似乎发生了变化。

Had it been a year ago already?
已经过去一年了吗？

Before he realized it, Shinji was putting his slippers on the shoebox, and slipping on his shoes, and the action of walking all the way from his classroom to the shoe locker area without actively thinking about it was a huge void in his memory, something that was a common occurrence whenever Shinji thought about that time he and Asuka had drifted apart, as corny and clichéd as it may sound.
真嗣还没反应过来，就已经把拖鞋放回鞋盒，穿上了鞋子，从教室走到鞋柜区，这一路上他全然无意识，记忆中留下了一片空白。每当他想起与明日香疏远的那段日子，这种记忆的缺失便频频出现，虽然听起来颇为俗套。

"Hey! Have any of you seen Asuka?"
嘿！你们当中有人见过明日香吗？

Shinji looked up as him and his friends walked inside the Lotteria that was closest to school.
真嗣抬头望去，他和朋友们踏入了离学校最近的乐天利快餐店。

Hikari asked already cleaning the mess of wrappers and napkins in the table as if she was inviting someone over to her house and had found out the living room was a mess, while Mayumi looked up from her book, smiling shyly and Mana slurped noisily at the meager liquid and ice left in her cup, as Rei continued to read her book and nibble from her pre-cut, pre-diced and pre-ordered fast salad and Mari fought with one of the counter girls over the robot figure she had gotten, demanding a new one because she already had that one in her collection.
光已经开始清理桌上的包装纸和餐巾，仿佛在邀请客人来家里，却发现客厅凌乱不堪。真由美从书本中抬头，羞涩地微笑，而真奈则大声吸着杯中残余的液体和冰块。玲继续阅读她的书，小口吃着预先切好、切碎并预定的快餐沙拉，真理则与一位柜台女孩争执，因为她得到的机器人模型已在她的收藏中，坚持要求换一个新的。

"No." Shinji answered while his face registered a frown. "She wasn't back after recess?"
不。" 真嗣皱着眉头回答道，"她休息时间后还没回来？

"No, and now that you mention it it's strange." Mayumi stated while putting the book she had been reading away in her bag.
"不，你这么一提，确实挺奇怪的。" 玛尤美说着，将手中的书收进了包里。

"We were waiting for her after class because we've all made plans to see a movie after school, and it's not like Asuka to cancel or disappear like that." Hikari said, not really upset, more like puzzled and worried.
"我们下课后一直在等她，因为大家约好放学后一起去看电影，明日香通常不会这样无故爽约或消失。" 光说道，语气中没有太多怒气，更多的是不解和担忧。

"Eh, you worry about red too much..." Toji said, waving his hand and speaking as reassuringly as he could, which earned him a smile from Hikari, which in turn made Mana and Musashi smirk at them both, which resulted in Toji grumbling and looking away as his face turned red.
"哎，你太在意红色了……" 东二边说边挥手，尽力安慰，这引得光展颜一笑，光笑又让真奈和武藏相视而笑，东二见状嘟囔着别过脸，脸上泛起红晕。

"Do you think she's alright? She's not sick or anything, is she?" Mayumi asked worriedly turning to glance at Hikari who gave her a shrug.
"你认为她没事吧？她没生病或有什么不适吧？" 五月美担心地转头看向光，光只是耸了耸肩。

"We heard she skipped gym class." Musashi answered in the way he always did; straight to the point, as he readjusted his book bag and stared at the girls as Keita and Kensuke were already ordering after Toji had given Ken some money while he and Shinji sat on the nearest table.
"听说她没去上体育课。"武藏依旧直截了当地回答，边调整书包边注视着那些女孩，此时景太和健介已开始点餐，因为东二刚给了健一些钱，而他和真嗣则坐在最近的桌子旁。

"Yeah like she got sick or something." Toji added with a snicker, which made Hikari and Mayumi turn to him and then at Shinji who suddenly felt like a deer caught in headlights, speaking in a quick, rushed way as he kept his palms at chest level and turned outside in what, he hoped, seemed as a placating attempt.
"是啊，她似乎生病了。" 东治窃笑着补充，这让光和真由美都看向他，接着又望向真嗣，后者顿时感觉自己像是被车灯捕捉到的鹿，急忙开口，双手举在胸前，试图以一种安抚的姿态转身。

"I'm sure she's fine, I mean she seemed okay earlier." Shinji said as Kensuke Keita and Mari walked back with their meals, the three of them going over the newest hobby magazine that Kensuke had purchased, glossing over and marveling at the garage kits showcased in there.
"我敢肯定她没事，毕竟她之前看起来挺好的。" 真嗣边说边和健介、圭太、麻里一起带着餐食走回来，三人正翻看着健介新买的爱好杂志，对其中展示的模型套件赞不绝口。

"Besides she wouldn't have come if she was sick just to hand out chocolate." Toji said as he began to wolf down his own burger.
"再说，如果她真的生病了，也不会仅仅为了分发巧克力而勉强来。" 东二说着，便开始大口享用自己的汉堡。

"Chocolate? What chocolate?" Mayumi asked, stopping short and repeating the word as if she didn't know what was the context of it, making Shinji's breath stop, feeling his throat constricting, as if it had suddenly formed a knot while Mana, Hikari, Mari... even Rei who looked up from her book and arched a perfectly immaculate eyebrow, but otherwise remained silent, looked on expectantly while Mayumi's eyes more than doubled their side, blinking curiously.
"巧克力？什么巧克力？" 麻由美停下脚步，重复着这个词，一脸茫然，似乎不明白所指何物。这让真嗣感到窒息，喉咙仿佛突然打了个结。真奈、光、玛丽，甚至从书本中抬头的丽，她挑起一道完美无瑕的眉毛，却依旧沉默，所有人都期待地注视着麻由美，她的眼睛瞪得大大的，好奇地眨着。

There was something in the way Mayumi asked that made Shinji's stomach tighten once more, making him feel like lurching and wondering if he was supposed to keep it a secret in the first place, but his mind was already taking action, and his body was already acting as he found himself opening his book bag and extracting the small rectangular cardboard box covered in red wrapping paper and with a copperish bow.
五月美提问时的语气让真嗣的胃再次紧绷，他感到一阵反胃，心中疑惑是否应该保密。然而，他的思绪已开始运转，身体也本能地行动起来，不知不觉间，他打开了书包，取出了那个用红色包装纸包裹、系着铜色蝴蝶结的小矩形纸板盒。

For some reason, Shinji felt like he was showing Mayumi some sort of undeniable proof and that made Toji snicker as he looked up while stuffing a handful of fires on his mouth which made Hikari slap the back of his head and shot him a glare.
不知为何，真嗣觉得自己仿佛在向真由美展示某种确凿无疑的证据，这让东治忍不住偷笑。他一边抬头，一边大口吃着薯条，却被光在后脑勺上轻拍了一下，并收到了她严厉的眼神。

"You know, her mom made a lot?" Shinji said ignoring the Suzuhara-Horaki antics.
"你知道吗，她妈妈做了很多呢。" 真嗣说着，对铃原和洞木的嬉闹视而不见。

The way Mana was staring at the box reminded Shinji of the same look Asuka had given him when he had jokingly asked if the chocolate was poisoned, and Mayumi was looking at him in a very peculiar way, the same way Hikari always stared at him whenever the topic of Asuka was brought up; like she had realized something simply because Asuka had given him the box and that made Shinji feel self-conscious, and a bit uncomfortable by it all.
真名盯着盒子的眼神，让真嗣回想起当初他开玩笑问巧克力是否被下毒时，明日香的那种表情。而真由美此刻正以一种异样的目光注视着他，就像每次提到明日香时，光总是那样凝视他一样；似乎因为明日香送了他这个盒子，她察觉到了什么，这让真嗣感到既尴尬又不安。

"Asuka never said anything." Mayumi said in a thoughtful tone while still keeping the same expression, looking like she was trying to understand what had happened, why Asuka had done what she had done. "Hey Hikari, did you hear about Asuka giving out chocolates?"
Asuka 一直没吭声。" Mayumi 若有所思地说着，脸上表情未变，似乎在努力揣摩事情的来龙去脉，以及 Asuka 为何会有那样的举动。"对了，Hikari，你听说 Asuka 送巧克力的事了吗？

"Yeah." Hikari answered while giving Shinji an amused look, like something she had finally figured out after the issue of the chocolate, something Shinji felt was still eluding him. "I think she only had some left because her mom used it as a selling tactic or something."
嗯。"光回答时，向真嗣投去一个会心的微笑，似乎在巧克力事件后她终于领悟了什么，而真嗣仍感困惑。"她剩下的那些，可能是她妈妈用作销售策略的一部分。

"That's not fair, I like her mom's chocolate!" Mayumi said softly, looking slightly hurt at the idea of Asuka doing something like this.
"这不公平，我可喜欢她妈妈做的巧克力了！" 真由美轻声说道，脸上流露出一丝受伤的神情。

Shinji knew that out of all the girls Asuka had a very close friendship with Hikari and Mayumi.
真嗣清楚，在所有女孩中，明日香与光和真由美关系特别亲密。

Rei and Asuka seemed to be just polar opposites of each other, one was quiet and controlled, the other one was loud and seemed to be short of a fuse, and Asuka and Mana...
绫波与明日香仿佛是截然相反的两极，前者沉静内敛，后者则喧闹易怒，至于明日香和真名...

Shinji didn't really know how to explain those two; at times it felt like they were bitter enemies over whatever imagined or amplified slight, always clashing for something or other; at times so similar in the way they behaved it sometimes felt as if they shifted between being friends and rivals, like Musashi and Toji.
真嗣其实不太清楚如何描述这两人的关系；时而他们因一些微不足道或被放大的小事而针锋相对，仿佛宿敌一般，总是为琐事争执；时而他们的行为模式又出奇地相似，让人感觉他们时而如朋友，时而如对手，就像宫本武藏与户木之间的复杂关系。

"Well you know Asuka, she's kind of... weird when it comes to... stuff." Mana said in a mild tone as she looked at Shinji who was deep in thought while Toji and Kensuke both snickered.
"哎，说到明日香，她对某些事情总是...挺古怪的。" 玛娜语气平和地说着，目光落在陷入沉思的真嗣身上，而旁边的东治和健介则忍不住偷笑。

"Yeah, I mean, I bet Asuka is clueless when it comes to cooking, do you remember that one time back in home economics where she was supposed to do some octopus balls and ended up burning the whole thing?" Toji said loudly, making Mana and Musashi and Keita laugh as well.
"是啊，我敢打赌明日香对做饭肯定一窍不通，你还记得那次家政课上她要做章鱼小丸子，结果把整锅都烧糊了吗？" 东二大声说道，逗得真奈、武藏和圭太也笑了起来。

"Yeah, she made such a mess Miss Ibuki was almost crying by the end of the class; it was awesome!" Kensuke followed up as he made his best attempt at trying to sound like the teacher had, flailing his arms around comically, everyone laughing and making fun at Asuka until Hikari cleared her throat loudly.
"没错，她弄得一团糟，伊吹老师差点在课尾哭出来；场面真是太精彩了！" 健介尽力模仿老师的语调，滑稽地挥动双臂，逗得大家哄堂大笑，纷纷取笑明日香，直到光大声清了清嗓子。

"I've told you guys to stop making fun of Asuka, or at the very least, do it to her face, not talk behind her back like this."
我早就提醒过你们，别再取笑明日香了，要是有意见就当面说，别在背后这样议论。

"Aw, c'mon Hikari, we were just playing." Toji said casually. "Besides, I'm sure Shinji would eat anything made by the devil. They're so close they're practically husband and wife."
哎呀，光，我们只是在开玩笑。" 东治随口说道，"再说，我敢肯定真嗣会吃下恶魔做的任何东西。他们关系那么好，简直就像夫妻一样。

"Wh-what? Of course not!" Shinji's anguished cry made Mana giggle, while Toji smirked and Kensuke simply shook his head as if it were a hopeless case, Rei quietly standing up to put the food tray she had used on the litter before getting herself a refill of her drink and sitting down once more, going back to reading her book.
"什么？当然不是！" 真嗣的痛苦呼喊让麻奈忍不住笑出声，东治则是嘴角上扬，健介摇头叹息，仿佛一切已无望。丽默默起身，将用过的餐盘放回，又给自己倒了杯饮料，重新坐下，继续沉浸在书本中。

"I mean those chocolates were probably given to Shinji by the red devil herself as a sign of she accepting him as his boyfriend." Toji kept at it, feeling at ease in his usual role of class clown while Kensuke nodded and turned to Mayumi, resting his face on one hand, smiling at the bespectacled girl, almost as if waiting or hoping for her to follow suit, only to encounter her staring sadly at the circle of friends.
"我想说的是，那些巧克力很可能是红魔女亲自送给真嗣的，象征着她接受他作为自己的男友。" 东治一如既往地扮演着班级小丑的角色，感到轻松自在，而健介点头转向真由美，一手托腮，对着戴眼镜的女孩微笑，似乎在期待或希望她也能加入，却只见她带着悲伤的眼神凝视着这群朋友。

"I'm telling you we're not like that!" Shinji tried once more, a little harder, a bit more forceful while everyone else except for Rei, Mayumi and Hikari kept laughing at this.
"我再说一遍，我们绝非如此！" 真嗣再次努力表达，语气更为坚决，而除了绫波、真由美和光之外的其他人依旧对此笑个不停。

"Toji! I told you not to make fun of Asuka!" Hikari said angrily in tandem with Shinji, while Mayumi narrowed her eyes at both boys.
"冬二！我跟你说过别取笑明日香！" 光气愤地与真嗣异口同声地说，而真由美则眯着眼盯着两个男孩。

"Come on Hikari, even you know it's the only other possible answer." Mana said in a snide tone while giving a small shrug of her shoulders. "It's common knowledge since she moved here that she and Shinji have been, like, betrothed or something."
光，你心里清楚，这是唯一可能的答案。"玛娜带着一丝嘲讽说道，肩膀微微一耸。"她搬来后，她和真嗣就像是被订婚了似的，这事儿大家都知道。

"W-we aren't..." Shinji tired again before Hikari cut him off, speaking with an angry tone.
"我们...我们不是..." 真嗣再次显得疲惫，却被日向愤怒地打断了。

"What! That's stupid! Who the heck came up with that silly lie?"
什么！这太荒唐了！到底是谁想出了那个可笑的谎言？

"You did, back when you had to give Asuka some of the print outs and she was sick with measles and you went to her house and saw Shinji inside cooking some rice porridge for her." Mana said matter-of-factly, making Hikari open her mouth to refute, but no sound came out as the freckled girl realized Mana was right, which made Hikari's cheeks turn a bright red color while Shinji grumbled under his breath again, his hands balling into tight fists.
"你确实去过，那时明日香得了麻疹，你给她送打印资料，到她家时看到真嗣正在煮粥照顾她。"玛娜平静地说，光本想反驳，却哑口无言，意识到玛娜所言非虚，顿时脸颊绯红，而真嗣则再次不满地嘟囔，双手紧握成拳。

"And then back when they were trying out for that school competition where they had to do some synchronized dancing... you screamed at them both saying they were living in sin." Mana continued, which only made Hikari's face redder, and Shinji's hands began to clench and unclench.
"记得他们为那次校际比赛试镜时，得表演同步舞蹈吗？你当时冲他们大吼，说他们是在犯罪。" Mana 的话让 Hikari 的脸更红了，Shinji 的手也不自觉地握紧又松开。

"And you seem to pay a lot of attention to what's going on between them both, Mana." Hikari answered flatly, crossing her arms and glaring as everyone began to feel a shift in the dynamic, somehow going from good-natured teasing to something that was the brink of angry and rude bullying.
"看来你对他们俩之间的事情格外上心啊，Mana。" Hikari 语气平淡地回应，双臂交叉，目光中带着锐利，周围的人都察觉到气氛的转变，原本轻松的调侃不知何时已滑向愤怒与粗鲁欺凌的边缘。

"She's just wrong for him." Mana said vehemently crossing her hands over her chest and nodding, as if she had thought about it for too long. "She's always abusing him, and shouting, and calling him an idiot, and remember last year when she began to hang out with the stuck ups and ignored all of us?"
她根本就不适合他。"玛娜语气坚决，双手抱胸，点头强调自己的看法，仿佛已反复思量。"她总是对他恶语相向，大发脾气，还骂他蠢货，你还记得去年她开始跟那些自视甚高的人交往，把我们全抛在脑后的事吗？

"She already said she was sorry when she realized those girls had been making up all those things we supposedly said about her behind her back." Hikari stated angrily at Mana, running her hand over her face. "And she has proved that a lot of times, I thought you would be the first one to accept that, Mana."
她意识到那些女孩一直在捏造我们背后说她坏话的事情后，已经道过歉了。" Hikari 带着怒气对 Mana 说，同时用手抹了把脸。"她已经多次证明了这一点，我本以为你会是第一个接受这一点的，Mana。

"Just because she said she was sorry doesn't mean she feels sorry about it." Mana pointed out, narrowing her eyes. "For all we know, she's waiting for her 'friends' to take her back so she can go back to being a stuck up bitch and ignore us again."
她口头上说对不起，并不代表她真的感到歉意。" Mana 眯着眼指出。"说不定她正等着她的'朋友们'再次接纳她，好让她能继续摆出那副高傲的姿态，再次对我们视而不见。

"Asuka would never do that! She's our friend." Mayumi said suddenly, angrily, making everyone stare at her, friends and strangers around her alike.
"Asuka 绝不会做那种事！她是我们的朋友。" Mayumi 突然愤怒地说，让在场的所有人，无论是朋友还是陌生人，都看向了她。

"Come on, Mayu... she even snuffed you when you tried to ask her for help! Why are you still defending her?" Kensuke began, crossing his arms over his chest, and speaking roughly, like he always did whenever he knew or found out about someone being mean to Mayumi.
"麻友，你瞧，你向她求助时她都对你嗤之以鼻！为什么还要为她辩解呢？" 健介说着，双臂交叉在胸前，语气一如既往地粗暴，每当他得知或发现有人对真由美不友好时，总是这副模样。

It was hard not to like Mayumi; she was quiet and gentle and smart and well-mannered and talking to her always made everyone feel important, because she would use only the most polite form of Japanese when talking.
真由美让人难以抗拒；她文静温柔，聪明且彬彬有礼，与她交谈总能让人感到自己备受重视，因为她总是用最恭敬的日语与人交流。

"Because she's still my friend." Mayumi said simply; it wasn't whining, more like she was trying to understand what had happened while Shinji simply looked at her, at loss with words to explain precisely that.
"因为她仍是我的朋友。" 玛由美坦然说道，并非抱怨，而是在努力理解事情的经过，而真嗣只是默默注视着她，难以言表地解释这一事实。

But there was something more, something else... something that eluded words altogether and that somehow was what made people be drawn to Mayumi; a quality that made even Asuka feel compelled to help the black-haired, mousy girl when other girls had began to pick on her.
然而，除了这些，还有某种难以言表的东西……正是这种无形之物让人们被 Mayumi 深深吸引；一种特质，让连 Asuka 都情不自禁地在其他女孩开始欺负这个黑发、怯懦的女孩时，选择帮助她。

"Because when I was the new girl, she was the first one to come on over when I was eating by myself and told me I was sitting in her usual place, and when I tried to move, she said she wasn't making me move, and that I should stay anyway because I was already eating lunch."
我刚来时，她第一个过来找我，当时我正独自用餐，她提醒我坐了她常坐的位置。我本想挪开，她却说不用，还让我继续坐着，毕竟我已经在吃午饭了。

There was familiarity, a sense of belonging that seemed to always be around whenever those two, Asuka and Mayumi were together; often, Shinji had seen Asuka and Mayumi chatting, smiling, and giggling as they would clean the room after classes while waiting for Hikari to finish with the school council meetings before all three would walk home.
每当明日香和真由美相伴，总有一种亲切与归属感萦绕四周；真嗣常常见到她们在课后一边打扫房间，一边谈笑风生，待光子结束学生会事务后，三人便一同踏上归途。

Kensuke, Toji and Mana took a moment to stare at Mayumi as she continued speaking, staring at her hands.
健介、透司和真奈一时凝视着继续说话的真由美，目光集中在她的手上。

"So what if people think Asuka is annoying or rude or loud? She isn't really like that, all you have to do is get to know her better." Mayumi said as her tone changed from marginally angry into to something much milder, making Shinji look up and notice her staring at the box of chocolates, taking it angrily from Toji's hands and gently placing it next to Shinji.
"即便人们觉得明日香烦人、粗鲁或嗓门大，那又如何？她本性并非如此，只需深入了解便知。" 麻由美语气由微怒转为柔和，引得真嗣抬头，见她正凝视着那盒巧克力，从东治手中愤然接过，轻放在真嗣身旁。

"Well, if she gave him this, then maybe she thinks Shinji's her boyfriend, but she's just wrong for him... or for anyone..." Mana said angrily, and for some reason, this made Shinji feel his face heat up. "She's just not girlfriend material."
哎，如果她把这东西给了他，或许她自以为真嗣是她的男朋友，但她完全不适合他...或者说，不适合任何人..." 玛娜愤愤地说，不知怎的，这让真嗣感到脸颊发烫。"她根本就不是当女朋友的料。

That was when Shinji finally lost it.
那一刻，真嗣彻底崩溃了。

"She's not my girlfriend!" Shinji screamed out, slamming his hands on the table, forgetting about the people around him, about the strangers in the booth next to their own, forgetting about the chocolates and about how everyone was staring at him.
"她不是我女朋友！" 真嗣吼了出来，双手重重地拍在桌上，全然不顾周围的人，不顾邻座陌生人的目光，也忘了桌上的巧克力，只感受到所有人投来的目光。

No... actually, he became painfully aware of how everyone was staring at him, which made Shinji close his eyes warily and sigh as he looked up, before standing up, slowly pushing his seat back, walking out the door, without saying anything else, leaving the table in silence, ignoring Toji and Musashi calling after him, ignoring Hikari, Mayumi and Rei staring at him, or Keita and Kensuke and Mana as they tried to excuse themselves.
不...其实，他深切感受到所有人都在注视着他，这让真嗣警觉地闭上双眼，叹了口气，抬头望了一眼，随后缓缓起身，推开椅子，默默地走出房门，留下餐桌上一片沉默。他无视了东治和武藏的呼唤，也忽略了光、真由美和丽对他的凝视，以及健太、健介和真奈试图解释的举动。

Shinji was outside walking away with his head down while pushing his way through the people in the sidewalk before entering a random alley, resting his back against a nearby wall, letting out a long suffered breath he never realized had been inside of him.
真嗣低着头，挤过人行道上的人群，向外走去，然后随意拐进一条小巷，背靠在旁边的墙上，长长地呼出了一直憋在胸中的那口气。

I shouldn't have stormed away like that. Shinji chastised himself angrily, his hand still holding the chocolate box, giving it an inscrutable look before cramming it inside his book bag, hearing the crack of the chocolate it held, feeling faintly as it broke apart while he flung his book bag over his shoulder.
我不该那样怒气冲冲地走掉。真嗣自责地想着，手里紧握着巧克力盒，他神秘地瞥了一眼，随即塞进书包，听着巧克力碎裂的声音，感受到它在包中散开，随后将书包甩上肩头。

For some reason, the box now felt twice as heavy as before, making him feel guilty and angry and embarrassed and sad and all the emotions were so much it just felt like they were closing in on him, taking the air away, making him feel like choking, like his throat was closing, like no air was able to come.
不知何故，箱子现在感觉比之前重了两倍，让他感到内疚、愤怒、尴尬、悲伤，种种情绪如此强烈，仿佛要将他吞没，令他呼吸困难，喉咙紧缩，几乎无法呼吸。

Before, in a moment of clarity, Shinji realized what he had to do.
之前，在片刻的清醒中，真嗣领悟到自己必须采取的行动。

So, that was it; that was how the day had started, and how it had proceeded to this point; and all Shinji could do right now was hold his breath and wait for the door to open and get some answers, even if the questions were, at best, simple words he feared asking out loud.
就这样，一天的序幕如此拉开，直至此刻；眼下，真嗣只能屏息凝神，静待门扉开启，以期获得哪怕是最简单的答案，尽管他内心对大声提问感到畏惧。

And now the door to Asuka's house was opening, and Shinji could only fear for the uncertainty of what was going to happen, closing his eyes, and breathing quickly, erratically... feeling his lungs as they seemed to try to expand past his ribcage and contract into the size of a tight fist with every breath he took, as he waited to come face to face with her...
此刻，明日香家的门缓缓开启，真嗣心中充满了对未知未来的恐惧。他紧闭双眼，呼吸急促而紊乱，每一次呼吸都让肺部仿佛要挣脱肋骨的束缚，又瞬间紧缩成一个紧握的拳头。他屏息凝神，等待着与她直面的那一刻……

"Jeez, what's with you? I thought I told you to be here early because your father would pick me up at se-."
哎呀，你怎么搞的？我不是说过让你早点到吗，你爸六点就要来接我了。

Only to see an older version of Asuka standing in front of her; short, almost pageboy-like cut hair, and dressed in a black turtleneck sweater and a skirt that came just above her knees, while carrying her coat on the other hand.
眼前出现的，是更早时期的明日香；她留着短发，近似学生头，身着黑色高领毛衣，搭配一条刚及膝的裙子，一手还拿着外套。

"-ven. Uh, hi?" Kyoko Soryu blinked quickly before the frown on her face was turned into a smile as recognized him. "Oh! Shinji it's you... Hey, if you're here looking for Asuka she hasn't come in yet from school, but she should be here any minute."
呃，嗨？" 绫波丽眨了眨眼，脸上的不悦迅速转为微笑，认出了他。"哦！是真嗣啊... 嘿，如果你是来找明日香的，她还没从学校回来，不过应该很快就到了。

Shinji remained quiet while Kyoko kept fiddling with her house keys, grumbling to herself about her irresponsible daughter while ever so often turning around to give the brown-haired boy a look, as if she were expecting him to do or say something.
慎二默不作声，京子则反复摆弄着钥匙，口中喃喃自语，责怪着她那不负责任的女儿，不时回头瞥一眼那个棕发男孩，似乎在期待他有所表示。

That reminded Shinji the reason he had come here, fishing inside his school bag quickly, before pulling out the box of chocolate Asuka had tossed his way earlier today and showing it to Asuka's mom who looked at it in confusion before she smiled at Shinji.
这让他记起了来此的目的，急忙在书包中翻找，随即取出了今日早些时候明日香抛给他的巧克力盒，向明日香的母亲展示。她起初一脸茫然，随后对真嗣露出了微笑。

"They're chocolates..." Kyoko's voice sounded like she was making a comment on a frivolous note from the newspaper; so detached and removed, Shinji could almost hear Asuka's lingering 'idiot' in the way the matter-of-factly statement was delivered.
"这是巧克力……" 杏的声音仿佛在评论报纸上一条无关紧要的笔记，显得异常超然和疏离，真嗣几乎能从她那平淡无奇的语气中，听到明日香留下的“傻瓜”二字。

"I know." Shinji said as he looked down while Kyoko rubbed her index finger over her lips, like the times she played her favorite sudoku puzzle, eyes trained on the box before she slowly lifted her head and looked up at Shinji, smile widening as she gave the boy a warm, inviting look.
"我明白了。" 真嗣低头说道，此时绫波正用食指轻抚着唇，宛如她沉浸在心爱的数独游戏中一般，目光凝视着面前的盒子，随后缓缓抬头，望向真嗣，笑容愈发灿烂，向男孩投去一个温馨而亲切的眼神。

"Shinji... I appreciate the gesture, but aren't I the one who's supposed to give you the chocolate?"
真嗣...你的心意我领了，不过，不是应该我送你巧克力吗？

Shinji blinked, clearly never expecting this answer, before he caught side of Kyoko's mouth twitching upwards at the corners slowly becoming the familiar Soryu smirk, the very same Asuka would use ever so often since as back as Shinji could remember.
真嗣眨了眨眼，显然对这个答案毫无准备，随后他注意到京子的嘴角慢慢勾起，逐渐展露出熟悉的 Soryu 式微笑，这种微笑自他记忆起，明日香就经常这样。

"N-no, I uh... Asuka gave them to me..." Shinji finally managed to say, making Kyoko give him an amused look and smile, something that made Shinji even more aware of just how similar mother and daughter were.
"不，我，呃... 是明日香给我的..." 真嗣终于开口说道，京子见状露出了会心的微笑，这让他更加感受到母女俩的相似之处。

It wasn't just the way their mouth would sometimes roll into a half-smile, half-smirk; it was the way they would blink rapidly before narrowing their eyes at someone being an idiot, or the way they would both look over their shoulder, uttering the word 'chance' in a sing-song voice whenever something went their way.
不仅仅是他们嘴角偶尔会勾起半笑半嘲的弧度；还有他们在对某人的愚蠢行为眯眼之前快速眨眼的神态，以及每当事情顺利时，他们会同时回头，用一种抑扬顿挫的语调轻声说出“机会”这个词。

It was also the way they would end up staring at him: half expectantly, half teasingly... just like how Kyoko was staring at him...
他们最终凝视他的方式也是如此：一半充满期待，一半带着戏谑……正如杏子此刻凝视他的模样……

Right now. 此刻

"Uh..." The boy began to stammer; he had never been good with girls or women of any kind, always painfully shy and a bit unsure, but for some reason that same quality seem to make him even more endearing to the likes of Kyoko... and Misato... and Satsuki...
"呃..." 男孩结巴着开口；他向来不擅长与女孩或任何女性相处，总是极度害羞且略显不自信，但奇怪的是，这种特质似乎反而让他更受京子、美里和萨琪这类女孩的青睐...

Shinji stopped his train of thought when he realized Kyoko was still staring at him, and her lips were still moving, and if he would be paying attention, he would probably know what she was talking about which forced the boy's brain to register what was being said, since it seemed like the right thing to do.
真嗣的思绪被打断了，因为他发现恭子依旧目不转睛地看着他，嘴唇还在动。如果他留心听，或许就能明白她在说什么。这让他觉得应该集中注意力去听她的话，这样做似乎才是对的。

"-ka said it didn't matter and now you're here so I'm starting to wonder if there's anything I should know about." Kyoko continued as she ran her hands through her hair, brushing back the bangs reaching her eyebrows, and the tips hanging just a bit below the neck, spiky and stylish, but completely functional. "Are you two fighting again?"
-ka 之前说这没什么大不了的，现在你来了，我不禁琢磨是不是有什么我该了解的内情。" 京子一边说着，一边用手拨弄着头发，将遮住眉毛的刘海往后梳，发尾稍稍垂至颈下，造型尖锐而时尚，却又不失实用性。"你们俩是不是又闹别扭了？

Shinji shook his head quickly, staring at the flowers that were planted along the entrance of the Soryu household; Hibiscus and red and orange Lilies along with red and white Anemones; she had always enjoyed working on her little garden, and Yui always enjoyed helping her as well, telling Shinji how Kyoko, despite being half German-half Japanese, tried to keep the 'language of flowers', Hanakatoba, alive.
真嗣快速地摇了摇头，目光停留在堀川家门前种植的花卉上：木槿、红橙色的百合，还有红白相间的银莲花；京子一直热衷于打理她的小花园，而唯也总是乐此不疲地帮忙，她告诉真嗣，尽管京子是德日混血，但她依然努力传承着“花语”这一文化。

Shinji sighed as he turned to look to the side, noticing Kyoko's room and the flowers hanging overhead; Zinnias and Violets and Morning Glories.
真嗣轻叹一声，侧目望去，绫波的房间映入眼帘，上方悬挂着百日菊、紫罗兰和牵牛花，色彩斑斓。

"Shinji?" 真嗣吗？

"No, it's nothing..." Shinji said slowly as he looked up and smiled at Kyoko, before turning around and walking outside. "I'll ask Asuka when she comes back."
没事，没什么……" 真嗣缓缓地说着，抬头对绫波微笑后，转身走了出去。"等明日香回来我再问问她。

Kyoko looked at the young boy as he went inside his house before looking up at her daughter's window, exactly across from Shinji's only a small leap separating both teens; a small space that now seemed to be thousands of miles away, populated only by the white gardenias that had blossomed over the year that were now sitting on Asuka's windows, smiling wistfully to herself, realizing that flowers never lied, before her husband's car approached the front gate, honking twice before she boarded the car and left as the curtain of the living room parted ways slightly, and Asuka stared at Shinji's house from inside.
京子目送小男孩进屋后，抬头望向女儿的窗台，正对着真嗣的窗户，两者仅一步之遥。然而，这小小的距离此刻仿佛隔了千山万水，唯有窗台上盛开的白色栀子花见证了这一年的变迁。她苦笑自语，花儿总是诚实的。此时，丈夫的车驶至门前，鸣笛两声，她随即上车离去。客厅窗帘轻轻拉开，明日香从屋内凝视着真嗣的家。

As much as he tried to focus, Shinji just couldn't; he had been staring at the computer screen for the best part of an hour, but only had three lines written down.
尽管真嗣极力集中精神，却始终难以专注；他对着电脑屏幕已经发呆了近一个小时，成果仅仅是寥寥三行字。

Next to him, Asuka's room was still dark, and Shinji checked his watch one more after looking over to where his leather bag was laying on top of his bed.
他身旁的明日香房间依旧暗着，真嗣又瞥了一眼手表，随后目光落在床上自己的皮包上。

8:26 P. M. 晚上 8 时 26 分

Where could she be? Shinji thought hurriedly, frowning; it wasn't like Asuka to be this late from school, especially when she hadn't been in school for the rest of the day, and Shinji hadn't really felt like Kyoko needed to hear this, otherwise she would be worried and would be asking Shinji questions wouldn't know how to answer.
她会在哪里呢？真嗣焦急地思索着，眉头紧锁；明日香通常不会这么晚还不从学校回来，特别是她今天一整天都没去学校。真嗣并不想让京子知道，免得她担心，还会问一些真嗣难以回答的问题。

So in the meantime, Shinji had decided to be proactive, fixing himself a light snack, and working on his homework while waiting for Asuka to be back.
于是，在等待明日香回来的这段时间里，真嗣决定主动一些，给自己弄了点小吃，边吃边做作业。

But every time he had tried to write something, he was stopped by the memories reminding him of the way the past year had been a change and a shock to him.
每当他试图动笔，脑海中的记忆便不断涌现，提醒他过去的一年给他带来了怎样的变化与震撼。

It had been back before they had graduated last school year, exactly a year ago; something had happened, something small and silly and completely out of the blue that had spiraled out of control.
那是在去年毕业前，整整一年前；发生了一些小事，既微不足道又荒谬，突如其来，最终却失控了。

After that, Asuka hadn't come to wake him up like she usually did, and in fact she had been rather distant, and when Shinji had finally gotten the courage to confront her about it, Asuka had looked away, as if she had been ashamed before she had begun to tell him that she wasn't going to do that again.
自那以后，明日香不再像往常一样来叫醒他，反而显得格外疏远。当真嗣鼓足勇气向她询问时，明日香避开了他的目光，仿佛心怀愧疚，随后才告诉他，她不会再那样做了。

"Everyone's talking about you and me! Saying we're like newlyweds! It's embarrassing!" The redhead had said angrily, refusing to look up while Shinji stared at his in-door slippers, at loss of words, feeling as if he had been punched in the gut, seeing white and feeling shortness of breath.
"大家都在议论我们，说我们像新婚燕尔！真是让人难堪！"红发女子愤愤地说，不愿抬头，而真嗣则盯着脚下的室内拖鞋，一时语塞，仿佛被重击了腹部，眼前一片空白，呼吸也变得急促。

And it was because of that particular memory that his gut would sometimes wrench and feel like it was eating itself away, even if things were better now between them both, it still didn't seem right... at all; it was more as if Asuka had become someone different that he and everyone else barely knew...
正是那段特别的记忆，让他的胃不时感到剧烈的绞痛，仿佛在自我蚕食。虽然现在他们之间的关系有所缓和，但总感觉哪里不对劲……完全不对劲；明日香似乎变成了一个他和周围人几乎不认识的陌生人……

Shinji had never been one to openly talk about it, but everyone of his friends had noticed the sudden shift in attitude, the way Asuka's jokes had become more hurtful and her remarks more biting, a small rift that slowly but surely had grown both of them apart.
真嗣向来不擅长表达，然而他的朋友们都注意到了他态度的突变，明日香的玩笑越来越刺痛人心，言辞也越发刻薄，一道微小的裂痕悄然扩大，将两人渐渐隔开。

Exactly one year ago. Shinji thought to himself; Asuka had began to be seen as a popular girl around school; a combination of her looks and outgoing personality, she had began to garner the attention of both the guys in her class as well as the upper class-men, and even the new freshmen had began to approach the redhead, leaving love notes in her shoe box, something that she appeared to enjoy, but had complained several times in the privacy of Shinji's room about how much of a hassle it really was.
一年前的今天，碇真嗣默默思索；明日香已成為校園中備受矚目的女孩，她的美貌與活潑性格吸引了同班男生、高年級學長，甚至新入學的學弟們，他們紛紛向這位紅髮女孩表達愛意，將情書放入她的鞋櫃。雖然明日香看似享受這種關注，卻也多次在碇真嗣的房間裡私下抱怨這其實帶來了不少困擾。

Because to her, Shinji was still Shinji.
对她而言，真嗣始终是那个真嗣。

But once, when he and Rei had been walking home after school he had brought up the issue, and the normally quiet girl had remained more quiet and thoughtful, as if trying to word together what she thought was the most obvious answer before telling Shinji bluntly that Asuka had probably decided to move on.
有一次，他和绫波放学后一同回家，途中他提起了这个话题。平日里话不多的绫波显得更加沉思，似乎在斟酌如何表达她心中最直接的答案，最终她坦率地告诉真嗣，明日香大概已经决定向前看了。

"What do you mean move on?" Shinji had asked back then, feeling the pit of his stomach clench reflexively, as if preparing for a punch to the gut that would leave him once more without air, dazed and confused; eyes downcast and mouth set in a thin, small line while his breathing was deep and calm, mentally getting ready for it, and silently counting down and bracing for impact.
"你说的'继续前进'是什么意思？"那时，真嗣反问道，感到胃部不由自主地紧缩，仿佛在为即将到来的重击做准备，那将再次让他窒息，头晕目眩，困惑不已；他垂下眼帘，嘴角紧抿成一条细线，深沉而平静地呼吸着，内心正为此做准备，默默倒数并做好承受冲击的准备。

"Perhaps she realized she does not like you." Rei's logical answer, uttered in a soft, calm voice had made Shinji feel like he had received a kick to the teeth instead, blindsided on the left field in such a way, he could still remember standing there, suffering from shortness of breath and feeling his air passages closing, feeling the world tumbling down.
"也许她意识到自己并不喜欢你。" Rei 那柔和而平静的回答，让 Shinji 感觉如同遭受了当头一棒，猝不及防地被击中，他至今仍记得自己站在那里，呼吸困难，感觉呼吸道在紧缩，整个世界似乎都在崩塌。

It had hurt... a lot, because he had lost something he never knew he had; something he had thought was a constant in his life but had effectively ceased to exist and eventually Shinji had decided maybe it was better this way: he wasn't much for groupies and posses and Asuka seemed to like it now, so he figured if she was ok with this, he really didn't have much say in the matter.
这让他感到非常痛苦，因为他失去了未曾察觉的珍贵之物；他曾以为那是生命中的不变之物，却已悄然消失。最终，真嗣觉得或许这样更好：他本就不喜欢簇拥和追随，而明日香似乎对此感到满意，既然如此，他觉得自己也没有太多置喙的余地。

8:37 P.M. 晚上 8 时 37 分

Shinji sighed in exasperation before closing his eyes, feeling already so close to doing something, anything to beat the thoughts running circles around his mind, ready to admit the obvious answer was the most probable and logical explanation.
真嗣无奈地叹了口气，闭上双眼，感到自己几乎要采取行动，任何能驱散脑海中不断回旋的思绪的行动，他准备承认，最明显的答案其实是最可能且合乎逻辑的解释。

Asuka wasn't known for cooking much; in fact, more often than not, she would tag along to his house just so Shinji could cook them something to eat while both did their homework in what amounted to an unspoken agreement between them both: Shinji would cook and Asuka would teach and it had worked so far.
明日香并不擅长烹饪；事实上，她经常跟着去真嗣家，只为让真嗣下厨，两人边吃边做作业，这成了他们之间心照不宣的约定：真嗣做饭，明日香辅导，一直运作良好。

So when she had said that Mrs. Soryu must had been the one who made the chocolate there wasn't really anything else to it, and yet...
因此，当她断言那巧克力定是早云夫人所制时，本以为话题就此结束，然而...

And yet it still bothered Shinji; it bothered him that Asuka had been so weird about the chocolate thing, and it bothered him that Kensuke and Toji had made fun of him like that.
尽管如此，真嗣还是感到困扰；明日香对巧克力事件的异常反应让他心烦，健介和徹的嘲笑也让他不快。

But more than anything, it bothered him that Toji and Mana had kept saying that Asuka was his girlfriend.
最让他心烦的，莫过于东治和真奈反复强调明日香是他的女朋友。

And today, despite whatever she or anyone else had said, Asuka had made him chocolate; homemade chocolate.
尽管她或其他人说了什么，但今天明日香还是亲手为他制作了巧克力。

For Valentine's Day. 情人节之际。

Even Shinji, despite being called an idiot by her, knew what that implied.
尽管被她称作傻瓜，真嗣也清楚那背后的含义。

And the realization of it all felt like a ton of bricks falling down on him, as his eyes were clouded by a look that had steadily began to grow more and more common in him; a look that seemed to have the words 'longing' and 'regret' etched in them.
他突然领悟到这一切，感觉就像一吨重的砖块砸在身上，眼中逐渐流露出一种越来越常见的神情，仿佛刻着“渴望”与“悔恨”。

Because deep down inside, Shinji knew the truth; knew that Mana was right...
内心深处，真嗣明白真相，明白真名是正确的……

She was just wrong for him.
她与他并不般配。

She just isn't girlfriend material...
她实在不是做女朋友的料...

And those words alone, made his book bag feel like it housed the weight of the world inside of it.
这些话语，让他感到书包沉重得如同装载了整个世界。

For the past couple of hours, Asuka had been keeping herself busy listening to music, or watching videos, or not staring at Shinji's bedroom which still had the light on and made the redhead wonder if that idiot even knew what it meant to let things go.
过去的几个小时，明日香一直忙着听音乐、看视频，或者不去盯着真嗣的卧室，那里的灯依旧亮着，让她这个红发少女不禁疑惑，那个傻瓜是否真的懂得放手意味着什么。

Without thinking, Asuka peeked outside the window once more carefully, making sure the light of her laptop didn't show outside, just like the last three or four times she had checked before she sighed.
明日香未加思索，又一次谨慎地向窗外窥探，确保笔记本电脑的光线未透出窗外，如同之前三四次检查时一样，她这才叹了口气。

It had been a fiasco.
那是一次彻底的失败。

There's really no other way of calling it. Asuka thought as she peeked outside again, before frowning and going back to her computer screen.
确实找不到别的说法来形容。明日香又朝外瞥了一眼，随即皱起眉头，转身继续盯着电脑屏幕。

After what had happened at school, she had decided she needed some time, and space, and air, and so, Asuka had been walking around aimlessly, glaring or ignoring the weirdos and random strangers pestering her to go out with them, or hang out, or if she'd be interested in becoming a model before she had finally decided to go back home, sending her mother a text message saying how she was going to be late, getting almost immediately an angry reply from Kyoko demanding her be here before seven or else...
在学校发生那件事后，她感到需要一些时间和空间来呼吸，因此，明日香开始无目的地闲逛，对那些奇怪的人和搭讪的陌生人或是怒目而视，或是置之不理，他们要么邀请她出去，要么询问她是否有兴趣成为模特。最后，她决定回家，给母亲发了条短信说自己会晚些到，随即收到了京子愤怒的回复，命令她七点前必须到家，否则后果自负...

When she entered, calling out to her mother she was home, she got no answer back, so Asuka figured she was probably outside buying groceries.
她进门时喊着告诉妈妈自己回来了，却没听到回应，于是明日香猜测妈妈大概出去买菜了。

Or flowers, or something equally stupid. The redhead had thought before hearing her mother walking inside, talking on the phone with her father, making plans for dinner at seven while whispering sweet little nothings into the phone, like a love struck teenager going out on a date.
或许是花，抑或其他同样无谓的东西。红发女孩在母亲进屋前这么想着，母亲正与父亲通话，商讨七点的晚餐安排，对着电话轻声细语，宛如情窦初开的少女即将赴约一般。

Get a room, you two and Ewww! Mental Bleach! were among the first things to pop in Asuka's mind as she made a beeline for the fridge, grabbing an juice box before she decided to hide herself in the bathroom next to the doorway hearing her mom coming down from her room upon hearing someone knocking on the door a couple of times followed by her mother's choice words in German, figuring it was her dad, and she was going to listen to them make out, scaring her for the rest for life.
明日香脑中首先闪过的是“你们俩找个地方吧”和“心理漂白剂！”这样的念头。她冲向冰箱，抓起一盒果汁，随即躲进门口旁的卫生间。此时，她听到妈妈从楼上下来，随后是几下敲门声和妈妈用德语的回应，她猜是爸爸到了，接下来他们可能会亲热，这让她感到一阵恐惧，仿佛余生都将被此阴影笼罩。

Instead of that, she had heard Kyoko call out Shinji's name, so Asuka decided to remain where she was focusing on drinking her juice; for some reason, her throat had felt parched after talking to Shinji, and her legs had been close to giving away, and her stomach...
相反，她听到绫波呼唤真嗣的名字，于是明日香决定留在原地，专心喝她的果汁；不知何故，与真嗣交谈后，她感到喉咙异常干渴，双腿几乎无力支撑，胃部也...

The whole thing had felt like something outside one of those stupid novels Misato would read instead of doing her college homework making Asuka wonder once more how someone like her could be her cousin, and how she had even managed to get into college, though from the fact that her friends were working, it made the redhead realize that having a college education did not equal being a genius in your field.
整个事件让明日香感觉仿佛出自三佐常读的那些无聊小说，而非她的大学作业，这让她再次纳闷，这样的人怎么会是她的表亲，又是如何考进大学的。然而，从三佐的朋友们都在工作这一事实，红发少女领悟到，大学文凭并不意味着在专业领域就是天才。

And despite her trying to listen very carefully behind the thin walls, all Asuka could make were mumbled words before Kyoko announced she had to leave, closing the door behind her.
尽管明日香努力在薄墙后仔细倾听，却只能捕捉到模糊的低语，直到绫波丽宣布她得走了，并随之关上了门。

Asuka had taken that moment to scramble outside going into her room and changing quickly out of her uniform making sure Shinji hadn't been nearby before scurrying quickly down to the living room, closing blinds and curtains and making sure there was no way anyone would assume she was back yet.
阿苏卡抓住时机冲出房间，迅速换掉制服，确认真嗣不在附近后，便急匆匆地下楼来到客厅，拉上所有窗帘和百叶窗，确保没人能察觉她已归来。

Now, nearly two hours afterward she realized the day was very much ending and that what she'd done was done and there was no way to take it back.
如今，过了将近两个小时，她才发觉这一天已近尾声，她所做的一切已成定局，无法撤回。

That it was now out there in the open and that even if that idiot was too much of a dense block-head to understand, Asuka was sure someone must have already explained to him by now what the chocolate meant, what it all meant.
如今这一切已昭然若揭，即便那个蠢货愚钝至极未能领会，阿苏卡坚信定有人已向他阐明巧克力的寓意，以及这一切的深意。

Which means that tomorrow...
也就是说，明天...

Tomorrow she'd have to face him and his stupid eyes and moronic face and silly hair and make sure he'd get it through his thick head how it didn't mean anything; how that chocolate was nothing more than obligation, and reinforce the notion that her mom had simply miscalculated the amount of chocolate she'd done.
明天她必须面对他，那双愚蠢的眼睛、呆滞的面孔、滑稽的发型，得让他彻底明白那巧克力并无深意，纯粹是出于义务，同时澄清她妈妈只是算错了巧克力的数量。

Shinji's light suddenly went out, and Asuka waited for another 15 minutes before she figured the idiot had probably given up waiting for her, and had instead gone to sleep before she made her way to her room, letting out a sigh of relief; tomorrow she'd have to clean the mess of pots and pans that was now polluting the kitchen, but for right now, all she wanted was to go to her bed, and curl up and pretend this day never happened.
真嗣的灯光突然熄灭，明日香又等了 15 分钟，才意识到那个傻瓜大概已经放弃等她，转而睡觉去了。她这才走向自己的房间，松了一口气；明天她得收拾厨房里那堆乱糟糟的锅碗瓢盆，但现在，她只想上床，蜷缩起来，假装这一天从未发生。

Honestly... what the heck was I thinking? The redhead thought as her hand grasped the doorknob, but instead of t turning it open she remained with her hand crisped around the brass handle.
说实话...我究竟在想些什么？红发女子心中疑惑，手虽已握住门把手，却并未转动，只是紧紧攥着那黄铜把手。

The redhead closed her eyes, letting out a couple of deep breaths as she opened the door to her room, her whole body trembling ever so slightly as the memories of the day and the past came back to taunt her, feeling like a house of cards tumbling down.
红发女子闭目深呼吸，推开房门时，全身微颤，白日的记忆与过往的阴影如潮水般涌来，令她感觉如同纸牌屋般瞬间崩塌。

"Ow..." 哎呀...

Just like how a certain idiot was tumbling down into his room after jumping out of hers from across her window.
正如某个笨蛋从她窗对面跳出后，一头栽进自己房间的情景。

"What the hell are you doing?"
你究竟在做什么？

To her credit, Asuka remained calm, trying not to let out a small amused giggle as she saw Shinji's arms flail around, tying to untangle his sneaker from his window rail; normally, it would be the other way around, Asuka would be the one jumping from her room into Shinji's, and he would act outraged while Asuka would smile and make fun of him.
值得称赞的是，明日香保持了冷静，努力抑制住想要轻笑的冲动，因为她目睹真嗣手忙脚乱地试图解开被窗户栏杆缠住的球鞋；通常情况下，明日香会从自己的房间跳到真嗣的房间，而他则会假装生气，明日香则在一旁微笑着取笑他。

"Nothing!" Shinji said with a grunt, trying once more before finally giving up and taking off his shoe before he appeared resting his elbows on his window as if nothing had happened as Asuka scowled at him, making it clear she wasn't up for any kind of crap while Shinji kept trying to remain calm, succeeding only in making Asuka's scowl deepen, and Shinji figured he was about to get an earful from the redhead.
"啥也没有！" 真嗣嘟囔着，再次尝试后终于放弃，脱掉鞋子，然后出现在窗边，双肘撑着窗台，一副若无其事的样子。明日香瞪着他，显然不接受任何胡闹，而真嗣则努力保持冷静，结果只是让明日香的怒视更加深沉。真嗣意识到，自己可能要被这位红发少女狠狠训斥一顿了。

But right now, her eyes spoke louder than anything she had ever said.
然而此刻，她的眼神比以往任何言语都更响亮。

For some reason, Shinji had always noticed there was something about those eyes, something deep and inaccessible, something that seemed to be always guarded behind close walls and seven keys; they evoked anger and embarrassment easily, which balanced out Asuka's tendency to quickly snap at and shout and lash out.
不知为何，真嗣总觉得那双眼睛里藏着深邃而难以触及的东西，仿佛被高墙和七把锁紧紧守护着；它们轻易就能激起愤怒和尴尬，恰好平衡了明日香动辄爆发、大喊大叫的倾向。

But at times they were different; they were gentle... and sweet; like the times she would help straighten Shinji's collar after they had both ran to school to make it on time.
但有时他们又显得不同；他们是那么温柔...又甜蜜；就像她会在两人一起跑着去学校赶时间后，帮他整理衣领的那一刻。

Or the times she would let him walk with her while raining, sharing an umbrella, walking in comfortable silence, the kind of silence that was born and breed not out of not having anything to say, but of not wanting anything to upset the gentle, soothing sounds of falling rain, or early mornings and peaceful afternoons, or of calm, chilly and silent nights.
或是她允许他在雨中并肩而行，共用一把伞，享受着舒适的静默，这种沉默并非因为无话可说，而是不愿打扰那轻柔、抚慰心灵的雨声，或是清晨与宁静的午后，或是平静、寒冷而静谧的夜晚。

Shinji couldn't deny, now that he was staring up at Asuka, that the year that had passed had been one he had hated.
碇真嗣不得不承认，当他抬头凝视着明日香时，过去的一年确实让他感到厌恶。

Because he still thought of her as a friend and he was sure Asuka thought of him the same way; even if they were apart at school once they were out everything changed and they would always hang out together.
他依旧将她当作朋友，并相信明日香也抱有同样的想法；即便在校时各自为政，放学后却截然不同，他们总会相约共度时光。

It was like dealing with two Asukas: the public one, the one who liked the adulation and adoration of the masses, that thrived and lived for the boys who would shower her with sweet words and promises of endless love that were too fake or incredible for kids their age, but that would still make the redhead smile and giggle and blush as if on cue.
这就像同时面对两个明日香：一个是公众眼中的她，沉醉于众人的追捧与爱慕之中，她因那些男孩们倾泻而来的甜言蜜语和看似永无止境的爱意而充满活力，尽管这些承诺对于他们这个年纪来说过于虚幻或难以置信，但仍能让这位红发女孩自然而然地微笑、咯咯笑和脸红。

And then, there was the other Asuka, the one that only he and a few others like Hikari and Mayumi were privy to; the Asuka he would meet when walking into the corner store to buy groceries while she was buying snacks and they would talk about nothing, and smile about something and laugh about anything before making their way back home, together.
此外，还有一个鲜为人知的明日香，只有他和光、真由美等少数人知晓；那个他在街角商店买日用品时偶遇的明日香，她正在挑选零食，两人会闲聊琐事，因某事相视而笑，为任何事开怀大笑，然后一同踏上归途。

And he missed her. 他怀念她。

He missed the Asuka who would sit in his bed and listen attentively while he would practice the cello, not saying a word but making her presence be felt simply by being there, by making Shinji aware of her; aware of the way the strawberry scent would coat her body and clothes due to the body wash and shampoo she liked to use, and aware of the way her breath would hitch and be held inside when playing that one alto she liked just so, imperceptibly and easy to ignore to everyone but him.
他怀念那个坐在床边，静静聆听他拉大提琴的明日香。她虽不发一言，却以静默的存在让真嗣感受到她的陪伴；感受到她因钟爱的沐浴露和洗发水而散发出的草莓香，以及在演奏她钟情的那段中音时，她那几乎无人察觉的屏息凝神。

Or the Asuka who would sometimes jump out of her bedroom window, and climb up his, for no other reason than to hang out there because she was bored.
或者是那个偶尔会从自己房间的窗户跳出，再爬上他的窗户，只因无聊而想在那儿消磨时光的飞鸟。

But lately, hanging out had began to get weird again.
但最近，一起闲逛又开始显得有些怪异。

At times it seemed like there were lines; invisible boundaries that had been decisively drawn into some sort of political buffering space that made some of the interaction feel... off.
有时候，仿佛有无形的线条；这些界限被清晰地划定在某种政治缓冲区内，让部分互动显得……有些异样。

Memories of a year gone by, of mistakes that were made, of words that they couldn't say...
回望过去的一年，那些曾犯的错误，那些未曾说出的话...

"Don't give me that crap!" Asuka shouted as she walked over to the rail, glaring daggers at the boy, walking towards the window, lifting her fist and shaking it angrily at Shinji to show she meant business. "What the heck were you doing in my room, you creep?"
别跟我废话！" 明日香怒吼着走向栏杆，目光如刀地瞪着那个男孩，随即走向窗户，举起拳头，愤怒地对着真嗣挥舞，以示她的认真。"你这变态，在我房间里做什么？

Shinji looked past her, guiltily, as Asuka followed his line of sight, noticing on top of her bed a box similar to the one she had given, almost identical, actually; the same stupid wrapping paper and the same silly bow, but this one was bent and banged-up.
真嗣心虚地越过她望去，明日香顺着他的视线，发现自己的床上放着一个盒子，与她之前送出的那个极为相似，几乎一模一样；同样的愚蠢包装纸和同样滑稽的蝴蝶结，但这个盒子已经弯曲且破损。

She grabbed it in silence, glaring at Shinji who let out a scared whimper.
她默默地抓起它，怒视着吓得发出呜咽声的真嗣。

But this glare was different; this one was embarrassed and angry, with a look that Shinji realized too late that could only be described by one word; humiliation.
然而，这次的怒视有所不同；它夹杂着尴尬与愤怒，真嗣意识到为时已晚，那眼神只能用一个词来描述——羞辱。

"Did you have a good laugh at me?" Asuka's voice was unfathomably chilly, making Shinji shiver unwillingly at the words as she threw the box at him, nearly missing his head.
"你嘲笑我是不是很得意？" 明日香的声音冰冷至极，令真嗣不禁打了个寒颤。她将盒子朝他扔去，险些砸中他的脑袋。

"N-no!" Shinji answered truthfully, frowning as he tried to articulate his thoughts. "I mean... I didn't know what to think, and then Mayumi and Hikari were telling Toji and Mana and Kensuke to stop laughing at you a-"
不，不！" 真嗣坦白地说，眉头紧锁，努力表达自己的感受。"我是说...我当时真的不知道该怎么想，然后真由美和光正在让东治、真奈和健介别再笑你了——

"You told them!" 你已经告诉他们了！

Shinji gulped as he noticed how Asuka's eyes were no longer holding a look of humiliation but one of embarrassment, and that her cheeks were flushed beyond the color of her hair which made him realize that this wasn't going according to how he had planned, that Asuka was pissed off, and he was bumbling through excuses and explanation instead of being able to tell Asuka what he wanted to.
真嗣咽了咽口水，察觉到明日香的眼神已不再是屈辱，而是尴尬，她的脸颊红得比发色还深，这让他意识到事情并未按计划进行，明日香显然生气了，而他只是在笨拙地辩解和解释，无法向她表达自己的真实想法。

"You weren't supposed to say anything to anyone!" Asuka said angrily, sternly, but she was still flushed and her eyes were misty, making the redhead rub at them angrily with her hands; back and edge and knuckles brushing hard against the white-now-flushed skin that made her cheeks look redder still.
"你本不该对任何人透露半点风声的！" 明日香怒气冲冲地说，语气严厉，然而她的脸颊依旧泛红，眼角含泪，使得这位红发少女愤然用手揉着眼睛；手背和指节用力摩挲着原本白皙现又泛红的肌肤，让她的双颊更显绯红。

"Well, what was I supposed to do?" Shinji said, slowly feeling his anger rising once more; the reminders of the earlier events; the chocolate, his friends laughing and making fun of him, words and stances... everything began to grow into a haze of red.
"那我该怎么办呢？" 真嗣说着，怒气又逐渐上涌；早先的种种事件如影随形——那块巧克力，朋友们的嘲笑和戏弄，言语和态度……一切都渐渐模糊，化为一片赤红的迷雾。

"You were supposed to either eat the stupid chocolate or just throw them away." Asuka said angrily and Shinji noticed how her shoulders began to shake a little, making him look quickly away, mumbling an apology that was what made Asuka let out an angry curse.
"你本该要么吃掉那些蠢巧克力，要么干脆扔了。" 明日香气愤地说道，真嗣注意到她的肩膀微微颤抖，便赶紧移开目光，低声道歉，这却引来了明日香的一声怒骂。

"Verdammt Scheiße! Stop apologizing! I bet Mana and Toji and Kensuke were bursting their guts laughing at the idea of me doing something as stupid as giving you chocolate." Asuka shouted, pointing at the box, anger and contempt and wrath held in her voice; an anger that felt so old and seemed so ancient, that it felt like a powerful, indecipherable force, something that couldn't really be described or explained, but that seemed to encompass and consume everything in its path, leaving nothing more than broken, cold ashes behind.
"该死的！别再道歉了！我敢肯定，真嗣、东治和剑介一定笑得前仰后合，居然想到我会做出送你巧克力这种蠢事。" 明日香怒吼着，手指着盒子，声音中夹杂着愤怒、鄙视与怒火；这股怒气古老而深沉，犹如一股强大而难以言喻的力量，无法准确描述或解释，却似乎能吞噬一切，留下满地破碎、冰冷的灰烬。

Shinji wondered if anyone was listening in on them; even if they lived in a quiet neighborhood, he could never be too sure, but all of this went into the background as Asuka got one of her feet on the rail and literally pounced on him.
真嗣心中嘀咕，不知是否有人偷听他们谈话；虽然身处宁静的社区，他仍不敢掉以轻心。然而，当明日香一脚蹬上栏杆，猛地向他扑来时，这些疑虑瞬间被抛到了九霄云外。

Normally, Shinji would have screamed, he would have begged and bantered for Asuka to stop, he would have asked her to leave him alone, or he would have simply turned and walked away.
正常来说，真嗣会尖叫，会恳求并调侃着让明日香住手，会求她别再纠缠，或者直接转身走开。

But today, right now, the last thing on Shinji's mind was precisely that; instead he flipped Asuka over, rolling with her on the ground, looking like a couple of wild animals trying to have supremacy over the other; the redhead on top, breathing and panting and grunting as she struggled against Shinji, before he flipped her over, glaring and baring teeth.
然而今天，就在这一刻，真嗣心中所想的并非如此；他反而将明日香翻转过来，两人在地上翻滚，宛如两头野兽在争夺主导权；红发的明日香在上，喘着粗气，发出呻吟和低吼，与真嗣激烈对抗，随后他又将她翻转，怒目相视，露出獠牙。

This went on for a few minutes, both teens rolling around Shinji's room before finally, Shinji was able to hold onto the redhead's slim wrists, pushing them to the ground and putting all of his weight to force Asuka's hands over her head, resisting her attempts to buckle underneath him while her struggles became weaker and weaker, until all they could both do was lay like they were, Asuka flat against the floor while Shinji held her hands above her head, both teens breathing heavily, deeply.
这番纠缠持续了几分钟，两个少年在真嗣的房间里翻滚，最终，真嗣紧紧抓住红发少女纤细的手腕，将其压在地上，全身重量压上去，迫使明日香双手举过头顶，她挣扎的力度逐渐减弱，直至两人只能这样躺着，明日香平躺在地，真嗣按住她的双手，两人都喘着粗气，呼吸深沉。

This wasn't the first time they had done this; Asuka had always been slightly tomboyish and had often enjoyed playing like this with Shinji, jumping on his back, or pushing him down and wrestling with him.
这并非他们第一次这样玩闹；明日香一直有点假小子性格，常常喜欢和真嗣这样嬉戏，要么跳上他的背，要么把他推倒后一起摔跤。

In fact, this reminded Shinji of the times when they had been younger and had wrestled roughly around the house, ending in such a position before either his mom, or Asuka's mom would come and separate them.
实际上，这勾起了真嗣对儿时在家中嬉戏打闹的回忆，每次都以这种姿势告终，直到他们的母亲或明日香的母亲前来将他们拉开。

Or, in Misato's case, she'd laugh and take a picture with her phone at the both of us.
换作是美里的话，她会边笑边用手机拍下我们两人的照片。

But right now, for some reason, Asuka remained quiet, while Shinji kept staring at her, both inching closer without realizing; right now it felt weirder... it felt less of a playful bout and more of something both teens couldn't really name.
然而此刻，不知何故，明日香沉默不语，真嗣则目不转睛地凝视着她，两人在无意识中逐渐靠近；这种感觉愈发奇异……不再似往日的嬉闹，而是两位少年难以言说的微妙情愫。

Shinji looked at Asuka before she spoke in a low, angry tone.
真嗣在明日香开口前，用低沉且带着怒气的声音注视着她。

"Get. Off." 请下来。

"No, you'll hit me the moment I do that." Shinji said, shaking his head which made Asuka open her mouth to deny it, but the look Shinji gave her made the redhead realize that was a very spot-on assessment of what she intended to do.
"不，你肯定会趁我那样做时打我。" 真嗣摇头说道，明日香本想反驳，但真嗣的眼神让她明白，他准确地看穿了她的意图。

"Fine. Get off and I promise I won't hit you." Asuka tried once more, buckling underneath but Shinji held her down.
"好吧。你下来，我保证不动手。" 明日香又一次试图挣脱，却被真嗣牢牢按住。

"Or kick me." Shinji added quickly, which made Asuka roll her eyes.
"要么踢我。" 真嗣急忙加了一句，惹得明日香白了他一眼。

"Or kick you..." The redhead said before she noticed Shinji was about to open his mouth once more and she cleared her throat, making the boy keep quiet, but still holding her wrists in his hands. "Or do any sort of physical attack on you."
要么踢你..." 红发女孩刚说完，察觉到真嗣又要开口，便清了清嗓子，示意他保持沉默，同时他的双手依旧紧握着她的手腕。"要么对你施加任何身体上的攻击。

Shinji thought about it and began to get off Asuka before he stopped and looked at her, dark blue eyes meeting light blue.
真嗣思索片刻，正要从明日香身上起身，却突然停住，两人的目光交汇，深蓝与浅蓝的眼眸相互凝视。

"What about mental anguish?"
那精神上的痛苦怎么办？

"Would you just get off right now or do I need to punch you?" Asuka snapped at Shinji, making the boy wince and roll a good couple of feet away from her, staring as she got up and brushed herself clean before turning to Shinji who felt like he should say something, given the tension that was already in the room. "God! Talking to you feels like having a period!"
你到底现在就走，还是要我动手？" 明日香对真嗣怒斥，令他不禁皱眉，连忙退开几步，眼看着她起身拍去尘土，然后转向真嗣，后者感到房间里的紧张气氛，觉得自己应该说些什么。"天哪！跟你说话简直像在经历生理期一样难受！

But it seemed like the words had been stolen, since he couldn't think of anything to say, so Shinji remained quiet for some minutes, expecting Asuka to continue with her tirade before he let out a sigh.
仿佛那些话语被窃取了一般，他竟无言以对，于是真嗣静默了片刻，等待明日香继续发泄，随后才轻叹一声。

"Why did you give it to me in the first place?" Shinji finally asked; wanting to know so badly after too much beating around the bush, tired of the question churning over and over and over in his mind like undigested food for thought, fermenting and festering.
"当初为何要把它给我？" 真嗣终于开口询问，他迫切想知道答案，厌倦了兜圈子，厌倦了这个问题在心中反复纠缠，如同未消化的思绪，不断发酵、恶化。

Asuka looked away, shrugging her shoulders, and making sure to keep her face away from Shinji's eyes, her whole body cutting away at the light coming from her room.
明日香别过脸，肩膀微微耸动，刻意避开真嗣的视线，她的身躯几乎遮断了房间里透出的光。

"I don't know, I mean, I spoke with Hikari and Mayumi about the whole crappy last year, and Misato dropped by a day ago saying she wanted mom's help in making chocolate for Kaji and then I-"
我也不太确定，我和光、真由美谈过去年那些不愉快的事，美里前两天也来过，说是想请妈妈帮忙做巧克力给卡吉，然后我就-

Shinji held his breath, expecting the verbal onslaught, but for the second time today, it never came; Asuka had spoken in a very small, very frail voice, as if she was embarrassed of saying something, but knowing she had to answer nonetheless.
真嗣屏住呼吸，以为会遭到言语的猛烈抨击，然而今天第二次，预期的风暴并未降临；明日香的声音异常微弱，带着一丝脆弱，似乎她因说出某些话而感到难为情，但又清楚自己不得不回应。

"You made it yourself." Shinji stated more than asking after a beat, making Asuka falter, looking at her carefully, seeing how her whole body seemed to show the internal struggle she was having; pride and reason against feelings and impulses.
"是你自己做的吧。" 真嗣停顿了一下，与其说是提问，不如说是确认，这让明日香一时无言，她凝视着她，注意到她的全身仿佛都在透露内心的斗争：骄傲与理智与情感和冲动之间的较量。

"Why didn't you say anything?"
你怎么没说话呢？

"Like what?" Asuka snorted, turning around and facing Shinji as she flipped her hair behind her shoulder with practiced ease. "Hey Shinji? Remember this past year where I treated you like crap and now I feel bad about it? Well, here, have some chocolate."
像什么呀？"飞鸟嗤笑一声，转身面向真嗣，熟练地将秀发甩至肩后。"喂，真嗣，记得我这一年对你不好，现在我挺内疚的。喏，给你巧克力。

Shinji thought about it for some time before nodding, agreeing with Asuka.
真嗣思索片刻后，点头表示赞同明日香的意见。

"Yeah, it does sound lame."
确实，这话听起来挺没劲的。

"Must be because I started hanging out with you more. Stupidity is contagious, you know."
肯定是因为我最近和你待在一起的时间多了。你可知道，愚蠢这东西，是会传染的。

"Can we not do this, right now?" Shinji sighed, tired of all the mind games and everything else, even if he knew on a very instinctual level this was typical of Asuka.
"我们现在能不能不这么做？" 真嗣叹了口气，对所有的猜心游戏和其他一切感到厌倦，尽管他本能地意识到这正是明日香的典型作风。

But at the same time, it was grating on his nerves the constant talk about him being stupid, and it amounted to just about everything else that was Asuka herself.
然而，与此同时，关于他愚蠢的喋喋不休不断刺激着他的神经，这几乎代表了明日香本人的一切。

"I just... I want to know why?"
我只是...想知道为什么？

Asuka turned to look at Shinji, and he could just picture her smirk firmly in place, arrogant and haughty, staring down at him, a sure sign of superiority once her opponent had accepted defeat.
明日香转头望向真嗣，他脑海中浮现出她那傲慢的微笑，高高在上地俯视着他，显然是在对手认输后彰显自己的优越。

But instead, Asuka's eyes were red, and puffy and Shinji noticed she was sniffling and it was very obvious she was crying by the way her shoulders were shaking and her breath hitched in her throat even if she was still trying to downplay it and make it seem like she was perfectly in control.
然而，明日香的眼睛红肿，新嗣察觉到她在抽泣，她肩膀的颤抖和哽咽的呼吸明显透露出她在哭泣，尽管她仍在努力掩饰，装作一切如常。

Because that was how Asuka was.
因为明日香就是这样的人。

"Do you remember why the whole thing started last year?" Asuka said after a beat, making Shinji stare at her before he nodded; the whole series of events still burned into his mind.
"你还记得去年这一切的起因吗？" 阿苏卡顿了顿说道，真嗣凝视着她，随后点了点头；那些事件依旧清晰地刻在他的记忆里。

"You were on a crappy date and when you came back you kissed me out of boredom."
你刚经历了一场糟糕的约会，回来后出于无聊，给了我一个吻。

Asuka flinched at Shinji's words spoken in a soft, quiet voice, both trying hard not to show how much it had hurt back then, and how it still hurt right now, before she shook her head and stared at him.
听到真嗣那柔和低沉的声音，明日香不禁一缩，两人都极力掩饰着当时所受的伤害，以及此刻依旧隐隐作痛的感觉，她摇了摇头，目光紧紧地盯着他。

"It was before that; back when I told you what's-his-face had asked me out."
那是之前的事了；在我告诉你那个谁谁谁曾约我出去的时候。

Shinji stiffened, knowing who she was talking about, but not really sure if Asuka forgetting his name was intentional, or if she had actually forgotten all about it, since the date in itself had been, according to the redhead, nothing but a waste of time.
真嗣身体一僵，心知她指的是谁，却难以判断明日香忘记他名字是出于故意，还是真的忘却了，毕竟那次约会，按红发少女所言，纯属浪费时间。

"It was Ryuj-" 那是龙字-

"I don't care who it was!" Asuka said angrily, still keeping her distance, still not turning around but her voice sounded stressed, with a faint edge to it, as if she was talking while suffering from a cold; throat raw and hurting and unable to go on. "When I told you, I asked you if you cared and you shrugged your shoulders and said it didn't matter, and then those girls, they began saying that you... and then I heard Mana... and I..."
我不在乎是谁！" 明日香愤怒地说，依旧保持距离，没有回头，但她的声音透露出紧张，略带沙哑，仿佛正忍受着感冒的痛苦；喉咙刺痛，难以启齿。"我告诉你时，问过你是否在意，你只是耸肩表示无所谓，接着那些女孩开始议论你...然后我听到了真...我...

Because every one of his friends, except for Hikari and Mayumi had said that Asuka was just a mean, selfish, and haughty girl, and lately it had seemed like the only thing they did was argue about anything which in itself was annoying.
除了光和真由美，其他朋友都认为飞鸟是个刻薄、自私又傲慢的女孩。最近，他们似乎除了为各种事情争吵外别无他事，这让人感到十分厌烦。

"What did you expect me to do?" Shinji asked angrily; back then, Shinji had been livid, but of course, he had kept it to himself; he just couldn't understand, and he often thought it was useless to try. "You were talking about him on the way back, saying how he was so cool, and president of the debate club, and also part of the baseball team, and how he had come and asked you in front of everyone."
你到底想让我怎么做？" 真嗣气愤地质问；当时，他确实怒火中烧，但并未显露。他就是搞不懂，常觉得试图理解也是白费力气。"你回来的路上一直在说他，夸他多酷，辩论社的社长，棒球队的，还当众向你表白。

But then why..? 可是，为什么呢…？

"I-" Asuka began, looking down, realizing that this was the end, because she couldn't keep the charade anymore, and now she looked smaller than Shinji could remember her, shoulders scrunched together, and body looking like a withered flower trying to survive the cold.
"我-" 明日香开口时，垂下目光，意识到一切即将结束，因为她再也无法继续这场伪装。此刻，她显得比真嗣记忆中的任何时候都要瘦弱，肩膀紧缩，身体仿佛一朵在寒风中苦苦支撑的凋零花朵。

Why was it that every time he saw her, his heart would beat like crazy?
为何每次遇见她，他的心都如脱缰野马般狂跳？

"You kissed me because you were bored." Shinji added quietly, taking another step as Asuka remained looking down, and now he could feel it once more; the smell of her shampoo and body wash, so close, so intense and intimate...
"你吻我，只因你感到无聊。" 碇真嗣轻声续言，又迈进一步，明日香依旧垂首，此刻他再次被她洗发水和沐浴露的香气包围，如此贴近，如此浓烈而私密...

A smell so tantalizing that it literally made him ache.
那香味如此诱人，几乎让他感到心痛。

"You pinched my nose." 你捏了捏我的鼻子。

"Yeah..." Asuka nodded, before she looked up at Shinji, and Shinji swallowed as she took a step towards him.
"嗯..." 明日香点头回应，随即抬头望向真嗣，真嗣不禁咽了咽口水，只见她向他迈近了一步。

"And now you tried to gave me chocolate to make up for it." Shinji said as she took one last, final step towards her as well, now only separated by mere inches before he picked up the abused cardboard box and offered it to her.
"现在你试图用巧克力来补偿。" 真嗣说着，也迈出了最后一步，两人之间仅剩咫尺之遥，他拾起那只受损的纸板箱，递给了她。

"I actually liked it." Shinji began quietly, and for some reason, his words seemed to be like lances piercing Asuka's body, making the redhead tremble, whether it was either out of anger, or regret, or embarrassment, Shinji couldn't really tell.
"我确实挺喜欢的。" 碇真嗣轻声说道，不知为何，他的话仿佛利箭穿透了明日香的心，令红发少女不禁颤抖，究竟是因愤怒、悔意还是羞涩，碇真嗣难以判断。

But he figured that if Asuka had the guts to do something like this, the least he could do was try as well.
他觉得，既然明日香都有胆量这么做，自己至少也应该尝试一番。

"I got you something." Shinji continued undauntedly, opening the box and pulling out a smaller one, red with gold trimmings, and after a moment, Asuka took the box from him.
"我给你准备了礼物。" 碇真嗣继续说道，打开盒子，从中取出一个红色镶金边的小盒子，片刻后，明日香接过了这个小盒子。

"I told you I didn't want anything for White Day."
我早就说过，白色情人节我什么礼物都不要。

"I know" Shinji said smiling at Asuka who, despite her angry scowl, was looking at the box and biting her lip, which meant she wasn't going to hit him or anything.
"我知道。" 真嗣微笑着对明日香说，尽管她面露怒色，但她的目光紧盯着盒子，咬着嘴唇，显然她并不打算对他动手。

Shinji knew that Asuka hated white chocolate; had complained about how the taste seemed chalky, and how the texture was too hard, and how the color was just wrong.
真嗣清楚明日香不喜欢白巧克力，她之前就吐槽过，说它味道干涩，口感过硬，颜色也不讨喜。

And Shinji couldn't help but smile despite himself because he figured it was some kind of poetic justice that Asuka would take chocolate so seriously; they couldn't have been more than eight or ten when Kyoko and Yui had explained to the little redhead about why girls could only get white chocolate a month after valentines, to which Asuka had answered in the same way she would have had this happened when she was older, by declaring it a stupid tradition.
尽管新二自己也不禁微笑，因为他觉得这是一种诗意的正义，明日香会如此认真地对待巧克力；他们那时不过八九岁，当京子和唯向这位小红发解释为什么女孩只能在情人节一个月后得到白巧克力时，明日香像长大后一样回答，宣称这是一个愚蠢的传统。

"It's a stupid tradition."
这是一种愚蠢的传统。

"I know..." Shinji said smiling patiently and feeling like a kid again, trying to somehow bring back a smile to her face.
"我知道..." 真嗣带着微笑，耐心地说着，仿佛回到了孩童时代，努力想让她再次展露笑颜。

Asuka was staring at him now, and her scowl was slowly melting away, and when she tried to open the box Shinji figured the gentleman thing to do was to help her, which he did, and their fingers brushed together, making Asuka's face grow a red hue on her cheeks.
明日香此刻正凝视着他，紧锁的眉头逐渐舒展。她尝试打开盒子时，真嗣认为作为绅士理应协助，便上前帮忙。手指不经意间的触碰，让明日香的脸颊染上了红晕。

Shinji figured he's made the right choice; blushing was never a bad sign, according to the movies and the series and the comics and Kaji and Toji and Musashi.
真嗣觉得自己的选择没错；按照电影、剧集、漫画以及加持、东治和武藏的观点，脸红从来都不是什么不好的征兆。

And even if Asuka hadn't meant any of it, even if she rejected him now, Shinji thought it was worth it, because Asuka wasn't the type to blush, and right now...
即便明日香并非出于真心，即便她此刻拒绝了他，真嗣仍觉得这一切值得，毕竟明日香不是轻易脸红的人，而此刻...

Right now she looked pretty, and soft and almost vulnerable.
此时，她显得美丽而温柔，几乎带有一丝脆弱。

"How much money did you spend on this?"
你在这上面花费了多少？

Shinji shrugged like he had seen Kaji do it whenever Misato had asked him the same question about something he had bought her, making Asuka roll her eyes obviously knowing who the blue-eyed boy was trying to emulate as she slowly opened the box.
真嗣模仿卡吉的样子耸了耸肩，每当美里问起卡吉给她买的东西时，卡吉总是这样。明日香见状，心知肚明地翻了个白眼，随即缓缓打开了盒子。

"They-" 他们-

Inside was a small assortment of truffles made out of dark chocolate, which Shinji knew Asuka liked better than the regular milk type, and Asuka figured they had been expensive because they were impressively lavish judging from the wrapping and the way they seemed to have been hand crafted meticulously by some sort of chocolate artisan.
盒内装着一小份黑巧克力制成的松露巧克力，真嗣知道明日香偏爱这种而非普通牛奶巧克力。从精美的包装和手工制作的精致程度来看，明日香推测这些巧克力价格不菲，定是出自某位巧克力大师之手，显得格外奢华。

Shinji opened his mouth to offer an explanation, given how Asuka had turned to look up at him, figuring she was trying to understand what he meant by this, deciding that, even if she hadn't helped him back on when this whole thing started on the roof, it was his duty to help Asuka out.
碇真嗣张口欲言，见明日香转头仰视，料她正试图领会其意，心想纵使她未曾在屋顶上事端初起时施以援手，助明日香一臂之力仍是他的本分。

But Asuka didn't really care, and Shinji realized that she wasn't really trying to figure out what he meant.
然而，明日香对此并不上心，真嗣察觉到她其实并未努力去领会他的意图。

Instead, she was kissing him, again, slowly and maybe a bit shyly, and perhaps a tad forcefully, but she wasn't doing it out boredom, and Shinji felt slightly dizzy and out of breath even if she wasn't pinching his nose.
相反，她再次亲吻他，动作缓慢，带着些许羞涩，又似乎有些坚决，这并非出于无聊，真嗣感到一阵头晕和呼吸急促，尽管她并未捏住他的鼻子。

Because the kiss held all the explanations they both needed from each other; it was wanting to belong, not out of some sort of poetic notion of love, but wanting to know what truth laid behind the looks each held, being able to see past the posturing and into what was really being said despite the words being spoken.
这个吻包含了他们彼此所需的所有解释；它渴望归属，并非源于某种诗意化的爱情观念，而是渴望探知对方眼神背后的真实，能够透过表象，洞悉言语之外的真正心声。

A kiss that asked for them to cast away the doubts, and listen to what couldn't be said.
一个吻，请求他们抛却疑虑，聆听那些无法言传的心声。

Because a kiss had changed their lives a year before, and this kiss would change it from this point on in just a second, wiping the slate clean, and burning itself forever into their mind.
一年前的一个吻曾彻底改变了他们的生活，此刻，这个吻又将瞬间改写一切，抹去过往，永存心间。

So there was no explanation needed or given; just a simple realization to be had.
因此无需多言，也未作解释；只需心领神会。

Once, when Shinji and his friends had been eating lunch in the school roof as usual, the conversation had drifted towards the topic of girlfriends and Musashi had mentioned how girlfriends always liked sweets and candies and going to nice, expensive restaurants and watching girly, sappy movies that always made them cry throughout the movie.
某次，真嗣与朋友们照常在学校屋顶享用午餐，闲聊中谈及了女朋友的话题。武藏说，女生们通常偏爱甜食和糖果，钟情于高档餐厅，还特别喜欢看那些让她们泪流满面的浪漫电影。

For some reason, Shinji had thought in that moment how Asuka would never do that, how she liked to eat meat lover's pizza and spicy curry and watch action movies, especially the kind that are loud enough to make one go deaf and that made her punch the air and scream loudly.
不知为何，那一刻真嗣脑海中闪过明日香绝不会这样做的念头，她钟爱肉食披萨和辛辣咖喱，酷爱观看动作电影，尤其是那些音量大到震耳欲聋，能让她兴奋得挥拳高呼的类型。

So Shinji had long ago realized he was just not ready for a girlfriend, and he had come to this understanding after drawing forth all the amassed information he could muster, both from seeing how Misato behaved around Kaji, and from all the TV shows and magazines and other sources.
因此，真嗣早已明白自己尚未准备好迎接恋爱，这一认识源于他竭尽所能搜集的各类信息，包括观察美里与加持的互动，以及从电视节目、杂志等渠道获取的资料。

After careful observation of the mating rituals that were prevalent in TV Shows, as well as the way Musashi and Toji were swindled by their "not-really-my-girlfriend" girlfriends, Shinji had realized that, before he could even think about having a girlfriend, he'd have to get a couple of part-time jobs, and ask his mom for permission to do so, or ask his dad for extra allowance, which of course made getting a couple of part-time jobs an easier, less terrorizing choice.
通过观察电视节目中常见的求偶仪式，以及武藏和东二被他们所谓的“女友”欺骗的经历，真嗣领悟到，在考虑交女朋友之前，他得先找几份兼职，并征得母亲的同意，或者向父亲多要点零花钱。显然，找兼职工作成了一个更为轻松、不那么让人害怕的选择。

But right now, a little voice in his head told him that wasn't entirely true, making him remember that Asuka never expected any of those things from him.
然而此刻，他内心有个声音提醒他，这并非全然真实，使他忆起明日香其实从未对他抱有这些期待。

Well, ok, she sometimes does... Shinji thought quietly as he took another look at the redhead's room across from him. But only when she's trying to make a point. A-and there are other times when she's actually offended whenever I do something like that.
嗯，好吧，她偶尔确实会这样... 碇真嗣默默思索着，再次望向对面红发女孩的房间。那通常是在她试图强调某个观点的时候。不过，也有时候，我那样做会让她真的感到不悦。

Like the first time Shinji had tried to buy her lunch: she had been pestering him for weeks so Shinji had finally decided to do it just to get her off his back, but when he offered her a Yakisoba roll Asuka had given him a look, before grabbing it and tossing it away before going back to eating the lunch her mother had packed for her that day, making Shinji look at Asuka as she kept on eating as if nothing had happened before he sighed, dropping his shoulders and walking away, shaking his head.
如同初次真嗣尝试请她吃午饭的情形：她已缠扰他数周，真嗣为求清静，决定请客。然而，当他递上炒面面包时，明日香瞥了一眼，接过后随手丢弃，转而继续享用母亲为她准备的便当。真嗣望着明日香若无其事地用餐，叹息一声，肩膀一沉，摇头离去。

But there was that one time we stopped by the Lotteria nearby, and she bought me a kid's combo... even if all she wanted was the action figure because Misato had asked for it and Asuka owed her.
但有一次我们路过附近的乐天利，她给我买了份儿童套餐……其实她只是想要套餐里的玩具，因为明日香之前欠她人情，而美里又正好想要那个玩具。

Once, Toji and Kensuke had convinced Shinji to go with them to the arcade, ditching Asuka's physics tutoring session; when she found out, the redhead proceeded to beat him in every single arcade game and video game he owned mercilessly, methodically and gruesomely, even going so far as to take pictures, or stalk him until Shinji would log in and then school him live in versus modes, posting the rankings and pictures in the school bulletin boards to add insult to injury before eventually growing tired and demanding Shinji to buy her tokens every time they went to the arcade until she could forgive him.
某次，东治和剑介拉着真嗣去了游戏厅，结果错过了明日香的物理辅导。明日香得知后，便在每款街机游戏及真嗣所有的电子游戏中，毫不留情地、有条不紊地击败他，甚至拍照记录，或跟踪他直到他上线，在对抗模式中当众羞辱他，还将战绩和照片贴在学校的公告板上。最终，她厌倦了这种报复，要求真嗣每次去游戏厅都得给她买代币，直到她消气为止。

Thank God it only took about two days and a half days, and when I won that one time, she accepted to be my "slave" for the day as punishment, but refused to do anything other than help me with my English homework.
谢天谢地，这事只花了大约两天半。那次我赢了，她作为惩罚答应当天做我的“奴隶”，但除了帮我做英语作业，其他一概不从。

Toji had agreed saying that, besides making one go to boring movies, girlfriends also insisted on having the boyfriend carry their shopping bags and holding doors open while expecting them to dress nicely in suits and ties or khakis and button-down shirts, like Misato made Kaji do.
时子表示赞同，她指出，女友们不仅要求男友陪看乏味的电影，还坚持要他们帮忙提购物袋、开门，并期望他们穿着得体，比如西装领带或卡其裤搭配纽扣衬衫，正如美里对薰的要求一样。

But Asuka always tell me I dress way too boring, that I should be comfortable enough NOT wearing polo shirts, or wearing ripped jeans, and she never carries any bags and she's always opening her own doors and likes sitting in booths whenever we go to eat at a fast food place, except for the times she demands I act like a gentleman which is normally just a way for her to tease me...
但明日香常批评我着装太乏味，建议我穿得自在些，不必拘泥于 polo 衫或破洞牛仔裤。她从不带包，总是自己开门，喜欢坐在快餐店的卡座里，除非她偶尔要求我表现得像个绅士，那通常只是她逗我的一种方式...

Musashi had mentioned that girlfriends expected a boyfriend to get them nice things, and when their birthdays came around, they expected roses and nice jewelry and dinner and a movie.
武藏曾提及，女生们总希望男友能送些好礼物，生日之际，更是期待收到玫瑰、精致的饰品，以及共进晚餐和看电影。

But when I tried giving her a necklace for her birthday, Asuka slapped my shoulder before saying how she had been dropping hints all month long about wanting Gore Coliseum IV instead.
当我试图送她一条项链作为生日礼物时，明日香拍了拍我的肩膀，随后抱怨说她整个月都在暗示想要《血战竞技场 IV》。

And when Shinji pointed out those hints had been her swearing she would never get such a brutish game because she hated blood, Asuka had simply dismissed his logic by saying any guy would have known to read between the lines and the was only accepting the gift because it would be rude and she was brought better than that by her mom.
当真嗣提到那些暗示是她曾发誓不会碰这种血腥游戏时，明日香不以为然，反驳说任何男生都该懂得揣摩言外之意。她之所以接受这份礼物，仅因拒绝显得失礼，她母亲教导她应有更高的修养。

But Shinji could still see inside Asuka's room, seeing that necklace hanging from the cork-board in her room right next to a picture they both had taken once during summer, smiling, happy, flashing a peace sign at the camera while Asuka held her arm around his neck.
然而，真嗣依然能窥见明日香房间内的景象，那条项链就挂在她的软木板上，紧邻着一张他们夏日合影的照片。照片中，两人笑容满面，幸福地向镜头比出和平手势，明日香还搂着他的脖子。

And Shinji realized that Mana had been right all along.
真嗣这才明白，麻奈的看法始终是正确的。

Asuka isn't right for anyone... and she isn't girlfriend material, but that's a good thing, because if I had a girlfriend, I'd need a part-time job now, and extra allowances... and a lot of practice at knowing when to hold open doors and pay for things.
明日香并不适合任何人...她并非理想的恋爱对象，但这反而是好事，因为一旦有了女朋友，我恐怕得找份兼职，零用钱也得增加...还得学会何时该为对方开门和买单。

So Shinji was happy he didn't have a girlfriend... he had an Asuka.
因此，真嗣庆幸自己没有女朋友，而是拥有了一个明日香。

And as he kept making out with her, faintly feeling the cold air, along with the smell that was Asuka intermixing with the sweet, intoxicating smell of the gardenias from her window just a few meters away, Shinji realized that was much better than anything an ordinary girlfriend could offer him.
在持续的亲吻中，真嗣隐约感受到冷风，以及明日香身上混合着窗外几米远处栀子花那甜美醉人香气的味道，他意识到这比任何普通女友所能给予的都要美妙得多。

AN: According to Hanakotoba, the Japanese "language of flowers", Gardenias represent "Secret Love". Also, if you're ever around a Lotteria burger joint, try the shrimp burger; it's awesome with a side of gnarly, totally.
根据日本的“花语”Hanakotoba，栀子花象征着“秘密的爱”。若你恰好在 Lotteria 汉堡店附近，推荐你尝试他们的虾堡，再搭配一份美味的薯条，味道棒极了。

Pre-read by: Some dudes on my facebook (but not the full story, just an excerpt) and my entire Creative Writing Class (unwillingly; thanks, losers!).
预读人员：我在 Facebook 上的几位朋友（仅预读了节选，非全文）以及我整个创意写作班（他们并不情愿；感谢你们，伙计们！）。

I want to offer this story as a shout-out and a boost to my girl Myssa Rei; before her, I knew squat about Mayumi Yamagishi, thanks to her and Ranka, I came to see Mayumi as a credible character given the right context; may this little story serve as some sort of homage to how those two managed to make an obscure video-game only character an important character in this fic.
我想通过这个故事向我的好友 Myssa Rei 表达敬意和支持；在她介绍之前，我对山岸真弓一无所知。得益于她与兰卡的努力，我在恰当的背景中看到了山岸真弓这一角色的可信度。愿这个小故事能作为对她们如何将一个游戏中的边缘角色塑造成本文关键角色的致敬。

Well, this is uh, what? number 17? Yeah... go me... just 13 more to go; at the rate this is going I might end this before I get to retire. This is the annual valentine's day fic (and yes, before a certain anonymous asks, if he decides to leave another unsigned review the other one is still a WIP) so I hope y'all like and whatever; with some luck, this might go into the fanfictionwriters' contest page as well.
嗯，这是第 17 篇了吧？对...继续努力...还剩 13 篇；照这个进度，我可能在退休前就能搞定。这是每年情人节的同人文（是的，在某个匿名者再次提问之前，如果他决定再留下一条未署名的评论，上一篇还在创作中），希望大家喜欢，诸如此类；运气好的话，这篇还可能被选入同人作家大赛页面。

Thanks for reading, hope you liked this, and have a happy Valentines day.
感谢您的阅读，希望您喜欢这篇文章，祝您情人节快乐。

### Chapter 18 Themes: K#13 (Excessive chain), W#16 (Honesty)
主题：K#13（链条过度），W#16（诚信）

Title: Marry Me. 标题：与我结婚吧。

Disclaimer: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
免责声明：我在此声明以自保：Eva 及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

Shinji hiccuped shifting a little as he felt a leg of the table digging against his back, sniffling and running the back of his hand against his nose before taking another drink from the sake bottle at his feet.
真嗣打了个嗝，微微挪动身体，感受到桌子腿顶在背上，他吸了吸鼻子，用手背抹了下鼻子，随后又从脚边的清酒瓶中喝了一口。

"Y-you bitch…" 你这个贱人…

He took another swig, making a face out of memory, since the bitterness of the sake had long been forgotten, his taste buds already numbed by the liquor as several empty bottles laid strewn around his feet and on top of the table against which his back was resting right now.
他再次大口饮下，脸上浮现出回忆的神情，因为清酒的苦涩早已淡忘，他的味觉已被酒精所麻痹，几只空瓶散落在他脚边和倚靠的桌面上。

"H-how could you… w-why?" Shinji sobbed before throwing the first thing in his hand which turned out to be the ring box, getting a brief feeling of satisfaction from hearing it clattering around the room.
"你怎么能这样…为什么？" 新治哽咽着，随手将手中的戒指盒扔了出去，听着它在房间里滚动的声音，心中涌起一丝莫名的快感。

"I thought I meant something… you only… you used me." he continued while hitting the floor with her fist, unable to otherwise express his rage and anger and frustration while his mind kept replaying the events of the day over and over.
"我曾以为自己有所意义…你却…你利用了我。"他一边说着，一边用拳头猛击地面，难以用其他方式宣泄心中的怒火与挫败，脑海中不断回放着那一天的种种。

"Shinji, please stop drumming your fingers against the controls, the sound is aggravating." Ritsuko Akagi said sullenly while recording the latest data from test plug 01.
"真嗣，别再敲打控制台了，那声音真让人心烦。" 丽子·阿卡伊一边记录着来自 01 号测试插头的最新数据，一边不悦地说道。

"Sorry, Dr. Akagi." Came the sheepish response over the comm channel, making Ritsuko roll her eyes while a small smile crept on her face. It was obvious he was nervous given what he had planned today, and Misato had been very clear about telling her and Kaji not to mention anything about knowing Shinji's plan.
"抱歉，赤木博士。"通讯频道里传来略带羞涩的声音，让律子不禁翻了个白眼，嘴角却忍不住露出一丝微笑。显然，他因为今天的安排而感到紧张，而美里已经再三叮嘱她和加持，不要让真嗣察觉到他们已经知晓了他的计划。

"Even if he doesn't look like it, he still has trouble believing in himself."
尽管外表看不出来，他内心依然缺乏自信。

The irony wasn't lost by neither of the three.
三人中没有谁没领会到其中的讽刺意味。

"Don't you think they're both too young?" Kaji asked over the video feed, ever the concerned adult when it came to the redhead he now saw equally as a younger sister, as well as a daughter. "I mean, far be it for me to stifle young love and all, but I really think those two should take things a bit slower."
你不觉得他们俩都太年轻了吗？" 卡吉透过视频连线表达了他的担忧，对于那位他既视如妹妹又如女儿的红发女孩，他总是如此关切。"我无意阻止年轻人的爱情，只是觉得他们俩应该稍微放慢脚步。

"Are you sure this is you talking and not your paycheck?" Misato grumbled.
"你确定这是你的本意，而不是受薪水影响吗？" 碇真嗣嘟囔道。

"Ok, fine… Langley asked me to have a talk with her and to make a long story short, I don't think I'm her beloved Kaji-san anymore." The ponytailed man said with a smirk before hearing a beep. "Ritsuko, I just got Asuka's data. Here, you can check her synch-graphs against Shinji's."
好吧，总之…兰利让我和她聊了聊，简单来说，我感觉自己不再是她心爱的卡吉先生了。" 马尾男子带着一抹微笑说道，紧接着听到一声提示音。"律子，我刚拿到明日香的数据。看，你可以对比一下她和真嗣的同步率图。

"Thanks Kaji." Ritsuko said calmly, taking a sip from her coffee cup while scribbling down something on her notepad. "Both you two and Asuka's father need to understand they faced a life or death situation 4 years ago, and then once they survived, they were told they would be separated and possibly never see each other again. If anything, those situations made them more aware of what could happen in the near future as opposed to anything."
"谢谢你，Kaji。" 律子平静地说，边喝咖啡边在笔记本上记着什么。"你们和明日香的爸爸都得理解，四年前他们遭遇了生死关头，幸存后又得知可能永远分离。这些经历让他们对未来可能发生的事情更加警觉。

"Well, you know those two… it's been four years and they still behave pretty much like Asuka living in Germany is nothing but a short-term vacation." Misato pointed out from her seat, where she was busy amusing herself by spinning around.
"哎，那两位的情况你也知道…四年过去了，他们的举止依旧像是明日香在德国的日子不过是短暂的假期。" 葛城美里坐在椅子上，一边说着，一边自得其乐地转着圈。

"Her father told Asuka she was still too young and if needed be, he would pull his weight around to make her focus on what was important instead of chasing after rainbows." Kaji said with a humorless tone.
"她的父亲对明日香说，她还太年轻，如果有必要，他会尽力让她专注于真正重要的事情，而不是去追逐那些不切实际的梦想。" 加持语气严肃地说道。

"So that's why she did it, huh?" Misato wondered out loud while smirking.
"原来如此，她这么做是有原因的啊。" 碇真嗣带着一丝微笑自言自语。

"Did what?" 什么做了？

"Oh, Asuka told me last time she'd be staying with me instead of Hikari."
哦，上次阿苏卡跟我说，她决定和我住，不和光里一起了。

"She did?" 她做了？

"Yeah, I think Hikari doesn't want to cover for her anymore when I call asking for her knowing already she's necking with Shinji on the apartment complex roof…." Misato said with a slight smirk as if knowing this made her be superior to everyone in the room. "As if any one of them could pull the ol' 'lets ditch Misato and make out' trick on me."
是啊，我觉得光现在不会再帮她打掩护了，每次我打电话找她，都清楚她正和真嗣在公寓楼顶亲昵……" 美里带着一丝得意的微笑说道，仿佛这一认知让她在房间里的人中显得高人一等。"好像他们中任何一个能对我耍'我们甩掉美里去亲热'的花招似的。

"You both might as well accept the fact that your surrogate children are getting married… which might qualify as a quasi incestuous-relationship." Ritsuko added while taking another drink of her coffee to hide her smirk while Misato and Kaji sputtered around her comment.
"你们还是接受现实吧，你们的代孕孩子即将步入婚姻……这或许可被视为一种近似乱伦的关系。" 律子说着，又抿了一口咖啡，以遮掩她的笑意，而美里和卡吉则在她身旁尴尬地应和着。

And now, the blond could see the look in Shinji's face, knowing that as soon as he would be out, he would call Asuka and they would both talk for the better part of the hour.
此刻，金发少年已能读懂真嗣脸上的神情，心知他一离开便会致电明日香，两人将畅谈近一个小时。

I wonder how on earth that boy plans on proposing to her. Ritsuko thought as she milled ruefully, turning to look over her shoulder to the top part of the command deck where both Dr. Ikari and Commander Ikari were watching.
丽莎子思索着，苦笑着转头望向指挥甲板的上层，碇源堂博士和碇司令正注视着，她不禁好奇那个男孩究竟打算如何向她求婚。

Still, it wouldn't hurt to give him a little confidence shot. Ritsuko thought as she opened a private voice channel between her terminal and Shinji.
即便如此，给他一点信心上的提振也无伤大雅。律子边想边打开了与真嗣的私人语音频道。

"Hi, Shinji, I have been noticing a few uh… fluctuation marks on your synch-graph… are you nervous about… something in particular?"
嗨，真嗣，我发现你的同步图上有几处波动，是不是有什么特别的事情让你感到紧张？

Shinji blinked at the voice channel, labeled 'Sound Only' before he looked at his parents; they both looked busy and serious, but he could also see his mother's hand squeezing his father's shoulder, before his own gloved hand came to rest on top of her.
真嗣对着标有“仅声音”的语音频道眨了眨眼，随后望向父母；他们神情专注而严肃，然而他注意到母亲的手正紧握着父亲的肩膀，紧接着，他自己戴着手套的手也轻轻覆在了母亲手上。

"Uh… ye-yeah, a little…" 嗯…是-是的，有点儿…

"Don't worry Shinji, I'm sure she's waiting for you to call her too."
真嗣，别担心，她肯定也在期待你给她打电话呢。

Shinji's face blushed a bright red; of course everyone knew about his and Asuka's relationship, especially after the incident involving the ship that was supposed to send her and Unit 02 to the NERV-EU base in Germany, how he had boarded the ship without permission, running around while shouting Asuka's name only to have her show up in one of the scaffold's overhead, jumping over the rail and reaching out for him, holding each other like a lifeline, never letting go.
真嗣的脸颊泛起一片绯红；他和明日香的关系早已是人尽皆知，尤其是在那次事件之后——那艘本应载着她和二号机前往德国 NERV-EU 基地的船上，他擅自闯入，焦急地呼喊着明日香的名字，直到她从头顶的脚手架上一跃而下，伸出手与他紧紧相拥，仿佛抓住了生命的纽带，再也不愿松开。

Misato hadn't been pleased in the slightest, and Kaji had even given them a halfharted lecture while both were still on the ship but both Shinji and Asuka noticed how he was obviously bored and didn't even say anything while they each held hands.
美里丝毫没有感到高兴，加持虽然在船上对他们进行了敷衍的训话，但真嗣和明日香都察觉到他明显心不在焉，甚至在他们两人手牵手时也未置一词。

That had been 4 years ago. 4 long years of a long distance relationship that would have Asuka coming over twice a year and staying with Hikari on the pretense of 'catching up with her' or Shinji going to visit Kaji and, invariably, Asuka; messages and emails and packages for valentines day and white day, birthdays and more had been exchanged.
那已是四年前的事。这段长达四年的异地恋中，飞鸟每年会来两次，借口“与光叙旧”与之同住，而真嗣则去探望卡吉，自然也会见到飞鸟；情人节、白色情人节、生日等时刻，他们互赠了无数的信息、邮件和礼物。

And through it all, their relationship had been cemented, had grown stronger, and now, today…
经历了这一切，他们的关系愈发牢固，愈发坚强，直至今日..

Asuka will be 18. Shinji thought as he exited the test plug and walked quickly towards the locker room, already imagining his phone would be ringing since Asuka was always calling him on time. He was still a little worried after their last fight a couple of days ago, it had been over something minimal but for some reason Asuka had insisted making a big deal out of it, before she began to tell Shinji she was tired of the distance, of the wait, of having to listen day in and out to her parents telling her she should be better at school, apply herself more on Nerv's program.
明日香即将迎来 18 岁生日。真嗣一边这样想着，一边迅速离开测试舱，快步走向更衣室，他预感到手机很快就会响起，因为明日香总是准时来电。尽管他们几天前的争吵已经平息，他心中仍有些许不安，那次争吵本因微不足道的小事而起，但明日香却执意将其放大，随后她向真嗣吐露心声，她厌倦了这种遥远的距离，厌倦了无尽的等待，厌倦了每天听着父母唠叨她应该在学校更加努力，应该更专注于 NERV 的项目。

In short, asking her to let go of him.
简单来说，就是让她放手。

It had all went downhill afterward, like a wrecking ball that had lost control, smashing everything in front until all the excessive chain had been railed in and exhausted, ending in Asuka calling him an idiot and how she hated him and she was happy they were half a world apart otherwise she would be kicking him up and down the street.
此后一切急转直下，犹如失控的铁球，摧毁前方所有，直至多余的链条被收束耗尽。最终，明日香骂他是个傻瓜，表达了对他的厌恶，并庆幸他们相隔半个地球，否则她定会把他踢得满街跑。

That was when Shinji had decided to end the conversation. Seconds afterwards, Asuka had called only to shout at him when he picked up she was the one ending this, not him.
就在那时，真嗣决定终止对话。不久，明日香来电，他一接听，她便怒斥他，表明是她要结束通话，而非他。

Afterwards, Shinji had decided to let her be and let her cool down. In a way, it had worked out better for him; that fight had made him realize she was right and he should show her what she really meant, so after carefully considering everything, he had decided to buy her a ring and ask her to marry him on her birthday, letting her know that when she got to Tokyo in a couple of weeks, he would be giving her the ring to make it official and in the meantime they should prepare their parents for the obvious shocking news.
事后，Shinji 决定给她空间，让她冷静。某种程度上，这反而对他有利；那次争执让他明白她是对的，他应该向她表明她的重要性。经过深思熟虑，他决定买一枚戒指，在她生日那天求婚，告诉她几周后她到东京时，他会正式送上戒指，并在此期间，他们应为父母准备这令人震惊的消息。

But when Shinji checked his phone he saw there were no missed calls or messages, no emails or voice mails.
然而，当真嗣查看手机时，却未发现任何未接来电、短信、邮件或语音信息。

That's odd, it should be 10 in the morning over there. Shinji thought as he glanced at the small velvet box inside his locker. Asuka would come for her Christmas break in 2 weeks, but he had already made up his mind to ask her to marry him, now that they were both, finally, legally adults.
真嗣觉得奇怪，那边此刻应是上午十点。他瞥向储物柜内的小天鹅绒盒，心中暗想。两周后，明日香将回来过圣诞假期，而他已下定决心，要在那时向她求婚，毕竟两人如今都已合法成年。

Well, it is her birthday, so maybe she is expecting me to call her. The boy figured as he began to punch in the numbers, holding the phone to his ear and waiting.
今天是她的生日，她可能正盼着我打电话呢。男孩这么想着，开始拨号，将手机贴近耳朵，静静等待接通。

"Hallo?" 喂？

Shinji frowned; the voice was unmistakably male and clearly German, maybe Asuka's dad had…
真嗣皱眉，那声音无疑是男性的，带着明显的德国口音，或许是明日香的父亲……

"Hallo, wer ist das?" 你好，这位是谁？

"Oh, a-ah… E-English, please." Shinji said shakily, not knowing if Asuka's dad knew any Japanese. "I w-want to talk to Asu-"
哦，啊……请用英语说。" 真嗣颤抖着开口，不确定明日香的爸爸是否懂日语。"我想和明日-

"Wer ist es?" Shinji gasped; the voice sounded angry. Was Asuka still angry? Maybe she had an argument with someone.
"是谁？" 真嗣喘着气问道，那声音听起来很愤怒。明日香还在生气吗？或许她刚和谁发生了争执。

"Ich weiß es nicht, einige kid wollen mit dir reden."
我不清楚，有几个孩子想跟你聊聊。

"Ugh, ist es wahrscheinlich mein dummkopf Ex-Freund. Sagen Sie ihm, tot umfallen." Shinji couldn't understand a lot of German, but the only words he could make out were unequivocally Asuka's; 'Idiot Ex-boyfriend'.
"唉，估计又是我的那个蠢货前男友。告诉他，我气得要命。" 真嗣虽然不太懂德语，但那几个词明显是明日香的口吻：'傻瓜前男友'。

Whatever else anyone was saying, it didn't really matter; Shinji simply stopped caring, not even registering when the phone fell of his hand, impacting on the floor.
别人说什么都已不再重要，真嗣已经完全不在乎了，连手机从手中掉落，砸到地上都没察觉。

He didn't know how he got home, all he could remember was he had to get out of there, he had to leave, run… and all the strength he could muster only managed to move his legs forward, not caring or minding about bumping into people on the elevator or the train car.
他记不清是如何回到家的，脑海中只有逃离那里的念头……他拼尽全力，也只能让双腿艰难前行，对在电梯或车厢中撞到人已无暇顾及。

Never once did Shinji care enough to raise his eyes.
真嗣从未有一次足够关心，以至于抬起双眼。

On auto-pilot, he left on his usual stop, walking up towards his home, opening the door and walking in before going straight to the liquor cabinet.
他处于自动驾驶状态，像往常一样停下脚步，走向家门，开门进屋，随即直奔酒柜而去。

He didn't know how long he had been drinking, but he knew the numbness was a welcomed state; things felt softer, smoother… fuzzier.
他记不清喝了多久，只觉得这种麻木感令人惬意；周围的一切都变得柔和、平滑，仿佛蒙上了一层模糊的纱。

It also meant Kaworu was here.
这也表明薰就在此地。

"H-huh? Kaworu? Wh-what? Aren't you supposed to be in… de-dead?" Shinji slurred.
"啊？是渚薰吗？怎、怎么回事？你不是已经……不在了吗？" 真嗣结巴着说。

"Yes, I am just a hallucination brought upon by your consumption of alcohol." Kaworu said placidly, sitting down in front of Shinji and staring at him with dancing, merry eyes.
"没错，我不过是你饮酒后的一场幻觉。"薰平静地坐到真嗣面前，用充满欢愉的眼睛注视着他。

"W-well, why are you here?"
那么，你来这儿是为什么呢？

"I am a figment of your imagination, Shinji… I also seem to be someone you feel a close attachment to. A spirit guide of sorts." Kaworu chuckled, almost as if he had said a personal, private joke. "What is it you wanted to talk about?"
我不过是你的幻想，真嗣……同时，我似乎也是你极为亲近的存在。可以说是某种精神向导。" 薰轻声笑了起来，仿佛分享了一个只有两人懂的秘密笑话。"你想聊些什么呢？

Shinji paused, looking at Kaworu with bleary, drunken eyes. "I-if you're really just a random thought, you should… know."
真嗣顿了顿，醉眼朦胧地看着薰。“我-如果你真的只是我脑海中的一个念头，那你应该……明白。”

"You want to talk about how Soryu dumped you." Kaworu said with the same affably tone, as if he were practicing singing lessons.
"你想聊聊 Soryu 是怎么把你甩了的。" Kaworu 依旧用那亲切的口吻说道，仿佛在练习声乐一般。

"Why? We promised we'd wait… she just… why?"
为什么呢？我们明明说好要等的…她就这么…为什么？

"You're thinking perhaps she was pressured by someone. Kaji and Misato had already said we were too young." Kaworu spoke in Shinji's soft voice, matching pitch and tone without flaw.
"你可能在想，她是否受到了某人的胁迫。加持和美里之前就说过，我们还是太年轻。" 渚薰以真嗣柔和的嗓音说道，无论是音调还是语气都模仿得天衣无缝。

"Yeah." 对。

"So do you feel that way?"
你也是这么觉得的吗？

"O-of course not." Shinji shot back feeling dizzy. "I mean, yeah, we're young but we love each other so it really shouldn't matter, right?"
当然不是。" 真嗣反驳时感到一阵眩晕。"我是说，虽然我们年轻，但我们真心相爱，这不应该成为问题，对吧？

Kaworu nodded. "But you already knew I would agree with you."
薰点头说：“但你心里清楚，我会支持你的。”

"Yeah." Shinji sighed. "I mean, you always want what would make me happy, so…"
嗯。" 真嗣叹息道，"我的意思是，你总是想做让我高兴的事，所以……

"Maybe I would be better for this then."
或许我来做这个会更合适。

Shinji blinked, now, in front of him was Rei.
真嗣眨了眨眼，此刻，绫波正站在他面前。

"I haven't seen you much even though we're both stationed here in Japan." Shinji said, smiling softly at Rei.
"尽管我们都在日本驻扎，我却很少见到你。" 碇真嗣温柔地对绫波丽微笑着说。

"That's because I've been in Matsuhiro. Besides, you no longer call." Rei said with a chiding tone, even if she was smiling at Shinji like she used to. Last time Shinji had seen her, she had let her hair grow, now wearing it tied into a long ponytail.
"那是因为我一直待在松広。还有，你也不再联系我了。" 丽虽然面带往日的微笑，但语气中带着一丝责怪。上次真嗣见到她时，她的头发已经留长，如今束成了一个长长的马尾。

"I know, after the last time…"
我明白，上次之后……

"Yeah, I guess me blurting out I loved you even while I knew you and Asuka were dating was a bit of a gaffe." Rei said while rubbing her nose and giving Shinji a small bashful smile.
"嗯，我明知你和明日香在交往，却还是忍不住表白，确实有些唐突了。" 绫波说着，轻轻揉了揉鼻子，向真嗣投去一个略带羞涩的微笑。

"So, I…" Shinji began, closing his eyes, feeling his cheeks burning. "Are you here to tell me she did the right thing?"
那么，我…" 真嗣说着，闭上双眼，脸颊因羞涩而泛红。"你是来告诉我她那样做是对的吗？

Rei nodded. "You had actually been waiting for this day ever since you both decided to give this a try 4 years ago."
丽点头说：“自从四年前你们决定一试身手以来，你其实一直在期盼这一天的到来。”

The tone in which Rei said that made Shinji look down, realizing it was true.
绫波说话的口吻让真嗣垂下目光，意识到她所言非虚。

"You always knew she would eventually grow tired of long distance relationship; how often did you fight over small stuff like you not answering the phone, or her always having such a tight schedule? It's a wonder you even managed to hold up this long."
你早就预料到她会厌倦异地恋；你们因为琐事争吵了多少次，比如你不接电话，或者她总是忙得不可开交？真没想到你们能坚持这么久。

Shinji held his head against his knees. It's true. Rei's right.
真嗣把头埋在双膝之间。确实，绫波说得没错。

"So I guess I actually wanted her to leave me then? I'm so pathetic."
看来我当时其实是希望她离开我？我真是太可悲了。

"You really are." 你确实是。

Shinji blinked before looking up. In front of her was now Asuka, standing tall, proud and looking down sternly at him.
真嗣眨了眨眼，抬头望去。明日香正站在他面前，身姿挺拔，神情骄傲而严肃地俯视着他。

"Look at you, feeling sorry for yourself and getting drunk; you've been hanging around Misato for too long."
瞧你这副样子，自怜自艾还喝得酩酊大醉，跟真嗣混久了就是这样。

"Shut up." 别说话了。

"And look at the mess you made. I'm sure your mom and your dad are gonna be pissed off when they come back and see y—" Asuka paused mid sentence before stopping and noticing the small velvet box, kneeling down next to it.
"瞧瞧你弄得这乱七八糟的。我敢打赌，你爸妈回来看到这一幕绝对会火冒三丈，他们回来看到你——" 飞鸟话说到一半戛然而止，目光落在旁边的小天鹅绒盒子上，随即跪下身去。

"Don't touch that!" 别碰那个！

Asuka jumped back as Shinji grabbed the box from where it was, glaring at her with red, watery eyes.
明日香急忙后退，只见真嗣从原位抓起盒子，红着眼眶，目光如炬地盯着她。

"This was supposed to be your gift! I was gonna ask you to marry me!"
这原本是给你的礼物，我正准备向你求婚！

Asuka stopped and stared at Shinji, lips quivering .
明日香停下脚步，凝视着真嗣，嘴唇轻轻颤抖着。

"Y-you what?" 你说什么？

"Yeah, today, I was gonna… a-and then I wanted you… w-when you got here… a-and I…" Shinji mumbled before Asuka knelt in front of him, holding the box.
"嗯，今天我本来想…然后我想等你…你到这儿时…我…" 渚薰支支吾吾地说着，此时明日香跪在他面前，手里捧着盒子。

"Why didn't you called me today?"
你今天怎么没给我打电话呢？

"I did and your dad answered and I heard you saying it's probably my idiot ex-boyfriend and I just…"
我打了电话，你爸爸接的，我听到你猜测可能是我那傻瓜前男友，我一时……

Asuka stared at Shinji for a long time before she slowly began to giggle. The giggle became a chuckle and soon she was sitting in front of Shinji, laughing out loud before falling on her back while he looked at her with an angry look on his face.
明日香凝视着真嗣良久，终于忍不住轻声笑了出来。笑声渐渐放大，她坐在真嗣面前，笑得前仰后合，最终仰面躺倒，而真嗣则一脸怒气地望着她。

"It's not funny! A-And you're not even real!"
这一点都不好笑！再说，你根本就不存在！

Asuka stopped laughing, giving Shinji an exasperated look before she got back to her sitting position in front of Shinji.
明日香止住了笑，对真嗣投去一个不耐烦的眼神，随后又坐回了他面前。

"You really are an idiot, but I knew that from the moment I met you… still… I guess…"
你确实挺傻的，我一见到你就看出来了……不过……我还是想说……

*Slap!* *啪的一声!*

"Ow!" Shinji yelped rubbing his cheek after Asuka's slap. "What the hell was that fo—"
哎哟！" 真嗣揉着被明日香打过的脸颊，惊叫道。"你这是干嘛——

Shinji blinked quickly. 真嗣眨眼眨得很快。

"You're… here?" 你…在这儿？

"Of course I'm here! Where the hell else am I supposed to be!?" Asuka shouted as she placed her hands, balled into tight fists, on her waist, looking down at Shinji.
"我当然在这里！不然我还能在哪儿！？" 明日香大声说道，双手紧握成拳放在腰间，低头看着真嗣。

Just like back when we first met. Shinji thought, feeling a pang of nostalgia mixing in with the happiness that moment always brought to his heart.
就像初遇时那样。真嗣心中涌起怀旧与幸福交织的情感，那一刻总是让他心生欢喜。

"But I thought you... over there at Germany... I mean..."
但我以为你在德国那边...我是说...

"Please! Do you honestly think I wouldn't come here?" Asuka huffed, trying hard to hide her smile. "I bought a ticket myself and got here after I got in a fight with my dad, I've been staying at Misato's since yesterday at night."
拜托！你真以为我不会来吗？" 明日香哼了一声，努力藏起笑意。"和爸爸吵架后，我自己买了票，昨晚起就住在美里家了。

"Then today…" Shinji said slowly, trying to rationalize everything. "I heard you and your father…"
而今天…" 真嗣缓缓开口，试图梳理所有事情。"我无意中听到了你和你父亲的对话…

"Oh that? That was me talking with some random tech from Nerv a couple of days ago to set up my voicemail message for you." Asuka said as she pulled out her phone and grabbed Shinji's, dialing from his number and letting it ring several times before the message played again.
"哦，那个呀？那是几天前我联系 Nerv 的某个技术人员，为了给你设置语音信箱的留言。" 明日香边说边掏出自己的手机，又拿起真嗣的手机，用他的号码拨号，让铃声响了几遍后，留言再次响起。

"Stupid Shinji, I'm pissed right now, but if you called to apologize, then I guess I can always listen to your message. Moron."
真嗣，你真蠢，我现在很生气，但如果你打电话来道歉，我还是愿意听听你的留言。傻瓜。

Shinji stared first at the phone and then at her.
真嗣先凝视着电话，随后目光转向了她。

"What? I was still angry at you for being an idiot, you know."
什么？我还在为你的愚蠢行为生你的气，你明白的。

"A-and now?" Shinji said as his face slowly began to grow red and his lips slowly began to etch a smile.
"那，现在怎么办？" 新二说着，脸上逐渐泛起红晕，嘴角不由自主地露出了微笑。

"Now, I'm trying to come up with a good wedding proposal since I'm the one holding the ring." Asuka said before staring at Shinji, smiling. "Which is kind of lame because the guy should always do the proposing, a-and besides I have no clue of how to do this, anyway…"
此刻，我正绞尽脑汁构思一个完美的求婚计划，毕竟戒指在我手中。" 明日香说完，目光转向真嗣，嘴角挂着微笑。"感觉挺别扭的，按理说求婚应该是男生的活儿，可我对此一窍不通……

Shinji stood there, staring at her face, her smile, her eyes… nothing else seemed to matter except this moment with her while Asuka kept her smiled before pouncing on Shinji almost as if she were a lion stalking her prey, landing on top of Shinji, almost straddling him.
真嗣站在那儿，目不转睛地看着她的面容、她的微笑和她的双眼，此刻与她相伴，其他一切都显得无关紧要。明日香保持着笑容，猛地扑向真嗣，犹如狮子扑向猎物，一下子压在他身上，几乎骑坐在他身上。

"Shinji Ikari, my biggest idiot, my oldest friend, the only idiot who would sneak into a ship after realizing just how good a catch I am, the only dork who would put up with me in a relationship no one else but us seem to want,the only moron who would try to propose over the phone instead than on person…" Asuka said as she held the ring between thumb and forefinger, using it to separate her lips from Shinji's.
"真嗣·碇，我最大的傻瓜，我多年的挚友，唯一一个在意识到我有多么出色后还敢偷偷上船的笨蛋，唯一一个愿意在一段除了我们俩似乎没人看好的关系中忍受我的呆子，唯一一个试图通过电话而不是当面求婚的蠢货……" 明日香说着，用拇指和食指夹着戒指，用它隔开自己的嘴唇和真嗣的嘴唇。

"Would you marry me?" 愿意与我共结连理吗？

Shinji simply took the ring, and slid it into Asuka's fingers before cupping her chin and kissing her gently on the lips.
真嗣轻轻拿起戒指，缓缓套进明日香的手指，接着捧起她的脸颊，温柔地吻了吻她的嘴唇。

"You already knew I'd say yes."
你早就知道我会答应的。

- Fin - - 完结 -

AN: Not much to say; this was written over a scenario interaction someone very special proposed (pun very much intended) and it has a very special meaning for us both. I hope you guys like it half as much as she did.
其实没什么特别要说的；这段文字是在一个由特别的人提出的场景互动中创作的（双关语意不言而喻），对我们双方都意义非凡。希望你们也能感受到它的魅力，哪怕只有她的一半。

Mahal kita, baby. 我深爱着你，宝贝。

### Chapter 19 Themes: K#06 (The space between dream and reality), W#19 (Humility)
主题：K#06（梦想与现实间的空隙），W#19（谦卑）

Title: The Haunting 标题：《鬼魅缠身》

Disclaimer: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
免责声明：我在此声明以自保：Eva 及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

Disclaimer #2: The story was part of a series of prompted interactions, and ended with Rei's last words. Another person, ReShinji, decided to write a more traditional ending which we both conceptualized and then I reworked into this story, so I guess you could chalk this one up to a collaboration.
免责声明#2：本故事属于一系列提示互动中的一环，以 Rei 的最后话语收尾。另一位参与者 ReShinji 构思了一个更传统的结局，我们共同策划后，由我进一步润色成此故事，因此这可视为一次合作创作。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

"HELP! MISATO! SOMEONE!" 救命啊！美里！有没有人啊！

"Asuka, Rei! Shinji's Eva is bei-"
Asuka, Rei! Shinji 的 Eva 正在遭遇-

"I got him Misato! Rei, help me get this idiot out!"
我找到他了，Misato！Rei，快来帮我一起把这个蠢货弄出去！

The last thing Shinji remembered was Asuka's face trying to hold a relieved smile as she stared into the camera and Shinji attempted to tell her how sorry and grateful he was.
真嗣最后的记忆停留在明日香脸上那努力维持的宽慰笑容，她直视着镜头，而真嗣正试图向她表达自己的歉意和感激之情。

"Save it you moron, now you owe *ME* one. This should teach you some humility." Had been Asuka's answer, cutting him off before he even managed to get past the 'Thank you'. "Serves you right for being a showof-"
留着吧，你这蠢货，现在你欠我一次了。这该让你学会谦逊。" 飞鸟的回答截断了他的话，他连"谢谢"都没说完。"你这是自找的，爱出风头的家伙——

And it was then that the German teen's face had changed from a pleasant smile into a look that could only be described as terror, because it turned out the Angel had made a move on Asuka, and before anyone knew what was going on, the red unit had began to sink, half of its body already disappearing underneath the puddle of solid black that was the angel designated as Leliel.
就在那一刻，德国少女的笑容骤然转为惊恐，因为天使突然对明日香发起了攻击。众人还未及反应，红色机体便开始沉入那片漆黑如墨的水潭——那正是被标记为雷里尔的天使所化。

"Rei, Shinji! Fall back!" Misato's voice came over the comm, crisp and sharp, but Shinji refused to do that and instead he held onto Asuka's Eva as the redhead shouted for help and pleaded with him to not let go.
"零，真嗣！快撤！" 美里的声音通过通讯器传来，清晰而急促。然而，真嗣并未撤退，而是紧紧抓住明日香的 Eva，红发少女焦急地呼救，恳求他千万别放手。

"I won't let go! Rei, help me!"
我不会松手！丽，快来帮我！

"Rei." Misato's voice became overridden by Commander Ikari's own voice, but his was cold, dispassionate and smooth, like iced water chilling the back of Shinji's neck. "You've been ordered to retreat. Keeping Unit-01 safe takes priority."
绫波。" 美里的声音被碇司令的声音所取代，他的声音冷若冰霜，毫无情感，平滑得仿佛冰水滑过真嗣的后颈。"你已接到撤退命令。保护零号机的安全是最高优先级。

It was then that Rei's attempt to help turned into an attempt to free Unit-01, while Shinji shouted at both the blue-haired girl and his father... Misato, Dr. Akagi... anyone he could think off. He shouted and grunted and continued to try and help Asuka, and just like that one time with the angel of the sea, where for a few seconds Shinji and Asuka's synch merged, something happened that made Shinji feel as if part of Unit-02 was slowly being pushed into him, while the red Eva slowly kept being swallowed whole by the darkness.
就在那一刻，绫波原本的援助意图转变为试图解放零号机，与此同时，真嗣对着蓝发少女和自己的父亲，以及美里、赤木博士等任何他能想到的人大声呼喊。他不断呼喊和努力，试图帮助明日香。正如之前与海洋天使交战时，两人的同步率短暂融合那样，一种奇异的感觉涌上真嗣心头，仿佛二号机的一部分正逐渐融入他体内，而红色的 EVA 则缓缓被黑暗吞没。

And now, barely 8 hours had passed before Shinji had been pulled away from Nerv by Misato and sent to one of the many barrack rooms under orders to sleep and recover.
如今，仅仅过去不到 8 小时，真嗣便被美里从 NERV 带走，遵照命令安置在众多营房之一，强制他休息恢复。

But he couldn't. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Asuka's face, slowly contorting from a big, honest smile to a look of indecipherable terror before he had to relive the experience over and over and over.
然而他无能为力。每次闭眼，明日香的面容便浮现眼前，从灿烂真诚的笑容渐渐转为无法言喻的惊恐，他只能一次次地重温那段经历。

He felt sick, physically ill, and mentally spent and all he could think of was of Asuka.
他感到身体不适，精神疲惫不堪，脑海中全是明日香的身影。

"You better not be having perverted thoughts about me you idiot."
你最好别对我有什么龌龊念头，你个笨蛋。

"O-of course not! I'm worried ab-" Shinji stopped mid-sentence, turning around and looking at the room, wondering if he had just heard things.
"当然不是！我正担心着-" 真嗣话说到一半突然停下，转头环视四周，心中疑惑是否听岔了什么。

"Worried about me? You damn well should! It's thanks to you that I'm in this mess now!" Asuka's voice continued to float around his mind, making Shinji turn quickly from one side to the other.
"担心我吗？你确实该担心！都是因为你，我才落得这般田地！" 明日香的话语在他脑海中萦绕不去，让真嗣不由自主地左右摇摆。

"A-Asuka? Where are you?" Shinji said slowly, as he made his way to the door. It would just be like Asuka to make him worry about nothing, enjoying as he felt miserable before eventually showing up with that annoying smirk of hers. "Honestly, it's not funny! I was worried sick about you!"
明日香，你在哪儿？" 碇真嗣边说边向门口走去。明日香就爱这样，故意让他担心，看着他焦虑不安，最后才带着那副得意的笑容现身。"真是的，这不好笑！我都快担心死了！

Shinji opened the door, already seeing Asuka's smirking face.
真嗣推开门，一眼就看到了明日香那副得意的笑容。

Instead, he saw her glaring at him, arms crossed around her chest, but looking kind of... transparent.
相反，他看到她怒目而视，双臂环抱胸前，却显得有些...若隐若现。

"A-Asuka?" 飞鸟 A？

"What the hell are you doing? I was just about to walk through the door and scare the living crap about you!"Asuka said stomping her foot in a soundless attempt to convey how frustrated and angry she was. "I wanted to see you pee your pants!"
你这是在干什么？我正要进门吓你一大跳呢！" 明日香气愤地说，用力跺脚，虽无声响，却尽显其怒火与挫败。"我本想看你吓得尿裤子！

"Sorry! I... wh-what are y- how di-" Shinji shouted as he closed the door and pressed himself against it, only to have Asuka's face appear to his left, upper half of her body sticking out through the door and still glaring at him.
"抱歉！我... 这、这是怎么回事？你- 你怎么-" 真嗣大声说着，急忙关上门，背靠门板，却见明日香的脸庞突然出现在左侧，她上半身穿过门扉，依然怒目而视。

"Jeez! Would you stop stammering already?" Asuka countered as she easily slipped inside, seeming a bit more solid, and her voice sounded less echoing and more grounded, while she closed the space separating her and Shinji, before staring straight into his eyes. "Look I don't know how it happened but I know I'm here. I mean sure, I kind of freaked out a bit but then I figured I could actually do something about it."
哎呀！别再结巴了行不行？" 明日香一边说，一边轻松地走进来，感觉更真实了，声音也少了些回音，更加沉稳。她缩短了与真嗣的距离，直勾勾地盯着他的眼睛。"我不知道怎么回事，但我确实在这里。一开始我确实有点慌，不过后来我想明白了，我其实能为此做点什么。

Shinji didn't know exactly what to say or do... it felt like a dream... a really lousy dream that was slowly turning into a nightmare; he had never seen Asuka, or any girl, like this; and just what could he do? Was she dead?
真嗣茫然不知所措，仿佛置身于一场梦魇之中，逐渐恶化；他从未见过明日香，或是任何女孩，如此模样；他又能做些什么呢？她是否已经离世？

"Asuka... are you... d-dead?"
Asuka... 你... 是不是... 已经... 死了？

Asuka turned at him, a look of anger on her face.
明日香转过身来，脸上满是怒气。

"I better not be, you moron! If I end up dying because you were an idiot show off I'll..." She roared as she lifted her fist to hit Shinji while the boy tried to shield himself.
"我可不想这样，你这笨蛋！要是我真因为你的愚蠢炫耀而丧命，我绝不会放过你……" 她怒吼着，举拳向新二挥去，男孩则慌忙遮挡。

There was a pause when both children realized that as much as the redhead wanted to, she couldn't really extract her revenge in her current situation. Shinji was about to sigh out of relief until Asuka's face changed from an angry, thoughtful expression to a giddy, wide smile that made Shinji tremble.
两个孩子意识到，红发女孩虽心怀报复之意，却受限于现状无法行动，一时间陷入了沉默。真嗣刚要因安心而叹息，却见明日香的脸色由怒气冲冲转为满面笑容，那笑容灿烂得让真嗣不由得心生寒意。

"I'll make sure to haunt you for the rest of your life."
我保证，你的余生我都会如影随形。

"Wh-what? Why?" Shinji began until Asuka's face made him shut up and concede the point. "I... I mean, sure... I get why but uhm..."
什么？为什么？" 真嗣刚要发问，却被明日香的脸色打断，只好点头承认。"我...我是说，当然...我理解原因，只是呃...

Both children seemed to be at loss of words and he scratched his cheek nervously, looking at her; she was still dressed in her red plugsuit, and she was still glaring at him.
两个孩子似乎都哑口无言，他紧张地挠着脸颊，目光投向她；她依旧身着那件红色驾驶服，怒目而视。

How could this happen? 这事怎么可能发生呢？

"I don't know how this happened you moron! All I know is I risked my life to save you and because of that I ended up getting swallowed by that angel, but before my Unit-02 was swallowed completely it felt like she was..." Asuka paused, trying to find the exact words she was looking for before shrugging and letting out a sigh. "like Unit-02 was trying to push me into you for whatever reason."
我真不知道怎么会这样，你这个蠢货！我只记得我冒着生命危险去救你，结果反倒被那天使吞了。就在我的二号机快被完全吞没时，感觉它似乎……" 明日香顿了顿，努力寻找恰当的表达，最终只是耸肩叹息。"好像二号机在拼命把我推给你，尽管原因不明。

"Oh." Shinji said after a moment. It really didn't make sense.
"哦。" 片刻后，真嗣开口道。这实在说不通。

"I know it doesn't make sense you idiot!" the redhead grumbled as she sat cross-legged in Shinji's bed. For a spirit she seemed very lively. "I can still feel my body, which means I'm still alive, which is the only reason why you are not in the floor right now, convulsing and frothing at the mouth and losing your mind from the epic scare and freight I will inflict upon you if it turns out my body is dead!"
我知道这对你来说毫无意义，你这个蠢货！"红发女子嘟囔着，盘腿坐在真嗣的床上。作为幽灵，她却异常生动。"我还能感受到我的身体，说明我还活着，这也是你此刻没有躺在地上抽搐、口吐白沫、因我即将带来的巨大惊吓而精神崩溃的唯一原因，如果我的身体真的已经死去的话！

Shinji stared at her like she had grown a second head out of her neck.
真嗣惊讶地看着她，好像她脖子上突然冒出了第二个头。

"What!?" 什么！？

"I didn't say anything..." the boy pointed out matter-of-factly, narrowing his eyes at the girl as he leaned forward. "Can you he-hear my thoughts?"
我可什么都没说……" 男孩直截了当地指出，眯着眼盯着女孩，身体微微前倾。"你能听到我的心思吗？

"Yes, and it's a miracle your stupidity hasn't affected me so far." Asuka's flippant answer caught Shinji by surprise. "Focus Third! You need to come up with some way to make sure I come back safe!"
没错，你的愚蠢居然还没波及到我，真是奇迹。" 明日香轻率的回答让真嗣措手不及。"专心点，第三！你得设法保证我能安全回来！

"I... I'm pretty sure it'll be alright!" Shinji said a bit too quickly smiling to try and defuse the situation only for Asuka to give him a bored and disbelieving look. "E-everyone is worried and trying their best! Lieutenant Ibuki and Misato both told me they were gonna try and get you out in one piece and then Doctor Akagi said Misato was more worried about having to explain to your dad how Unit-02 and it's pilot were lost and Misato told her to shut up a-and..."
我...我确信一切都会没事的！" 真嗣急忙说道，试图用微笑缓和紧张的气氛，但明日香只是回以一个无聊且怀疑的眼神。"大家都很担心，都在尽力！伊吹中尉和美里都向我保证，他们会尽力确保你安全无恙，然后赤木博士提到美里更担心如何向你父亲解释二号机及其驾驶员的失踪，美里让她别说了，然后...

"Idiot, just shut up!" Asuka said, pinching the bridge of her nose. "All this rambling is making my head hur-"
傻瓜，别说了！" 明日香皱着眉，捏了捏鼻梁。"你这一通胡扯，我都头疼了-

Her words faded away, the way songs do when they end and Asuka slowly became almost invisible for a few seconds before slowly fading back into Shinji's vision, like a picture focusing and getting sharper, more defined.
她的话语逐渐消逝，就像歌曲结束时的余音，明日香也随之缓缓隐去，几乎消失了几秒，随后又慢慢在真嗣的视野中重新显现，仿佛一幅画面逐渐清晰，轮廓愈发分明。

"Wh-what just happened?" 刚刚发生了什么？

"Huh? What do you mean idiot?" Asuka's voice sounded tired and spent.
"什么？你这话什么意思，傻瓜？" 明日香的声音显得疲惫而无力。

"You left for a couple of seconds." Shinji's voice seemed to tingle slightly, as if he was forcing himself to remain calm and not freak out.
"你刚离开了一会儿。" 真嗣的声音略带颤抖，他似乎在努力保持镇定，以免自己失控。

"I uh..." She paused to digest this. "I... I me-mean..."
我...呃..." 她顿了顿，试图理解这一切。"我...我是说...

Shinji stared at her worriedly as the redhead faltered before she shot the boy a glare. "It's none of your business! When I come back remind me to kick your bony, scrawny ass all the way to next week for this! Dammit! This is the last time I try to help you, useless baka Shinji!"
真嗣忧心忡忡地望着她，红发女孩步履蹒跚，随即对男孩怒目而视。"少管闲事！等我回来，记得提醒我，非得把你那瘦弱的屁股踢到下周不可！真是的！这是我最后一次帮你，没用的蠢货真嗣！"

"He-hey, I tried to help but Rei... father... he..." Shinji trailed looking down and feeling the worst sort of impotence.
"嘿嘿，我本想帮忙，可零...父亲...他..." 真嗣说着，垂下目光，深感一种难以言喻的无力。

"Don't make me laugh! If you had really wanted to help me out you'd have done everything like I did! Like you did last time!"
别逗我了！真想帮忙的话，你早该像我一样全力以赴了，就像你上次做的那样！

Shinji closed his eyes, remembering that time in the volcano, how Asuka's voice had sounded like it was fading away, how something had made him move, like a push, a shove out of nowhere and suddenly he was plunging into the lava, grabbing one of the cables and ignoring the pain and the heat and diving down towards her, towards Unit-02.
真嗣闭上双眼，回想起火山中的情景，明日香的声音似乎在逐渐远去，一股莫名的力量驱使他行动，仿佛无形的推力，他猛地跳入熔岩，抓住一根电缆，忍受着剧痛与炙热，奋力向她，向二号机潜去。

Shinji had been so lost in thought he had forgotten all about Asuka and how she was still in the middle of another one of her angry rants.
真嗣沉浸在思绪中，竟忘了明日香还在一旁怒气冲冲地发着牢骚。

"... and besides, I-it's not like I did it it because I wanted to! I just figured that since you're 'precious little Shinji' I would en up getting like, court martialed or something if I didn't at least try to save you." Asuka scowled, trying not to feel sorry for herself. "Everyone would be all 'oh, poor little Shinji-kun, he's in there... we need to save him!"
... 再说，我这么做并非出于本意！只是考虑到你是'宝贝小真嗣'，我若不尝试救你，恐怕会面临军事法庭的审判。" 明日香皱眉，努力不让自己感到自怜。"大家都会说'哦，可怜的小真嗣，他在那儿... 我们得救他！

The last part made Shinji look up at her, feeling the familiar pangs of guilt, regret and understanding at the same time.
最后那部分让真嗣不由得抬头望向她，心中同时涌起熟悉的愧疚、悔恨与领悟。

"Yeah... I... I guess that's why I try to always do stuff for others... if I'm needed then people would want me around, right?"
嗯...我...我想这就是我总想为他人做事的原因吧...如果我被需要，人们自然会希望我在他们身边，不是吗？

Asuka rolled her eyes at Shinji's obvious 'people only like me cause I'm needed, woe is me' routine. "Figures only someone as dumb as you would think something like that... if anything your dad would use all of Nerv's resources to save you or the doll. He doesn't give a crap about me."
明日香对真嗣那明显的“人们喜欢我只是因为我被需要，我真可怜”的把戏不屑一顾。“也只有你这种笨蛋才会这么想……说真的，你爸会不惜动用 NERV 的一切资源来救你或那具人偶。他根本不在乎我。”

"... if he did, it wouldn't be for me... maybe for Rei." Shinji said after a moment of silence
"...如果他真的做了，那也不会是为了我...或许是为了绫波。" 碇真嗣沉默片刻后说道。

"Are you saying because of Eva?" Asuka's voice was strangely quiet.
"你是因为 Eva 才这么说的吗？" 明日香的声音异常平静。

"I... my dad called me after all those years because he wanted me to pilot... Misato keeps me around but I'm sure that if I didn't pilot, she wouldn't care so much... and my friends..."
多年后，我父亲突然来电，竟是为了让我驾驶...美里虽然让我留在身边，但若非我驾驶，她恐怕不会如此关切...至于我的朋友们...

Asuka looked at Shinji with an indecipherable look, like she was trying to see if he was being a smart ass or honest before she settled on her usual look that Shinji had come to realize simply meant he was a lucky idiot, as per usual.
明日香凝视着真嗣，眼神复杂难明，似乎在揣测他是故作聪明还是真心表达。最终，她恢复了平日的神态，真嗣已能领会，这往往意味着他依旧是那个幸运的傻瓜，一如既往。

Shinji sighed. Kensuke is my friend only because of Eva... and Toji hates me because of it.
真嗣叹息着。健介之所以是我的朋友，全因 Eva...而东治却因此对我怀有敌意。

"Well duh! Of course the four-eyed dork would want to be your buddy if you are an Eva pilot! Heck, I'm sure that if you ask him to, he'll carry your books and do your chores if you promise him a chance to see the Evas up close!" Asuka said with a bored look in her face. "And the two legged brute hates you because you hurt his little sister... talk about a pervert who has a little sister-loli complex."
哎呀，这不是明摆着嘛！如果你是 Eva 驾驶员，那个戴眼镜的书呆子肯定巴不得和你交朋友！我敢打赌，只要你开口，他肯定乐意帮你拿书、做杂事，只要你答应让他近距离看看 Eva 就行！" 明日香一脸不耐烦地说。"至于那个四肢发达的家伙讨厌你，是因为你伤害了他的小妹妹……真是变态，还有点小妹妹萝莉情结。

"Toji doesn't... look would you stop doing that?"
东寺，你能不能别再那样了？

"Doing what?" The redhead blinked quickly, but the smile curving her lkiops made it obvious she was we'll aware what 'that' was.
"做什么呢？"红发女孩眨眼间流露出俏皮，她嘴角那抹微笑显然透露出她对“那个”心知肚明。

"That! Reading my thoughts!" Shinji said as he made vague gestures to the space between their heads. "It's freaking me out!"
你竟然能读取我的思想！" 真嗣说着，向两人头部之间的空隙比划着模糊的手势，"真是让我不寒而栗！

"I can't help it! When I hear your stupid thoughts I have to answer them! Besides, it's your stupid fault for having these stupid thoughts and you deserve it anyway!" The redhead said, pointing at Shinji in an overly grandiose flair that seemed lost the moment she ended her statement by sticking out her tounge at Shinji.
"我实在忍不住！一听到你那些愚蠢的想法，我就忍不住要回应！而且，你产生这些愚蠢的想法也是自找的，你本来就该受着！"红发女孩说着，用一种夸张的手势指向真嗣，但当她结束话语并朝真嗣吐舌头时，这种夸张似乎瞬间失去了意义。

"Until I'm somehow brought back I'm gonna stay with you, reading your thoughts and making you realize how much of a loser, perverted freak you really are!"
在我以某种方式回归之前，我会一直陪伴你，窥探你的思绪，让你认清自己是个多么失败、变态的怪物！

"Ye-yeah, well I uh... " Shinji closed his eyes and focused on something to make Asuka shut up. "I-if you don't leave me alone I'm gonna do this!"
嗯，那个，我... " 碇真嗣闭上眼，努力想找个办法让明日香安静下来。"你要是再不让我静一静，我可真要这么做了！

Before he finally thought of the worst, vile thing he could think of and forced it into his mind.
在他最终想到最恶劣、最不堪的事情，并强迫自己接受这一念头之前。

Asuka blinked and then narrowed her eyes, squinting hard at Shinji. "Is that... you playing the cello?"
明日香眨了眨眼，随后眯起双眼，紧盯着真嗣。"那是...你在拉大提琴吗？"

"No, th-tha's me... playing the cello badly... o-on purpose!" Shinji said in a strained tone, obviously taxed by the concept of thinking about something evil and Asuka managed to close her mouth and hide her amused smile before Shinji could open his eyes.
"不，那是我……故意把大提琴拉得一团糟……故意的！" 真嗣用一种紧绷的语气说道，显然是被思考邪恶事物的念头所困扰，而明日香则及时闭上嘴巴，藏起了她那得意的笑容，没让真嗣看到。

"Please... don't make me laugh! That's the least evil plot I have ever seen!" She said in a sing-song voice while sitting next to Shinji, just to enjoy watching the little twerp's scared face even if she couldn't physically touch him. "Here, let me show you how it's done."
拜托...别逗我笑了！这可是我见过的最无害的阴谋了！" 她坐在真嗣身边，用一种唱歌似的语气说着，纯粹是为了欣赏这个小家伙惊恐的表情，尽管她无法真正触碰到他。"看好了，我来教你怎么做。

With that, Asuka leaned closer to Shinji, making the boy shudder reflexively, and even if she was some kind of ghostly apparition, Shinji couldn't help but feel Asuka's breath lightly tickling his cheek.
就这样，明日香贴近真嗣，令他本能地一颤。即便她如同幽灵般虚幻，真嗣仍能感受到她轻柔的气息拂过脸颊。

"I'm gonna spend every waking hour of every single day you have for the rest of your natural life stalking you, feeding of your thoughts, your fears, every little thing that makes you tick." Asuka began as she got on all fours and crawled slowly towards Shinji who had been inching himself back slowly the whole time until his back was against the wall.
"我将在你余生的每一个清醒时刻，无时无刻不跟踪你，汲取你的思绪，你的恐惧，以及所有让你心动的点点滴滴。" 明日香说着，四肢着地，缓缓向真嗣爬去，而真嗣一直在慢慢后退，直到他的背紧贴着墙壁。

But Asuka kept advancing, her voice lowering to a rumbling whisper.
然而，明日香依旧步步紧逼，声音低沉得如同耳语。

"I'm gonna find what you fear and I'm gonna make you relive it every moment of every day, I'll find what your nightmares are and I'll make sure every time you close your eyes you dream of nothing but them. I'll get to intimately know all of what you fear and then shove it in your face every single moment of every single day until all you can do is lie awake for fear of sleeping, lying silently in bed trying to make me think you are dead just so I can leave you alone."
我会挖掘出你内心深处的恐惧，让你日复一日地重温那些恐怖时刻。你的噩梦将成为我掌控的领域，每次你闭眼，它们将是你唯一的梦境。我将深入了解你的一切恐惧，然后无时无刻不将其呈现在你眼前，直到你因害怕入睡而彻夜难眠，静静躺在床上，只求我以为你已无生命，从而放过你。

Shinji gulped as Asuka's face came only inches apart of his own, her teeth-bearing smile seeming almost feral.
真嗣紧张地咽了咽口水，明日香的脸庞近在咫尺，她那露齿的笑容透着一股野性。

Rei Ayanami's hand stopped inches from the door leading to Shinji's barrack. She had been about to knock on the door to inform him that a salvage and retrieval operation for Unit-02 would be attempted when she heard the familiar sound of Shinji's whimpering scream, subdued... as if he was using his pillow to quiet himself down.
绫波丽的手悬在通往真嗣宿舍的门前，本打算敲门告诉他将尝试对二号机进行打捞和回收，却听见了真嗣熟悉的压抑哭声，似乎是用枕头捂着以降低声音。

She blinked before letting out a small sigh.
她眨了眨眼，随后发出一声轻叹。

"It has been close to 16 hours, the Eva self-sustained battery is just about to run dead. Perhaps it would be best to... let Ikari come to terms with this before informing him of the operation."
已经过去将近 16 小时，Eva 的自主电池快要耗尽了。或许应该先让碇司令适应这一情况，再向他透露行动细节。

Turning around and walking away, Rei realized that Shinji Ikari was probably suffering a nightmare, haunted by the memories of the one he had let go of.
转身离开之际，绫波丽察觉到碇真嗣或许正深陷噩梦，被他曾放手的记忆所纠缠。

"Ok, even you have to admit that was a damn good scare." Asuka sounded almost giddy as she plopped on the bed next to Shinji while he kept breathing deep and hard into his pillow, giving her an angry, miserable look.
"好吧，连你都得承认，那真是吓得不轻。" 明日香几乎带着兴奋的语气，一屁股坐在真嗣旁边的床上，而真嗣则继续将头埋在枕头里，深重地喘息着，向她投去愤怒而痛苦的目光。

"F-for someone who's scared of dying, you're having too much fun scaring me."
既然你这么怕死，怎么还这么起劲地吓唬我呢？

"Who said I was scared!?" Asuka screeched angrily, making Shinji jump back.
"谁说我害怕了！？" 明日香怒气冲冲地尖叫，吓得真嗣往后一跳。

"Y-you aren't?" 你不是吗？

"Of course not! In fact, I'm ok with dying so long as I make sure you see my face and hear my voice asking for your help every time you close your eyes." Asuka delivered in a low, ominous growl, the last part punctuated by Asuka trying to punch Shinji's shoulder, only to have it pass right through it, and Shinji noticed it felt like a gust of wind from out of nowhere.
"当然不是！事实上，我宁愿死去，也要确保你每次闭眼都能看到我的面容，听到我求助的声音。" 明日香低沉而阴森地说着，最后一句时她试图击打真嗣的肩膀，却只是穿透而过，真嗣只感到一阵莫名风起。

And then one of the sensors in Asuka's wrist began to blink silently, the message displayed across reading 'Batt: 2.2%'.
接着，明日香手腕上的一个传感器悄然闪烁起来，屏幕上显示着'电量：2.2%'。

Asuka and Shinji stayed like that, staring at her hand, still balled into a fist before the redhead's shoulders slumped down slowly, almost in slow motion and her whole frame began to rock and shake ever so slightly.
明日香和真嗣依旧那样站着，目光紧锁在她紧握的拳头上，直到红发女孩的肩膀渐渐低垂，动作缓慢得仿佛慢放一般，她的全身开始微微摇摆和颤动。

Shinji could see Asuka holding her hands together, muttering something so quietly it sounded no different from her low, jagged breaths. He was still staring at the space where her hand had been when he heard a small choked sob coming from the German girl and when he tried to tentatively reach towards her, he heard her small voice.
真嗣目睹明日香双手紧握，低语着什么，声音微弱到几乎与她那不平稳的呼吸声融为一体。他仍凝视着她手曾停留之处，忽闻德国女孩传来一声哽咽。当他小心翼翼地伸手欲触时，耳边响起了她细弱的声音。

"I... I don't want to die... I'm too young to... I ha-haven't done a lot of stuff yet... I... I want to eat those yummy cakes Hikari and I saw the other day at the shopping district. I want to go out on another date with Kaji! I... I've never been kissed!"
我...我不想死...我还太年轻...好多事还没体验过...我...我想吃那天和光在购物区看到的那些诱人的蛋糕。我还想和 Kaji 再约会一次！我...我还没体验过接吻呢！

Shinji was about to mention the kiss they had shared but he realized it hadn't been a real kiss; it had been a sloppy, messy attempt at trying to be grown-ups that had ended with Asuka rinsing her mouth and Shinji almost choking to death.
真嗣本想提起他们之间的那个吻，但随即意识到那根本算不上真正的吻；那是一次笨拙而混乱的尝试，想要装作成熟，最终却是明日香漱口，而他自己差点窒息。

"Oh pe-please... it wasn't that bad. The part that sucked was you not holding me." Asuka said between her choked, broken sobs, making Shinji look up at her in surprise.
"哦，求你了...真的没那么糟。最让我难受的是你当时没有抱住我。" 明日香哽咽着，断断续续地说出这番话，让真嗣惊讶地抬头望向她。

You.. you mean you actually liked it? Shiji thought, watching as the redhead blushed and stammered, attempting to look away before he heard the quick rush of her voice, as if she were trying to sweep everything under a rug at the sight of prying eyes.
你...你是真的喜欢吗？十吉思索着，目睹红发女孩脸颊泛红，语无伦次地试图避开视线，随后听到她急促的声音，似乎想在旁人窥探的目光下将一切遮掩。

"I wo-wouldn't say it was earth-shattering but as far as kisses go it wasn't..." Asuka trailed before realizing what she was saying and to whom. "I... I mean y-you need more experience of course! Y-you kiss like a little boy."
我不会说那是个震撼人心的吻，但就接吻来说，它其实……" 明日香话到一半，突然意识到自己的失言和对象，急忙改口。"我……我是说，你肯定得多练练！你的吻技还像个小孩似的。

Are you telling me the truth?
你在告诉我实话吗？

"O-of course I am! I-it's not like I'm trying to save face!" Asuka shouted, her face now sporting a bright, almost luminescent, blush, almost color coordinated with her hair.
"当然是我！我又不是为了保全面子才这么说的！" 明日香喊道，她的脸颊泛着鲜艳的红晕，几乎与她的发色相映成趣。

Shinji couldn't help but smile a little smile.
真嗣情不自禁地露出了淡淡的微笑。

"A-and stop asking me all these stupid questions!" Asuka fist flew quickly, trying to punch Shinji once more without any effect except for her hand sailing through his face.
"A-别再问我这些蠢问题了！" Asuka 的拳头迅速挥出，试图再次击打 Shinji，然而除了她的手穿过了他的脸庞外，并未产生任何效果。

"Why?" 为什么呢？

"Because for whatever stupid reason, when you think of a question I can only answer with the truth!"
无论出于什么荒谬的原因，每当你提出问题，我只能如实回答！

As soon as those words had been shouted out, the redhead clasped her hands over her mouth, eyes wide open and cheeks blazing red while Shinji simply stood there, trying to process what he had just heard while Asuka tried her best to remain motionless.
话音刚落，红发少女便双手捂嘴，双眼圆睁，面颊绯红，而真嗣则愣在原地，努力消化所闻，明日香则竭力保持静止。

"You... I uh..." 你... 我，呃...

"Ugh! Just get it over it you stupid idiot! Ask me as many mental truth or dares you want to humiliate me more, but know this: I'm gonna make sure to remember all of it and the moment I'm dead..." Asuka's voice was a low growl as she once again closed the gap, staring once more at Shinji, light blue eyes on dark stormy ones, noses inches away and Shinji could still remember how her breath felt that time when she ki-
"唉！快点结束吧，你这笨蛋！想用多少心理上的真心话大冒险来羞辱我尽管来，但要记住：我会牢牢记住这一切，直到我死去的那一刻……" 明日香的声音低沉而充满怒意，她再次逼近，凝视着真嗣，浅蓝色的眼眸与深邃的暴风雨般的眼睛对峙，鼻尖相距咫尺，真嗣仍能清晰记得那时她的呼吸，当她……

"S-stop thinking about that!" Asuka shouted, more embarrassed and flustered than angry, arms hanging firmly at her sides and leaning forward just a bit as her hair framed her face, her hair adding a layer of color that combined with her cheeks.
"别想那事儿了！" Asuka 喊道，与其说是生气，不如说是尴尬和慌乱，她的双臂紧贴身体两侧，微微前倾，头发勾勒出脸庞，发色与泛红的脸颊相映成趣。

"I can't!" Shinji shouted, mirroring Asuka's stance. "E-everytime we're close by or I see your eyes or I smell you or we bump into each other or touch I can only think of that kiss!" Shinji blurted out without really knowing why.
"我做不到！" 真嗣喊着，模仿着明日香的站姿。"每次我们一靠近，或者我看到你的眼睛，闻到你的气味，甚至不小心碰到，我脑海里就全是那个吻！" 真嗣不假思索地吐露了心声。

It was Asuka time to stay there, mouth hanging open and staring at Shinji who was looking the other way, blushing and doing his best to not look at her, both teens staying like that until finally, Asuka coughed, clearing her throat and giving Shinji her best attempt at a winning, arrogant smirk.
轮到明日香留在那里，嘴巴微张，目光紧锁着故意不看她的真嗣，后者脸颊泛红，努力避开她的视线。两人就这样僵持着，直到明日香轻咳一声，清了清喉咙，向真嗣投去一个自认为既得意又傲慢的微笑。

"H-hah! I knew you thought about it more than I do! J-just goes to show that I am a damn good kisser a-and you really need to get better at i-"
哈哈！我就知道你考虑得比我多！这足以证明我接吻技术确实高超，你真得在这方面好好提升一下——

Shinji's look told Asuka he wasn't falling for that. Instead, he cleared his throat and his thoughts.
真嗣的眼神让明日香明白，他并未中计。他只是清了清喉咙，理顺了自己的思绪。

Why do you do that? You're hot one second and cold the next... it's hard to deal with.
你怎么这样呢？一会儿热情似火，一会儿又冷若冰霜...让人难以捉摸。

"I... I j-just..." Asuka stopped in mid sentence, forced by Shinji's question to answer truthfully once more. "I... I'm not... the kind of girl who will let anyone close... because the few who I have... they've..."
我...我刚才..." 明日香话说到一半就停住了，真嗣的问题迫使她不得不再次坦白。"我...我不是那种会让任何人接近的女孩...因为那些我曾信任的人...他们已经...

Shinji leaned forward, straining to hear her as Asuka's voice had now become a mere whisper.
真嗣倾身向前，竭力捕捉明日香的声音，她的声音此刻已细若游丝。

Only to have the redhead shout the last part in his face.
仅仅是为了让那个红发人冲着他脸大喊最后那部分。

"I'd rather not let people know how I feel about them because in the end they leave me or screw it up anyway! Now stop asking those stupid nosy questions and just go back to being scared, idiot!"
我宁愿不让人知道我对他们的感情，反正最后他们总会离我而去或搞砸一切！别再问那些无聊的窥探问题了，回去继续害怕吧，笨蛋！

And this was where Shinji decided to, at least, take a stand.
正是在此，真嗣决心至少要表明自己的立场。

"N-no." 不，不行。

Asuka looked up at Shinji with red, puffy eyes trying to understand what he had meant by that.
明日香抬起头，用红肿的双眼望着真嗣，试图弄明白他那句话的含义。

"I... I'm not gonna do that... you... you tried to help me and now I'll..." Shinji stopped. What can I offer you, what can I tempt you with to make you come back?
"我...我做不到...你...你曾伸出援手，现在我该如何..." 真嗣顿住了。我该拿什么回报你，用什么才能让你回心转意呢？

"There's nothing you can offer that will make me come back, you moron... this isn't a bad romantic movie where just by wishing to save someone, you get to save them." Asuka said, trying to sound angry, trying to sound hurt, but the biting edge to her words was gone, and instead, it sounded more like the redhead was tired of pretending, tired of playing make believe.
"你再怎么努力也无法让我回头，你这个蠢货...这可不是那种烂俗爱情片，光靠愿望就能拯救谁。" 明日香说道，她试图表现出愤怒和受伤，但言语中的锋芒已不复存在，取而代之的是一种疲惫，仿佛她已经厌倦了伪装，厌倦了扮演角色。

She was slowly beginning to fade away.
她正逐渐淡出视线。

"I... I can feel Unit-02's battery is about to end. I guess this is it."
我...我感觉到二号机的电池即将耗尽。看来这就是终点了。

There was a lot of sadness in her voice, almost like it had become something so unbearable and heavy for the redhead to carry.
她的声音里满是悲伤，仿佛化作了红发女孩难以承受的沉重负担。

So Shinji decided to do like in the volcano, to let go of his body, to let it move forth, to let it act without thinking.
于是，真嗣决定效仿在火山中的做法，任由身体自由行动，不加思索地让它前进。

Asuka blinked when she felt something against her and, opening her half-lidded eyes as if she were dreaming. The entryplug was dark save for the red-tinted light and the on-board instruments blinking in a slow, dying rhythm.
当明日香感觉到有什么东西触碰到自己时，她眨了眨眼，半睁着朦胧的双眼，仿佛置身梦境。插入栓内昏暗无光，唯有红色微光和仪表板上缓慢闪烁、即将熄灭的指示灯。

But she could feel Shinji was holding her hand in his, fingers interlacing.
她能感受到真嗣紧握着她的手，手指相互交织。

I'm sorry I got you into this, Asuka.
抱歉，是我把你牵扯进来的，明日香。

He wasn't here, but his voice was low, his tone was steady.
他虽不在场，声音却低沉，语气平稳。

But I promise you somehow I'll get you back.
但我向你保证，无论如何我都会让你回到我身边。

Shinji's face felt closer, and his breath was warm against her face, and the darkness felt heavier, more defined, as if it were taking his shape and form.
真嗣的脸庞近在咫尺，他的呼吸温暖地拂过她的面颊，四周的黑暗愈发浓重、分明，仿佛正逐渐勾勒出他的轮廓。

"And when I see you again, I'll make sure to kiss you, and hold you."
再次相见时，我定会吻你，紧紧拥抱你。

And now his lips were crushing her own, and Asuka only had enough energy to open her eyes wide at the shock, before feeling her whole body being invaded by a sense of lethargy, as if someone had given her a sedative.
此刻，他的双唇正紧紧地压在她的唇上，明日香惊愕地瞪大了双眼，紧接着便感到一股深深的疲惫感席卷全身，仿佛被注射了镇静剂一般。

"You... Shinji, you idiot." Were the last words Shinji heard her say. Her smiling face was the last thing Shinji saw before she dissolved into nothingness, fading away like a dream would as morning came.
"你... 真嗣，你这个傻瓜。" 这是真嗣听到她说的最后话语。她那微笑的面庞，是真嗣在她如晨梦般消散前所见的最后一幕。

And Shinji opened his eyes with a start, realizing he was in his bed and someone was knocking on his door. He looked around, trying to gather his bearings as the door opened To show Rei Ayanami standing impassively in front of him.
真嗣突然惊醒，发现自己在床上，门外传来敲门声。他四下张望，努力找回方向感，这时门被打开，绫波丽面无表情地出现在他眼前。

"We are about to commence the salvage operation. The battery of Unit-02 is about to end."
我们即将启动打捞作业，二号机组的电池即将耗尽。

Shinji sat in the cockpit, resisting the urge to rub his eyes, feeling his tears fall, ignoring the way they floated and dissolved into the LCL.
真嗣坐在驾驶舱里，克制着不去揉眼睛，任由泪水流淌，不去理会它们在 LCL 中漂浮并逐渐消散。

Asuka…I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can….I'm sorry. I wish I could do more. I wish I could have told you the truth last time you were here.
明日香…我不确定你是否能听到，若你能听见，我深感歉意。真希望那时能为你做得更多，上次你来时，我本应坦白真相。

He had been briefed on the situation, only to learn that there was no way to free Asuka from the 12th Angel. In fact, his father had decided that Eva-02 was an expendable loss.
他已获悉情况，得知无法从第 12 使徒手中救出明日香。实际上，他的父亲已决定，二号机作为牺牲品也在所不惜。

I don't know if I can really say I love you. I've never felt it for anyone. But I really did like you.
我无法确定自己是否真的能说爱你，因为我从未对任何人产生过这样的情感。但我确实非常喜欢你。

Instead they were going to dump several hundred N2 mines inside the Angel and hope for the best.
相反，他们计划在天使内部布设数百枚 N2 地雷，期待能有好结果。

Misato had tried to argue the point but Gendo had simply stared her down before confirming the order once more, with the logic that even if they could free Asuka from the 12th Angel, the shadow would still just move into NERV and doom them all. Shinji had wanted to say something, but he knew it was pointless. His father would never listen to him anyway.
弥薩托曾试图就此争辩，然而源堂仅以冷峻的目光让她无言以对，随后再次重申命令，其逻辑是即便他们能从第 12 使徒手中解救明日香，那阴影仍将转移到 NERV，最终导致所有人灭亡。真嗣本欲开口，却深知此举无益，他的父亲向来不会听取他的意见。

"You'd probably call me stupid or an idiot for saying that. What was it you said…oh yeah: 'This isn't a bad romantic movie where just by wishing to save someone, you get to save them.' But I'm going to say it anyway. I probably won't get another chance."
你或许会认为我愚蠢至极，竟敢说出这样的话。你之前不是提过吗…对了：'这可不是那种烂俗爱情片，单凭一厢情愿就能救人。'尽管如此，我还是要说。恐怕再无机会了。

So units 00 and 01 had been stationed at either end of the Angel, who had been maneuvered into one of the deserted industrial districts which housed several buildings that had been reconditioned to house weapons caches and umbilical cords, with the orders of containing both the angel and the explosions with their AT Fields.
因此，单位 00 和 01 分别驻守在天使的两端，该天使被引导至一处荒废的工业地带，此处数栋建筑已改建为武器库和脐带设施。他们的任务是运用 AT 力场，同时限制住天使及其引发的爆炸。

The bomber jets were flying over them one last time, slowly circling to be in position before delivering their payload. Shinji blinked away the tears once more.
轰炸机最后一次在他们头顶盘旋，缓慢调整位置，准备投下炸弹。真嗣又一次眨眼，试图忍住泪水。

"I love you, Asuka." Shinji swallowed thickly. "Please, come back…"
我爱你，明日香。" 碇真嗣哽咽着说。"求你回来吧…

And then the shadow cracked open.
接着，那影子裂开了。

The Angel's massive shadow-body on the ground began to convulse wildly while the ground shook as a fissure raced from one of its edge to the other. It was as if the shadow had suddenly gained a zigzag line of teeth and was desperately trying to keep its mouth shut as lumps and hills erupted out of the Angel's madly contorting body.
天使庞大的阴影身躯在地面上猛烈抽搐，地面为之震颤，一条裂缝从其边缘迅速贯穿至另一侧。宛如那阴影瞬间生出了锯齿般的裂口，正竭力紧闭，而天使扭曲不已的身躯上，土丘和隆起接连涌现。

In the air, the portion of the Angel that actually was its shadow shuddered violently and turned jet black and a hand erupted out of the 12th Angel, spattered with gory clumps of matter as blood leaked out of the sphere in thick columns.
空中，天使的影子部分猛烈颤动，转瞬漆黑，一只手从第 12 号天使体内破出，沾满血肉模糊的物质，血液如柱般从球体中涌流而出。

The hand was joined by another and both began to slowly open the Angel's spherical body, blood and flesh falling heavily down upon the dissolving shadow on the ground.
一只手与另一只手相汇，共同缓缓撑开天使的球状身躯，血肉如雨般沉重地落在地面那消散的阴影上。

Eva-02's head looked up from within the angel, and even if there was no mouth on the red behemoth, everyone could clearly hear the machine howling in triumph as it freed itself from the Angel.
伊娃-02 的头颅自天使体内昂起，即便那红色巨兽并无口舌，众人仍能清晰听见机器在胜利的嘶吼中挣脱了天使的束缚。

With one last shove it opened up the sphere enough to climb out of the rapidly dissolving orb, landing on the ground, shattering the shadow into a thousand bloody pieces of obsidian before the fragments broke like glass upon contact with the ground as it rained blood everywhere.
它用尽最后一丝力气，撑开了正在迅速溶解的球体，从中爬出，落在地上。随即，阴影被击碎成无数血红色的黑曜石碎片，这些碎片一触地便如玻璃般碎裂，血雨随之四散飞溅。

The Eva finally relaxed and stood to attention as the remains of the 12th Angel rained down around the city.
伊娃最终放松下来，肃立着，第 12 使徒的遗骸如雨点般纷纷落在城市四周。

Even before Misato had finished ordering everyone to stand their ground and for Both units 00 and 01 to go and assist, Shinji was already running towards her, jumping over fences and buildings and tanker trucks, his feet pumping as fast and hard as he could while the purple Eva made it's way to where it's red counterpart stood.
在 Misato 尚未下达命令，要求全员坚守并派遣 00 和 01 两台机体前去支援时，Shinji 已飞奔向她，跃过围栏、楼宇与油罐车，竭尽全力地疾驰，而那台紫色的 Eva 正向着红色 Eva 所在之处逼近。

Asuka opened her eyes, coughing up some LCL as she heard a quiet voice dimly calling her name. The redhead blinked and the world refocused around her and Shinji's face swam into view.
明日香睁开双眼，咳出些许 LCL，耳边传来微弱的声音，似乎在呼唤她的名字。她眨了眨眼，视线逐渐清晰，真嗣的面容随之映入眼帘。

He was crying. 他在哭。

Of course he's crying... that... idiot. Asuka smiled as tears ran freely and shamelessly down his face and she reached up and cupped his face, realizing that yes, she was solid, and yes, she was alive.
他当然在哭...那个...傻瓜。明日香微笑着，泪水毫无顾忌地顺着他的脸颊流淌，她伸手轻抚他的脸庞，意识到自己确实有实体，确实还活着。

Shinji caught her hand and held it in his own.
真嗣抓住她的手，紧紧握在自己的手中。

"-re alright?" 你还好吗？

His voice was diaphanous, and Asuka gave him a weak smile. It felt like she was still sleeping... like everything was fake but also real; a moment in time and space between dreams and reality.
他的声音轻柔得仿佛透明，明日香对他报以一个虚弱的微笑。她感觉自己仿佛仍在梦中……一切既虚幻又真实；那是介于梦境与现实之间，时空交错的一瞬。

"Of course I am." Her voice was hoarse, and her throat ached, but she still was able to smile at him. "What are you, stupid?"
我当然是。"她的嗓音沙哑，喉咙隐隐作痛，却依旧对他展露笑容。"你是不是傻？

Shinji smiled at her even if it was becoming harder for him to not blink away the tears. "I thought you were dead."
尽管泪水让真嗣越来越难以抑制，他还是向她露出了微笑。"我还以为你不在了。"

"Yeah... me too..." 嗯... 我也是...

"Asuka, I…I lo-" She just put a finger to his lips.
"Asuka，我…我喜-" 她轻轻将手指放在他的唇上，示意他不要说下去。

"I know." 我明白。

Rei's smile was going before anyone could see it, and she stood impassively a few feet away, almost as if she were guarding the place while behind her Misato was running towards both children as the sun began to rise over the horizon.
绫的微笑在无人察觉之际便已消逝，她静立于数尺之外，神情淡漠，仿佛在守卫着这片空间。与此同时，美里正急速奔向那两个孩子，而太阳正缓缓从地平线上升起。

### Chapter 20 Themes: K#04 (Our distance and that person), W#29 (See the world my way)
主题：K#04（我们与那个人的距离），W#29（用我的视角看世界）

Title: Airplanes in the sky
标题：空中飞翔的飞机

Disclaimer: I shall use this space to cover my own ass: Not mine. I do not own Eva, or anything in this story.
免责声明：我在此声明以自保：Eva 及本故事中的所有内容均非我所拥有。

This little joke started as an attempt of mine in trying to get out of writer's block, so I (stupidly) said to myself "Myself, let's take this endeavor of 2 challenges at once: 30 kisses and 30 ways in one story."
这个笑话源于我试图打破写作瓶颈的一次尝试，我（有些愚蠢地）对自己说：“来吧，让我们同时迎接两个挑战：在同一个故事中融入 30 个吻和 30 种情境。”

It all snowballed from there.
事情就是从那时起像滚雪球一样越滚越大。

Disclaimer #2: I most definitely don't own in any way, shape or form the Disney "Paperman" short either.
免责声明#2：我绝对不以任何形式、方式或形态拥有迪士尼短片《纸人》的任何权利。

During instrumentality an infinite number of worlds were created; from the Edo period to the end of the millennium. All of them different, all of them unique.
在工具性作用下，诞生了无数个世界，从江户时代直至千禧年终结。每个世界都独一无二，各有千秋。

But all those worlds have one unifying rule in common; in every single one we met, and invariably, we fall in love. And sometimes we hurt each other.
然而，所有这些世界都有一个共同之处：在每一个我们相遇的地方，我们总是不可避免地陷入爱河。当然，有时我们也会彼此伤害。

And we connect to each other deeply.
我们彼此间深切相连。

Worlds made with both you and me in the center.
以你我为中心创造的世界。

That's the single, unifying rule. (Retake 04)
那就是唯一且统一的法则。（重拍第 04 次）

The fact that it was Monday morning wasn't lost to Shinji.
真嗣清楚地意识到，那天是星期一早晨。

The fact that a gust of wind in the abnormally cold winter morning made him snuggle closer to his wool coat and scarf, and wish he would have gotten that warm coffee for an extra 100 yen made this morning much more miserable than it was.
在那个异常寒冷的冬晨，一阵风让他不由自主地紧裹羊毛大衣和围巾，心中懊悔未曾多花 100 日元买一杯热咖啡，让这个早晨显得格外凄凉。

And so, here he was, standing in the train station, trying to stay warm with his wool coat while trying to stay awake long enough to take the train at the same time.
就这样，他站在火车站内，裹着羊毛大衣抵御寒意，同时努力保持清醒，以便赶上同一班火车。

Time was going by so slow… even the fact that the train had just passed by and a few papers were left flowing in it's midst, sticking to the fence, the rails, the roof and even Shinji himself, seemed like something that was happening miles away from here,
时间仿佛停滞不前……即便火车刚过，几页纸在它掀起的气流中飘扬，附着在围栏、铁轨、屋顶，甚至贴在了真嗣身上，这一切似乎都发生在千里之外，与这里无关

Until that same paper that had been sticking stubbornly to his arm flew away, only for it to be chased after by a redheaded girl about his age.
那张一直粘在他手臂上的纸终于飞走了，紧接着被一个同龄的红发女孩追了上去。

Shinji noticed that, and he also noticed that she seemed to be rather cute, albeitly, that could be because her particular hair color wasn't something he was used to seeing that often here in Tokyo. her eyes were also very peculiar; a vibrant shade of blue, clear and pure… almost electric, like the sky on a summer day; the kind that could make someone stare at them and lose themselves easily, not really caring about anything in life but content with simply staring at those pure, beautiful blue eyes.
真嗣察觉到了这一点，他还发现她颇为可爱，或许是因为她那罕见的头发颜色在东京并不常见。她的眼睛同样别具一格：一种鲜亮的蓝色，清澈透亮，宛如夏日晴空，电光般夺目；足以让人凝视其中，忘却尘世，只愿沉醉于那双纯净美丽的蓝眼睛。

But it was also because of the way she was frowning her brows as she made her way towards where Shinji remained standing, as if she were trying to burn a hole into the sheet of paper that was now being tucked into one of her folders before she looked up at Shinji who simply gave her a brief small smile that was answered with a frown and a narrowing of her eyes.
这同样是因为她皱着眉头走向真嗣的样子，仿佛要在将那张纸塞进文件夹前，在纸上烧出个洞。她抬头看向真嗣，他只是对她微微一笑，而她则皱眉并眯起了眼睛。

Before another train passed quickly by, making one of Shinji's own papers flow out of his grasp and straight into the redhead's face, obscuring her face and flapping the edges around at the void the air being displaced had created while the train stopped in it's tracks, just as she was busy trying to rearrange her hair, flipping behind her ear a strand that refused to play along.
另一列火车呼啸而过，新二手中的一张纸随之飘走，恰好扑向红发女子的脸，遮住了她的视线，纸张边缘在火车带起的气流中翻腾。当时，她正忙着整理头发，努力将一缕顽皮的发丝别到耳后。

Shinji gasped as his hands reflexively reached up towards the paper, peeling it back from the redheaded girl's face, and that was when things slowly began to unravel.
真嗣屏住呼吸，本能地伸手揭开覆盖在红发女孩脸上的纸张，那一刻，一切开始逐渐显露出复杂的真相。

His lips were already forming the vowels to ask for an apology while the redhead's face was already frowning, her lips tracing back into a snarl, ready to shout at him, and ask for an explanation when her eyes fell upon the piece of paper, a form of some kind that had to be filled and stamped and then sent out through the mail before she did the oddest thing in the world.
他的嘴唇正要发出请求道歉的声音，而红发女子的眉头已经紧皱，嘴唇紧抿，准备对他大喊并要求解释。就在这时，她的目光落在了那张纸上，那是一份必须填写、盖章并邮寄的表格。然而，她却做出了一个出人意料的举动。

She smiled, big blue eyes slowly blinking at him before she looked at the paper he held in his hand and she let a small laugh. Shinji could only stare in awe at how such a simple expression could grant someone some sort of ethereal, almost sublime loveliness, the likes of which he had never seen before. He began to look around to see what she had seen that seemed so funny before his eyes fell on the form he held in his hand; the bright, red contour of the redheaded girl's lips clearly visible against the white backdrop and the black ink and for some reason, it felt so comical and funny that all Shinji could do was laugh and chuckle and smile, before he heard the train bell ringing.
她微笑着，蓝眼睛缓缓地朝他眨了眨，随后目光转向他手中的纸张，不禁发出一声轻笑。真嗣只能惊叹，一个简单的表情竟能赋予人一种超凡脱俗、近乎崇高的美丽，这是他从未见过的。他环顾四周，想知道她究竟看到了什么如此有趣，这时他的目光落在了手中的表格上；红发女孩鲜红的唇印在白色背景和黑色墨迹中格外显眼，不知为何，这情景显得异常滑稽，真嗣忍不住笑出声来，直到他听到火车铃声响起。

And he saw the redhead boarding the train, heading out elsewhere while the wind began to pick up as the train gained momentum, the paper in Shinji's hand which still had the red mark of the creamy lipstick the redhead has used flapping stubbornly, almost as if it wanted to get free form the vice grip.
他目睹红发女子登上火车，驶向远方，风势渐起，火车加速。新二手里那张纸上，还留着红发女子所用奶油色口红的红色印记，纸张在风中顽强地摇曳，似乎渴望挣脱紧握的束缚。

And all Shinji could do was watch her leave, becoming smaller and smaller, and all he could do was flash a small, almost weak and somewhat submissive smile, the kind that you flash when you are ready to resign and throw in the towel...
真嗣只能眼睁睁看着她渐行渐远，身影逐渐缩小，他勉强挤出一个微弱而略显顺从的笑容，那是准备放弃、甘愿认输时才会露出的表情...

Just as the girl looked over her shoulder directly at Shinji and she smiled a small, shy, almost there smile.
女孩回头直视真嗣，脸上浮现出一抹羞涩而微妙的笑容。

And then the distance between him and that person became so big, the train finally entered a tunnel and darkness swallowed her whole.
随后，他与那人之间的距离愈发遥远，火车终于钻入隧道，黑暗彻底将她吞没。

Asuka looked over her shoulder, catching that guy's small, brief smile before she reflexively gave him one of her own just as the train rode inside the tunnel and she lost sight of him.
明日香回头一瞥，恰好捕捉到那男子一闪而过的浅笑，她下意识地报以微笑，紧接着列车驶入隧道，他的身影便消失在视线中。

She sighed and turned on her seat, staring at her stack of folders with her resume. She already had most of her morning and afternoon planned out to drop of resumes here and there, and so, without thinking again about it, she decided to enjoy the mind-numbing ride to the next station and begin with her day.
她轻叹一声，转身坐在座位上，目光落在那叠装着简历的文件夹上。她已安排好上午和下午的行程，准备四处投递简历。于是，她不再多想，决定在这段令人麻木的旅途中放松一下，前往下一站，迎接新的一天。

The ride to the office had been more of a fast forward flash, Shinji could only remember walking inside the train car when the train had finally arrived, and then walking out of it and walking in some sort of auto- motion towards his office building, scrunching his tall, lanky frame along with the other people who took the same elevator car up, before he finally reached his floor, walked outside and past the office's wooden doors, and made his way to his desk, sitting down while he stared out the window, sighing and remembering the flash of red and blue that had painted some color into his otherwise black and gray working day.
前往办公室的路程仿佛被快进了一般，真嗣只记得自己走进车厢，火车抵达后，便机械地随着人流走出，挤进电梯，直至抵达楼层，穿过办公室的木门，来到座位上坐下，凝视窗外，叹了口气，脑海中浮现出那抹红蓝相间的色彩，为单调的工作日增添了一丝生机。

So far the day had advanced in a hazy way; if you would ask Shinji, he wouldn't be able to remember anything in particular of it, except for the morning wait time for his commute; the morning shift had been boring and stale, his lunch had been a mere 30 minutes of pre-rehearsed jokes and comments of last nights "it" show, and now, the afternoon shift seemed to be a clone of the morning one, except for the fact he had gotten into trouble for something he couldn't really be bothered to remember but that Misato had made very clear he wasn't supposed to forget.
至今为止，这一天都在朦胧中悄然流逝；若问起真嗣，他对这一天并无特别记忆，只记得早晨通勤的等待时光；早班乏味至极，午餐仅是短短 30 分钟，充斥着昨晚热门节目的老套笑话和评论，而下午班仿佛是早班的复刻，唯一不同的是，他因一件懒得记起的小事而陷入麻烦，美里却再三强调他绝不能忘记。

All in all, all he could do since he had seated down on his desk, exactly 23 and a half minutes ago was stare at the paper that had that redheaded girl's lips; vibrant red against dull black and neutral white before out of nowhere a stack of forms was placed squarely on his desk by one of his supervisors; her mauve-colored hair tied tightly into a ponytail that was sitting at the base of her neck while she offered Shinji a small, almost apologetic look before she shrugged and walked along with the other section supervisors; the blond with glasses and a birthmark under her left eye and the older man with a ponytail and a perennial five o'clock shadow, towards the main section's chief office door, closing it behind while everyone else at their desks got busy reviewing, stamping, signing, filling out and generally making sure the forms were correct before placing them on their "out" bin.
总之，自从他 23 分半钟前坐在办公桌前，所能做的就是凝视那张纸上红发女孩的嘴唇；鲜红色在暗淡的黑色和灰白色背景中显得格外生动。突然，一堆表格被他的主管整齐地放在他的桌上；她那淡紫色的头发紧紧地扎成马尾，垂在颈后，她向新二投去一个略带歉意的眼神，然后耸耸肩，与其他部门主管一起走向主管办公室的门，包括那位戴眼镜的金发女郎，她左眼下有颗痣，还有那位年长的男士，扎着马尾，脸上总是带着五点钟的胡茬，他们关上门后，其他桌上的同事开始忙碌地审阅、盖章、签字、归档仔细检查表格，确保一切正确，然后将其放入“待发”箱。

Shinji looked from the stack back at the space where the supervisor's office had been opened, before a strong gust of air flew, making the form he had been staring at so intently slowly ease itself out from under all the other forms, flowing out towards the open window while Shinji held onto it tightly, not yet willing to part ways with the only reminder he had of that redheaded girl, and wondering when destiny would deign itself to make them both cross paths yet again.
真嗣从文件堆中抬头，目光投向主管办公室曾敞开的地方。一阵强风袭来，他专注凝视的那个形状逐渐从其他杂物中挣脱，飘向敞开的窗边。真嗣紧握不放，不愿与这唯一能勾起红发女孩记忆的物品分离，心中暗自思忖，命运何时会再次让他们重逢。

Which was when Shinji looked up, and noticed that on the building across from his, just a flight below, was the same vibrant hue of red hair, the same bright blue eyes and the same small, shy, almost there smile all belonging to the same girl he had meet at the train station by mere chance.
就在那一刻，真嗣抬头望去，注意到对面楼房比自己所在楼层低一层的位置，站着那位在火车站偶然相遇的女孩，她拥有同样醒目的红发、明亮的蓝眼睛，以及那几乎难以察觉的羞涩微笑。

She was walking through the door, smiling and shaking the hand of whoever was sitting in the desk in front of her, before sitting down, waiting.
她穿过门口时面带微笑，与坐在面前桌旁的人握手致意，随后坐下静候。

The smile in Shinji's face felt so big and wide and huge it made his cheek and jaw hurt, almost as if they were being ripped apart, but he didn't really care because she was there, close enough that all he had to do was shout loud enough for her to hear and she would turn and see him and maybe smile or chuckle or roll her eyes.
真嗣脸上的笑容如此之大，以至于脸颊和下巴都感到疼痛，仿佛要被撕裂，但他毫不在意，因为她就在近旁，只要他大声呼唤，她便会听见，转头看见他，或许还会露出微笑、轻笑或翻个白眼。

Ok, so she wasn't turning even if Shinji was trying to shout out at her, because obviously the air and the height and a lot of other, physics-related reasons made his voice not loud enough to make it able to travel the distance between both buildings and through the windows, the sounds of traffic and people walking and chatting and life as anyone knew it in a big city drowning the anguished cries a brown haired boy from one building was making, trying to make the redhead girl from the building across look up and out the window.
显然，尽管真嗣竭力呼喊，那位女孩并未回头。空气、高度以及众多物理因素导致他的声音无法响亮到足以穿越两栋楼之间的距离并穿透窗户。城市的喧嚣——车辆的轰鸣、行人的脚步与交谈，以及大都市中人们习以为常的生活噪音——淹没了这个棕发男孩在一栋楼里发出的绝望呼喊，他试图让对面楼里的红发女孩抬头望向窗外。

But Shinji knew that when she'd finally hear him, she would smile back at him and shake her head because of his weird antics and then Shinji would motion for her to meet him downstairs and he would get out early and they would exchange names and phone numbers and email addresses and maybe text each other to go get a coffee or some tea o-
然而，真嗣心里清楚，一旦她听到他的声音，定会对他露出微笑，摇头笑他那奇特的举动。接着，真嗣会示意她下楼相会，他会提前出门，两人将互换姓名、联系方式，或许还会发信息约个时间，一起去喝杯咖啡或茶

Ahem... 呃...

Shinji looked up and noticed Ritsuko looking at him, leaning back from her chair as an immaculate eyebrow arched ever so slightly, wordlessly asking him if there was any kind of problem or issue while one of the senior clerks, Ibuki, looked from her to him and then back at her. Ritsuko paid no attention to the clerk but held her eyes on Shinji who looked from the blond towards the redhead outside his window and then to the stack of papers in his desk, finally sitting down and looking defeated while Ritsuko leaned back forward, closing the door while everyone else went back to work.
真嗣抬头时，发现律子正注视着他，她身体微微后仰，优雅地挑起一边眉毛，无声地询问他是否遇到了什么问题。一位名叫伊吹的资深职员来回打量着他们俩。律子对伊吹视而不见，目光始终锁定在真嗣身上。真嗣先是望向窗外的金发女子，随后目光落在桌上的文件堆，最终颓然坐下。律子见状，身体前倾，关上门，周围的人也恢复了工作。

Shinji sat down back at his desk, still staring out his window, still wondering how he could be able to reach out to the girl in front of him before the form that held the redhead's lipmarks began to flap again under the wind, making Shinji slam his hand down firmly at it to prevent it from escaping.
真嗣坐回桌前，目光仍停留在窗外，心中琢磨着怎样才能在那张留有红发女孩唇印的纸再次被风吹动前，伸手触及她。为了不让它飘走，他猛地用手将其按住。

And that was when he got the idea.
就在那时，他萌生了这一念头。

He reached out towards the form sitting on top of his stack of papers, placing it on his desk and quickly folding it around an imaginary axis, following the motions he knew since elementary school to build a paper airplane.
他伸手取过堆叠的文件顶端的那张纸，放在桌上，熟练地沿假想轴线折叠，遵循着自小学起就烂熟于心的步骤，折出了一架纸飞机。

The lines were firm, the edges very well defined and all in all, the body and nose of the airplane were so well done, Shinji was sure it would fly out effortlessly from his hand out towards the redhead who was still sitting down, maybe waiting to be for her interview.
线条坚挺，边缘分明，飞机的机身和机头制作得如此精良，真嗣确信它将从他手中轻松飞出，飞向那位仍坐着、或许在等待面试的红发女孩。

And so when he held his hand outside the window, after making sure no one from the supervisor's office was looking outside their door, Shinji confidently let his hand slip back, taking in a small amount of momentum before flinging his wrist forward, letting his hand sail forth and fall as it released the paper airplane from his grasp.
确认监工办公室无人注意后，他小心翼翼地将手伸出窗外，先积蓄了一点力量，随即迅速向前甩动手腕，让手中的纸飞机顺势飞出，自由地飘落。

And then watched as it plummeted down towards the busy street.
随后目睹它急速坠向熙熙攘攘的街道。

Shinji looked at the paper construct before he went back to his desk, plucking out another form from his stack and began the process again: fold, fold, flip, fold, flatten, turn, fold before he threw this airplane gently from his window, watching it sail out across the divide between both buildings, holding his breath just as the paper plane was about to reach the window, only for it to crash into the buildings brick wall just inches away from the open window and the redhead who was now reading the morning newspaper.
真嗣凝视着面前的纸艺作品，随后回到桌前，从一叠文件中抽出另一张表格，再次重复起那套动作：折叠、翻折、翻面、再折、压平、转个方向、继续折，最后轻手轻脚地将纸飞机从窗口放飞，目送它划过两楼间的空隙。他屏息凝神，眼看纸飞机就要触及对面窗户，却偏偏撞上了离窗仅咫尺之遥的砖墙，而那位红发少女正巧在窗边读着晨报。

Shinji was undeterred though: fold, fold, flip, fold, flatten, turn, fold but just as he was turning in his chair, ready to get up to try again, a heavy hand pushed him down on his chair, making Shinji let out a small gasp and look up at Kaji's frowning face, with the white lollipop stick sticking out of his mouth before his frown broke into a small smile, silently motioning with his head towards the supervisor's section where Fuyutsuki, one of the bigwigs from upstairs had just walked in.
然而，真嗣并未放弃：折叠、折叠、翻转、再折叠、压平、旋转、继续折叠。正当他准备从椅子上站起来再次尝试时，一只沉甸甸的手突然将他按回原位，真嗣不由得轻声惊呼，抬头看见加持紧皱的眉头，嘴里含着白色棒棒糖棍。随后，加持的眉头舒展开来，露出一抹微笑，用头示意监督区，只见楼上的高层之一——冬月正巧走进来。

The silent message was loud and clear; sit down, get your act together and get your job done, so Shinji stared at Kaji as he walked to the office, stopping to look over his shoulder and give Shinji a wink before closing the door behind him, the silhouettes from inside the office all sitting down.
无声的信息传达得既响亮又明确：坐下，整理好自己，把工作完成。于是，真嗣目送卡吉走向办公室，途中他停步回头，向真嗣眨眼示意，随后关上门，办公室内的身影纷纷落座。

And once he was sure they were all inside and busy, Shinji went back to making a paper airplane, throwing it outside of the window.
确认大家都已进入并忙碌后，真嗣又回去折起了纸飞机，并从窗户向外扔去。

Only for this plane to fly at a downward angle straight towards the open window of the office that was two floors down from the original target, where a short, thin guy with wide-rimmed glasses sat down, his curly, light brown hair and freckles making him look a lot younger than his actual age,
仅为此飞机以向下倾斜的角度，径直飞向比预定目标低两层的办公室敞开的窗户。那里，一个戴着宽边眼镜的瘦小男子坐着，他那卷曲的浅棕色头发和脸上的雀斑，让他显得比实际年龄要年轻得多

He stared from the paper airplane that had just landed in his desk to the open window and then up at Shinji who was now busy shaking his hands quickly, trying to explain to the other guy it had been a mistake.
他目光从刚落在桌上的纸飞机移向敞开的窗户，随后抬头望向 Shinji，后者正急切地挥手，向另一个人解释这纯属误会。

Sandy-haired freckled glasses frowned, crumpling the paper plane, throwing it to the trash and getting back at work.
金发且脸上有雀斑的人戴着眼镜，眉头紧锁，将纸飞机揉皱后丢入垃圾桶，随即又投入工作。

Shinji tried again, and this time the plane flew true towards the window, keeping optimal altitude and bearing and was just about to make it inside when a flock of pigeons flew across, and the last one of the birds in the triangle caught a beak full of the paper airplane.
真嗣再次尝试，这次纸飞机准确地飞向窗户，保持最佳高度和航向，就在即将成功进入之际，一群鸽子横飞而过，其中最后一只鸟恰好用喙衔住了纸飞机。

Again and again Shinji tried, planes flowing out as if they were part of a paper armada intent on conquering the other building; some flew onto the building's wall, landing on the building's ledge, while others fell down towards the street, while some others were chased away by the air, some flying several floors up or down or some windows left or right.
真嗣一次又一次地尝试，纸飞机仿佛组成了一支纸制舰队，誓要征服对面的建筑；有的飞上了建筑的墙面，停靠在窗台上，有的则坠落至街道，还有的被气流卷走，或飞升几层楼，或下降几层楼，或是偏离左右窗户。

The closest one flew across the space between the buildings, was able to sneak past a gust or two of wind that threatened to make it fly of course, waltzed inside the window where the redhead was, and landed on the paper basket next to the couch where she had been sitting a few seconds before.
最近的那只飞鸟巧妙地穿越了楼宇间的空隙，几度避开强风，从红发女子所在的窗户翩然飞入，稳稳地降落在她刚离开的沙发旁的纸篓上。

It was only a few seconds after that the redhead came back, walking back from an adjacent door and looking down as she kept on wiping her hands dry with her handkerchief before finally sitting down again, and she began to talk with whoever was on the other side of the desk, never knowing how close Shinji had been to making contact with her.
仅仅几秒后，红发女子便从邻门返回，边走边低头用手帕擦干双手，随后重新坐下，与桌对面的人交谈起来，却未察觉真嗣曾与她近在咫尺。

Shinji ended up bonking his head against the bricks surrounding the wall in exasperation.
真嗣因极度沮丧，一头撞上了环绕墙壁的砖块。

Again and again Shinji tried over and over, paper planes flying, falling, sailing, crashing, until finally Shinji reached for another form and all he could grasp wait emptiness and air, and his desk bin fell onto the floor, crashing the silence of the workplace with such loudness, it felt like something had been broken and could never be made whole again.
真嗣一次次尝试，纸飞机飞起又落下，滑翔又碰撞，反复不已。最终，当他伸手去抓另一种形态时，却只触碰到空无一物的空气，桌旁的垃圾桶随之坠地，巨响打破了工作间的宁静，仿佛有什么东西就此破碎，再也无法完整。

Everyone stared at Shinji, and Rei, who was sitting in the desk next to him silently, and without so much as arching an eyebrow simply held her hand over her own form stack, pushing it towards herself and going back to work, never taking her arm off.
所有人都注视着真嗣，以及坐在他邻座的绫波。她静默无言，未曾挑眉，仅是将手轻覆于自己的文件堆上，将其拉近，随即埋头工作，手臂始终未曾挪开。

Shinji looked from his bare desk to the bin still on the floor, reflexively thinking all the forms were gone, all that he had left was the original one, the one that had started it all, the form with the imprint of the redhead's lips, firmly held down to his desk by his right hand.
真嗣望着空荡荡的桌面，目光又转向地上的垃圾桶，本能地以为所有表格都已不见，只剩下最初的那张，那张一切的起点，上面清晰地印着红发女孩的唇印，被他的右手牢牢按在桌上。

Shinji looked to his right, noticing the redhead was shaking the hand of the freckled faced brunette sitting on the desk, both of them talking enthusiastically and smiling and giggling before Shinji realized this was it; this was his last chance.
真嗣向右一瞥，只见红发女孩正与坐在桌上的棕发女孩握手，两人兴致勃勃地交谈，笑容满面，不时发出欢快的笑声。真嗣恍然大悟，这正是他最后的机会。

Quickly, he did the same motions as before; fold, fold, flip, fold, flatten, turn, fold. Solemnly, he stood in front of the window, holding the paper plane made with that form tightly between thumb and forefinger, staring out at the redhead in front of him with all his will, as if trying to force an imaginary tunnel to take form so that this paper plane could reach it's final destination, crash into the redhead's side, making her gasp and turn and pick it up, staring at the from, frowning while the brunette would stare from the paper plane to her friend and then out the window towards the smiling and waving by in the office building across.
他迅速重复之前的动作：折叠、折叠、翻转、折叠、压平、翻面、折叠。肃穆地站在窗前，他用拇指和食指紧紧夹着那架精心折叠的纸飞机，全神贯注地凝视着面前的红发女子，仿佛在努力让一条无形的隧道显现，以便纸飞机能飞向目标，撞击红发女子的身侧，让她惊呼转身，拾起纸飞机，皱眉审视。与此同时，棕发女子从纸飞机转向她的朋友，再望向窗外，目光投向对面办公楼里微笑挥手的人。

Shinji would be smiling and waving his hands, and the brunette and the redhead would smile and giggle and chat between them both, before finally, the brunette would push her friend forward just a bit, and then signal to Shinji to go downstairs so they could finally meet and talk, and get her name and number and email and then Shinji would ask her out to get some coffee or lunch and th-
真嗣面带微笑，挥手致意，旁边的棕发女孩和红发女孩则相视而笑，低声交谈。最后，棕发女孩轻推好友向前一步，示意真嗣下楼，以便他们能正式见面，交换姓名、联系方式，并邀请她一同去喝咖啡或共进午餐，接着..

The wind blew again, and it made the last airplane fly out of his hand, falling down in a spiral towards the street below and far beyond Shinji's reach who could only watch from his window as the airplane became a small dot against the gray asphalt of the street, before he looked up and could only watch a flash of red walking out the door, closing the door behind her.
风又起，最后一架纸飞机从他手中飘走，螺旋下坠，远离了真嗣的视线。他只能透过窗户，眼睁睁看着纸飞机在灰暗的街道上缩成一个小点。接着，他抬头，只见一抹红色身影匆匆出门，随后门轻轻关上。

Shinji gasped, unsure of what to do when suddenly, the supervisor's door opened, and everyone went from staring at Shinji back to work. Shinji looked down and then up at Misato who held a fresh new stack, a frustrated look on her face before she let it fall on Shinji's desk again, making Shinji slowly fall down on his chair before out of the corner of his eyes he saw the familiar flash of red hair walking out the building's front door.
真嗣倒吸一口凉气，茫然无措。突然，主管室的门开了，大家纷纷收回目光继续工作。真嗣低头又抬头，只见美里面带愠色，手里捧着一叠新文件，再次重重地搁在他桌上，让他不由自主地坐回椅子。就在这时，他眼角余光捕捉到那抹熟悉的红发，正从大楼前门匆匆离去。

Shinji looked despondently at Misato's retreating form, before something new began to fester in him.
真嗣失落地凝视着美里离去的背影，内心逐渐涌起一股新的情感。

And before she could go back to the supervisor's office, Misato heard the rustle of wind and paper sheets on the floor as Shinji ran towards the front office door, and outside to the busy street downstairs.
就在她折返主管办公室之际，真嗣已奔向前台大门，冲向楼下熙熙攘攘的街道，此时，碇真嗣耳边响起了风声和地上纸张的窸窣声。

And even as she tried to remain angry at him, Misato could only shrug and smile, while Rei finally relaxed and let her left hand fall, staring at Shinji's empty desk and then at the office that laid beyond the space between both buildings, wondering who had been that redhead Shinji had payed so much attention to.
尽管她努力保持对真嗣的怒气，葛城美里最终还是无奈地笑了笑，绫波丽也放松了紧绷的左手，目光从真嗣空无一人的桌子上移开，转向两栋楼之间的办公室，心中疑惑那个让真嗣如此留意的红发女孩究竟是谁。

If Shinji had left the office five minutes before, then he would have probably seen the redhead just as she was walking out the front door of the building in front of his, and she would have seen him. They both would have probably smiled awkwardly before Shinji would have tried to make his way towards her, finally fulfilling his self imposed mission of asking her for her name, telephone number, email address, and then inviting her to have lunch or coffee or something else, maybe even catch a movie or going somewhere.
如果真嗣早五分钟离开办公室，他很可能就会目睹那位红发女孩正从他面前大楼的前门走出，而她也会注意到他。两人或许会尴尬地相视一笑，随后真嗣会鼓起勇气走向她，完成他心中的任务——询问她的名字、电话号码、电子邮箱，并邀请她共进午餐、喝咖啡或进行其他活动，甚至可能一起去看电影或去某个地方。

As it was, Shinji rushed out the front door mere seconds after the redhead had turned around the corner across from his building, already disappearing between the sea of people from the busy intersection while Shinji lunged forward towards the street, crossing the street as cars and trucks and buses honked angrily at him just as he made his way towards the other side of the street, turning frantically left then right, gasping for air and holding his head in his hands while he tried to regain his bearing before making a choice of where to go from here.
就在红发女孩转过街角，消失在对面繁忙路口的人群中几秒后，真嗣冲出了家门。他冲向街道，车辆愤怒地鸣笛，他不顾一切地穿过街道，焦急地左顾右盼，喘着粗气，双手抱头，试图找回方向感，然后决定接下来的去向。

There, in front of him, sitting in a mailbox carelessly, just like an inanimate object would, lay the last newspaper he had made, still with the bright red lipstick kiss on it, and for some reason, that made Shinji so angry, so frustrated, so irked, all he could do was snatch the paper plane and throw it out towards the sky, the air rising from within the city streets propelling it up, up and away, lifting it past buildings and billboards, across streets and alleys, until the plane slowly began to fly lower and lower into the courtyard of an apartment building that was partially shadowed in given the time of the day and the direction of the walls.
在他面前，随意地坐在邮箱里，如同无生命的物体一般，躺着他制作的最后一份报纸，上面还留有鲜红的唇印。不知为何，这情景让真嗣感到异常愤怒和沮丧，他只能抓起纸飞机，奋力向天空抛去。城市街道上升的气流将纸飞机推得越来越高，越过楼宇和广告牌，穿过街巷，最终缓缓降落在一个公寓楼的庭院里，那里因时间和墙壁的遮挡，部分区域被阴影覆盖。

Slowly, the plane drifted down more and more, crashing into one of the walls and then slowly plummeting down before it finally it finally fell on top of another plane, just as the wind blew and turned it one side, then the other, then away from the plane and into the floor, making it fall into a few dozen more planes sitting on the floor.
飞机缓缓下降，撞上墙壁后继续下坠，最终落在另一架飞机上。风势加剧，使它左右摇摆，随后将其吹离，撞向地面，进而砸中地面上的数十架飞机。

Without even waiting to see where that plane had flown out to, Shinji began to walk angrily. he needed to get away from that place, from those stupid airplanes, from that damn building. He needed to forget about cute redheads and bright blue eyes and smiles that were half smirks and half lopsided grins and cute small noses and bright red lips and all he could right now to keep himself from screaming out of sheer anger and frustration was stomp angrily down the street, ignoring as people stared and pointed at him.
真嗣甚至没等看清那架飞机飞往何处，就怒气冲冲地迈开了步子。他迫切想要逃离这个地方，远离那些愚蠢的飞机和那座可恶的建筑。他渴望忘掉那可爱的红发、明亮的蓝眼睛、半带嘲弄半带歪斜的笑容、小巧的鼻子和鲜红的唇瓣。此刻，他只能通过愤怒地在街上跺脚来抑制自己，不让愤怒和挫败感爆发出来，对周围人的注视和指点视而不见。

And just as he passed by the alley that lead to the courtyard of the building where a good portion of his forms-turned-paper-airplanes had ended, a strong gust of winter air flew, rattling them all, lifting them from the floor almost like it was awaking them from a deep slumber, making the paper planes lift up and move in circles around each other, dancing to a musical tune that only they seemed could hear.
当他经过那条通往大楼庭院的巷子时，那里曾是他众多纸飞机的归宿，一阵猛烈的冬风突然吹过，使它们发出阵阵响声，仿佛从沉睡中唤醒，纸飞机们随之升空，围绕彼此旋转飞舞，仿佛在跳着只有它们能听见的音乐之舞。

Shinji walked past them with an angry look in his face; he had decided that the day could very well just go to hell for all he could care and so he decided to head back to the station and go back home.
真嗣面带怒容从他们身边走过；他已决定，这一天对他而言爱咋咋地，索性返回车站，打道回府。

Just as he turned the corner he noticed the entrance to the train station had a construction frame collapsed on it, and a crew of construction workers flagged him down, telling him he couldn't go through, as it seemed one of them had accidentally turned on a jackhammer near a frame and had accidentally turned it on when a paper plane flew out of nowhere, making him somehow cut down the frame, blocking the small street.
当他刚拐过街角，便发现火车站入口处的建筑框架坍塌了。一群建筑工人拦住他，告知此路不通。原来，一名工人不慎在框架旁开启了手持凿岩机，一张突如其来的纸飞机让他分心，意外切断了框架，堵住了狭窄的街道。

Great. Shinji shook his head and walked back the street; the closest stations were both a good 10 blocks away either way. So Shinji decided to stop by a convenience store and buy himself a canned coffee.
挺好。真嗣摇摇头，沿着街道返回；最近的两个车站无论哪个方向都还有十个街区之遥。于是他决定在便利店稍作停留，买一罐罐装咖啡犒劳自己。

The cashier smiled at him in that same, auto-mechanical way they do when smiling is part of their work description; like plastic flowers or fake fruit; from a distance it seems just like the real thing until you look closer and notice the truth.
收银员对他露出了那种职业性的微笑，仿佛微笑已融入他们的工作职责，远看如同真花真果，近看方知其假。

So Shinji decided to ignore the perfect-almost-too-perfect smile with white pearly teeth and the gray, almost ashen hair of the clerk and instead walked out the door turning right to go to the nearest train station.
于是，真嗣决定不去理会那位店员那完美得近乎不真实的微笑，以及他那灰白得近乎苍白的头发，径直走出店门，右转前往最近的火车站。

Only to see a police cruiser driving at top speed towards the street intersection, stopping with a sudden screech as an officer jumped out and approached the site of a car crash between a fish truck and a taxi, the taxi driver trying to explain to the officer how the crash had been the result of a paper plane coming out of nowhere, startling him into driving straight into the trucks rear fender.
只见一辆警车全速驶向十字路口，急刹车时发出刺耳声响，一名警官随即下车赶往鱼车与出租车相撞的地点。出租车司机正向警官解释，事故起因是一架纸飞机突如其来，令他受惊不慎撞上了卡车的尾部。

Shinji decided to scurry away for fear someone might say he was the guy who had devoted the better part of his day to making and throwing paper planes out his window.
真嗣决定赶紧离开，担心有人会指出他就是那个整天忙着做纸飞机并从窗口扔出去的人。

Everywhere he went, it seemed the paper planes were following him; in one street, a plane had crashed into a group of movers that had let go of the ropes lifting a grand piano towards one of the top floors,resulting in a huge crash and the street being closed to the circulation.
他走到哪儿，纸飞机就跟到哪儿；在一条街上，一架纸飞机撞上了一群正在松开绳索、准备将大钢琴吊往顶楼的搬运工，结果引发巨大撞击，街道因此被封锁，禁止车辆通行。

In another one, the plane had flown into a street light that had been connected to the power cables haphazardly, making the light fall which in turn made a car crash into another.
另一案例中，飞机撞上了乱接电源的路灯，路灯倒下后，又导致一辆汽车撞上了另一辆。

Still in another one, another plane had flown into a parking car where a small child had followed it, locking the doors with the keys inside and currently the child's mother was trying to coax him into opening the door with the promise of chocolates and toys, lest the child would put the key in the ignition and turn it on.
另一处，一架飞机意外撞入一辆停着的汽车，一个小孩跟随进入后不慎锁门，钥匙遗留在车内。孩子的母亲正用巧克力和玩具诱导他开门，以防孩子误将钥匙插入并启动汽车。

And while Shinji kept on walking towards the station, marveling at the strife a few little paper airplanes could cause, he never witnessed as a particular airplane, one that had a bright red kiss imprint on one of it's wings flew like a bat out of hell, zipping across roofs and buildings and kept going on straight, flying inside an open taxi, through a corner window office and upwards from a bus.
真嗣一边走向车站，一边对几架纸飞机引发的纷争感到惊奇。他并未注意到，一架翼上印有鲜红唇印的纸飞机，如离弦之箭般穿梭于屋顶与建筑间，直飞入一辆敞开的出租车，穿过角落办公室的窗户，又从一辆巴士上方腾空而起。

It flew past a group of children walking with their teacher, crossing the road and past a newsstand with the sonic boom of a supersonic plane, making the newspapers and magazines and other publications rustle, pages flipping as skirts flew and men tried not to look at the ladies holding their skirts.
它飞越一群正由老师带领过马路的孩子，掠过报摊时，超音速飞机的音爆使得报纸、杂志等出版物哗哗作响，页张翻动，裙摆随之飘扬，男士们则尽量不去注视那些按住裙子的女士们。

As she walked out of her interview, Asuka looked around, feeling as if something was amiss. While Hikari had told her that she was a show-in for that position and that she was sure she would get it, something on the back of her head kept whispering she was missing something.
走出面试室时，明日香环顾四周，总觉得哪里不对劲。虽然光曾告诉她，这个职位非她莫属，而且她自己也坚信能拿下，但心底总有个声音在提醒，她似乎忽略了什么。

Something important, something… blue.
重要之事，以及……那抹蓝色。

Dark blue eyes and a goofy small shy smile; dark brown, almost black, hair falling down his face and a tall, lanky frame that was almost like a bean sprout about to be broken in half by the wind.
深邃的蓝眼睛搭配着羞涩的傻笑；深棕色，近乎黑色的头发垂落脸颊，高挑瘦削的身躯，宛如一根纤细的豆芽，似乎在风中摇摇欲坠。

Something blue like this particular bouquet made of dark blue flowers with small yellow centers and white stamens. she had asked the flower lady what kind they were and she had said they were hydrangeas, which were now in bloom.
这束花呈现出深蓝色调，花心点缀着小巧的黄色，雄蕊洁白如雪。她曾向卖花人询问，得知这些是正值盛开的绣球花。

And as Asuka got closer to the flowers to smell them, attempting to freeze frame their design into her memory, she noticed out of the corner of her eye a piece of paper landing on top of the flowers at the other end of the stand; she did a double take as she noticed it was a paper plane that seemed to have the impression of a red pair of lips on it…
明日香走近花朵，想要闻其芬芳，并试图将这美丽瞬间铭记于心。就在这时，她眼角余光注意到摊位另一端的花朵上飘落了一张纸片。她再次凝视，发现那是一架纸飞机，上面赫然印着一对红唇的图案……

A very familiar pair of lips...
一双极为熟悉的唇瓣...

In a very familiar looking piece of paper from a somewhat familiar guy with equally dark blue eyes.
一张纸，来自一个眼熟的人，他也有着同样深邃的蓝色眼睛。

And then the plane seemed to be free once again, a playful gust of wind making it fly around her, making the redhead twirl in her place as if she was being held by her waist and arm by an unseen dancer before she felt the need to follow this plane out of nowhere wherever it would lead her.
接着，飞机仿佛重获自由，一阵俏皮的风让它在她四周盘旋，红发女孩随之原地旋转，宛如被一位隐形的舞者揽着腰臂。她心生一股冲动，要追随这架突如其来的飞机，无论它引领她去向何方。

Shinji sighed as he waited on the train station for the train to arrive only to notice a paper airplane flying to his feet. He frowned and knelt to grab it just as the 5:00 p.m. train stopped and opened it's door and a tidal wave of commuters rushed out, like water from a dam that had been broken, the people pushed him back and away from his train before he could do anything about it, instead only being able to see as the doors closed and the train left for the next station.
真嗣在火车站等待火车时叹了口气，突然一只纸飞机飞落到他的脚边。他皱眉弯腰去捡，恰逢下午 5 点的火车到站，车门一开，汹涌的通勤人群如决堤之水般涌出，将他挤离了火车。他来不及做任何反应，只能无奈地看着车门关闭，火车驶离前往下一站。

Which meant Shinji now had to wait an extra 13 minutes for the next train to arrive.
这意味着真嗣现在需要多等 13 分钟，下一班火车才能到站。

Asuka kept running behind the paper plane as it turned around a corner and flew down a street before going up the stairs of the train station, past the people standing and waiting for the train to leave. She felt like a little child, seeing the world in a different way, with outstretched arms that were trying to pull themselves around the world while the plane flew above and under and around her, circling her body, and before she knew it, Asuka had ran into the train, catching up to the plane which fell limply just as her fingertips grazed it, almost at the exact same time the train bell rang and it's doors closed and the car began to move forth onto the next station.
明日香紧追不舍，纸飞机绕过街角，掠过街道，又顺着火车站的阶梯飞升，穿梭于静候列车启程的人群之间。她仿佛回到了童年，以全新的视角审视世界，张开的双臂似要拥抱一切，而纸飞机则在她的头顶、脚下和四周盘旋，围绕着她翩翩起舞。就在她冲进火车的那一刻，指尖刚好触及那架即将坠落的纸飞机，几乎同时，火车铃声响起，车门关闭，车厢缓缓驶向下一站。

Shinji grumbled from his seat on a train car he had never tried to take, a train car he had only gotten into because a little boy had bumped into him after trying to catch a paper airplane which had made Shinji lose his balance, landing face first inside the train car just as the doors closed behind him and the car began to move in the opposite direction he had wanted to take.
真嗣坐在一节陌生的火车车厢里，不满地嘟囔着。他之所以会误入这节车厢，全因一个小男孩在追逐一架纸飞机时不慎撞到他，使他失去平衡，一头栽进了车厢。就在车门关闭的瞬间，车厢启动，驶向了他原本不打算前往的方向。

Now, all he could do was watch as another one of those damn paper planes flew next to him, outside the window, the stark white paper making a vivid contrast against the blueish, pinkish, orangeish, reddish hues of the setting sun and the night sky.
此刻，他唯有注视着又一架恼人的纸飞机在窗外飞过，在夕阳与夜空交织的蓝粉橙红背景下，那张洁白的纸张显得格外醒目。

Asuka looked at the plane with her lips on it, as she waited for the car the arrive to it's destination, shaking her head as the brief spiel of repressed childhood passed and now here she was; already late, with darkening skies and she still had to take 3 more trains to get home.
明日香紧贴着飞机凝望，等待车辆载她抵达目的地。她摇头轻叹，儿时被压抑的记忆掠过心头，此刻她已迟到，天色渐暗，还需换乘三趟列车才能到家。

She looked up as the train finally stopped in the station, walking out and looking at the plane that still lay in her hands, playing with it a little, as if trying to wake it up and make it come alive again before behind her, she heard the screeching sound of a train stopping in the middle rail, and with the sound of metal scraping against metal the ever present gust of air as the speed of travel reached the end of momentum, only to see at her feet what seemed like dozens and dozens of paper planes being pushed by the air past her, making the redhead turn reflectively.
火车缓缓停靠在站台，她抬头望去，手中依旧把玩着那架纸飞机，仿佛在尝试唤醒它的生命。突然，身后传来另一列火车急停的尖锐声响，金属摩擦声和因速度骤减而产生的气流随之而来。她低头一看，只见数十架纸飞机被气流推动着从脚边飞过，这一幕让红发女子本能地转过身来。

And there, next to her, stepping out of the train car almost in a daze was Shinji, staring at Asuka as if it was the first time he had ever laid eyes on her.
就在她旁边，真嗣几乎是在恍惚中从火车车厢里走出来，目不转睛地盯着明日香，仿佛初次见到她一般。

Hikari giggled behind her mittens while Touji kept on talking about how Shinji had been goofing off the whole day, something decidedly not normal, and had instead devoted the last part of the day to making airplanes out of the forms they were supposed to review and stamp, throwing them out the window while Rei and everyone else in the office simply witnessed this.
光在手套后偷偷笑出声，冬二则不停地说着真嗣整天都在胡闹，这明显不正常。真嗣反倒把一天的最后时间用来用他们本该审阅盖章的表格折飞机，还把它们从窗户扔出去，而零和办公室里的其他人只是默默地看着。

Hikari rolled her eyes, but smiled while she told Toji how her boss had decided to give Asuka a chance but the redhead hadn't been able to answer her phone. It wasn't a real problem because she had told her boss she would tell the redhead to show up on Wednesday for work but still…
光翻了个白眼，却带着微笑向东二解释，她的老板决定给明日香一次机会，但那位红发女孩没接到电话。这倒不是什么大问题，因为她已经跟老板说好，会让明日香周三来报到，不过……

Touji was about to say something when he stopped short, stopping Hikari with him. The brunette stared at her boyfriend and then followed his line of sight as he stared at the window of a small cafe.
冬二本欲开口，却戛然而止，连带光也止步。棕发少女凝视着男友，随后循着他的目光，一同望向了那家小咖啡馆的窗边。

There in front of them were Shinji and Asuka, sharing a cup of coffee as if they had always were meant to.
在他们面前，真嗣和明日香正共饮一杯咖啡，宛如命中注定的一对。

And in front of them both, sitting on the cafe bar lay a paper airplane with a pair of red lips kissing it.
他们俩面前，咖啡吧台上，一架纸飞机静静躺着，上面印着一对红唇，仿佛在亲吻它。

AN: Hmm, guess I still had one more story to add before becoming a zombie.
嗯，看来在成为僵尸之前，我还得再讲一个故事。
