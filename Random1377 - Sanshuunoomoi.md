Shinji Ikari sat at the small kitchen table, a can of juice in one hand and a small paperback in the other. "Weird stuff…" he muttered, keeping his thumb in the middle of the book so as not to lose his page and flipping the cover closed. "Droogies…" he said thoughtfully, "I think I can see why this is Misses Souske's favorite… but what's a clockwork?"  
碇真嗣坐在小厨房的桌子旁，一手拿着果汁罐，另一手拿着一本小巧的平装书。“奇怪的东西……”他喃喃自语，用拇指夹住书页以防丢失进度，然后将封面合上。“德鲁吉……”他若有所思地说，“我想我能明白为什么这是苏斯克小姐的最爱……但什么是发条呢？”

He sighed, carefully opening the book once more (with great care, to ensure that the spine did not get creased) and picking up where he had left Alex and his friends in a milk bar… but he found himself distracted by an odd sound from further back in the house.  
他叹了口气，小心翼翼地再次打开书本（非常小心，以免书脊起皱），准备继续阅读他在牛奶吧里留下的亚历克斯和他的朋友们……但他发现自己被屋子深处传来的奇怪声音分心了。

"That sounds like…" 那声音听起来像是……

He blinked as his roommate and fellow pilot, Asuka Langley Souryu, danced into the kitchen, singing at the top of her lungs.  
他眨了眨眼，只见他的室友兼飞行员同伴，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，一边高声唱着歌，一边跳着舞进入了厨房。

"Rock the cradle of love!" the girl sang, shimmying over to the fridge and retrieving a carrot, "Rock the cradle of love… yes the cradle of love… don't rock easily, baby – wooo!"  
"摇滚爱的摇篮！" 女孩唱着，扭动着身体走向冰箱，取出一根胡萝卜，"摇滚爱的摇篮…是的，爱的摇篮…宝贝，它不容易摇动——喔喔！"

Shinji just stared as she spun around, grinning as she plopped into the seat across from him, then immediately standing, biting the end off the carrot and tapping her free hand first on the table, then Shinji's arm.  
真嗣只是盯着她旋转，当她笑着坐到他对面的座位上，然后立刻站起来，咬掉胡萝卜的一端，并用空着的手先是敲打桌子，然后是真嗣的手臂时，他笑了。

"Whatcha doin'?" "你在干嘛？"

The Third Child looked uncertain. "Just… reading," he said awkwardly, closing the book as Asuka began humming under her breath and pacing around the room, taking occasional bites of the vegetable in her hand and bobbing her head in time to some unheard rhythm.  
第三适格者看起来有些不确定。“只是……在阅读，”他尴尬地说道，合上书本，此时明日香开始轻声哼唱，在房间里来回踱步，不时咬一口手中的蔬菜，并随着某种未闻的节奏点头。

"…sent from heaven above – that's right – to rock the cradle of love… yes the cradle of love…"  
“……从天而降——没错——摇动爱的摇篮……是的，爱的摇篮……”

"Is there… something you want to talk about?" Shinji asked.  
“你是不是……有什么想聊的？”真嗣问道。

"Why do you say that?" Asuka asked lightly, setting the carrot down and giving him a huge grin.  
"为什么这么说？" 明日香轻声问道，放下手中的胡萝卜，朝他露出了一个灿烂的笑容。

"Well," Shinji murmured as she suddenly wandered around behind him and pretended to play the drums on his shoulders, "you just seem… really happy…"  
"嗯，" 真嗣低声说着，而她突然绕到他身后，假装在他的肩膀上敲打鼓点，"你看起来……真的很开心……"

The redhead leaned on the boy's back, playfully ruffling his hair. "Now ask me why," she whispered into his ear, laughing with delight as the boy blushed and fidgeted in his seat.  
红发少女倚在男孩的背上，调皮地揉乱他的头发。"现在问我为什么，" 她在他耳边低语，笑声中带着喜悦，看着男孩脸红并局促不安地坐在那里。

Shinji nodded, wondering if he had ever seen the girl this affectionate. "Ummm… why are you so happy, Asuka?"  
真嗣点了点头，疑惑自己是否曾见过女孩如此亲昵。“嗯……你为什么这么高兴，明日香？”

The girl sat on the edge of the table and crossed her legs, winking as she gave her reply.  
女孩坐在桌边，双腿交叉，眨眼间给出了回答。

"I've got a date." “我有个约会。”

"Oh," Shinji nodded. "哦," 真嗣点头道。

"That's all you've got to say?" the redhead grinned, leaning closer to the boy. "I've got a real date," she boasted, "doesn't that make you jealous? You'll be stuck here – without even having your little girlfriend – while I'm out having a good time and getting that much closer to real life."  
"你就这点反应？" 红发女孩咧嘴一笑，向男孩凑近了些。"我可是有真正的约会，" 她炫耀道，"你不嫉妒吗？你只能困在这里——连你的小女朋友都没有——而我却在外面玩得开心，离真实生活又近了一步。

Shinji scratched the back of his neck. "I, ummm… how…?" he asked uncertainly.  
真嗣挠了挠后颈。"我，呃……怎么……？" 他不确定地问道。

"What is wrong with you!?" Asuka said with much exasperation. "Look," she started ticking off points on her fingers, "you're born… you go to school… you learn a few things here and there, but nothing real… you get a bit older… you start dating… and then…" she shrugged, her expression indicating that Shinji should already know all of this. "Then people start treating you like a grown-up instead of a child."  
"你到底怎么了！？" 明日香带着极大的不耐烦说道。"听着，" 她开始用手指一一列举，"你出生…你去上学…你学到了一些零碎的东西，但都不是真的…你长大一点…你开始约会…然后…" 她耸了耸肩，表情暗示着真嗣应该已经知道这一切。"然后人们开始把你当作成年人而不是孩子对待。"

Shinji looked skeptical. "Then what?" he asked, paling slightly as he realized how confrontational this question sounded.  
真嗣看起来有些怀疑。"然后呢？" 他问道，脸色微微发白，意识到这个问题听起来有多么挑衅。

"You really are stupid," Asuka sighed pityingly. "When people treat you with respect," she explained patiently, "then they start to rely on you. When they start to rely on you, they start to trust you. And when they trust you… they accept you."  
"你真是太笨了，" 明日香叹了口气，带着怜悯。"当人们开始尊重你，" 她耐心地解释道，"他们就开始依赖你。当他们开始依赖你，他们就开始信任你。而当他们信任你…他们就会接纳你。"

"I see," Shinji said, trying his best to get his mind around just how a date translated into being accepted by adults. He went back over Asuka's steps, frowning slightly as she folded her arms over her stomach and smiled triumphantly. "So if what you're saying is true," he said slowly, "then… should people be accepting me? I don't get it…"  
"我明白了，" 真嗣说道，尽力去理解约会如何转化为被成年人接受。他回想着明日香的步骤，微微皱眉，看着她双臂交叉在腹部，得意地笑了。"所以，如果真像你说的那样，" 他缓缓地说，"那么…人们应该接受我吗？我不明白…"

"Man," Asuka murmured, "you don't, do you?" She stared up at the ceiling for a minute, finding herself on the verge of telling him just who she would be going out with. "Ok," she said finally, grinning as she found an analogy that fit. "Imagine you started dating Misato."  
"天哪，" 明日香低声说，"你还真是不懂啊。" 她抬头盯着天花板，差点就要告诉他她要和谁出去。"好吧，" 她最终说道，咧嘴一笑，找到了一个恰当的比喻。"想象一下，你开始和美里约会了。

Shinji blinked. "I… don't think she's lonely enough…" he muttered uncomfortably.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。"我… 我觉得她还没那么孤单…" 他不安地嘟囔着。

"Oh, there's no doubt that it would be short-lived," the redhead retorted dryly, "but try to picture it. You guys go out… people notice… people start to think, 'hey, maybe that kid is more mature than he looks,' and then – even if they don't realize what they're doing – they start paying more attention to you."  
"哦，毫无疑问，那将是短暂的，"红发女孩干巴巴地反驳道，"但试着想象一下。你们一起出去……人们注意到了……人们开始想，'嘿，也许那孩子比他看起来更成熟'，然后——即使他们没有意识到自己在做什么——他们开始更加关注你。"

"What if I don't want attention?" Shinji whispered.  
"如果我不想引人注意呢？" 真嗣低声说。

"Stay with me here," Asuka rolled her eyes, "they start paying more attention to you, because you're with her, you see? By dating her, you've become… kind of an 'adult in training.'"  
"跟我一起想，"明日香翻了个白眼，"他们开始更加关注你，因为你和她在一起，明白了吗？通过和她约会，你已经变成了……某种'成人训练生'。"

"Ahh," Shinji nodded, another rather aggressive comment slipping out before he could stop it, "So you're just going out tonight so people will notice you?" He prepared himself for an angry reply, sure that the girl would take offense to the idea that she was being manipulative.  
"啊，" 真嗣点了点头，又一句颇为尖锐的话脱口而出，"所以你今晚出去只是为了让别人注意到你吗？" 他准备好迎接愤怒的回应，确信女孩会对这种认为她有操纵意味的想法感到冒犯。

Instead, she smiled, leaning closer to him to whisper, "No, Shinji… I'm going out with him because I want to, and because he wants to go out with me." She leaned back, turning to head for the bathroom as she added, "But I don't think you'd understand that, now would you?"  
然而，她却微笑着，倾身靠近他耳语道："不，真嗣……我跟他出去是因为我想去，也是因为他想和我出去。" 她后退一步，转身朝洗手间走去，边走边补充说："但我想你不会理解这一点，对吧？"

Shinji was totally unprepared for the sudden, intense feeling of shame that slammed into his gut. "Wh-what do you mean?" he managed.  
真嗣完全没料到，一股突如其来的强烈羞愧感猛地击中他的腹部。"你……你什么意思？" 他勉强挤出这句话。

Asuka grinned, so fully intent on displaying her superior knowledge of the world that she never stopped to consider just how cruel her words were. "I think you know what I mean," she said haughtily, "but if you're really that dense, why don't you ask Souske? Oh wait, that's right – from what she says, you don't say much at all." She paused in the doorway, glancing back over her shoulder as she concluded, "Although I guess she doesn't really need you to talk, just have your lips ready to-"  
明日香咧嘴一笑，全神贯注地展示她对世界的优越知识，却从未停下来考虑她的言辞有多么残忍。“我想你知道我的意思，”她傲慢地说，“但如果你真的那么迟钝，为什么不问问 Souske 呢？哦，等等，对了——从她的话来看，你几乎不怎么说话。”她在门口停下，回头瞥了一眼，总结道：“虽然我想她其实不需要你说话，只要你的嘴唇准备好——”

"Don't." “别说了。”

Asuka turned around, surprise lighting her features as Shinji cut her off. "What?"  
明日香转过身来，惊讶地看到真嗣打断了她。“什么？”

"Don't… make her sound cheap," he whispered, unable to meet the girl's inquisitive gaze. "Please, Asuka… she's never done anything to you – don't talk about her like she's dirty… please…?"  
"别…让她听起来廉价，"他低声说道，无法直视女孩探究的目光。"求你了，明日香…她从没对你做过什么——别把她说的那么不堪…求你了…？"

Asuka blushed, recalling the younger girl's cheerful smile and open, honest questions about love and relationships. "Yeah," she murmured quietly, feeling suddenly ashamed, "yeah, ok…"  
明日香脸红了，回想起那个年轻女孩的欢快笑容和关于爱情与关系的坦率真诚的问题。"嗯，"她轻声细语，突然感到羞愧，"嗯，好吧…

"Thank you." "谢谢你。"

The two teens stood silently for a moment, not quite sure what to do. Finally, Asuka murmured, "So, ummm… stay there a second, ok? You can tell me how my dress looks."  
两个少年沉默地站了一会儿，不太确定该做什么。最后，明日香低声说："那么，嗯…你就站在那儿别动，好吗？你可以告诉我这裙子看起来怎么样。"

"Ok…"

Shinji paced around the hallway for several minutes, plucking absently at a loose thread on his shirt. _I should be mad right now,_ he thought, frowning slightly, I should try to protect my girlfriend, shouldn't I? I mean, that's what guys do, right? He stopped pacing and sat down on the floor, leaning his head back against the wall and closing his eyes. I'm not really her boyfriend though, he told himself, she wanted to be my girlfriend, but I never said…  
真嗣在走廊里来回踱步了几分钟，心不在焉地扯着衬衫上的一根松线。我现在应该生气才对，他皱着眉头想，我应该保护我的女朋友，不是吗？我的意思是，这是男生该做的，对吧？他停止踱步，坐在地上，将头靠在墙上，闭上了眼睛。但我并不是她真正的男朋友，他告诉自己，她想成为我的女朋友，但我从未说过……

He sighed. 他叹了口气。

"Keeps getting hollower, every… single… time…" he muttered.  
"越来越空洞了，每一次…每一次…" 他喃喃自语。

"Hey," Asuka's voice called, "how do I look?"  
"嘿，" 明日香的声音传来，"我看起来怎么样？"

Shinji opened his eyes… and found his jaw dropping open.  
真嗣睁开眼睛…发现自己的下巴都快掉下来了。

"Hmmm," Asuka hummed, smiling with satisfaction, "guess that means I look ok."  
"嗯哼，"明日香哼了一声，满意地笑着，"看来我看起来还不错。"

Shinji just nodded. Speech, he knew, would be patently impossible, and with a touch of shame, he suddenly realized he had very good reason to be jealous of the redhead's date. Instead of red (Shinji always associated Asuka with red) the Second Child wore a calf-length black dress, boasting a slit up to the knee on the left side to allow for freedom of movement. He swallowed, trying not to stare at the girl's smooth, flawless shoulders, exposed by the dress's elegant cut.  
真嗣只是点了点头。他知道，此刻言语显然是不可能的，带着一丝羞愧，他突然意识到自己有充分的理由嫉妒红发女孩的约会对象。与往常总是与红色联系在一起的明日香不同（真嗣总是将明日香与红色联系在一起），第二适格者穿着一条及膝的黑色连衣裙，左侧开叉至膝盖，以便于活动自如。他咽了口口水，尽量不去盯着女孩光滑无瑕的肩膀，那是由连衣裙优雅的剪裁所露出的。

"Wait until I get my makeup on," Asuka winked, holding her arms over her chest to keep the arms of the dress in place.  
"等我化好妆再说，"明日香眨了眨眼，双臂交叉在胸前，以保持裙子的袖子位置。

"Y-yeah," Shinji stammered.  
"嗯，嗯，" 真嗣结巴着回答。

"Zip me up?" the girl asked, turning around and holding her long, red hair up off her shoulders. "Don't get any funny ideas," she teased, "I'm only asking you because Misato's not home."  
"帮我拉上拉链好吗？" 女孩转过身，将她那头长长的红发从肩上撩起。"别想歪了，" 她打趣道，"只是因为美里不在家我才找你帮忙的。"

"Sure," Shinji replied, walking over and reaching out with hands that were suddenly shaking.  
"当然可以，" 真嗣回答道，走过去伸出手，却发现自己的手突然开始颤抖。

"Listen," Asuka whispered suddenly, not noticing that she made him jump. "About what I said earlier – about Souske and all… I'm… I'm sorry. You're right, Shinji… she's not cheap or dirty. That was mean…"  
"听着，" 明日香突然低声说道，没注意到她的话让他吓了一跳。"关于我之前说的——关于宗介和所有的事……我……我很抱歉。你说得对，真嗣……她并不廉价或肮脏。那话太刻薄了……"

"It's ok," Shinji replied quietly, grasping the tab lightly with his thumb and forefinger and trying not to notice the lacy strapless bra that peeked tantalizingly out from the parted fabric.  
"没关系，" 真嗣轻声回应，用拇指和食指轻轻捏住拉链头，尽量不去注意那从分开的布料中若隐若现的蕾丝无肩带胸罩。

Asuka tilted her head forward, smiling softly as the zipper slowly slipped up her back. _Maybe Kaji can give him a few lessons,_ she thought, feeling slightly dizzy as she realized that her date would begin in less than an hour. _Want me to ask him, Souske? I'll bet Kaji could turn your boyfriend into a real lady-killer. Not that_ I _would ever go for him – huh uh! – I'll take my Kaji, thank you. After tonight…_ her smile became even softer, after tonight, he'll know that I'm not just a child.  
明日香微微低头，随着背后的拉链缓缓上升，她温柔地笑了。也许卡吉可以教他几招，她想，意识到约会将在不到一小时后开始，她感到有些眩晕。要我问问他吗，宗介？我敢打赌卡吉能把你的男朋友变成真正的情场高手。并不是说我对他有兴趣——哼，才不呢！——我要我的卡吉，谢谢。今晚之后……她的笑容更加温柔了，今晚之后，他会知道我不是个孩子。

Kaji sighed as he rang Misato's doorbell. Why am I here again? he thought tiredly, Oh yeah… that's right – I'm stupid.  
Kaji 叹了口气，按响了 Misato 家的门铃。我为什么又来这里了？他疲惫地想，哦对了……没错——我就是个傻瓜。

Taking a glance at his watch, he muttered, "The reception's probably in full swing about now… bet Misato's hammered – she never did have much of a tolerance for seeing others happy…"  
他瞥了一眼手表，喃喃自语道：“现在宴会大概正热闹着呢……我打赌 Misato 肯定喝高了——她从来就见不得别人开心……”

He frowned as Asuka's voice reached him through the door.  
听到门后 Asuka 的声音，他皱起了眉头。

"Go in the other room! Geez, stop hovering – you're not clever you know!"  
"去另一个房间！天哪，别老在这儿晃悠——你以为自己很聪明吗！"

Shinji's voice, sounding flustered, replied, "I wasn't spying – you forgot your, ummm… this thing…"  
真嗣的声音听起来有些慌张，回答道：“我没有偷听——是你忘了拿，呃……这个东西……”

"It's called a shawl," the redhead grumbled, "don't show your ignorance." There was a brief pause. "Thanks… and don't pout!"  
"这叫披肩，"红发女孩嘟囔着，"别显得那么无知。"短暂的停顿后，她又说："谢谢……还有，别撅嘴了！"

Kaji bowed politely as the door opened. "Miss Souryu," he said formally, "are you ready?"  
门打开时，薰礼貌地鞠了一躬。“惣流小姐，”他正式地说，“您准备好了吗？”

When he raised his eyes, he found Asuka smiling at him… or rather, a gorgeous young woman that looked vaguely like Asuka, smiling at him. "I am," the redhead said coolly, offering him her hand, "and may I say… you look very nice tonight, Ryouji."  
当他抬起眼睛时，他发现明日香正对着他微笑……或者更确切地说，是一位与明日香有些相似的美丽年轻女子正对着他微笑。“我准备好了，”这位红发女子冷静地说，向他伸出手，“而且，我得说……今晚你看起来非常帅气，薰。”

Shaking himself, the man took Asuka's hand, raising it to his lips and kissing it briefly. "Thank you, Miss Souryu," he said quietly, "you look pretty good yourself."  
男子回过神来，握住明日香的手，将其举至唇边，轻轻一吻。“谢谢您，惣流小姐，”他轻声说道，“您今晚也非常漂亮。”

A faint blush appeared on the girl's cheeks as she reclaimed her hand, taking in Kaji's formal dress uniform. "Did you come straight from work?" she asked, closing the door and stepping into the hallway.  
女孩的脸颊上泛起淡淡的红晕，她收回手，打量着卡吉的正式军装。“你是直接从工作岗位过来的吗？”她问着，关上门，走进了走廊。

Kaji shrugged apologetically. "I told you," he said calmly, "I'm always working."  
卡吉带着歉意耸了耸肩。“我告诉过你，”他平静地说，“我总是在工作。”

Asuka grinned. "Well I hope you can take an hour or two to be pleased…" she blushed as the man blinked. "Um… I mean… not like _that_! I was just saying… an hour or two too… have fun – but not like…" She sighed. "Forget it…"  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“我希望你能抽出一两个小时来享受……”她脸红了一下，因为那个男人眨了眨眼。“呃……我的意思是……不是那种享受！我只是说……一两个小时……玩得开心——但不是那种……”她叹了口气。“算了……”

"I understand," Kaji assured her, relaxing slightly.  
"我明白了，" 薰向她保证，身体稍微放松了些。

_That was too weird,_ he thought, gesturing for the girl to precede him down the hall, for a minute there, it was like she was a whole different person… and it was a little… hot. He smiled to himself. _Not so hot that anything would happen, but close._  
真是太奇怪了，他想，示意女孩先他一步走进走廊，有那么一会儿，她仿佛变成了另一个人……而且还有点……性感。他暗自笑了笑。虽然不会发生什么，但已经很接近了。

"So," Asuka said lightly as they entered the elevator, "what should I expect for the evening, Mister Kaji?"  
"那么，" 明日香轻松地说，他们走进电梯时，"今晚我该期待些什么呢，薰先生？"

"Hmmm," Kaji pushed the button for the first floor, standing next to the redhead and folding his arms. "I think we agreed on dinner, right?" he asked quietly, waiting for her to nod before commenting, "Yeah, I thought so… so I made reservations at _The_ _Midnight_ Frost Cafe." He paused, arching an eyebrow. "Does that sound acceptable to you?"  
"嗯哼，" 加持按下了去一楼的按钮，站在红发女子旁边，双臂交叉。"我想我们约好了吃晚饭，对吧？" 他轻声问道，等她点头后才继续说，"是啊，我就知道……所以我预订了午夜霜冻咖啡馆。" 他停顿了一下，挑起一边眉毛。"你觉得这样可以吗？

The redhead was having a hard time concealing her enthusiasm. "That sounds… fine," she said, trying not to grin like an idiot as she imagined what the most talked about restaurant in Tokyo-3 might look like, "do they, ummm… have dancing there?"  
红发女子很难掩饰自己的兴奋。"听起来……不错，" 她说着，尽量不让自己像个傻瓜一样咧嘴笑，想象着东京-3 最热门的餐厅可能是什么样子，"他们，呃……那里有跳舞的地方吗？

Kaji came very close to laughing. The Midnight Frost, in addition to being known for its fine cuisine, was reputed to have the most spacious dance floor available, with room enough for one hundred couples to dance until their feet grew sore and never have to worry about colliding with others.  
加持差点笑出声来。午夜霜冻咖啡馆不仅以其精致的美食闻名，还以其宽敞的舞池而著称，足够容纳一百对情侣跳舞跳到脚酸，却不用担心会与其他人相撞。

"I believe they do have dancing," he nodded, unable to keep from smiling. "Will I have the pleasure?"  
"我相信他们确实有舞蹈，"他点头说道，忍不住露出微笑。"我有幸能邀请你吗？"

Asuka's attempt at an indifferent, "Perhaps," was ruined by the note of giddiness in her voice. "I suppose we'll just see what the evening brings, won't we?"  
明日香试图装作无所谓的样子，"或许吧，"但声音中的兴奋感出卖了她。"我想我们只能看看今晚会有什么惊喜了，不是吗？"

"I suppose so." "应该是这样。"

The elevator arrived at the ground floor and they exited, walking to Kaji's Trueno Hachi Roku in silence. "Thank you very much," Asuka smiled as he opened the door for her, "such a gentleman."  
电梯抵达一楼，他们默默地走了出来，朝加持的 Trueno Hachi Roku 走去。"非常感谢，"明日香微笑着，当他为她打开车门时，"真是个绅士。

"Only to the ladies," Kaji muttered, closing the door and walking around to his side. "Which reminds me… you should buckle up – I'm the one that taught Misato how to drive.  
只对女士如此，"加持嘟囔着，关上车门，绕到自己的座位。"这让我想起……你应该系好安全带——是我教美里怎么开车的。

Asuka laughed… but fastened her belt all the same.  
明日香笑了……但还是系上了安全带。

The drive to the restaurant was filled with idle small talk and silence as the couple tried their best to find a comfortable medium between harmless flirtation and quiet coolness. Leaving the car with the valet, they started up the stairs, both impressed by the establishment's imposing exterior.  
前往餐厅的路上，两人在闲聊与沉默间努力寻找着一种介于无害调情与静谧冷淡之间的舒适平衡。将车交给泊车员后，他们开始登上楼梯，都被这家店气势恢宏的外观所震撼。

"Very avant-garde," Kaji said approvingly, "an entirely isolated Feudal Japanese Pagoda, right in the heart of Tokyo-3."  
“非常前卫，”薰赞许地说，“一座完全独立的封建日本式塔楼，就在东京-3 的中心。”

"I heard that some people dress up to come here," Asuka commented, trying to act casual as she stepped closer to him and slipped an arm around his, "see?"  
“我听说有些人会盛装来这里，”明日香评论道，她故作随意地靠近他，挽起他的手臂，“看吧？”

Kaji smiled softly at the girl's attempt to distract him by pointing to a rather ornately garbed couple. "Uh huh," he said quietly, putting his free hand on her arm, "they look like they belong here."  
卡吉温和地对女孩试图通过指向一对穿着相当华丽服饰的夫妇来分散他的注意力微笑。“嗯哼，”他轻声说道，用空着的手搭在她的手臂上，“他们看起来确实属于这里。”

"Y-yeah," Asuka stammered, flushing at his light touch. "So, ummm… should we go in?"  
“是-是的，”明日香结巴着说，因他轻触而脸红。“那，呃……我们应该进去吗？”

"Indeed we should," the man agreed, wondering suddenly what Misato would say if she saw them.  
“确实应该，”男子同意道，突然好奇如果美里看到他们会说什么。

_She'd probably try to joke about it,_ he thought as they made their way to the building's entrance and gave the host his name, _But she'd understand after I explained why – she knows how Asuka feels… she'd know this is the best way to-_  
他想着，她大概会试图开个玩笑，当他们走向大楼入口并向接待员报上名字时，但解释原因后她会理解的——她知道明日香的心情……她会明白这是最好的方式——

"Kaji…?" “加持…？”

"Hmm?" Kaji turned to find Asuka looking up at him with open adoration.  
“嗯？”加持转过身，发现明日香正仰望着他，眼中满是崇拜。

"You really do look great tonight…" the redhead murmured, slowly taking his hand and bringing it to her lips for a soft, light kiss. "Thanks for giving me a shot."  
"你今晚看起来真的很棒……" 红发女子低声说道，缓缓握住他的手，将其带到唇边，轻轻地吻了一下。"谢谢你给我这个机会。"

"Sure," Kaji replied, acting as casual as he could as several people gave him disapproving stares. "Just remember, this is so we can get to know each other better… so, ummm… you don't have to do that again."  
"当然，" 卡吉回答道，尽可能表现得漫不经心，尽管有几个人向他投来不赞成的目光。"只是要记住，这是为了让我们更好地了解彼此……所以，嗯……你不必再那样做了。"

Asuka blushed, releasing his hand and lowering her gaze as the host motioned for them to follow. "O-ok… sorry…"  
明日香脸红了，松开他的手，垂下目光，这时主持人示意他们跟上。"好…好的…对不起…"

They made their way to a rather out of the way table, both of them smiling as they found it arranged in the classic Japanese style.  
他们走向一张相当偏僻的桌子，两人都面带微笑，发现它布置成了经典的日式风格。

"Well, I'd love to pull your chair out for you," Kaji said dryly as he knelt on one side of the table, "you'll have to forgive me."  
“嗯，我很想为你拉开椅子，”卡吉干巴巴地说道，同时跪在桌子的一侧，“你得原谅我。”

"Understandable," she grinned, carefully arranging her dress for modesty as she knelt, "Of course, this does make it easier if, you know, you wanted to dance later…"  
“可以理解，”她咧嘴一笑，小心翼翼地整理着裙子以保持端庄，同时跪下，“当然，如果你之后想跳舞，这样确实更方便……”

Kaji smiled as a waiter materialized at his side. "We'll both have the porterhouse," he told the man easily, "And a nice red wine, I'd think."  
加治微笑着，一位服务员悄然出现在他身旁。“我们俩都要带骨牛排，”他轻松地对那人说，“再来一瓶不错的红酒，我想。”

"Do you have a preference on the wine sir?" the waiter asked, ignoring Asuka entirely.  
“先生，您对红酒有什么偏好吗？”服务员问道，完全忽略了明日香。

Kaji shrugged. "Surprise me," he winked, "but keep in mind I have a house payment."  
加治耸了耸肩。“给我个惊喜吧，”他眨眼道，“但别忘了我还有房贷要还。”

"Yes sir," the waiter chuckled, "I'll be right back, then."  
"是，先生，"服务员笑着说，"我这就回来。"

"Something wrong?" Kaji asked as Asuka fiddled with one of her chopsticks, a light rose hue on her cheeks.  
"有什么问题吗？" 加持问道，此时明日香正摆弄着她的筷子，脸颊上泛起淡淡的红晕。

"No one's ever… ordered for me…" she said quietly, "it's just kinda… strange."  
"从来没人……替我点过菜……" 她轻声说，"感觉有点……奇怪。"

Kaji cleared his throat. "Sorry about that," he sighed, "force of habit." He smiled. "I just forgot for a minute that this isn't a date."  
加持清了清嗓子。“抱歉，”他叹了口气，“习惯使然。”他微笑着说，“我只是一时忘了这不是约会。”

Asuka's blush intensified as she looked down at the table, carefully arranging her flatware in a neat line. "I wouldn't mind if you forgot again…" she whispered.  
明日香的脸颊愈发绯红，她低头看着桌子，小心翼翼地将餐具排列成一条直线。“如果你再忘记一次，我也不介意……”她轻声细语。

Kaji took a sip of his water, declining to reply.  
加持喝了一口水，没有回应。

They sat quietly for a few minutes, looking around at the décor until the waiter reappeared, bearing a bottle of wine. "Will this be acceptable, sir?" he asked smoothly, cradling the bottle in his palms and showing it to Kaji.  
他们静静地坐了几分钟，环顾四周的装饰，直到服务员再次出现，手里拿着一瓶葡萄酒。“先生，这个可以吗？”他流畅地问道，双手捧着瓶子向卡吉展示。

Kaji peered intently at the label, studying the date and vineyard for a moment before nodding. "Excellent," he said firmly, deciding not to insist going through the entire presentation of the wine for the sake of time and comfort. "You may serve us."  
卡吉专注地盯着标签，查看日期和葡萄园片刻后点头。“很好，”他坚定地说，决定为了时间和舒适不坚持走完整个葡萄酒展示流程。“你可以为我们服务了。”

"Very good, sir." “非常好，先生。”

Kaji smiled as Asuka's discomfort seemed to grow, until she was shifting from side to side by the time the wine was poured. As soon as the waiter took his leave, Kaji observed, "You don't like the way I talk to him."  
加持笑着看明日香的不自在似乎在加剧，直到酒被倒好时，她已经开始左右挪动。服务员一离开，加持便观察道：“你不喜欢我跟他那样说话。”

Asuka took her glass, staring into it for a moment before whispering, "I know that this is a nice restaurant… and I know that this is the way people talk in a nice restaurant… but it just… I don't think I could ever do it, that's all…"  
明日香拿起酒杯，凝视了一会儿，然后低声说：“我知道这是一家不错的餐厅……我也知道在好餐厅里人们就是这样说话的……但就是……我觉得我永远也做不到，仅此而已……”

Kaji shrugged as the girl took a tentative sip from her glass. "You know something?" he asked lightly, "I don't really like it either, but they expect it… and I think they'd be a little offended if I wasn't at least a little uppity."  
女孩小心翼翼地抿了一口酒后，加持耸了耸肩。“你知道吗？”他轻描淡写地问，“其实我也不太喜欢这样，但他们期待如此……我想如果我不表现得稍微高傲一点，他们可能会有些不悦。”

Some of the tension left Asuka's shoulders as she took another, longer sip. "I guess you're right," she admitted, running her tongue over her lips, "I just-"  
阿苏卡的肩膀上有些紧张感消退了，她又喝了一大口。“我想你是对的，”她承认道，用舌头舔了舔嘴唇，“我只是-”

"Is it that good?" 有那么好喝吗？

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

Kaji leaned a little closer. "You've finished half a glass already… is it really that good?" He laughed as the redhead stared at her glass, her eyes wide. "I never knew you were such a heavy drinker," Kaji winked, "maybe you've been spending too much time with Katsuragi."  
卡吉稍微靠近了一些。“你已经喝掉半杯了……真的那么好喝吗？”他笑着说，红发女孩瞪大了眼睛看着自己的杯子。“我从来不知道你这么能喝，”卡吉眨了眨眼，“也许你和葛城待在一起太久了。”

"I'm German," Asuka muttered, bristling slightly at the mention of her guardian's name and emptying the glass in one long draught. "I can handle it."  
"我是德国人，" 明日香嘟囔着，一提到她的监护人的名字就有些不悦，一口气喝干了杯中的酒。"我能应付。"

The pony-tailed man shook his head and sighed as she held her glass out to him.  
那位扎着马尾的男人摇了摇头，叹了口气，因为明日香正向他伸出手中的杯子。

"More, please." "请再来点。"

"So you did have a boyfriend?"  
"那么你确实有男朋友了？"

Asuka shrugged, grasping a bit of steak with her chopsticks and popping it into her mouth before replying, "I wouldn't call him my boyfriend, but I'm sure he'd call me his girlfriend."  
明日香耸了耸肩，用筷子夹起一小块牛排送入口中，然后回答道：“我不会称他为我的男朋友，但我肯定他会称我为他的女朋友。”

Kaji nodded, resting his elbows on the table and leaning closer to her. "Why didn't I ever know about this?" he asked, "I was your guardian – I should know these things." He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "You deliberately withheld information, Miss Souryu."  
加持点了点头，将手肘放在桌上，身体向她倾斜。“为什么我从来不知道这件事？”他问道，“我是你的监护人——我应该知道这些事情。”他压低声音，用一种密谋的口吻说：“你故意隐瞒了信息，惣流小姐。”

"Oh please," Asuka snorted, taking a sip of wine to clear her mouth, "we went to the movies once and he held my hand at commencement – it's not like I was sleeping with him, Mister Kaji."  
"哦，拜托，" 明日香嗤之以鼻，喝了一口酒来清清口，"我们就一起去看过一次电影，开场时他握了我的手——又不是我和他上床了，卡吉先生。

"Did you kiss him?" the man asked, his eyes twinkling with mischief.  
"那你亲他了吗？" 男人问道，眼中闪烁着调皮的光芒。

"No!" Asuka shook her head for emphasis. "He tried to kiss me, but fortunately I saw it coming and turned my head in time." She took another bite of her dinner. "I've never kis-"  
"没有！" 明日香用力摇头强调。"他想吻我，但幸好我预见到了，及时转过头去。" 她又吃了一口晚餐。"我从来没亲——

Kaji smiled as she cut herself off, taking another drink and averting her eyes.  
Kaji 微笑着打断了自己，又喝了一口，移开了视线。

"Dance with me." 和我跳支舞吧。

He sighed as the girl abruptly stood. "Are you sure you're up to it? You look a little wobbly."  
女孩突然站起来时，他叹了口气。“你确定你能行吗？你看起来有点摇摇晃晃的。”

"I'm fine," the redhead insisted, grinning broadly as he got to his feet, "sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not drunk enough for you to take advantage of me just yet."  
"我没事，"红发少年坚持道，一边咧嘴笑着站起来，"抱歉让你失望了，但我还没醉到让你有机可乘的地步。"

Kaji rolled his eyes, smiling in spite of himself as he muttered, "Who would be taking advantage of who?"  
加持翻了个白眼，尽管如此还是忍不住笑了，低声嘀咕道："谁占谁便宜还不一定呢？"

Asuka laughed with delight, taking his hand and leading him to the dance floor. She smiled, sliding willingly into his arms and letting her body move with the music. "That's better…" she hummed, resisting the temptation to rest her head on his chest. "Hey," she said softly, allowing herself the luxury of putting her arms on his back, "you're not too bad, Ryouji…"  
明日香开心地笑了，拉着他的手走向舞池。她微笑着，顺从地滑入他的怀抱，随着音乐摇摆身体。"这样好多了……"她轻哼着，忍住将头靠在他胸前的冲动。"嘿，"她轻声说，放纵自己将手臂搭在他的背上，"你也不赖嘛，真嗣……

"Thanks," Kaji said quietly, "you're not too bad yourself."  
"谢谢，" 卡吉轻声说道，"你自己也不赖。"

_So much for keeping things friendly,_ he thought as the girl beamed at him, time to call it a night.  
看来保持友好是不可能了，他心想，女孩对他灿烂一笑，是时候结束今晚了。

They moved in slow circles, maintaining the silence that had fallen between them until the song ended.  
他们缓缓地转着圈，保持着两人间降临的沉默，直到歌曲结束。

"Thank you for the dance," Asuka bowed formally as the music died down, "may I have another, please?"  
"谢谢你陪我跳舞，" 音乐渐息，明日香正式地鞠了一躬，"能再跳一支吗？"

"Actually," Kaji said apologetically, watching her face closely for any sign of anger or pouting, "I have to get going…"  
"其实，" 加持带着歉意说道，目光紧盯着她的脸，寻找任何愤怒或噘嘴的迹象，"我得走了……"

A flash of frustration passed over the girl's features, but vanished in an instant as she nodded. "I understand," she said quietly, feeling very proud that she was being so mature about things, "walk me home? We're not that far… and I don't think you should drive just yet mister, 'It's only three glasses.'"  
女孩脸上闪过一丝挫败，但转瞬即逝，她点了点头。"我明白，" 她轻声说，内心为自己如此成熟地处理事情感到自豪，"送我回家好吗？我们离得不远……而且我想你还不该开车，先生，'才喝了三杯而已。'

"Not that far?" Kaji echoed, "It's gotta be two or three miles, Asuka."  
"没那么远吧？" 加持重复道，"得有两三英里呢，明日香。"

"Come on," Asuka chided, "you're not _that_ out of shape, are you? It'll be nice…" she smiled, lowering her voice, "we can talk… get to know each other…"  
"得了吧，" 明日香责备道，"你不会那么缺乏锻炼吧？会很惬意的…" 她微笑着，压低声音，"我们可以聊天…互相了解…"

_It's really not THAT far…_ Kaji thought as the redhead started back towards the table, and she's right… I did have a bit more than I planned – can't go pulling strings to get DUI tickets fixed all the time, now can I?  
其实真的没那么远… 加持心想，看着红发女子转身朝桌子走去，她说的对…我确实喝得比计划多了点——总不能老是靠关系来解决酒驾罚单，对吧？

"Besides," he muttered to himself, "this will give you more time to tell her that it's not going to work out."  
"再说，" 他自言自语道，"这会给你更多时间告诉她，这行不通。"

He paid the bill in cash, leaving a healthy tip as Asuka polished off the last of her glass of wine, and together they headed out into the night.  
他用现金结了账，留下丰厚的小费，此时明日香喝完了最后一口葡萄酒，两人一同走进夜色中。

It only took three blocks for him to figure out that Asuka was drunk.  
只走了三个街区，他就意识到明日香已经醉了。

"Mmmm…" she sighed, "isn't it romantic tonight?" She smiled, looking up into the sky with a dreamy expression. "Look," she said happily, "it's a full moon."  
"嗯……" 她轻叹一声，"今晚是不是很浪漫？" 她微笑着，抬头望向天空，眼神中带着梦幻。"看，" 她开心地说，"是满月呢。"

"Not quite," Kaji mumbled, wondering if it was just his imagination, or if the girl really was swaying as she walked. "I think it's only three quarters."  
"不见得，" 卡吉嘟囔着，不知道是自己的错觉还是那女孩真的在摇晃着走路。"我觉得只是个上弦月。"

"You're so smart," the redhead smiled, reaching into the small purse she had with her, "want some gum?"  
"你真聪明，" 红发女孩笑着，伸手从随身的小包里掏出东西，"要来点口香糖吗？"

"No thanks…" "不了，谢谢…"

"Your loss," Asuka shrugged, slowly unwrapping a piece and popping it into her mouth. "Much better," she said, "I was tasting all steaky…"  
"那你就亏了，" 明日香耸耸肩，慢慢拆开一片放入口中。"好吃多了，" 她说，"刚才的味道全是肉味…"

"Steaky?" Kaji repeated, wondering how much further the apartment was. "Steak-like?"  
"肉味？" 加持重复道，心里琢磨着离公寓还有多远。"像牛排的味道？"

"Steaky," Asuka nodded, wavering a bit as this movement caused her balance to shift. "Oh no!" she cried suddenly.  
"斯蒂基，" 明日香点了点头，身体微微摇晃，这个动作让她的平衡发生了变化。"哦不！" 她突然惊叫道。

"What? What's wrong?" Kaji asked concernedly.  
"怎么了？出什么事了？" 加持关切地问道。

Asuka's face was heavy. "I swallowed my gum."  
明日香的脸色沉重。"我把口香糖吞下去了。"

Kaji sighed as the girl grinned at him.  
加治叹了口气，那女孩却对他咧嘴一笑。

"Sorry," she giggled, stumbling slightly as they continued on their way, "guess I… had one too many…"  
“对不起，”她咯咯笑着，走路时有些踉跄，“我猜……我喝得太多了……”

Kaji pursed his lips, but before he could reply, the redhead tried taking another step. "Careful!" he cried, stepping forward and catching the girl as she started to topple.  
加治抿紧嘴唇，但还没等他回答，红发女孩又试图迈出一步。“小心！”他喊道，上前一步，扶住了即将倒下的女孩。

"Mmmm…" Asuka hummed, letting him support her, "you're so strong… God, I love that…" She smiled drunkenly up at him, a slight slur in her speech as she murmured, "And you look so damn good!" Abruptly, she shook her head, pulling back from his supporting arms. "Sorry," she managed, putting her right hand on her head, "I guess I really did have a few, huh?"  
"嗯……" 明日香哼了一声，任由他支撑着自己，"你真强壮……天哪，我就喜欢这样……" 她醉眼朦胧地抬头朝他微笑，说话略带含糊，"而且你看起来真他妈帅！" 突然，她摇了摇头，从他的扶持中抽身出来。"抱歉，" 她勉强说道，右手扶着额头，"看来我真的喝多了，对吧？

Kaji said nothing, watching closely as the redhead tottered a few more steps before deciding what needed to be done.  
加持一言不发，密切注视着红发女子又踉跄了几步，然后决定必须采取行动。

"Next time," Asuka yawned, wobbling slightly on her feet, "one glass." She smiled, starting to turn towards her date. "So," she began, "do you think… there's going to be a next-wha!"  
"下次，" 明日香打了个哈欠，脚步有些不稳，"就喝一杯。" 她微笑着，开始转向她的约会对象。"那么，" 她开口道，"你觉得……还会有下次吗——啊！

"Stop." "停下。"

Asuka nodded as she found herself leaning against Kaji for support once more. "S-sorry," she stammered, trying to pull back, "I'm trying, Ryouji, I really am. You have to belie-" She let out a short yelp as Kaji quickly leaned down, slipping one arm under her knees and the other around her back, hoisting her easily into the air. Instinctively, she threw her arms around his neck, closing her eyes out of the reflexive fear of being dropped.  
明日香点了点头，发现自己再次不自觉地靠在加持身上寻求支撑。“对-对不起，”她结巴着，试图后退，“我在努力，加持，我真的在努力。你得相信——”她发出一声短促的惊叫，因为加持迅速弯下腰，一只手臂伸到她的膝下，另一只手臂环抱她的背部，轻松地将她抱起。出于本能，她双臂环住他的脖子，闭上眼睛，出于反射性的恐惧，担心自己会被摔落。

"I won't let you go."  
“我不会让你掉下去的。”

Sky blue eyes slowly opened, allowing the redhead an unobstructed view of Kaji's concerned, but smiling face. Just a little closer, she thought, her head spinning, just… a few inches, and…  
天蓝色的眼睛缓缓睁开，让红发少女得以清晰地看到加持那关切却带着微笑的面庞。再近一点，她心想，头有些晕眩，就…几英寸，然后…

Kaji froze, caught completely off guard as the girl in his arms began drifting closer, her eyes closing once more even as her lips parted. Ten inches. Eight. Five. Two. Asuka's mouth was less than an inch from his when she finally halted, allowing him to smell the sweet mixture of alcohol and gum on her breath. Everything stopped as the girl's eyes opened.  
卡吉僵住了，完全措手不及，怀中的女孩开始向他靠近，她的眼睛再次闭上，嘴唇微微张开。十英寸。八英寸。五英寸。两英寸。当她终于停下时，明日香的嘴唇离他的不到一英寸，让他闻到了她呼吸中酒精和口香糖的甜美混合味道。一切都停止了，女孩的眼睛睁开了。

"You don't know how bad I want to kiss you right now…"  
“你不知道我现在有多想吻你……”

Though he had not thought it possible, Kaji tensed even more. "Asuk-"  
尽管他觉得这不可能，卡吉还是更加紧张了。“明日香-”

"I want you to be my first," Asuka continued, showing no sign that she had heard his attempt to protest, "my first kiss, my first touch, my first… everything. God, I want it all, Ryouji…" Slowly, carefully, she leaned to the side, resting her head on his shoulder and closing her eyes as she whispered, "But I want it to be right… I want it to be because you want me too." A small smile appeared on her lips. "I want it to be because you want me too…"  
"我想让你成为我的第一个，"明日香继续说道，丝毫没有表现出她听到了他试图抗议的迹象，"我的初吻，我的初次触碰，我的第一次…一切。天哪，我想要这一切，Ryouji…"她慢慢地，小心翼翼地向一侧倾斜，将头靠在他的肩膀上，闭上眼睛轻声说道，"但我想让它变得正确…我想让它发生是因为你也想要我。"她的唇边浮现出一丝微笑。"我想让它发生是因为你也想要我…"

Kaji found himself at a loss for words. "Asuka," he said finally, wetting his lips.  
加持发现自己无言以对。"明日香，"他终于开口，舔了舔嘴唇。

"Hmmm…?" the redhead hummed, shifting slightly in his arms to get closer to him.  
"嗯…？"红发女孩哼了一声，在他的怀里稍微动了动，以便更靠近他。

Again, the man fumbled for words, trying to figure out a way to say what he was thinking without damaging the fragile creature cradled in his arms. He blinked in surprise as he felt her body relaxing, then let out a soft sigh of relief as he realized, She's asleep…  
男人再次结巴着寻找措辞，试图在不伤害怀中脆弱生灵的情况下表达自己的想法。他惊讶地眨了眨眼，感觉到她的身体正在放松，随后轻轻松了口气，意识到：她睡着了……

For over five minutes he stood holding Asuka's limp body, feeling her ever-deepening breath blowing against his neck and staring up at the nearly-full moon in silent contemplation.  
他就这样抱着明日香瘫软的身体站了五分多钟，感受着她愈发深沉的呼吸拂过自己的颈项，默默地凝视着几乎圆满的月亮沉思。

Shinji looked up from his homework as the doorbell sounded. "Can't be Chidori," he murmured to himself, pushing back from the table, "Misses Souske would never let her out this late – especially if she knew she was coming to see me." He paled slightly as he started for the door, a sudden, vivid image of Chidori's tear-streaked face flashing through his mind.  
听到门铃声，真嗣从作业中抬起头来。“不可能是千鸟，”他自言自语道，从桌边推开，“宗介小姐绝不会让她这么晚出来——尤其是如果她知道她是来找我的话。”他走向门口时脸色微微发白，脑海中突然闪过千鸟泪流满面的生动画面。

_Maybe she ran away,_ he thought wildly, pausing in the foyer, _no! Come on! She loves her mom… she loves her… why WOULD she run away? She's got no reason!_  
也许她逃跑了，他疯狂地想着，在大厅里停下脚步，不！别这样！她爱她的妈妈……她爱她……她为什么要逃跑？她没有理由啊！

He shook his head, hearing her voice cry, 'I just had to be with you! Please let me stay here!'  
他摇了摇头，听到她的声音哭喊着：'我只是想和你在一起！请让我留在这里！'

Taking a deep breath, he yanked the door open… and found the incredibly implausible thought of Chidori running away from home blasted into oblivion as he found an even more incredible sight waiting for him.  
他深吸一口气，猛地拉开门……发现关于千鸟离家出走的不可思议的想法瞬间化为乌有，因为他看到了一个更加不可思议的景象在等待着他。

"Think you might be willing to step aside?" Kaji asked with a note of irritation in his voice. "She's not that heavy, but I've been walking awhile."  
"觉得你可能会愿意让一下吗？" 薰带着一丝不耐烦问道，"她没那么重，但我已经走了一会儿了。"

"Yeah!" Shinji said, quickly getting out of the way, "Sure, sorry!"  
"好的！" 真嗣迅速让开，"当然，抱歉！"

"Katsuragi still out?" Kaji asked quickly, his eyes darting around the apartment as he walked towards the living room.  
"葛城还在外面吗？" 薰迅速问道，他的目光在公寓里四处扫视，朝着客厅走去。

"Yeah," Shinji said, astutely picking up on the concern in the older man's voice, "She called and said she was going to sleep at Doctor Akagi's apartment because she was too dr- ummm… she was having fun…" He blushed as Kaji stopped, glancing over his shoulder.  
"嗯，" 真嗣敏锐地察觉到年长男子声音中的担忧，"她打电话来说要在赤木博士的公寓过夜，因为她玩得太晚了……呃……她玩得很开心……" 他脸红起来，因为加持停下脚步，回头瞥了他一眼。

"I see," Kaji sighed, continuing into the living room and carefully laying the redhead on the couch. "Listen," he said softly, arranging her in a slightly elevated position, "I don't really have time to be subtle with you, Shinji, so I'll tell you flat out: Asuka's had a lot to drink, and I'm worried that she's going to be sick… but I can't stay here with her because I have some important business I have to take care of."  
"我明白了，" 加持叹了口气，继续走进客厅，小心翼翼地将红发女孩放在沙发上。"听着，" 他轻声说道，将她调整到一个略微抬高的姿势，"我没时间跟你拐弯抹角，真嗣，我就直说了：明日香喝了很多酒，我担心她会吐……但我不能留在这里陪她，因为我还有些重要的事情要处理。

Shinji nodded absently, his eyes glued on the Second Child's flushed cheeks and rapid breathing.  
真嗣心不在焉地点了点头，目光紧紧盯着第二适格者泛红的脸颊和急促的呼吸。

"Take care of her for me?" Kaji whispered, patting the girl's hair gently.  
"替我照顾她一下？" 薰低声说着，轻抚着女孩的头发。

"S-sure," Shinji managed, his mind whirling.  
"好、好的，" 真嗣勉强应道，脑海中思绪纷乱。

Kaji offered him a comforting smile. "Do me another favor?" he asked quietly, "Keep this between us?"  
薰向他投去一个安慰的微笑。"能再帮我个忙吗？" 他轻声问道，"这件事就我们俩知道，好吗？"

Shinji nodded, understanding at once. "Ok."  
真嗣点头，立刻明白了。"好的。"

"I owe you one, Shinji," Kaji said honestly, putting a hand on the boy's shoulder. He frowned, feeling the need to add, "Just so you know… nothing happened with us."  
“我欠你一个人情，真嗣，”加持真诚地说，将手放在男孩的肩膀上。他皱起眉头，觉得有必要补充一句，“只是让你知道……我们之间什么都没发生。”

He frowned, averting his eyes as he thought, _Not_ that it didn't cross my mind… I mean, so IS cute… ahhh! I have to get out of here!  
他皱起眉头，移开视线，心里想着，倒不是我没想过……我是说，她确实很可爱……啊啊啊！我得离开这里！

Shinji could not hide his confusion. "I… didn't think it had," he said awkwardly, averting his eyes and trying not to envision a drunken Asuka feebly protesting as Kaji's fingers slowly drew the zipper of her dress down.  
真嗣无法掩饰自己的困惑。“我…没想到会这样，”他尴尬地说道，避开视线，尽力不去想象醉酒的明日香无力地抗议，而加持的手指缓缓拉下她裙子的拉链。

"No," Kaji murmured, "I guess you wouldn't, would you." Abruptly, he smiled. "Hey, I heard you're dating now… how's that going?"  
“不，”加持低声说，“我想你不会想到的，对吧。”突然，他笑了。“嘿，我听说你现在在约会…进展如何？”

Sticking his hands in his pockets, the boy shrugged.  
男孩将手插进口袋，耸了耸肩。

"That good, huh?" Kaji sighed.  
"有那么好吗？" 加持叹了口气。

"It's not… bad," Shinji told him hesitantly. "We're just… going slow."  
"倒也不是……不好，" 真嗣有些迟疑地告诉他，"我们只是……进展比较慢。"

"You know something, Shinji?" Kaji said thoughtfully, heading for the door, "That's a really smart thing to do. Too many kids your age just rush into things without thinking about the consequences. I'm glad to hear that you're not like that." He came up short in the hallway, grinning as he asked, "Have you kissed her yet?" When Shinji blushed, stuttering that he really didn't like to talk about it, Kaji laughed. "Well," he chuckled, opening the door and letting himself out, "there's something to be said for honor… well done, Shinji."  
"你知道吗，真嗣？" 加持若有所思地说着，走向门口，"这样做真的很明智。很多你这个年纪的孩子总是急匆匆地投入事情，不考虑后果。我很高兴听到你不是那样。" 他在走廊里突然停下，笑着问道："你吻过她了吗？" 当真嗣脸红，结结巴巴地说他真的不喜欢谈论这个时，加持笑了。"嗯，" 他轻笑一声，打开门走了出去，"荣誉感还是值得称赞的……干得好，真嗣。"

Shinji simply nodded as the door slid shut, not knowing quite what to say. "Honor," he mumbled, heading back into the living room and sitting on the floor by the couch. "Kaji's old fashioned." He sighed, stretching out and reaching for the TV remote. "Might as well see what's on," he said to himself, glancing at Asuka's sleeping face.  
真嗣只是点了点头，门随之滑上，他不知道该说什么好。“荣誉，”他喃喃自语，走回客厅，坐在沙发旁的地板上。“加持先生真是老派。”他叹了口气，伸了个懒腰，伸手去拿电视遥控器。“看看有什么节目吧，”他自言自语，瞥了一眼明日香熟睡的脸庞。

Finally settling on a dating program (more from lack of other options than real interest) he allowed his mind to wander. They went on a date, he thought, taking another curious look at the sleeping redhead, _but… Kaji said nothing happened. Why did Asuka say it was a date? Maybe… Kaji didn't want to admit it? He looked embarrassed, like he didn't want me to know._ Again, the image of Asuka and Kaji in an intimate embrace slipped into his mind, only this time, Asuka was the aggressor. That makes more sense, he thought, looking back to the TV, _God, I'm horrible… I can't believe I'm thinking about this – Asuka would kill me if she knew._  
最终选择了一个相亲节目（与其说是真的感兴趣，不如说是没有其他选择），他让自己的思绪飘散。他们去约会了，他想，又好奇地看了看熟睡的红发少女，但是……加持说没发生什么。为什么明日香说那是约会？也许……加持不想承认？他看起来很尴尬，好像不想让我知道。又一次，明日香和加持亲密拥抱的画面闪入他的脑海，只是这次，明日香是主动的一方。这样想更合理，他想，目光回到电视上，天啊，我真糟糕……我不敢相信我在想这些——如果明日香知道了，她会杀了我的。

He gave an involuntary start as a soft groan emanated from the girl. Covering his suddenly-thumping heart, he craned his neck to peer at her.  
女孩发出一声轻微的呻吟，他不由自主地一惊。他捂着突然砰砰直跳的心脏，伸长脖子朝她看去。

"Uh oh…" 哎呀…

As quickly as he could, Shinji got to his feet, tugging on Asuka's arm and managing to get her upright as her eyes flew open, registering surprise. "Shin-unhh…"  
真嗣迅速站起身，拉住明日香的手臂，使她站起来，她的眼睛猛地睁开，露出惊讶的神色。“真…唔…”

"Come on!" Shinji said urgently, tugging on her arm as she turned an alarming shade of green, "Come on!"  
“快点！”真嗣急切地说，拉着她的手臂，她脸色变得异常苍白，“快点！”

Covering her mouth with her free hand, Asuka nodded, and together they rushed into the bathroom. Shinji threw the toilet seat up just in time, trying not to be sick himself as Asuka fell to her knees, the alcohol she had ingested making its way violently out of her body.  
用空着的手捂住嘴，明日香点了点头，两人一起冲进了洗手间。真嗣及时掀起马桶盖，尽力不让自己也跟着呕吐，而明日香则跪倒在地，她喝下的酒精正猛烈地从体内排出。

Asuka grasped the back of the toilet desperately, her fogged mind running in every direction as she emptied her stomach. Oh, why does he have to see me like this? she thought desperately, heaving again, _God, I'm such a loser… sure, Kaji, I'm nice and mature – now how about a little kissy, hmm? God…_ Time lost its meaning as she knelt on the cold tile, forcefully ejecting her stomach's contents.  
明日香紧紧抓住马桶后部，她那迷糊的头脑四处乱窜，胃里的东西被她倾泻而出。哦，为什么他非得看到我这副模样？她绝望地想着，再次呕吐，天啊，我真是个失败者……没错，加持，我既温柔又成熟——现在来点亲吻如何，嗯？上帝啊……时间失去了意义，她跪在冰冷的瓷砖上，用力将胃里的东西吐出。

"Oh…" she gasped, reaching out with a shaking hand to flush the toilet, "oh thank God… it's over…" As her breathing returned to normal, she became aware of a feeling of lightness around her neck and shoulders.  
“哦……”她喘息着，颤抖的手伸出去按下冲水按钮，“哦，感谢上帝……结束了……”随着呼吸恢复正常，她感觉到脖子和肩膀周围有一种轻松的感觉。

_Hair,_ she thought feebly, _can't… feel my hair…_  
头发，她无力地想着，我…感觉不到我的头发…

She closed her eyes, taking a deep, steadying breath as she realized why.  
她闭上眼睛，深吸一口气以稳定情绪，随即明白了原因。

Shinji was holding her hair back for her… just like in those stupid romance novels she read, he was being thoughtful and considerate. He was being a gentleman… in spite of the cruelty she had shown him earlier that very night, he was still being kind to her.  
真嗣正帮她把头发往后拢…就像她读过的那些愚蠢的言情小说里描述的那样，他在体贴入微，考虑周到。尽管她当晚早些时候对他表现出了残忍，他依然对她温柔以待，展现出了绅士风度。

"Thanks," she whispered, opening her eyes and spitting into the toilet with an expression of extreme distaste. "I think I can handle it from here…" She frowned as she felt Shinji's arm slide around her waist, gently helping her to her feet. "I said I was ok," she grumbled, trying to shake him off, "let me go."  
"谢谢，"她低声说着，睁开眼睛，一脸厌恶地朝马桶吐了一口。"我想我自己能应付了……"她皱着眉头，感觉到真嗣的手臂环住了她的腰，轻柔地扶她站起来。"我说了我没事，"她嘟囔着，试图挣脱他，"放开我。"

"I said I would take care of you," Shinji told her awkwardly.  
"我说过我会照顾你的，"真嗣尴尬地告诉她。

"Who'd you tell that, Misato?" the redhead demanded, still trying to free herself from his gentle hold.  
"你跟谁说你会照顾我的，美里？"红发女孩质问道，仍在努力从他温柔的怀抱中挣脱出来。

"Kaji." "加治。"

Asuka's struggles ceased. "Kaji?" she whispered.  
明日香的挣扎停止了。“加治？”她低声问道。

"Yeah," Shinji confirmed, "he told me to make sure you were ok."  
"嗯，" 真嗣确认道，"他让我确保你没事。"

Slowly, reluctantly, Asuka raised her eyes. "Oh man," she hissed, catching sight of herself in the mirror, "God, I look terrible…"  
缓缓地，不情愿地，明日香抬起眼睛。“天哪，”她倒吸一口凉气，从镜子中瞥见自己的模样，“上帝啊，我看起来糟透了……”

"You don't… look that bad…" Shinji said softly.  
“你……看起来没那么糟……”真嗣轻声说道。

"I'm not Chidori," Asuka grumbled, pulling away from the boy's supporting arms and leaning on the sink, "you don't have to butter me up, Third Child – you're not kissing me."  
"“我不是千鸟，”明日香嘟囔着，从男孩支撑的手臂中挣脱出来，倚靠在水池边，“你不必奉承我，第三适格者——你又不是要吻我。”

Shinji flushed a brilliant crimson as the Second Child ran some water in the sink and began washing her sweaty face. "I was just… you really don't look _that_ bad…" Shinji protested weakly.  
真嗣的脸涨得通红，此时第二适格者打开水龙头，开始清洗她满是汗水的脸。“我只是……你真的看起来没那么糟……”真嗣无力地辩解道。

Asuka glanced at him over her shoulder, then rolled her eyes and looked back to the mirror. "Sure, Shinji," she murmured, "sure."  
明日香从肩膀上瞥了他一眼，然后翻了个白眼，又看向镜子。“当然，真嗣，”她低声说，“当然。”

When she finished cleaning herself up, Asuka headed for the living room, only offering a vague, 'watch your hands,' when Shinji slid one arm around her waist to help her and settling onto the couch with a weary sigh. She watched in silence as Shinji walked into the kitchen, returning a few minutes latter with a steaming mug of tea.  
清洗完毕后，明日香走向客厅，当真嗣伸手环住她的腰帮助她时，她只是含糊地提醒了一句“小心手”，然后疲惫地叹了口气，坐到沙发上。她静静地看着真嗣走进厨房，几分钟后端着一杯热腾腾的茶回来。

"Here," he said quietly, offering her the mug, "this will help your stomach."  
"这里，"他轻声说道，递给她一个杯子，"这个会缓解你的胃痛。"

"You sure?" Asuka asked skeptically, eyeing the mug.  
"你确定？"明日香怀疑地问道，盯着那个杯子。

Shinji smiled. "Works for Misato," he said lightly. "It has lots of sugar."  
真嗣微笑着。"对美里有效，"他轻松地说，"里面加了很多糖。"

Asuka accepted the drink, blowing lightly on the contents while Shinji lowered himself onto the couch next to her. Once it was cool enough, she took a cautious sip. "Hey," she said with some surprise, "this is really good."  
明日香接过饮料，轻轻吹了吹，而真嗣则在她旁边的沙发上坐下。待温度适宜后，她小心翼翼地抿了一口。“嘿，”她有些惊讶地说，“这个真的很好喝。”

"Thanks," Shinji said happily. He watched her quietly for a minute, finally working up the courage to ask, "So, umm… how was your date?"  
“谢谢，”真嗣开心地说。他静静地观察了她一会儿，终于鼓起勇气问道：“那么，嗯……你的约会怎么样？”

Asuka glanced into the mug, swirling the contents slowly. "I don't want to tell you," she said flatly.  
明日香瞥了一眼杯中的液体，缓缓搅动着。“我不想告诉你，”她冷淡地说。

Shinji nodded, averting his eyes. "I understand."  
真嗣点了点头，移开视线。“我明白了。”

Asuka frowned as he got to his feet, keeping her eyes on the tea. "I think I blew it, Shinji," she whispered, just as he reached the door. She waited for him to say something, but he kept his silence, compelling her to go on. "It was going pretty well until I had too much to drink," she mused, taking another sip from the mug, "then I just kept pushing… and pushing… and pushing." She sighed. "I don't think he'll go out with me again…"  
当真嗣站起来时，明日香皱起了眉头，目光仍停留在茶上。“我想我搞砸了，真嗣，”她在他到达门口时低声说道。她等待他说些什么，但他保持沉默，迫使她继续说下去。“本来进展得挺好的，直到我喝多了，”她沉思着，又从杯子里啜了一口，“然后我就一直推……一直推……一直推。”她叹了口气。“我觉得他不会再和我出去了……”

She looked up as Shinji crossed back over to her and knelt at her feet.  
她抬头看着真嗣再次走回她身边，跪在她脚边。

"What?" she asked, confused by the serious expression in his dark blue eyes.  
"什么？" 她问道，被他深蓝色眼眸中的严肃表情弄得一头雾水。

"Do you think," Shinji said slowly, "that maybe… that's for the best?" Asuka's expression immediately darkened, but he continued anyway. "He's pretty busy with his work, Asuka," he said quietly, "and… he and Misato had, you know, kind of a thing before. Wouldn't that be awkward?"  
"你觉得，" 真嗣缓缓地说，"或许……这样最好？" 明日香的表情立刻阴沉下来，但他还是继续说道。"他工作很忙，明日香，" 他轻声说，"而且……他和美里之前，你知道的，有过一段。那不会很尴尬吗？

"I don't care if it's awkward," Asuka said calmly, setting her mug down and leaning forward so that she was right in Shinji's face. "I don't care at all."  
"我才不在乎是否尴尬，" 明日香平静地说，放下杯子，身体前倾，直视着真嗣的脸。"我一点也不在乎。

"No," Shinji shrugged, trying not to be intimidated by the redhead's closeness and drawn-down brow, "but he might. It might be hard for him to be with you and see her all the time, you know? And besides," he smiled weakly, "he's… probably afraid you'd be too good to him, and he'd never get to date anyone else."  
"不，" 真嗣耸了耸肩，尽量不让自己被红发女孩的靠近和紧皱的眉头吓到，"但他可能会。他和你在一起，同时又经常看到她，这可能会让他很难受，你知道吗？而且，" 他苦笑了一下，"他可能害怕你会对他太好，以至于他再也没有机会和别人约会了。

Asuka was not smiling. Silently, she studied his face, her lips pursing as she carefully chose her words. "Listen to me, Shinji," she whispered, waiting until his eyes stopped darting around the room and fixed on hers before continuing, "I know what you're trying to do, and part of me appreciates it – really – but you should stop." She put her hand over his mouth as he tried to protest, shaking her head as she continued. "I know we don't talk much," she said softly, "and we don't know each other that well, even though we live together, but I know that you're trying to make me feel better… and you should just stop right now, because I'm not going to get over this easy. Ok?"  
明日香并没有笑。她静静地审视着他的脸，嘴唇紧抿，小心翼翼地选择着措辞。"听着，真嗣，"她低声说，等到他的目光不再在房间里游移，而是固定在她的眼睛上后，才继续说道，"我知道你想做什么，我的一部分真的很感激——真的——但你应该停下来。" 她用手捂住他的嘴，阻止他抗议，同时摇头继续说。"我知道我们不怎么交谈，" 她轻声说，"我们虽然住在一起，但彼此了解并不深，但我知道你试图让我感觉好一些……你现在就应该停下来，因为我不会这么轻易就释怀的。好吗？

Shinji nodded, lowering his eyes as the redhead pulled her hand away. "I just-"  
真嗣点了点头，目光低垂，红发女孩把手从他嘴边移开。"我只是——"

"Shinji," Asuka cut in, "let it go.'  
"真嗣，"明日香插话道，"放手吧。'

"Alright…" "好吧…"

Asuka considered his downcast face for a moment before leaning back. "Thank you for the tea," she said quietly. Shinji nodded, starting to rise, but Asuka leaned forward again and put her hands on his shoulders. "Wait," she said quickly. Slowly wetting her lips, she took a deep breath. "I'm not… really good at talking to people, you know?" she said slowly, "I'm not going to get all weepy and cry on your shoulder or anything lame like that, but I was thinking, when you were holding my hair for me… that I'm not that nice to you." She cocked her head to the side. "Am I right about that, Shinji?"  
明日香凝视着他低垂的脸片刻后，向后靠去。"谢谢你的茶，"她轻声说道。真嗣点头，正要起身，但明日香再次倾身向前，双手搭在他的肩上。"等等，"她急忙说。她缓缓舔了舔嘴唇，深吸一口气。"我不太擅长和人交谈，你知道吗？"她慢慢地说，"我不会哭哭啼啼地靠在你肩上，或者做出那种无聊的事，但我在想，你帮我托着头发的时候……我对你其实并不好。"她侧着头问道，"我说得对吗，真嗣？

Shinji blushed, but did not reply.  
真嗣脸红了，但没有回答。

"Yeah," Asuka murmured, "kinda thought not." With a sigh, she released him and sat back on the couch. "I'll try and be better," she mumbled tiredly, "how's that?" She snorted suddenly, folding her arms over her breasts. "Don't look for more than that, Third Child… that's my sap quota for the next six months. If you want more, go see Souske."  
“嗯，”明日香低声说，“有点觉得不会。”她叹了口气，放开他，坐回到沙发上。“我会试着做得更好，”她疲惫地嘟囔着，“这样行吗？”她突然哼了一声，双臂交叉在胸前。“别期待更多了，第三适格者……这是我接下来六个月的煽情配额。如果你想要更多，去找草薙吧。”

Shinji smiled softly. "No," he said quietly, rising to his feet, "if you got any sappier, I might ask Kaji what happened to the real Asuka."  
真嗣温柔地笑了笑。“不，”他轻声说道，站起身来，“如果你再煽情一点，我可能会问加持，真正的明日香去哪了。”

Asuka grinned. "Go to bed," she muttered, "it's past midnight."  
明日香咧嘴一笑。“去睡觉吧，”她嘟囔道，“已经过了午夜了。”

"What about you?" Shinji asked uncertainly.  
“那你呢？”真嗣不确定地问道。

"I had a little nap," the girl said ruefully, "so I'm gonna stay up for a bit… maybe read a little – and definitely change into something more comfortable, 'cause I can hardly breath in this stupid thing."  
"“我刚才小睡了一会儿，”女孩有些懊恼地说，“所以我想再熬一会儿……可能读点书——当然还要换上更舒服的衣服，因为这破玩意儿让我几乎喘不过气来。”

Shinji laughed, blushing as he stole a glance at the tight-fitting dress. "Well," he said, "goodnight."  
真嗣笑了，脸颊泛红，偷瞄了一眼那紧身裙。“嗯，”他说，“晚安。”

As he turned, Asuka whispered, "Shinji."  
当他转身时，明日香轻声唤道：“真嗣。”

"Yeah?" he asked, turning to look over his shoulder.  
“怎么了？”他问道，转过头来望向肩膀后方。

Asuka was grinning broadly. "I saw that." She laughed out loud as the boy's cheeks flushed and he stammered an apology. "Tell you what," she winked, "make me some more of that tea tomorrow, and I won't tell little Souske-chan about your wandering eyes, deal?"  
明日香笑得合不拢嘴。“我看到了哦。”她大声笑出来，男孩的脸颊泛红，结结巴巴地道歉。“告诉你吧，”她眨了眨眼，“明天再给我泡点那种茶，我就不告诉小宗介你那游移的眼神，成交？”

"Deal!" the boy said firmly, sharing a smile with her before heading to his room and closing the door.  
“成交！”男孩坚定地说，与她相视一笑后，走向自己的房间并关上了门。

Slowly, Asuka leaned back on the couch and gazed up at the ceiling. "Idiot," she whispered, allowing her mask of casual 'no big deal' calm to slip away. "God I'm such an idiot! Why couldn't I just… oh now he'll never want to be with me!" Taking a shuddering breath, she tried to get control of herself, but the quiet voice of the Third Child, telling her that this was probably for the best, made control impossible – especially when she realized that he was probably right.  
明日香缓缓地靠在沙发上，仰望着天花板。“笨蛋，”她低声自语，让那副漫不经心、无所谓的平静面具滑落。“天啊，我真是个笨蛋！为什么我就不能……哦，现在他肯定不想和我在一起了！”她深吸一口气，试图控制自己，但第三适格者那平静的声音告诉她，这或许是最好的结果，让她无法自控——尤其是当她意识到他可能是对的。

Rolling onto her side and pressing her face into the back of the couch, Asuka Langley Souryu took another shuddering breath and did something she had not done in seven years…  
翻身侧躺，将脸埋进沙发的背面，惣流·明日香·兰格雷深吸了一口气，做了她七年来未曾做过的事情……

She wept… 她哭了……

The End 完

Author's notes: This was originally supposed to be part of the Chidori/Shinji story _Kaiku_, but it started to get so long that I decided to cut it and make it a side story. I really wanted to accomplish two things in this story: avoid having Asuka and Kaji fall in love, and depict what a date between a 29 year old and a 14 year old might be like. I wanted him to be nervous as all hell, and trying his best to keep things 'friendly,' while she's doing everything in her power to get him to see her as an adult… and end with both of them partially succeeding. Their relationship is not over – no one involved with Project-E is ever really free of it, or the people associated with it… but as Asuka realizes and finally accepts at the end of this story, friendship is the most she can hope for. Of course, sometimes a friendship can be more fulfilling than an affair, so I guess we'll just have to see what happens. *shrug*  
作者的话：这原本是打算作为千鸟/真嗣故事《回响》的一部分，但它开始变得太长了，所以我决定将其切割出来，作为一篇番外故事。我在这篇故事中真正想实现两个目标：避免让明日香和加持坠入爱河，以及描绘一个 29 岁的人和一个 14 岁孩子之间的约会可能是什么样子。我希望他极度紧张，尽其所能保持‘友好’，而她则竭尽全力让他将自己视为成年人……最终两人都部分成功了。他们的关系并未结束——参与 Project-E 的任何人都不可能真正摆脱它，或与之相关的人……但正如明日香在这篇故事的结尾意识到并最终接受的那样，友谊是她所能期望的极限。当然，有时友谊可能比风流韵事更令人满足，所以我们只能拭目以待，看看会发生什么。*耸肩*

Pre-read was done by Lord Malachite and Ryoma – who both fell to their knees and worshiped me for not putting Asuka in Kaji's bed. *Sigh* some people… -_- Lisa Eggleston, who also pre-read, simply wiped the sweat from her brow and shook her head, muttering something like, "Dodged THAT bullet…" *double SIGH*  
预读工作由 Lord Malachite 和 Ryoma 完成——他们俩都跪倒在地，崇拜我没有把明日香放到加持的床上。*叹气* 有些人啊……-_- Lisa Eggleston 也参与了预读，她只是擦了擦额头上的汗，摇摇头，喃喃自语道："躲过了那颗子弹……" *双重叹气*
