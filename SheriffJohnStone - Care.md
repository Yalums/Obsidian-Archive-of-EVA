Shinji poured his tea and sat down in front of the TV. It was a quiet night, accented by the gentle breeze and ever-present cicada noises.  
真嗣沏好茶，坐在电视前。夜色静谧，微风和蝉声为这夜晚增添了几分恬淡。

The channel he decided to watch was airing movies all night, so he figured he'd relax with it on. The current flick was an old animated film about aliens that play instruments, set entirely to music. He wasn't sure what to expect at first, but the movie intrigued him enough to keep watching. The particular style of music wasn't exactly his thing, but it wasn't too bad.  
他选择的频道通宵播放电影，他便打算借此放松。正在放映的是一部老动画，内容是外星人用乐器演奏，全片以音乐为背景。起初他并不清楚期待什么，但电影的吸引力让他决定继续看下去。虽然这种音乐风格并非他最爱，但也并不令人反感。

Commercials aired between scenes, but the one that caught his eye was a promo for some documentary about the "Angel Wars." It made him chuckle. Five years really went by fast, and now the most turbulent time of his life was a TV special. Thankfully, Misato managed to attain a fantastic therapist, which made dealing with those memories much easier.  
场景切换间播放的广告中，一则关于“天使战争”的纪录片预告吸引了他的注意，让他不禁轻笑。五年光阴转瞬即逝，曾经动荡不安的日子如今竟成了电视上的特别节目。多亏美里找到了一位优秀的心理医生，处理这些记忆变得轻松许多。

The movie returned, putting his sudden trip down memory lane in the back of his head. He was tapping his fingers to the upbeat rhythm of the current song when the phone rang.  
电影继续播放，他暂时将那段突如其来的回忆搁置一旁。此时，电话铃声响起，他正随着音乐的轻快节奏轻敲手指。

Shinji took a sip of his tea before getting up to answer. "Hello?"  
真嗣抿了一口茶，随即起身去接听。"喂？"

_"Shhinji!"_ said a rather slurred voice. _"Shhtupid, idiot-Shinji! C'mere!"_  
真嗣！" 一个口齿不清的声音喊道，"笨蛋，傻瓜真嗣！快过来！

"Asuka?" he answered. "是 Asuka 吗？" 他回应道。

He heard some shuffling around before another voice greeted him. _"Good evening, Ikari."_  
他听到周围有些窸窣声，紧接着另一个声音向他问好：“晚上好，碇。”

"Miss Horaki, hi!" 霍拉基小姐，您好！

_"You've known me long enough..."_ she trailed off before continuing. _"Look, Asuka's had too much. Would you mind coming to pick us up?"_  
你认识我这么久了……" 她顿了顿，接着说，"明日香喝多了，麻烦你来接我们一下好吗？

He sighed. "No problem. I'll be there soon. Are you okay, though?"  
他叹了口气说：“没事，我马上就到。你还好吧？”

_"I'm fine. I had a few drinks, but this one got way ahead of herself. We'll be at the front of the club on Minato. See you in a bit!"  
我还不错。虽然喝了点酒，但她显然喝过头了。我们会在港区俱乐部的前面等你。待会儿见！_

_"Hhhikari! When'z Dumb-Stupid-Idiot-Boy-Shhinji gonna get his cute butt over he-"  
光！那个笨拙的小傻瓜真嗣什么时候才能过来呢-_

The line died, and Shinji shook his head. This would happen every so often; Asuka would go for a girls' night out with Hikari, and he'd have to reel her in. Sometimes he was woken up, other times it was fairly early.  
线断了，真嗣无奈地摇摇头。这种情况偶尔会发生；明日香会和光去参加女生聚会，他则得负责把她接回家。有时是半夜被叫醒，有时则还算早。

He grabbed a jacket and his keys, and stepped out of the apartment, taking the elevator to the ground floor and exiting into the cool air of the night. The commercial brought back stray memories of his piloting days, and how hard he and Asuka fought against the Eva series to a narrow finish.  
他拿起夹克和钥匙，走出公寓，搭乘电梯至一楼，踏入夜间的清凉空气中。那则广告勾起了他驾驶飞机时的零星回忆，以及他与明日香如何与 Eva 系列激战，最终以微弱优势胜出。

Thoughts and memories continued to swirl in his mind as he drove down the lamp-lit streets towards the nightclub. The radio softy played some classical music as the wind blew his hair around. Asuka was a tough situation to him. He assumed that once everything was said and done she'd move back to Germany, but she insisted on staying. He figured it was because he took care of things around the house, but she always said that he couldn't do simple tasks without her, so they remained part of an odd household with Misato, eventually moving out once they became adults. He was her roommate and occasional wrangler, but it beat living alone.  
思绪与记忆在他脑海中交织，他驾车穿梭在灯火辉煌的街道上，朝着夜店驶去。车内，古典音乐在收音机里轻柔地流淌，风儿吹拂着他的发丝。明日香对他而言是个难题。他本以为事情结束后她会返回德国，然而她却执意留下。他猜测这或许是因为他负责料理家务，而她总认为他离了她连简单的事都做不来，因此他们与美里共同生活在一个奇特的家庭中，直到成年后才搬离。他是她的室友，偶尔也充当调解者，但这样的生活总比独居来得有趣。

Shinji's thinking came to a decrescendo as he pulled up in front of the nightclub. It was a decent-sized building, and not super flashy. For some reason Asuka loved going here whenever she wanted a night on the town, but to each their own. He saw two feminine figures in red and green dresses and knew it was the young women he was chauffeuring. He honked his horn to get their attention, and Hikari threw Asuka's arm around her, leading her to the car.  
真嗣的思绪在夜总会前停下时逐渐平息。这座建筑规模适中，并不张扬。明日香每次想在城里尽情玩乐时，总偏爱来此，各有所好。他注意到两位身着红绿裙装的女子，确认了她们正是他要接送的对象。他按响喇叭引起她们注意，光便挽着明日香的胳膊，一同走向车辆。

The girls got in the back. "Hi! Sorry about this!" Hikari said sheepishly.  
女孩们坐到了后排。"嗨！抱歉打扰了！" 光有些不好意思地说。

Shinji turned to address them. "It's no problem, really." Hikari had her wits about her, but Asuka was swaying like she was light as a feather. He turned back around and started to drive.  
真嗣转头对他们说：“真的没事。” 绫波头脑清醒，而明日香则像轻飘飘的羽毛般摇摆不定。他回过头，继续开车。

"About _freakin'_ time, Shtupid Shinnji!" Asuka slurred. "You... You took... For freakin' ever!"  
你这个笨蛋真嗣，总算来了！"明日香醉醺醺地说，"你...你真是...慢死了！

"Sorry," he said with a little smile.  
"抱歉，" 他微微一笑说道。

"You idiot! Allllways with the shtupid apologies! What if our- What if you..." she drunkenly trailed off.  
"你这个蠢货！老是说些没用的道歉！要是我们的...要是你..." 她醉意朦胧地话没说完。

He first dropped off Hikari at her house. She expressed her gratitude before hurrying to the door. Once she was inside, he started to head home.  
他先送光到了她家门口，她表达了谢意后匆匆进了家门。待她进屋后，他才启程回家。

"So, have a fun night...?" he asked, but a glance in the rearview mirror told him that she was not conscious enough to respond. Putting his eyes back on the road, he chuckled to himself, thinking of all the times Asuka bragged about her 'German liver.'  
"那么，祝你有个愉快的夜晚...？"他问道，但通过后视镜一看，发现她已经意识不清，无法回应。他重新将目光投向路面，自顾自地笑了，回想起飞鸟多次吹嘘她那"德国人的酒量"。

The empty streets provided a quick path home, and once parked, he got out and carefully opened the door to the back. Reaching over, he un-clipped Asuka's seatbelt and sighed to himself before lifting her out of the car. He put her arm over his shoulder, and she seemed to come to her senses just enough that she loosely walked with him. The two of them made their way to the elevator, then the apartment.  
空无一人的街道成了回家的捷径，停车后，他轻手轻脚地打开后门。伸手解开飞鸟的安全带，他暗自叹息，随后将她从车中抱出。他让她的手臂搭在自己肩上，她似乎略微恢复了些意识，能依稀与他同行。两人缓缓走向电梯，继而进入公寓。

The door opened, and he gently hoisted her inside. _"Wehrre home!"_ Asuka quietly slurred, before stumbling and grabbing onto Shinji with both arms for support.  
门缓缓开启，他轻柔地将她抱入屋内。"我们到家了！"明日香含糊地呢喃，随即脚步不稳，双臂紧紧环抱住真嗣以稳住身形。

Shinji guided her to the bathroom, where he assisted her in taking off her makeup and brushing her teeth. It was awkward and difficult the first time, but he had gotten the hang of it by now, at least to the best of his ability as a male.  
真嗣带她到浴室，帮她卸妆和刷牙。一开始既尴尬又费劲，不过他现在已逐渐上手，至少以男性的标准来看，算是尽力了。

Once done in the bathroom, Shinji helped Asuka to her bedroom. He silently asked any and all deities for assistance before putting his free arm under her legs, swooping her up into a bridal carry. Gently, he placed her down on her bed.  
浴室的事情处理完毕后，真嗣搀扶着明日香回到她的房间。他默默祈求神明的庇佑，随后用一只手臂托起她的双腿，以新娘抱的姿势将她抱起，并轻柔地安置在床上。

He looked at her sleeping form, his arm still under her shoulders. He smiled. "Goodnight, Asuka," he whispered. When he went to remove his arm, he hit a snag in the form of his roommate's iron grip. For a drunk 20 year-old girl, she was holding on surprisingly tight. He gave a tug, then another, but she wasn't budging.  
他凝视着她安睡的模样，手臂依旧搁在她的肩下。他嘴角上扬，轻声道：“晚安，明日香。”欲抽回手臂时，却遭遇了室友那如铁钳般紧握的阻碍。一个醉酒的 20 岁女孩，竟能抓得如此牢靠。他用力拽了拽，再试一次，她却依旧纹丝不动。

"Nnno, shtay," he heard Asuka say through the muffle of her pillow, and he sighed. She wasn't gonna let him leave. Instead of fighting it, he simply knelt down beside the bed, resting his head sideways on the soft mattress. He felt Asuka's body turn before an arm draped itself on his head.  
"不，等等，"他听到明日香的声音透过枕头传来，他叹了口气。她显然不打算放他走。他没有选择争执，而是跪在床边，将头侧放在柔软的床垫上。随即，他感觉到明日香的身体转了过来，一只手臂轻轻地搭在了他的头上。

"Idiot Shinnji," he heard her whisper gently before drifting off.  
他听到她轻声呢喃了一句‘傻瓜新二’，随后便进入了梦乡。

---

The morning sun shone through the window, directly into Shinji's eyes. It was a fantastic wakeup call. He moaned in pain as his body reminded him of the hellish sleeping position he was in. He looked up to see Asuka, her arm still cradling his head from above. He moved slowly and slipped out of her grasp, which elicited a groan as she stirred, but remained asleep. He rubbed his face as he quietly exited her room and made his way to the kitchen.  
清晨的阳光透过窗户，直射进真嗣的眼中，仿佛是绝佳的起床闹钟。他的身体因昨晚糟糕的睡姿而痛苦地呻吟。抬头一看，明日香的手臂还从上方抱着他的头。他小心翼翼地挪动，从她的怀抱中滑出，这让她发出一声呻吟，但仍未醒来。他揉了揉脸，轻手轻脚地离开了她的房间，走向厨房。

Shinji's mind kicked into "Hangover cure-mode," which consisted of a perfect breakfast for Asuka: Pancakes. He had the mix recipe memorized down to each ingredient and measurement, as well as pancake shape and time in the pan for each one. Recently, he had the idea of homemade strawberry jam, so he retrieved the jar from the fridge, as well as a small teaspoon for spreading it. He flipped the current pancake before going back to setting the table. He made Asuka's spot, carefully lining up the fork and knife. Another flip, and he prepped the plate. While shopping once, he found a bunch of shaped stencils meant for coffee, as well as other things. He decided on the rose-shaped stencil to match the redness of the strawberries, and sprinkled three little roses made of nutmeg. First pancake of the stack was placed on the plate, and he started on her coffee. Having enough piloting money to sit around for the rest of his life made Shinji pick up different methods of coffee-making. Asuka's favourite was a cappuccino, so he made sure to prepare the milk perfectly, and mix it just enough with the coffee itself. Placing that down, he stacked the second pancake. With everything else prepped, he focused all of his attention on the third and final pancake. It was the perfect one to top the stack, looking fluffy and golden-brown. He gave a satisfied smile as he placed it on top, completing the breakfast.  
真嗣的脑海中迅速切换到了“宿醉解救模式”，构思出一份专为明日香定制的完美早餐：煎饼。他对煎饼的配方了如指掌，从每种原料到分量，再到煎饼的形状和煎制时间。最近，他灵机一动，决定自制草莓酱，便从冰箱中取出了一罐，并随手拿了一把小茶匙准备涂抹。在翻转煎饼的同时，他不忘布置餐桌，细心地为明日香摆放好餐具。再次翻转煎饼后，他开始准备餐盘。曾在一次购物中，他发现了一套咖啡用及其他用途的形状模具，这次他选择了玫瑰形状的模具，以呼应草莓的鲜红，并在煎饼上点缀了三朵用肉豆蔻制成的小玫瑰。 盘子上摆好了第一块煎饼，他随即开始为明日香冲泡咖啡。由于拥有足够的飞行收入，真嗣得以在余生中悠闲自在，也因此掌握了多种咖啡制作技巧。明日香钟爱卡布奇诺，他便精心调制牛奶，使其与咖啡恰到好处地融合。咖啡备好后，他叠上了第二块煎饼。一切就绪，他将心思全放在第三块也是最后一块煎饼上，这块煎饼蓬松金黄，完美地作为堆叠的顶端。当他将其放置完毕，完成早餐时，脸上露出了满意的微笑。

Just as he finished up, Asuka trudged into the kitchen, plopping herself onto the chair.  
他刚收拾完，明日香就拖着疲惫的脚步走进厨房，重重地坐到了椅子上。

"How are you?" he asked calmly.  
他平静地问：“你好吗？”

"Are you stupid?" she groaned. "I feel like crap!"  
你是不是傻啊？"她呻吟着说，"我感觉糟透了！

"Well, here," he responded, placing down the pancakes in front of her. Asuka's mouth opened to bite back a remark, but the presentation, as well as the smell of fresh pancakes, stopped her in her tracks. She wordlessly grabbed the cold jam and spread some on top of the first pancake before cutting a piece and taking a bite.  
"嗯，放这儿了，"他边说边把煎饼摆到她面前。明日香本想回嘴，但煎饼的诱人模样和扑鼻香气让她住了口。她默默拿起冷果酱，抹在第一张煎饼上，切下一块，送入口中。

As he washed dishes, Shinji peered over his shoulder to see if she was enjoying her meal. "How is it?"  
洗碗之际，真嗣回头望去，想看看她是否正享受着美食。“味道如何？”

Asuka took a sip of her coffee and paused for a moment. Silence hung between the two before she gave her assessment. "It's acceptable. I'll allow my stomach to grace it." It made Shinji smile. After living with her long enough, he knew that vague backhandedness was Asuka's way of giving compliments. He continued to clear the sink, satisfied with his work.  
明日香轻啜一口咖啡，稍作停顿。两人之间一片静默，她随后评价道：“还算可以。我就勉强让胃接受它吧。”这话让真嗣不禁微笑。与她共处多时，他已懂得这种隐晦的反语正是明日香赞许的方式。他继续收拾水槽，对自己的成果感到满意。

Drying his hands, he went to leave the kitchen, seeing Asuka sitting cross-legged on her chair, three quarters of the final pancake in front of her. "Just leave the plate in the sink when you're done, I'll take care of-"  
他擦干手，正要离开厨房，发现明日香盘腿坐在椅子上，面前还剩四分之一个煎饼。“吃完把盘子放水槽就行，我来收拾。”

"Eat the rest of it." She wasn't making a request.  
"把剩下的都吃了。" 她并非在请求，而是在命令。

Shinji obliged, taking a bite and assessing his handiwork. Asuka said it was fine, and he couldn't agree more. He offered her a smile before quickly finishing the pancake and clearing the table.  
真嗣应允了，尝了一口自己的手艺。明日香评价说挺好的，他对此深有同感。他向她报以微笑，随即吃完煎饼，并迅速收拾了桌子。

He was blissfully unaware of Asuka staring at him from the doorway to the living room, a small smile of her own spread across her face.  
他全然未觉明日香正从客厅门口注视着他，她脸上也浮现出一抹浅浅的微笑。

A/N: Funny story, I got this idea from a tiktok I saw. This guy made a really nice looking plate of pancakes for his hungover roommate, and I thought it was Asushin-esque. Not as on the nose as "Practice" but it was a nice thing to write. Gonna continue on YW now.  
有趣的是，这个灵感来自我在 TikTok 上看到的一个视频。视频中，一位男士为宿醉的室友做了一盘精美的煎饼，我觉得这颇具阿修罗的韵味。虽然没有“练习”那么直接，但写起来感觉很温馨。接下来，我要继续创作《永夜君王》了。

Also, bonus points if you can guess what movie Shinji is watching.  
此外，若能猜出真嗣所看电影，可获额外加分。

Special thanks to HydrationStation for reading it over. Keep on rockin' in the free world, folks.  
特别感谢 HydrationStation 的审阅。朋友们，让我们继续在自由的天地里尽情摇滚。

Act II: Of Course I Do!  
第二幕：我当然愿意！

The apartment for two held a quiet atmosphere. Shinji watched TV while Asuka had a shower. A ringing of the phone broke that silence.  
两人住的公寓里气氛宁静。真嗣看着电视，明日香则在洗澡。电话铃声突然响起，打破了这份宁静。

"Hello? …Oh, hey Kensuke! Yeah, it's been a while. …You know, school and all that. …Uh-huh, you told me about your new place. …A party? Yeah, sure! We should be able to make it! I'll text you. Okay. Hopefully see you then! …Bye!"  
喂？……哦，健介啊！确实好久没见了。……学校的事嘛，你懂的。……嗯，你提过你的新家。……聚会？好啊，我们能去！我会给你发消息。好的，希望到时候见！……拜拜！

Shinji put the phone down.  
真嗣把电话放下了。

Asuka emerged from the bathroom, towelling her hair. "Who was it?" she asked.  
明日香从浴室走出，正用毛巾擦拭着湿发。"刚才是谁？"她询问道。

He looked at her, wearing a loose-fitting t-shirt she stole from him. To him, it was pleasant to look at. "That was Kensuke. He moved into that place a couple months ago and wanted to do a reunion of all the people we went to school with. We're both invited."  
他凝视着她，她身上穿着一件从他那儿偷来的宽松 T 恤，这让他感到赏心悦目。“那是健介。他几个月前搬到了那里，打算组织一次校友聚会，把我们学校的人都召集起来。我们俩都收到了邀请。”

Asuka crossed the room, put a hand on her cheek and smirked. "You know what? Why not? I think I can stand to deal with some of those chumps for one night! Plus, Hikari will be there too, right?"  
明日香穿过房间，一手轻抚脸颊，嘴角露出一丝狡黠的微笑。“你知道吗？有何不可？我想我能忍受那些家伙一晚上！再说，光也会在场，对吧？”

"Well, Toji's helping set up, so most likely."  
嗯，既然东治在帮忙搭建，那多半没问题了。

"If that stooge is gonna be drinking, she'll be wrangling him until he passes out. She needs company, and I think that'd be me. It'll make me feel young for a night!"  
如果那个家伙打算喝酒，她会一直陪到他醉倒为止。她需要有人陪伴，我想那个人就是我。这会让我感觉自己仿佛年轻了一夜！

Shinji rolled his eyes. "Asuka, I'm older than you."  
真嗣不耐烦地翻了翻白眼。"明日香，我比你年长。"

Asuka punched him on the arm. "Whatever, you dork. I'm in!"  
明日香捶了捶他的胳膊，"得了吧，你这傻瓜。我加入！"

---

Shinji tugged at his collar. Not the most comfortable shirt, but Asuka basically dressed him for the evening. According to her, he dressed like an inanimate object, so it was her duty to pick an outfit. The particular set of clothes he was wearing was also picked up when she made him go shopping with her.  
真嗣拉了拉衣领，这件衬衫穿起来并不舒服，但今晚的装扮几乎都是明日香一手包办的。她认为他平时的打扮就像没有生命的东西，所以有责任帮他挑选服装。这套衣服，也是她硬拉着他去购物时选定的。

Shaking the thought, the two of them approached Kensuke's apartment. Asuka knocked, and the door slid open to reveal the host. Since high school, he had sprouted quite a bit. He was just over 6 feet tall and quite lanky. Shinji was just under that height, and the difference was negligible.  
两人摇摇头，走向剑介的住处。明日香轻敲门扉，门应声而开，主人现身。自高中时代起，剑介已长高许多，身高达六尺有余，显得颇为瘦削。真嗣虽稍矮一些，但身高差距并不明显。

"Ikari! Soryu! Good to see you guys!" he said. He shook hands with Shinji and pulled him into a hug, then offered the same to Asuka. She accepted hesitantly.  
"怒涛！苍龙！见到你们真好！"他高兴地说。他先是与真嗣握手拥抱，随后也向明日香伸出了拥抱的邀请。她略显迟疑地接受了。

Wandering into the apartment, Shinji took in the polished feel. Fresh hardwood floors, a brand-new throw rug, a kitchen with all new appliances, and some great furniture. All in all, it was great for a bachelor pad. "Wow, nice place."  
踏入公寓，真嗣立刻被那种光洁感所吸引。新铺设的硬木地板，一块崭新的地毯，厨房里摆满了全新电器，还有精致的家具。整体来看，这真是个适合单身汉的理想居所。“哇，这地方真不错。”

"Yeah. For a stooge-cave, it isn't half bad!" interjected Asuka.  
"确实，作为傀儡的藏身之所，这里算是相当不错了！" 阿苏卡插话道。

"Oh, bite me, devil," Kensuke said with a small grin.  
"哦，来咬我吧，恶魔，" 健介带着一丝微笑说道。

"Oh crap, is that the Shin-man!?" said a voice from the living room. It was none other than Toji Suzuhara, who leapt up from the couch to greet Shinji, almost spilling his beer in the process.  
"哎呀，那不是真嗣吗！？"客厅里响起一个声音。原来是铃原东治，他从沙发上跳起来迎接真嗣，差点把手中的啤酒洒出来。

"Oh, hi Toji," Shinji said as he was pulled into a man-hug.  
"哦，冬二，你好啊，" 真嗣说着被拉进了一个男人间的拥抱。

"Ahh, it's good to see ya, buddy. It's been a few months! How have we not seen each other sooner, y'know, with our girlfriends hangin' out all the time!"  
哎呀，见到你真高兴，老兄。都过去几个月了！想想我们的女朋友经常一起玩，我们怎么就没早点碰面呢，你说是吧！

That made Shinji blush as the hug untangled. "Well, uh, Asuka's my roommate, not my-"  
这让真嗣脸颊泛红，拥抱松开后他支支吾吾地说：“那个，明日香只是我的室友，并不是我的——”

"Eh, whatever, man. Let's drink!" Toji said, cutting him off. Shinji was led over to a table with various bottles of liquor and cans of alcoholic beverages.  
"唉，无所谓了，哥们。来，咱们喝点！" 东治打断他，领着真嗣来到一张桌子前，桌上摆满了各式酒瓶和罐装酒。

"Thanks," he said, taking a beer. He was going to take the night slow.  
"谢谢，"他边说边拿起一瓶啤酒。他决定悠闲地度过这个夜晚。

"'Ey, Ikari, you better be slamming that back," said Toji, who was filling shot-glasses.  
"嘿，碇，你可得一口干了那杯啊，"东治一边说着，一边给小酒杯斟满。

---

Three shots in, Shinji didn't realize the rapid side effects kicking in. His mind simply shut off inhibitions and he kept going. He accepted shot number I-don't-know next to a girl with glasses.  
注射了三针后，真嗣并未意识到迅速显现的副作用。他的思维仿佛解除了所有束缚，继续接受注射。他接过了下一针，旁边是一位戴着眼镜的女孩。

"Cheers, uh, whas' your name again?" he asked loudly.  
"干杯，对了，你叫什么名字来着？" 他提高声音问道。

"Mayumi." 真弓

"Mayumi! Mamuyi, Mayumi! Cheers!"  
Mayumi！加油，Mayumi！干杯！

The girl clinked shot glasses with him, and they both took back more vodka. She chased right away, and Shinji stood there, shuddering for a moment at the liquor crawling down his throat, but didn't think to follow it up.  
女孩与他碰杯后，两人都一饮而尽，又续了些伏特加。她随即又追加了一杯，而 Shinji 站在那里，一时因烈酒滑过喉咙而颤抖，却没有继续喝下去。

He stumbled away from the spot he was in and found Toji and Hikari on the couch. She was on his lap, head leaning on top of his as they conversed.  
他踉跄着离开了原来的位置，发现东治和光正坐在沙发上。光坐在东治的腿上，头倚靠在他的头上，两人正亲切交谈。

"Toji! H'kari! Man, I love you guys!" he shouted, sitting next to them.  
"东治！光！哎呀，我真是太爱你们了！" 他坐在他们旁边大声说道。

Toji patted him on the shoulder. "Same over here, Shin-man! We're glad you and Soryu showed up tonight. 'Ey Ken, wanna grab us some beers?" he said to the host, who nodded and rushed to the cooler.  
透二拍拍他的肩膀，“我们这儿也是，进哥！你和苍龙今晚能来真是太好了。嘿，健，能帮我们拿点啤酒吗？”他对主人说道，主人点头后便匆匆去取啤酒。

Shinji smiled a wide, drunk grin. "Hikari!"  
真嗣带着醉意，咧开嘴笑了。“光！”

She giggled. "Yes, Shinji?"  
她咯咯笑着说：“怎么了，真嗣？”

"Y're so cute! And you and Toji are, like, the perfect couple! Man, you guys are cute together."  
你真是太可爱了！你和冬二简直是天造地设的一对！哎呀，你们俩在一起简直萌翻了。

Hikari exchanged a look with Toji. They both wanted to laugh. It was certainly funny to see Shinji so outgoing tonight. Good thing he was an affectionate drunk.  
光和东地相视一笑，两人都差点笑出声。今晚真嗣这么放得开，真是难得一见。还好他喝醉了就变得特别亲昵。

Kenuske returned with three opened beer bottles. "Here we are. Cheers, boys!"  
肯努斯克带着三瓶已开启的啤酒回来了。“我们到了，兄弟们，干杯！”

Shinji accepted and clinked his bottle with no hesitation. "To th' stooges! Yeah!"  
真嗣毫不犹豫地接受了，与对方碰了碰瓶子。"敬那帮家伙！耶！"

---

Asuka was relishing in the eyes on her. Of course, she could handle her liquor, which was a given since she was German. She had taken some shots with the stooges and Hikari. What surprised her was Shinji. He took back shots of vodka with little resistance. He twitched a little, but didn't think to chase it like the idiot he was. He seemed okay in the hands of his friends, so she went onto Kensuke's veranda for some air. The alcohol was hitting nicely, but she was managing herself tonight. No falling onto Shinji  
明日香正陶醉于众人的注目之中。身为德国人的她，自然能驾驭酒精。她和那几个笨蛋还有光一起痛饮了几杯。真嗣的表现却让她吃惊，他轻松地回敬了几杯伏特加，只是略微抽搐，并未像傻瓜一样继续灌酒。在朋友们的陪伴下，他似乎安然无恙，于是她便走到剑介的阳台上呼吸新鲜空气。酒精的作用正合她意，但她今晚自控力十足，绝不会倒在真嗣身上。

She heard someone step out a few moments later. It was Strasberg, one of the guys from their class. He grew taller as well, and kept the middle-part in his purple hair.  
几分钟后，她听到有人走了出来。是斯特拉斯伯格，他们班的一个男生。他同样长高了，紫色的头发保持着中分。

"Guten Abend," he said, offering a smile.  
"晚上好，"他微笑着说道。

"Guten Abend," she responded. "And here I was thinking I was the only German from our school."  
晚上好，"她笑着说。"没想到这里还有其他德国同学。

He leaned against the railing next to her. "Well, you thought wrong." They both chuckled.  
他倚在旁边的栏杆上，对她说：“嗯，你想错了。”两人相视而笑。

There was a beat. He scooted a little closer to her. "So, you and Ikari, are you...?"  
一阵沉默后，他稍稍向她靠近了些。“你和碇，你们是不是……？”

"No," she said with a sigh. He only cooks for me, cleans our shared living space, and doesn't say anything when I down a bunch of alcohol and cling to him. "We're just roommates. We were also pilots, so we just get each other like that."  
她叹息着说：'不，'他只负责给我做饭，清洁我们共同的生活区域，当我酗酒并依偎在他身边时，他从不言语。'我们仅仅是室友。由于我们都是飞行员，所以彼此间有种默契。'

"Ah, like me and Kirishima. I care about her loads, y'know? I dunno if I'd... If I'd _date_ her, but I appreciate her." He smiled.  
"啊，就像我和切岛那样。我真的很在乎她，你懂的。虽然不确定是否会和她交往，但我确实很欣赏她。" 他微笑着说。

Asuka thought Strasberg was nice, but there was something about him that was putting her off. "Well, that's good for you. I could see you guys making it work."  
明日香觉得斯特拉斯伯格挺好的，但就是有些地方让她感觉不太对劲。"嗯，对你来说挺好的。我觉得你们俩能合得来。"

He tilted his head a little. "Maybe, but I'd also like to-"  
他略微歪了歪头，说：“可能吧，但我还想——”

_"Oh my god I remember!"_ said an unusually loud voice.  
"天哪，我想起来了！"一个声音异常响亮地说道。

It was Asuka's perfect out. "I should go check on that." Before Strasberg could say another word, she was back inside.  
这是明日香绝佳的脱身机会。“我得去看看那边的情况。”斯特拉斯伯格还未来得及多言，她已转身回到屋内。

Shinji was sitting on the couch, iron grip on an almost-empty bottle of beer, as he had his arm around Toji. They were loudly recounting stories from school.  
真嗣坐在沙发上，手中紧握着快喝完的啤酒瓶，胳膊搭在东治肩上。两人正大声地讲述着校园里的趣事。

Asuka made eye contact with Hikari, who was face-palming, but couldn't help a chuckle.  
明日香与捂着脸的光对视，却还是忍不住笑了出来。

"And-and rem'mber when you and Kenshuke had to get shcooped into my Eva? Man I was a real ass about that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."  
还记得你和健助不得不被我拉进我的 Eva 那次吗？我那时真是太过分了。真的很抱歉，对不起。

"Nah man, nah, I owe you the apology. Especially after you stopped the thing they made me test in," Toji said, sticking a finger in his face.  
"不，兄弟，该道歉的是我。尤其是你阻止了他们逼我测试的那玩意儿，" 东治说着，用手指戳了戳他的脸。

"Oh, god! Did you-did you know how pisshed my dad was? He made me sit in a cell for, like, days!" said Shinji.  
"天啊！你不知道我爸当时有多火大，他让我在牢房里待了好几天！" 真嗣说道。

Asuka walked in front of them. "Having fun?" she said, putting hands on her hips.  
明日香走在他们前面，双手叉腰问道：“玩得开心吗？”

Shinji dropped his bottle and stood immediately. "Asuka! Ashuka! Oh, man, I'm happy to shee you. C'mere!" he pulled her into a rough hug. It brought heat to her face, but she still returned it with limp hands.  
真嗣不慎将瓶子掉落，随即起身。"明日香！明日香！哦，天啊，见到你真是太高兴了。快过来！"他用力将她拥入怀中。这让她脸颊泛起红晕，尽管如此，她还是用无力的双手回应了他的拥抱。

When he broke the hug, he put gentle hands on her cheeks and started to shake her a little. "My cello. D'you know where my cello is? Some people didn't know that I played! I wanna play 'em something!"  
他松开拥抱后，温柔地抚摸着她的脸颊，轻轻摇晃她问道：“我的大提琴在哪儿？有人还不知道我会拉琴呢！我想给他们露一手！”

She laughed a little, before putting a hand on his chest to disengage him a little. "We left it at home."  
她微微一笑，随即把手放在他胸口，轻轻将他推开一些。"我们把它忘在家里了。"

He looked off for a moment. "Home. Right. Y'know, i'ss really cool that we live together, because, um, you're really cool."  
他稍稍移开视线，说道：“家，没错。说真的，我们同住一个屋檐下，感觉太棒了，因为你真的很酷。”

"You too, Shinji. Hey, how about we slow down a little? I'll get you some water." She grabbed his wrist and guided him to a chair. "Sit tight."  
真嗣，你也一样。嘿，我们放慢点速度如何？我去给你倒杯水。"她握住他的手腕，引他坐到椅子上。"坐稳了。

As this happened, other people noticed the clear look of infatuation in Shinji's eyes. Some things never change.  
就在这时，旁人察觉到真嗣眼中流露出的明显迷恋。有些事，始终如一。

---

Asuka let the tap run cold. She opened a few of Kensuke's cabinets until she found a sizeable glass. Filling it, she made haste to where she left Shinji. He was on his phone.  
明日香打开了水龙头，让冷水流出。她在健介的橱柜中翻找，终于找到一个大小合适的玻璃杯。迅速装满水后，她赶回真嗣所在的地方，发现他正低头玩手机。

She took the phone from his hand. "Drink," she ordered.  
她从他手里拿过电话，命令道：“喝吧。”

Without a word, he accepted, drinking with both hands like a little kid.  
他默默无言，双手捧杯，如同孩童般饮下。

Asuka decided to look at his phone. He was texting Rei, who was abroad.  
明日香决定查看手机，他正在给身处国外的绫波发消息。

**S. Ikari: Rei S. Ikari: 零**

**S. Ikari: Rei S. Ikari: 零**

**S. Ikari: Rie S. 伊卡里：丽**

**S. Ikari: I got mIsato and Asuka but u T my only relative  
S. Ikari：我找到了 Misato 和 Asuka，但你才是我唯一的亲人。**

Good God, his typing was getting worse.  
天啊，他打字的技术越来越差了。

**R. Ayanami: I understand. You play a similar role in my life. Do not fret, I'll be back soon. You and Asuka can have me for dinner.  
R. 绫波：我明白了。你在我生命中的角色与我相似。别担心，我很快就会回来。你和明日香可以等我回来共进晚餐。**

She decided to take some initiative.  
她决定主动出击。

**S. Ikari: Hi Wondergirl. It's Asuka. We're at a party, and your brother had too much to drink. Not to worry, I have him under control.  
S. Ikari: 你好，Wondergirl，我是 Asuka。我们在参加一个聚会，你哥哥喝得有点多。放心吧，我已经把他安顿好了。**

A moment later, she got a response.  
过了一会儿，她就收到了回复。

**R. Ayanami: I understand. Say hello to everyone for me.  
R. Ayanami：我明白了。请代我向大家问好。**

**S. Ikari. Will do. S. Ikari 表示会完成。**

"Asukaaaaaaa. Asuka. I'm done the water," said Shinji, sounding like he just ran a race.  
"Asukaaaaaaa. Asuka，我已经把水弄好了，" 真嗣喘着气说，仿佛刚结束了一场赛跑。

Asuka took the cup from him. "Good. I'm gonna get you more, so sit tight, alright?"  
明日香接过他递来的杯子，说道："好的，我再去给你倒点，你先坐着别动。"

He nodded, and she went to refill.  
他点头示意，她随即去续水。

When she returned, Shinji was talking to someone. It didn't take long for her to realize it was Kirishima, who had grown her hair out more. His head was on her shoulder as he rambled about something.  
她回来时，发现真嗣正与某人交谈。不久她便认出那是桐岛，她的头发比以前更长了。真嗣的头倚在她的肩上，正喋喋不休地说着什么。

"Mana. Manamanamanamanamana. Isn't pilotin' a big ol' robot, like, the craziest thing?" he crooned.  
"玛娜。玛玛玛玛玛玛娜。驾驶那庞大的机器人，不正是最疯狂的事吗？"他柔声哼唱着。

She was giggling and twirling a lock of hair. "Yes, Ikari. It was."  
她咯咯地笑，手指缠绕着一缕头发。“是的，碇，的确如此。”

He looked up at her. "I'm gonna be honest. I'm so drunk right now, and this, like, never happens."  
他抬头望向她，坦白道：“说实话，我现在醉得不行，这种事，真的很少见。”

She patted him on the head. It made Asuka's eye twitch. "I think I can tell that."  
她轻拍了他的头，明日香的眼角不由得抽动了一下。"我想我看得出来。"

They maintained their eye contact until Shinji leapt out of his seat, almost pushing Kirishima over. "Bathroom! Where is it!?"  
他们一直保持着眼神接触，直到真嗣猛地从座位上跃起，差点撞倒桐岛。“洗手间在哪里！？”

Asuka chased after him, guiding him with subtle pushes to Kensuke's bathroom.  
明日香紧随其后，巧妙地引导他走向健介的浴室。

Shinji got on all fours and released the contents of his stomach. There went the dinner they ate beforehand.  
真嗣匍匐在地，呕吐出胃中的食物，之前享用的晚餐化为乌有。

"Ah... Asukaaaaaa..." he moaned, before returning more into the toilet.  
"啊...亚丝娜..." 他呻吟一声，再次退回厕所深处。

Asuka stuck her head out of the doorway, where Kirishima was standing around like a moron. She cleared her throat. "Water."  
明日香从门边探出头，只见雾岛呆呆地站在那里。她清了清喉咙，说道：“水。”

Moments later, Kirishima was back with a new cup, which Asuka snatched. She knelt down, putting a hand on Shinji's back.  
不久，切岛拿着新杯子返回，明日香迅速接过。她跪下身，一手轻放在真嗣背上。

"As'ka, I feel not so good," he said, looking at her like a sick puppy.  
"阿斯卡，我感到不太舒服，"他望着她，眼神如同病弱的小狗。

She grabbed a little toilet paper and wiped his mouth, then guided the water to his lips, which he accepted with desperation. "You had too much, Shinji."  
她拿起一小块卫生纸，轻拭他的嘴角，随后将水递到他唇边，他急切地喝下。“真嗣，你喝得太多了。”

He grunted. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."  
他嘟囔道：“对不起，真的对不起。”

She put a hand on his flushed cheek. Making sure he was looking at her. "Hey, hey look at me. It's alright. How many times have I been in this situation, huh?"  
她轻抚他泛红的脸颊，确保他目光与她交汇。"嘿，看着我。没事的。这种场面我经历过多少回了，对吧？"

Shinji smiled wearily. "Th'nk you, Asuka." He fell forward and gave her a clumsy hug. After a beat, he said "Y'r hair smells nice. Always has."  
真嗣疲惫地微笑着，“谢谢你，明日香。”他身体前倾，给了她一个略显笨拙的拥抱。片刻后，他轻声说道：“你的头发总是那么香。”

"Why, thank you," Asuka said, smiling.  
"哎呀，谢谢你，" 明日香笑着说。

She guided Shinji to his feet. "C'mon, let's get you some air."  
她扶起真嗣，说道：“走，带你去呼吸点新鲜空气。”

---

Shinji managed to be okay for the rest of the night, despite being completely wasted. The party calmed down, and he had a good amount of rambling in him, but Asuka kept him under control.  
尽管彻底醉了，真嗣还是设法平安度过了那个夜晚。派对气氛缓和下来，他话匣子大开，但明日香及时控制了局面。

"And-n' then, As'ka said "let's kiss" and I'm all like "the fuc' why?" and she's all-" he rambled to a fascinated Kensuke  
"接着，阿斯卡提议'我们亲吻吧'，我则疑惑地问'干嘛要这样？'，她便继续..." 他向听得津津有味的健介讲述着

"Alrighty!" Asuka interrupted. "How about a different story, huh? Ooh, what about that one teacher you had in that cooking class?"  
好嘞！" 明日香插话道，"换个话题如何？哎，聊聊你上烹饪课时的那位老师怎么样？

_"Oh my god!"_ This was Shinji's favourite story. He had told it once or twice, so she anticipated a drunken recollection. "Okay, ssho, this asshole, I'm cookin' right? I got this _great_, this great, great dish, right? And he..."  
天啊！" 这是真嗣最爱的故事。他曾提起过一两次，她料想这次又是酒后吐真言。"听着，这个家伙，我在做饭呢，对吧？我做了这道超赞的菜，明白吗？然后他...

Okay, maybe drunk Shinji was a little adorable.  
嗯，喝醉的碇真嗣确实有点惹人怜爱。

---

It was a few hours after midnight when the party wound down and Asuka decided to depart with Shinji. On the way out, he gave Strasberg a firm handshake and told him to 'get with Mana already.' He also said the same to Kensuke, so hopefully he didn't cause a fight.  
午夜已过数小时，派对渐入尾声，明日香决定与真嗣一同离去。临行前，他与斯特拉斯伯格紧紧握手，并催促他“赶紧和玛娜确定关系”。对健介也说了同样的话，希望这不会引起什么不快。

Asuka called a taxi, which arrived in a decent amount of time. The only challenge was wrangling a swaying Shinji.  
明日香叫来的出租车很快就到了。唯一棘手的是，得让摇摇晃晃的真嗣稳稳地坐进车里。

"As'ka," he slurred. "阿斯卡，" 他口齿不清地说。

"Yes, Shinji?" 怎么了，真嗣？

"L't's kiss." 我们接吻吧。

She giggled. "You're a bit too drunk for that, Shinji."  
她咯咯笑着说：“真嗣，你喝得有点过了。”

He straightened up. "No, I'm not! I'm good, I'm-look at me." Shinji grabbed her head with both hands. "Just a kiss. Just a teeny, tiny kiss. C'mere."  
他挺直腰杆，说道：“不，我没事！我很好，你看我。” 真嗣双手捧住她的脸。“就亲一下。就轻轻地亲一下。来吧。”

"Shinji, you're barely-mmph." Asuka was stopped by his lips crashing into hers. It was sloppy, and he was too drunk to kiss properly. Still, it made her spine chill.  
"Shinji，你几乎要说不出话来——" Asuka 的话被他突如其来的吻打断。这个吻既生涩又笨拙，他醉意朦胧，吻得毫无章法，却意外地让她感到一阵寒意沿着脊椎蔓延。

When the cab arrived, she chaperoned him into the back, and they were en route to home.  
出租车一到，她就陪他坐进后座，两人随即启程回家。

As Shinji was all but asleep on her shoulder, Asuka thought back to the conversation with Strasberg. He assumed they were dating, which probably meant others did the same. It wasn't that hard to explain, though! They were just roommates that did everything together, including accidentally being stuck in the other's bed. Nothing more.  
真嗣几乎在明日香的肩头睡着，她脑海中浮现出与斯特拉斯伯格的交谈。他误以为两人在交往，这或许意味着旁人也有此误解。其实解释清楚并不难！他们不过是同住一个屋檐下，共同生活，偶尔不慎睡到对方床上罢了。并无其他。

Still, that kiss. Despite it being kind of bad, it still elicited a response. A response that she wasn't sure Strasberg could get out of her if he tried.  
尽管那个吻有些糟糕，却依然激起了她的反应。她不确定斯特拉斯伯格若尝试，是否也能从她这里唤起同样的反应。

She sighed. Since high school, Shinji had really worked on being more outgoing. He still managed to annoy her, but in different ways. His food was still good, and he still cleaned up after her.  
她轻叹一声。自高中起，真嗣便致力于变得更为开朗。他依旧能以不同方式惹她生气，但他的厨艺依旧出色，且总是默默地在她之后收拾。

"Mmghmm... Asuka..." he muttered.  
"嗯... 明日香..." 他低声念叨。

"Yes, Shinji?" 怎么了，真嗣？

"Y're the best," he said, sticking a hand up to rub her cheek.  
"你是最棒的，"他边说边伸手轻抚她的脸颊。

She put her own hand on top of his. "Thanks. You aren't so bad yourself, Ikari."  
她把手覆在他的手上，微笑道：“谢谢你。碇，你其实也挺不错的。”

"I really, really, realllllllly," he said, stretching his words. "-Like you. Y're pretty and really great..." he incoherently trailed off. 

She just smiled and squeezed his hand.  
她微微一笑，紧握了他的手。

---

The cab reached their complex. Shinji always put Asuka in the bridal carry when they were in the reverse scenario. She was just as strong, but it felt weird to do the same, so she opted to put Shinji in a fireman's carry. She couldn't help but laugh when a finger came up and started drawing circles on her spine.  
出租车抵达了他们的住处。通常情况下，真嗣会用新娘抱的方式抱起明日香。尽管明日香同样有力，但反过来做总感觉不太对劲，因此她决定用消防员背负的方式来抱真嗣。当有手指在她背上画圈时，她不禁笑出声来。

She plopped Shinji onto the couch, then helped him stand. She guided him to the bathroom, where she commanded he wash his face and brush his teeth. He mumbled something about 'doing anything for her,' which prompted a blush, but the sloppy night routine carried on. She gave him some ibuprofen for the impending hangover.  
她将真嗣安置在沙发上，随后扶他起身。她领他到浴室，吩咐他洗脸刷牙。他含糊地说着'愿意为她做任何事'，让她不禁脸红，但混乱的夜间例行公事依旧进行。她递给他一些布洛芬，以缓解即将袭来的宿醉。

Asuka lead Shinji to his room and guided him onto his bed. Before he passed out, she threw his tank-top and shots at him, giving the order to change. A moment later, he called out _"G'night, As'ka!"_  
明日香领着真嗣走进他的房间，扶他躺到床上。就在他即将昏睡之际，她扔给他一件背心和短裤，让他换上。不一会儿，他迷迷糊糊地喊了声：“晚安，明日香！”

She opened the door once more. Shinji laid there, sprawled out. Leaving him as-is didn't feel right. He was going to wake up in genuine turmoil.  
她又一次打开了门。真嗣躺在地上，四肢伸展。任由他这样躺着，心里总觉得不妥。他醒来时必定会感到极度困扰。

_Screw it._ She shrugged. Just for the night, she would be next to him. That's all it was about. She pushed Shinji's arms aside and laid down stiff next to him. Eventually, she allowed herself to sink into the bed and find a comfortable position.  
就这样吧。她耸了耸肩。就这一夜，她决定躺在他的身边。仅此而已。她轻轻推开真嗣的手臂，僵直地躺下，随后渐渐放松，找到了一个舒适的睡姿。

Shinji's hand stayed on her shoulder. It was a nice hand.  
真嗣的手轻轻搭在她的肩头，温暖而舒适。

---

Asuka woke up feeling thoroughly warm.  
明日香醒来，感觉全身暖和极了。

The bed was comfortable. Her company was comfortable. A pair of arms was wrapped around her. She could feel a warm breath on her shoulder. She nuzzled into it.  
床铺舒适宜人，她的陪伴同样令人安心。一双臂膀温柔地环抱着她，肩上能感受到温暖的呼吸。她不由自主地依偎得更深了。

No hangover, since she was taking care of that idiot Shinji.  
她没有宿醉，因为她一直在照看那个傻瓜真嗣。

_Idiot-Shinji... 笨蛋真嗣..._

Wait, she was in his room, in his bed, in his arms! Her eyes shot open, and she craned her neck to see Shinji, sound asleep still. This was too comfortable, and it freaked her out just a little. Asuka decided to put her mind to other things. Breakfast. Shinji was going to be hungover, so he needed something to eat when he got up.  
等等，她竟然在他的房间，躺在他的床上，被他拥在怀里！她猛地睁开眼，扭头看向仍在熟睡的真嗣。这种舒适感让她有些不安。明日香决定转移思绪，考虑早餐的事。真嗣醒来时肯定会宿醉，需要吃点东西。

She rolled out of Shinji's bed, which elicited a groan from him. She slipped out of the room and into the kitchen.  
她从真嗣的床上悄然起身，引得他发出一声低沉的呻吟。她轻手轻脚地离开房间，走进了厨房。

Immediately, she got to work on scrambled eggs. While they began to cook, she set the toaster. It was already making her sweat. How did Shinji do this with such ease? The eggs were coming together nicely. She turned the heat down and prodded methodically at them.  
她立刻动手做炒蛋。蛋液入锅后，她又去设置烤面包机。厨房的热气已让她额头冒汗。Shinji 究竟是如何轻松应对这一切的？炒蛋逐渐成形，她便调小火力，细心地翻炒着。

The toast popped. She whipped around and put the pieces on a small plate, grabbing a bigger one and bringing it next to the stove. Back to the eggs. They were hitting that good consistency. She lifted the pan off of the stove and poured the contents onto a plate. The scrambled eggs sat in a nice pile, with steam and scent wafting off.  
吐司跳了出来。她敏捷地转身，把吐司放在小盘子里，又取了一个大盘子搁在炉边。继续关注煎蛋。蛋液已经煎至恰到好处的稠度。她从炉上提起锅，将煎蛋倒入盘中。炒蛋整齐地堆成一团，热气和香气扑鼻而来。

Asuka turned back the now-cooled toast. Shinji liked just butter on his, so she uncovered the stick that sat on their counter and spread liberally. She liked a mix of spreads on her toast, so she kept the knife to butter her own. She then grabbed the cream cheese out of the fridge, along with an extra knife from the drawer, and spread a perfect amount onto her second piece. She took the plates and set them down in the middle of their table.  
明日香把已经凉下来的吐司翻了个面。真嗣偏爱只涂黄油的吐司，她便从台面上拿起黄油棒，大方地涂抹起来。她自己则喜欢多种涂抹，所以留着刀子准备给自己的吐司涂黄油。随后，她从冰箱取出奶油奶酪，又从抽屉里拿了一把额外的刀，给自己的第二片吐司恰到好处地涂上了奶油奶酪。她端起盘子，放在餐桌正中央。

Shinji emerged from the hallway, rubbing his eyes. "Morning," he grumbled.  
真嗣从走廊里走出来，揉着惺忪的睡眼。“早啊，”他含糊地嘟囔着。

She crossed her arms and levelled him with a sly gaze. "How are you feeling, champ?"  
她双臂交叉，狡猾地盯着他，问道：“冠军，感觉如何？”

"I... I don't feel too great," he said with an expected level of grogginess. What he didn't say out loud was how soothing of a night's sleep he had. His brain wouldn't piece together why until much later.  
"我...我感觉不太舒服，" 他带着预料中的迷糊说道。他没说出口的是，那一夜的睡眠是多么的安稳。直到很久以后，他才明白其中的缘由。

Asuka chuckled. "What did we learn?"  
明日香轻声笑道：“我们有什么收获呢？”

"Don't drink too much." 别喝过量了。

She smiled. "Good. Well, I made some breakfast. What are roommates for right?" she said with pride.  
她笑着说：“好极了。看，我准备了早餐。室友不就是该互相照顾嘛。”语气中带着自豪。

Shinji blushed. "Ah, um, thank you, Asuka."  
真嗣脸颊泛红，轻声道："啊，那个，谢谢你，明日香。"

This damned idiot. Almost in his twenties and he reverted to his younger self whenever she did something nice. He sat down, and Asuka sat adjacent. They shared an even ambience of toast-crunching and fork-plate interaction.  
这个笨蛋，眼看就要二十了，可她一对他好，他就又变回了小孩子。他坐下后，明日香也挨着坐下。两人之间弥漫着一种平和的气氛，夹杂着咀嚼吐司和叉子轻触盘子的声响。

"Remember anything from the party?" she asked  
"你还记得派对上的事情吗？"她问道

Shinji closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to salvage. "Um, I was having a beer, then Toji kept putting these shots in front of me. I drank them and... a few other things. I was on a balcony, then I was in a cab?"  
真嗣闭眼片刻，似乎在努力回忆。“呃，我本来在喝啤酒，东治却不断递来烈酒。我喝了那些，还有点别的。记得在阳台上，后来就上了出租车？”

Asuka stifled a laugh. "Who did you see?"  
明日香强忍着笑，问道："你看到谁了？"

"Kensuke, Toji, uhh... Hikari, that one girl from our class Mayumi, some other people whose names I can't remember, and... Yeah, that's it."  
健介、透司、嗯...光、我们班那个叫真由美的女生，还有几位我记不清名字的同学，以及...对，就这些。

She flicked him on the nose, which made him flinch a little. His reaction made her heart flutter for some reason. "Looks like someone found out their alcohol tolerance, didn't they?"  
她轻弹他的鼻尖，他不由得微微一缩。这反应不知怎的，竟让她的心怦然跳动。"看来有人已经摸清了自己的酒量，对吧？"

He blushed harder. "Yes. I didn't make a mess, did I?"  
他脸更红了，说道：“是的。我没搞砸，对吧？”

"Only into Aida's toilet."  
只能进入艾达的洗手间。

"Oh, god. I need to call him and apologize or something." Shinji started to stand.  
"哎呀，天哪。我得赶紧给他打电话，道个歉或者采取点什么措施。" 真嗣站起身来。

Asuka grabbed his arm, stopping him in his tracks. "Just sit tight. Eat right now, you can call him later."  
明日香一把抓住他的胳膊，让他停了下来。“先别急，现在就吃饭，晚些时候再联系他也不迟。”

"Right, right." he returned to his eggs.  
"嗯，嗯。" 他继续吃起自己的鸡蛋。

After another beat, it was Shinji who spoke up. "By the way, thank you for looking out for me. You really didn't have to."  
片刻后，真嗣打破了沉默：“对了，感谢你的关照。其实你本不必如此。”

Now Asuka was blushing. "Wha-obviously! What do you mean by that!?"  
此刻，明日香满脸通红。“什-当然是这样！你那话到底什么意思！？”

He smiled. "Nothing, nothing. I'm just..." he sighed contently. "I'm glad you care."  
他微笑着说：“没什么，真的。我只是……”他心满意足地叹了口气，“有你在乎，我很欣慰。”

It made her pout. "Of course I do! We've known each other how long now? You aren't the only one who... Y'know..."  
她因此噘起了嘴。"我当然清楚！我们相识已有多久？你并非唯一知情的人..."

Shinji shifted in his seat. "Yes. I know." His hand was right next to Asuka's. Throwing self-doubt out the window, he slid it on top. Her hand was warm and soft. A perfect form of soothing that countered the turmoil his head and stomach were in. He was basically forcing eggs into his gullet, but Asuka's warmth helped him just that much. It was intriguing how she had that effect on him.  
真嗣在座位上挪了挪身子，答道：“嗯，我知道。”他的手紧挨着明日香的手。他抛开疑虑，轻轻覆上她的手。她的手温暖而柔软，恰到好处地安抚了他内心的纷乱。尽管他几乎是在硬塞鸡蛋下肚，但明日香的温暖确实让他好受了许多。她对他竟有如此影响，着实令人好奇。

Asuka's entire face was hot. Hands touching, the two roommates shared warmth, silence, and serenity. It felt right.  
明日香的脸颊滚烫。两人双手相触，室友间传递着温暖，四周静谧而祥和。一切恰到好处。

She turned her hand over and let her fingers curl into Shinji's.  
她翻转手掌，手指自然地蜷曲，握住了真嗣的手。

I also wrote about half of this while nursing a hangover of my own, so I hope you enjoyed my rigorous labour of love.  
我同样是在宿醉未消时完成了这篇文章近半的创作，愿你能感受到我这份倾注心血的劳动成果。

Have a good one, folks.  
大家好好享受吧。
