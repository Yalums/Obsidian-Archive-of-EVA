Das Ewige Dasein 永恒的存在

"The Eternal Life" “永恒的生命”

I remember when I was happy. I mean really happy. Not this fake façade that I can pass off with a smile and even a laugh and people believe me and they don't know that there's anything wrong. No, I mean really happy. I can still remember that.  
我记得我真正快乐的时候。不是那种我可以用微笑甚至笑声掩饰过去，让人们相信我一切都好，而他们不知道有任何问题的虚假表象。不，我是说真正的快乐。我至今仍记得那种感觉。

Everything was so different then. I didn't have a care in the world – I didn't have to have a care in the world. My mother handled the world for me and all I had to do was be a child. I didn't know there was anything wrong until it was too late. Until my mother was dead.  
那时一切都截然不同。我无忧无虑——我本就不需要有任何忧虑。母亲为我打理一切，我只需做个孩子。直到为时已晚，直到母亲去世，我才意识到有什么不对劲。

I stopped being a child that day. It didn't matter that my body was still small, my voice still inquisitive and my eyes still capable of growing wide and begging when I wanted something. Something snapped in my head the day she died, and all the world's color was washed away in a rain of gray and black. Happiness went with it, and I don't even think I remember how to be really happy like I was before.  
就在那天，我不再是孩子了。尽管我的身体依旧幼小，声音依旧充满好奇，眼睛依旧能在渴望某物时睁得大大的，带着哀求。母亲去世那天，我脑海中有什么东西断裂了，世界的色彩在一场灰黑色的雨中被冲刷殆尽。快乐也随之而去，我甚至怀疑自己是否还记得如何像从前那样真正地快乐。

Maybe it would have been different if I hadn't been the one to find her.  
或许如果我不是那个发现她的人，一切都会有所不同。

She had problems. I didn't know that then, because I was only seven years old. I couldn't have known then that it wasn't right to have to visit your mother in the hospital – the mental ward, I know now – every day, that it wasn't right to have done so for as long as you could remember. My mother had always had problems. She must have, because I can't think of a time when I didn't have to go to the hospital to see her. I thought it was normal. I thought there was nothing wrong with it. I didn't know that the reason she was in there was because she couldn't handle the stress of living as a mother in this big bad world that she left me in. That she just couldn't handle doing everyday duties like shopping or cleaning or caring for her daughter without getting frantic and confused. That she thought her daughter was a doll.  
她有她的难处。那时我并不知道，因为我才七岁。我那时不可能明白，每天去精神病院——我现在知道了，那是精神科——看望母亲是不正常的，也不应该从记事起就一直这么做。我母亲一直都有问题。她肯定有，因为我记不起有哪段时间不需要去医院看她。我以为那是正常的。我以为那没什么不对。我不知道她之所以在那里，是因为她无法承受作为一个母亲在这个残酷世界中生活的压力，这个她将我留下的世界。她就是无法处理日常事务，比如购物、打扫或照顾女儿，而不变得慌乱和困惑。她认为她的女儿是个玩偶。

I am a doll. I am a doll like that bitch Ayanami is, only I am not Ikari's doll. I am my mother's doll.  
我是一个玩偶。我就像那个贱人绫波一样，只是一个玩偶，但我不是碇的玩偶。我是我母亲的玩偶。

But then again, don't we all have problems?  
但话说回来，谁没有点问题呢？

I have a problem, Kaji tells me.  
我有个问题，卡吉告诉我。

Kaji. I smile, and I think of him again because whenever I think of him the world almost isn't so bad anymore. He is tall and well-built and his eyes are clear. His long brown hair is almost always pulled back into a soft ponytail that just touches his shoulders and he is always dressed so nicely. I wonder why he is not something more important in this whole operation. Doesn't Ikari see just how important Kaji is?  
卡吉。我微笑着，又想起了他，因为每当我想到他，世界似乎就没那么糟糕了。他高大健壮，眼神清澈。他那头长长的棕色头发几乎总是束成一个柔软的马尾，轻轻触到肩膀，而且他总是穿得那么得体。我不明白为什么在整个行动中他不是更重要的人物。难道碇司令看不到卡吉的重要性吗？

But then I wonder why Kaji is doing this at all. The world turns grey again and I can't get out of bed so I lie and stare at the colorless ceiling and wonder why Kaji does this. I don't think it's the money – I know the sum that NERV pays him can't be much. I know it's not for me – I'm a lost cause and all anyone has to do is open their eyes to see that. There is no hope for me.  
但随后我又疑惑，为什么薰要这么做。世界再次变得灰暗，我无法起床，只能躺在那里凝视着无色的天花板，思考薰为何要这么做。我不认为是为了钱——我知道 NERV 给他的报酬并不多。我知道不是为了我——我已是无望之人，任何人只要睁开眼睛就能看到这一点。我已无望。

"That's not it at all, Asuka," he tells me in that warm voice of his, as I stare out the window at the blue sky and the green grass and the younger children running after each other down the street while I sit in here and study EVA schematics and search for a reason why I can't get my synch ratio even higher than it already is. Shinji is catching up to me, and I can't let him do that.  
“根本不是那样，明日香，”他用那温暖的嗓音告诉我，而我则凝视着窗外蔚蓝的天空、翠绿的草地，以及街道上追逐嬉戏的孩子们，而我却坐在这里研究 EVA 的图纸，寻找为什么我无法让同步率再提高哪怕一点点的理由。真嗣正在追赶我，我不能让他得逞。

He can't be as good as I am.  
他不可能比我更优秀。

He can't be better than I am.  
他不可能比我强。

And I'm not even going to think about Ayanami.  
至于绫波，我甚至都不愿去想。

I know that's not my problem. I know the fact that I can never be happy – never be really happy – is something everyone thinks that I will get over, given time. Time. It's been years. *Years*. I'm not going to get over it.  
我知道这不是我的问题。我知道所有人都认为，我终会随着时间的流逝而释怀——那种永远无法真正幸福的感受。时间，已经过去好几年了。*好几年*。我无法释怀。

"It's your perfectionism," he says, "That's your problem, Asuka. You always want to be the best. You push yourself so hard. You should go easier on yourself. You're an EVA pilot – I know you can handle things."  
"是你的完美主义，"他说，"这就是你的问题，明日香。你总是想成为最好的。你对自己要求太严格了。你应该对自己宽容一些。你是 EVA 驾驶员——我知道你能处理好事情。"

I think he is saying more, but I can't hear him. I'm too busy thinking, _My mother couldn't handle things._ I don't know what that means for me.  
我想他还在说些什么，但我听不见。我正忙着思考，我母亲无法处理事情。我不知道这对我意味着什么。

The glass of the window I'm looking out of seems to have become a portal – a window into the past, because I can see the harsh white walls of the hospital stretching above me. The halls were so big when I was small, I didn't know if there really was a ceiling or if the noisily buzzing overhead lights were really a hundred noisy suns, shining down on me as I skipped down the hall to visit my mother.  
我望向的窗户玻璃仿佛变成了一个门户——一扇通往过去的窗户，因为我能看到医院那刺眼的白色墙壁在我上方延伸。当我小时候，那些走廊显得如此宽阔，我不知道是否真的有天花板，或者那些嘈杂的头顶灯光是否真的是一百个吵闹的太阳，照耀着我蹦蹦跳跳地穿过走廊去看望我的母亲。

Happiness. 幸福。

I was always happy when I got to see her. I lived with the delusion that it was normal for her to be a mother while sitting in her cold metal bed, wearing a thin blue hospital gown and laughing at jokes she had made up to tell herself. She always did that – she would sit there for hours and make up little nonsensical jokes, and she would tell them to herself and to me when I would come. I was young – I thought they were the funniest things I had ever heard. I didn't know.  
每当我能见到她时，我总是感到快乐。我生活在一种错觉中，认为她作为母亲，坐在冰冷的金属床上，穿着单薄的蓝色医院袍，自创笑话自娱自乐是正常的。她总是这样——她会坐在那里几个小时，编造一些毫无意义的笑话，然后对自己说，当我来的时候也会对我说。那时我还小——我认为这些是我听过的最有趣的事情。我不知道。

I never knew. 我从未知晓。

Not until it was over.  
直到一切结束之前。

"Asuka," she would say, cradling a red yarn-haired rag doll in her arms, speaking to it because she thought that I was that rag doll. I didn't know that, I thought she was speaking to me, as I looked up at her from the cold tile floor and wished she would look at me when she spoke. She was so far away from me, so high up because I was so small. She was pretty, too, and everything else anyone could ask their mother to be.  
她会抱着一个红线头发的布娃娃，说：‘明日香’，对着它说话，因为她以为我就是那个布娃娃。我并不知道，我以为她在对我说话，我抬头望着她，从冰冷的瓷砖地上，希望她说话时能看我一眼。她离我那么远，那么高，因为我太小了。她也很漂亮，还有其他任何人希望母亲拥有的所有美好。

Except sane. 除了理智。

"Asuka," she would say, "do you know what the duck told me yesterday?"  
"明日香，" 她会说，"你知道昨天那只鸭子告诉我什么了吗？"  
"No, Mama," I would say, grasping the bedrail with my pale little hands, standing up on tiptoe to hear what she would say next, still wishing she would look at me. "What did he say, Mama?"  
"不，妈妈，"我会说，用我苍白的小手紧紧抓住床栏，踮起脚尖听她接下来要说什么，仍然希望她能看我一眼。"他说了什么，妈妈？"

She would smile, and chuckle a little before answering, and that smile had never seemed crazy to me. The fact that she never looked at me, never really spoke to me directly never seemed crazy to me. But what did I know?  
她总是先微笑，轻笑一声再回答，那笑容在我看来从未显得疯狂。她从不看我，从不真正直接与我交谈，这些在我看来也从未显得疯狂。但我又懂什么呢？  
"He said to me that ducks like to eat quackers," she would grin at the Asuka-doll, and we would laugh, and I would be happy.  
她会笑着对明日香玩偶说：“他告诉我鸭子喜欢吃嘎嘣脆。”我们便一同笑起来，而我也会感到快乐。

I liked to wear my blue dress in to see her, because she always said I looked so pretty in it. She said I looked pretty every day, and she said that I would grow up to be a good little girl and that I would make her proud.  
我喜欢穿着那件蓝色裙子去看她，因为她总说我穿它时特别漂亮。她每天都夸我好看，还说我会长成一个乖巧的小女孩，将来会让她感到骄傲。

I always wanted to make her proud. And I am a good little girl. I am.  
我一直想让她为我骄傲。我是个乖巧的小女孩。我确实是。

I know now she was talking to her doll.  
我现在明白了，她当时是在跟她的玩偶说话。

"Asuka, I know you want to impress your mother," I remember someone telling me. I don't know who it was. Everything but my mother is just a watercolor blur of faces and voices up until the time that she died. After she died, that was when things became sharp, when someone took a razor and cut out my world, cut it out like I would cut out clothes for my paper dolls.  
“明日香，我知道你想给妈妈留下深刻印象，”我记得有人这么对我说过。我不记得是谁了。除了妈妈，其他的一切都只是模糊的水彩画，人脸和声音交织在一起，直到她去世的那一刻。她去世后，世界才变得清晰起来，仿佛有人用剃刀将我的世界割裂，就像我为纸娃娃剪裁衣服那样，将它割离。

I am a paper doll, someone else cut out a paper world for me.  
我是一个纸娃娃，别人为我剪出了一个纸世界。

That voice again, dripping out of the watercolors, and I still can't remember who it was. "I know you want to impress her. But you don't have to try so hard. She loves you just the way you are."  
又是那个声音，从水彩画中滴落出来，我依旧记不起那是谁。“我知道你想给她留下深刻印象。但你不需如此费力。她爱你，正是你现在的样子。”  
But that wasn't enough. I wanted to do great things, I wanted to be the best so that she would be proud of me and give me praise when I visited. But most of all I wanted to do great things because I thought they would make her look at me. If I made her proud, she would turn and look at me when she spoke. I just knew it. I could see it in her eyes, when she would glance at me, every once in a while, almost acknowledging I was there before turning back to the good little doll in her arms.  
但这还不够。我想成就伟业，我想成为最优秀的，这样她就会为我感到骄傲，在我探访时给予我赞扬。但最重要的是，我想成就伟业，因为我认为这会让她注视我。如果我让她骄傲，她说话时就会转过头来看我。我就是知道。我能在她的眼神中看到，每当她偶尔瞥向我，几乎是在承认我的存在，然后又转回她怀中那个乖巧的小玩偶。

I never got to see her eyes.  
我从未有机会看到她的眼睛。

Well, that's not true, I think, looking at the hazy reflection of my red hair, blue eyes, pale skin in the window as Kaji continues to go on about this plug connection or that.  
我望着窗户上模糊映出的红发、蓝眼和苍白肌肤，心想这并非实情，而此时，薰还在继续谈论着这个插头连接或那个。

I see those eyes all the time. I see those dead unblinking eyes staring at me out of her too-pale face, gaunt with the weight of the rope tied about her neck. I see her dead body hanging from the ceiling, cold and unmoving. I see her dead mouth, smiling, and I imagine the little joke she must have made up about death to tell herself at the last instant that made her smile like that. I see her dead hands, limp and no longer cradling her doll, which hangs dead and limp from the ceiling beside her.  
我时常看见那双眼睛。我看见那双死寂、不眨的眼睛从她过于苍白的脸上瞪视着我，她的面容因颈间绳索的重量而显得憔悴。我看见她的尸体悬挂在天花板上，冰冷而静止。我看见她那死去的嘴角，带着微笑，我猜想她在生命最后一刻对自己说了什么关于死亡的小笑话，才让她那样微笑。我看见她那无力的双手，不再怀抱着她的玩偶，那玩偶也和她一样，死气沉沉地悬挂在旁边。

I hear myself screaming, all the time, wearing that blue dress that matches the blue eyes that are full of tears, hearing my voice scream, "Mama! Mama! Mama!"  
我听见自己一直在尖叫，穿着那件与满含泪水的蓝眼睛相衬的蓝色裙子，听见自己的声音在呼喊：“妈妈！妈妈！妈妈！”

Something flooded over me, as I sunk to the floor, legs sprawled beneath me and shiny black patent leather shoes scraping along the cheap green and white checkered tile. The tears rolled down my cheeks, and my voice grew hoarse from calling her name. The doctors came in, shouting and yelling and I was lost in a sea of pant legs and voices. I had stopped yelling, and for another minute or so no one even seemed to notice I was in there.  
当我跌坐到地板上，双腿散乱地摊开，锃亮的黑色漆皮鞋在廉价的绿白格子瓷砖上摩擦时，一股情绪涌上心头。泪水顺着脸颊滚落，呼唤她名字的声音变得嘶哑。医生们冲了进来，大声呼喊，而我则迷失在一片裤腿和声音的海洋中。我停止了呼喊，有那么一分钟，似乎没有人注意到我的存在。

Then one of the nurses gasped and pointed, and someone yelled for her to get me out of there. I was bodily lifted and carried away, watching my mother's still white body lying on her still white bed, her hair spread out on the pillow like brown rays of sunshine, bobbing up and down over the nurse's shoulder as she swiftly carried me away from that place.  
随后，一名护士倒吸一口凉气，指着某个方向，有人大声呼喊让她把我带离那里。我被整个抱起，迅速带走，目光却停留在母亲那静止的白色身躯上，她躺在同样洁白的床上，头发如棕色的阳光般散落在枕头上，随着护士急速的步伐，在我眼前上下晃动，直至我被彻底带离那个地方。

I felt numb. I felt tired, after all my crying, and I know I felt scared. But there was something running underneath it all, something that had come as soon as I saw her, as soon as I began crying and screaming her name. Something soothing, taking the harshness off my fright, something that was now making the tears slow and stop and letting their trails begin to dry on my freckle-spotted cheeks.  
我感到麻木。在痛哭之后，我感到疲惫，我知道我也感到害怕。但在这所有情绪之下，有一种东西在涌动，它在我一看到她，一开口呼喊她的名字，开始哭泣和尖叫时就出现了。那是一种抚慰，减轻了我内心的恐惧，现在它正让泪水渐渐止住，让泪痕开始在我布满雀斑的脸颊上干涸。

I felt relieved. I didn't really know what to call it at the time, but I felt relieved somehow that it was finally over. That something had happened, because somehow even though I was so young I had known that this couldn't have gone on much longer. Something had to happen. Something had to break. And now, at least, she was out of her pain.  
我感到如释重负。那时我并不清楚该如何形容这种感觉，但就是觉得终于结束了，心里有种莫名的释然。发生了一些事情，因为尽管我还那么年幼，却隐约知道这一切不可能持续太久。总得发生点什么，总有什么需要打破。而现在，至少她摆脱了痛苦。

And I was just beginning mine. I felt torn – how could I feel so relieved that she was dead? That she wasn't moving and breathing and blinking and that she would never again laugh or talk or cry? How could I feel relief at my own mother's death? What kind of a person was I?  
而我才刚刚开始我的旅程。我感到内心撕裂——我怎能因为她的死亡而感到宽慰？她不再动弹、呼吸、眨眼，也永远不会再笑、再说话、再哭泣。我怎能因自己母亲的去世而感到宽慰？我究竟是怎样的人？

I didn't want to lose my mother. I didn't want her to be gone. I didn't.  
我不想失去母亲。我不想她离开。我真的不想。

And the yelling began again.  
然后，叫喊声再次响起。

"Mama! Mama! Mama!" "妈妈！妈妈！妈妈！"

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

I turn back to Kaji, who has closed his schematics book. I look at the clock on the wall and see that it's nearly time for him to leave. But he still has fifteen minutes –  
我转头看向已经合上图纸书的卡吉。我瞥了一眼墙上的钟，意识到他差不多该走了。但他还有十五分钟——

"I'll see you tomorrow, Asuka," he says softly, and shows himself out of the room.  
"明天见，明日香。"他轻声说道，随后自行离开了房间。

They're all so afraid, I think. They're all so afraid to do anything to upset me because they think I'm going to end up like her. They think that I'm going to end up frantic and scared and unable to take care of myself.  
我想，他们都很害怕。他们都不敢做任何可能惹恼我的事，因为他们认为我会变得和她一样。他们觉得我会变得狂乱、恐惧，无法照顾自己。

I stand, smoothing out the skirt of my yellow dress, tightening the red ribbon in my hair. I begin putting my books and blueprints away for lack of anything better to do. That's not going to happen to me, I think. That can't happen to me.  
我站起身，抚平黄色裙摆，紧了紧发间的红丝带。由于无事可做，我开始收拾书籍和蓝图。我心想，那种事不会发生在我身上，也不可能发生在我身上。

If that happens to me, then how will I make my mama proud? How will she ever be able to look down from Heaven and see me doing great things if I end up scared and small like she did?  
如果我遭遇了那种事，我该如何让妈妈为我骄傲？如果我最终变得像她那样胆小卑微，她又怎能从天堂俯瞰，看到我成就非凡呢？  
I have to be the best. I have to do it for my mama. I have to show her that the world was terrible to her but that I don't mind. I have to show her that I can do something with my life. That I can be the best – that I am the best.  
我必须成为最优秀的。我必须为了妈妈而努力。我必须向她证明，这个世界曾对她残酷，但我并不介意。我必须向她展示，我能够有所作为，能够成为最优秀的——我就是最优秀的。

I have to make my mama proud of her little red-haired doll.  
我得让妈妈为她的小红发娃娃感到骄傲。
