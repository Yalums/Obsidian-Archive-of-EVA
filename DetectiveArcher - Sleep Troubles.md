Shooting upright in a near blind panic, Shinji Ikari awoke in a cold sweat. The boy gasped raggedly as he quickly took stock of his surroundings. The fear of finding strange creatures writhing in the shadows of the night almost overwhelmed him, before he realized that he was where he should be and that the horrors hadn't followed him from his dreamscape. The familiarity of his room was comforting, even in the darkness of the night. Inside the boy's chest, his heart still hammered away mercilessly, driven by the terrible visions of his dreams. The mostly buried memories of Instrumentality forced themselves to be heard in the Third Child's sleep. As such, the nights that Shinji found restful slumber were few and far between.  
碇真嗣猛地从床上坐起，几乎是在盲目的恐慌中醒来，浑身冷汗。他急促地喘息着，迅速环顾四周。在意识到自己应该在的地方，那些梦中的恐怖生物并未从梦境中跟随他来到现实之前，他几乎被夜晚阴影中蠕动的不明生物的恐惧所淹没。房间的熟悉感在夜色中给予了他安慰。在他的胸膛里，心脏仍在无情地猛烈跳动，被梦中的可怕景象所驱使。那些大部分被埋藏的关于人类补完计划的记忆，在第三适格者的睡眠中强行浮现。因此，碇真嗣能找到安稳睡眠的夜晚寥寥无几。

Glancing across the room, the boy took in the glowing red numbers which glared mockingly back at him from his desk. Three in the morning. Letting out sigh, he allowed himself fall back onto his pillow. His bed had grown uncomfortably warm in his sleep, despite the slight autumn chill in the air. Shinji remembered a time as a child when he could cover his head in his blankets and feel perfectly safe from any imagined monsters. Of course, such simple comforts were beyond him now. Time and the knowledge gained growing up had stolen the only reassuring aspect of his childhood from him.  
环顾房间，男孩注视着桌面上那闪烁着红光的数字，它们仿佛嘲讽般地回瞪着他。凌晨三点。他叹了口气，任由自己倒回枕头上。尽管空气中带着些许秋日的凉意，他的床铺在他熟睡时已变得异常温暖。真嗣回忆起童年时，他可以把自己裹在被子里，感觉完全安全，远离任何想象中的怪物。当然，现在这种简单的慰藉已离他远去。成长的时间和所获得的知识夺走了他童年唯一令人安心的部分。

Staring at the off-white ceiling, he gathered his thoughts and tried to remember the strange visions that made up his nightmares. As with every other occasion, the images in his sleep evaded close scrutiny, fading from memory and leaving only the remembrance of abstract terror.  
凝视着那灰白色的天花板，他整理思绪，试图回忆起构成他噩梦的那些奇异景象。和以往每一次一样，睡梦中的画面逃避着仔细审视，从记忆中消退，只留下抽象恐惧的记忆。

The young, ex-pilot still couldn't completely piece together exactly what had transpired between seeing the mangled remains of Unit-02 and waking in the sea of LCL. Whatever had happened had muddled his memories, warped his recollection. He couldn't remember any specific thing during that time. The Third Child wondered if that was a good thing or not. Perhaps, those who had returned simply made themselves forget that world in order to be happy in this one. Certainly, a large portion of the already dwindled population had yet to return from that place, even a year after the Third Impact. But, if indeed there had been some peace to be found in that place, why hadn't he found it? Didn't he deserve some sort of satisfaction? Had his choice to return been the correct one? Not for the first time he pondered the question deeply.  
那位年轻的退役飞行员仍旧无法完全拼凑出，从目睹二号机残骸到在 LCL 之海中苏醒之间究竟发生了什么。无论发生了什么，都已模糊了他的记忆，扭曲了他的回忆。那段时间里，他记不起任何具体的事情。第三适格者不禁思索，这是否是一件好事。或许，那些归来的人们为了在这个世界中找到幸福，已经让自己遗忘了那个世界。确实，在第三次冲击一年后，仍有大部分已经减少的人口尚未从那个地方归来。但如果那个地方真的存在某种安宁，为什么他没有找到呢？难道他不配得到某种满足吗？他选择回来的决定是否正确？这不是他第一次深思这个问题了。

"Maybe," the boy wondered aloud, "I made a mistake coming back."  
“也许，”男孩自言自语道，“我回来是个错误。”

The truth of that world was lost to Shinji, and for good reason. Losing himself in that endless sea of humanity, that boundless world of flesh and bone and spirit, had simply been too _different_. The world and the collective human body stretched in every direction for as far as could be imagined. It expanded in every dimension and warped into strange angles that were unfathomable by human minds. That type of existence wasn't something mere humans were supposed to understand. However, the soul is a strange and resilient thing. The wonders and horrors of that place had found purchase in Shinji's nightmares and would not let go.  
那个世界的真相对真嗣而言已无从知晓，这自有其道理。在那无垠的人海中迷失自我，在那肉体与骨骼、灵魂交织的浩瀚世界中沉沦，实在是太过迥异。世界与集体的人体向四面八方延伸，直至想象力的极限，它在每个维度上扩张，扭曲成人类心智难以揣度的奇异角度。那样的存在，本非凡人所能理解。然而，灵魂是奇异而坚韧的。那里的奇迹与恐怖已扎根于真嗣的噩梦之中，挥之不去。

Eyeing the ceiling in the pale light of the low hanging moon, the very tired boy wondered, not for the first time, what had happened to him in that strange time and place. It was uncomfortably often that the boy found himself jostled into the waking world by the sights he found in his dreams. Many a time he'd found himself quietly weeping to himself in the wee hours of the morning, only to be unsure of the cause. Looking over at the glowing numbers on the alarm clock again, Shinji shuddered. He hated this time of night, these darkest hours, where men can't find rest, for thoughts of their own mortality. He wasn't always alone on nights like this. On more than one occasion, the boy had overheard Asuka crying softly to herself in the room across from his. The low, almost inaudible, sobbing ripped at his heart and twisted his stomach into knots, but the boy knew better than to go to her.  
在低悬月光的苍白映照下，凝视着天花板的疲惫少年再次思索，在那段奇异时空里，自己究竟遭遇了什么。梦境中的景象频繁地将他惊醒，这样的情形已屡见不鲜。多少次，他在黎明前的寂静中独自啜泣，却对缘由茫然无知。再次瞥向闹钟上闪烁的数字，真嗣不禁打了个寒颤。他厌恶这深夜时分，这最黑暗的几个小时，人们因思索自身生死而无法安眠。并非每个这样的夜晚他都孤单一人。不止一次，他曾听见隔壁房间的明日香轻声啜泣。那微弱到几乎听不见的哭声撕扯着他的心，让他的胃纠结成团，但少年深知，此时不宜去打扰她。

He'd been bold and made the mistake of trying to comfort her once. After a particularly horrifying dream, she'd woken screaming. It was difficult to tell whether she was simply terrified or in physical pain. In his fear for her wellbeing, he'd rushed to her side, only to find the violently shaking redhead lashing out at him, refusing to be consoled. Shinji wanted desperately to help, but found his throat tight and at a loss for words. In the end he'd left the shuddering girl curled up on her bed sobbing uncontrollably. The rest of the night, he sat outside her room and wept at his own worthlessness, Asuka's sobs drifting through the door.  
他曾大胆尝试过一次安慰她，却犯下了错误。在一次特别恐怖的梦境后，她惊醒尖叫。很难分辨她是单纯的恐惧还是身体上的痛苦。出于对她安危的担忧，他冲到她身边，却发现那个剧烈颤抖的红发女孩正向他猛烈反击，拒绝任何安慰。真嗣极力想要帮助，却发现自己喉咙紧绷，无言以对。最终，他离开了那个蜷缩在床上无法自控哭泣的女孩。那一整夜，他坐在她房间外，为自己的无用而哭泣，明日香的啜泣声透过门缝传来。

Asuka never wanted to talk about the dreams, making it difficult to find any sort of common ground. Given what had happened to his comrade, Shinji supposed he understood as well as he could. He decided it was better if he didn't press the matter. It wasn't his place to drag forth such scarring memories into the light of day. Even if he did force her to talk about her experiences, he doubted he'd be much help to. He never was.  
明日香从不愿谈论那些梦境，这让找到共同点变得困难。考虑到他同伴的遭遇，真嗣认为自己能理解的程度有限。他决定最好不要深究此事。他没有权利将那些创伤记忆拖到日光之下。即使他强迫她谈论她的经历，他也怀疑自己能提供多少帮助。他从未真正帮上忙。

What made the dreams even more unnerving was the fact that only he and Asuka seemed to have them. Nobody who'd returned remembered anything much after the death of Kaoru, Mankind's penultimate victory over the Angels. And so, the world returned, unsure of what happened. It was chaos for a while, but one year later, the world was turning again. Only the area in and around Tokyo-3 was completely destroyed, while everything else was, relatively, untouched. So, with capital of Japan being shifted to Tokyo-2, everything went along as it always had. Except, for two scared children cowering in fear of memories they didn't want.  
令梦境更加令人不安的是，似乎只有他和明日香经历了这些。从薰死后，人类对天使的倒数第二次胜利之后，所有归来的人几乎记不起什么。于是，世界回归，却对所发生之事一无所知。一时间混乱不堪，但一年后，世界再次运转。唯有第三新东京市及其周边彻底毁灭，其他地方相对而言未受波及。因此，随着日本首都迁至第二新东京市，一切如常进行。只是，有两个害怕的孩子，在不愿回忆的记忆中瑟瑟发抖。

It was at times like this, alone and surrounded by the darkness, that Shinji wondered why some people didn't come back. Did they find happiness in Instrumentality? Was this world too hard for them? Did they ever really exist in the first place? In an effort to flee from the thoughts, Shinji sat up, forced himself out of bed, and ventured into the kitchen for a glass of water. A cool breeze swept through the hall, and Shinji couldn't help be silently complain about the cold floors. Upon entering the kitchen, the Third Child stopped dead when he saw Asuka sitting at the table, bathed in the moonlight pouring in from the window.  
正是在这样的时刻，独自一人被黑暗包围，真嗣不禁思索为何有些人没有回来。他们在人类补完计划中找到了幸福吗？这个世界对他们来说是否太过艰难？他们最初真的存在过吗？为了逃离这些思绪，真嗣坐起身，强迫自己下床，走进厨房去倒一杯水。一阵凉风穿过走廊，真嗣忍不住在心里默默抱怨冰冷的地板。一进厨房，第三适格者便愣住了，他看到明日香坐在桌旁，月光从窗户洒进来，照亮了她。

Even now, he was taken aback by her striking features, accentuated by the silvery glow. However, now her loveliness was marred by heavy bags under her eyes and the obvious fatigue of sleepless nights. Lifting her darkened eyes, she stared across the room into Shinji's deep cobalt orbs. The two simply looked at one another for a moment that seemed to last for hours. "You too, huh?" Asuka broke the silence with the almost casual observation. Shinji simply nodded.  
即便现在，他仍被她那在银色光芒下更显突出的惊人美貌所震撼。然而，此刻她的美丽却被浓重的黑眼圈和明显因失眠而疲惫的神态所破坏。她抬起那双黯淡的眼睛，直视着真嗣深邃的钴蓝色眼眸。两人就这样对视了一会儿，仿佛时间凝固了数小时。“你也是吗？”明日香打破了沉默，用一种近乎随意的语气说道。真嗣只是点了点头。

Without needing to be asked or told, the boy drifted over and sat opposite the beautiful girl. For a long moment neither said a word, both simply glad for the other's company. When someone finally spoke it was Shinji. "How do you feel?" Shinji had learned to stop using wording that made Asuka uncomfortable. The question was a modified version of 'Are you alright?' If she noticed or even cared about the hidden meaning, the weary young woman gave no indication.  
无需询问或告知，男孩便飘然而至，坐在美丽的女孩对面。良久，两人都未发一言，只是为彼此的陪伴感到欣慰。最终开口的是真嗣。“你感觉怎么样？”真嗣已经学会避免使用让明日香感到不适的措辞。这个问题是“你还好吗？”的改良版。如果她注意到或在乎这隐含的意义，这位疲惫的年轻女子并未表露出任何迹象。

Asuka simply shrugged and did her best to sound calm and collected. "I'm tired. I haven't had a decent night's sleep in…God, I don't know how long." Shinji nodded, understanding. The lack of sleep was starting to affect him as well. During the day, the claws of sleep would grasp at him as well, slowing his motions and muddling his thoughts. Every day the ex-pilot found his exhaustion growing steadily as his sleep became less and less restful.  
明日香只是耸了耸肩，尽力表现出平静和镇定。“我很累。我已经很久没有好好睡过一晚了……天啊，我都不知道有多久了。”真嗣点头表示理解。缺乏睡眠也开始影响他，白天时睡意也会向他袭来，减缓他的动作，混淆他的思绪。每一天，这位前驾驶员都发现自己的疲惫在逐渐增长。他的睡眠越来越不安稳。

Swallowing hard, Asuka gave her late-night companion a serious look. "Shinji, I know we've never exactly been… on good terms. And, maybe not all of that is your fault…most of it is, but not all." The boy hid a smile, knowing that this was the closest thing to an apology he was going to get from Asuka. Ever. The smile evaporated from his thoughts as Asuka unconsciously rubbed her left eye. "You always tried to talk, and I was…less than accommodating. But now, I need someone to talk to."  
艰难地咽了咽口水，明日香对这位深夜的同伴投以严肃的目光。“真嗣，我知道我们从未真正……关系融洽过。也许，并非所有的不愉快都是你的错……大部分是，但并非全部。”男孩藏起一丝微笑，明白这已是他能从明日香那里得到的，最接近道歉的表示了。永远如此。然而，当明日香无意识地揉搓左眼时，他心中的微笑消失了。“你总是试图交谈，而我……并不怎么配合。但现在，我需要有人倾听。”

Shinji thought he heard the slightest hint of tears in her voice, and more than a little fear. He decided to chalk it up to the lack of sleep. It was less distressing that way. It had been a tough time sharing space for the two pilots. Neither never quite understood exactly what happened during Instrumentality, but both somehow felt an air of uneasiness between them. They'd steered carefully clear of talking about the incident on the beach. It was less distressing that way.  
真嗣觉得他听到了她声音中微弱的泪意，以及更多的恐惧。他选择将其归咎于缺乏睡眠，这样想不那么令人心烦。两位驾驶员共处一室的日子一直很艰难。他们都不完全明白在人类补完计划期间发生了什么，但两人之间似乎总弥漫着一种不安的气氛。他们小心翼翼地避开了关于海滩事件的谈话。这样想不那么令人心烦。

Despite their restlessness he felt in her presence, Shinji still tried to be near Asuka. He cared for her in a way he couldn't easily describe, least of all to himself. He simply knew that he wanted to help the beautiful girl across from him in any way he could. Mustering all of his strength, Shinji reached out and placed his hand over Asuka's. Fighting down the urge to flinch, the girl gave him a hard glare. "I said 'talk to,' not 'molest me.'" Shinji found it odd that even after saying that, Asuka made no move to pull away from the touch. Slowly withdrawing his hand, the Third Child muttered something akin to an apology. As the comfort and warmth of Asuka's hand faded into memory, Shinji felt a stab of disappointment. He wasn't exactly surprised at the reaction, but he'd still hoped she would be able to appreciate the gesture. Shinji pushed the thought aside and waited a moment before speaking again. "What do you dream about?"  
尽管在她的陪伴下感到不安，真嗣仍然试图靠近明日香。他对她的关心难以言表，更不用说对自己解释了。他只知道，他想尽自己所能帮助眼前这位美丽的女孩。鼓起所有勇气，真嗣伸出手，覆在明日香的手上。尽管女孩强忍着退缩的冲动，用严厉的目光瞪着他，“我说的是‘跟我说话’，不是‘非礼我’。”真嗣觉得奇怪，即便如此，明日香并没有抽回手。他缓缓收回手，第三适格者低声嘟囔着类似道歉的话。随着明日香手上的温暖与安慰消散在记忆中，真嗣感到一阵失落。他并不惊讶于这种反应，但仍希望她能理解这一举动。真嗣将这念头搁置一旁，稍等片刻后再次开口：“你梦见什么了？”

The girl's heavily bagged eyes lost focus and became hazy. It was almost as if she were peering at something far away, a sight mercifully hidden from the waking world. A deluge of memories swept through the Teutonic redhead's thoughts: her hanging mother, the 15th Angel's assault on her psyche, the Lance of Longinus, the mind searing agony of being eaten alive by the Eva Series.  
女孩那双因疲惫而布满眼袋的眼睛失去了焦点，变得朦胧。仿佛她在凝视着远方，那景象被仁慈地隐藏在清醒的世界之外。一连串的记忆涌入这位日耳曼红发少女的思绪中：她悬挂着的母亲，第 15 使徒对她心灵的攻击，朗基努斯之枪，以及被 EVA 系列机体活生生吞噬的痛苦。

"A lot of things." “很多事情。”

Somehow, Shinji understood what images were still burned into Asuka's mind and carefully steered the conversation away from her. "What do you think happened?" He didn't need to elaborate. Anyone he asked would have understood what the boy was referring to. Laying her head on her crossed arms, Asuka gave a noncommittal noise. "I'm not sure. I can't really remember anything happening after I….After I lost to the Eva Series." The girl cleared her throat and continued. "Everything just went dark." She shivered at the memory. In the end, there hadn't been a tunnel for her. No choir, no open arms, no absolution. Only an emptiness, dark and silent and complete. The cold of the grave. She forced the unnerving thoughts away. "After that, I only get bit and pieces. Small fragments of a bigger picture. Nothing really makes sense. The next thing I remember clearly is waking up on the beach…with you."  
不知怎的，真嗣理解了哪些画面仍深深烙印在明日香的心中，并小心翼翼地将话题从她身上引开。“你觉得发生了什么？”他无需多言，任何一个被问及的人都会明白这个男孩所指何事。明日香将头枕在交叠的双臂上，发出一声模棱两可的声响。“我不确定。我真的记不清在那之后……在我输给 EVA 系列机之后发生了什么。”女孩清了清喉咙继续说道，“一切突然就陷入了黑暗。”她因回忆而颤抖。最终，她并没有经历所谓的隧道。没有合唱，没有张开的怀抱，没有宽恕。只有一片空虚，黑暗、寂静且彻底。如同坟墓般的寒冷。她强迫自己驱散这些令人不安的思绪。“在那之后，我只记得一些零星片段，大图景中的小碎片，一切都毫无头绪。我记得最清楚的，就是醒来时在海滩上……和你一起。”

Swallowing hard, Shinji kept his eyes low. "Asuka, about that-"  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，目光低垂。“明日香，关于那件事——”

She looked away from him, staring out the window. "Don't say anything. I'd rather not talk about it." Her voice was uncharacteristically soft, the statement sounding more like a plea than a command.  
她转过头去，望向窗外。“什么都别说。我宁愿不谈这个。”她的声音异常柔和，那句话听起来更像是恳求而非命令。

The boy gave a meek nod. It was a horrifying and awkward moment for both of them. Shinji was never sure as to why he did what he had, but at the moment it had made perfect sense. The only thing he'd ever known in his life was pain and loss and sorrow. In that brief, dark moment on the sands of the beach, the sky stained with crimson and the air smelling thickly of blood, Asuka symbolized everything he hated about the world and himself. As he wrapped his hands around her throat he wanted nothing more than to destroy the beautiful girl and everything she meant to him. Occasionally, he could still feel the heat and pulse of her neck in his hands. The phantom sensation made him physically ill.  
少年怯懦地点了点头。那一刻，对他们两人来说都是既恐怖又尴尬。真嗣从未确切明白自己为何会做出那样的举动，但在当时，一切似乎都合情合理。他一生所知的，唯有痛苦、失落与悲伤。在那片沙滩上，短暂而黑暗的瞬间，天空被血色染红，空气中弥漫着浓烈的血腥味，明日香成了他所憎恨的世界与自己的一切象征。当他双手紧扼她的喉咙时，他只想摧毁这位美丽的少女以及她对他所代表的一切。偶尔，他仍能感受到她颈间的热度和脉动，那幻觉般的触感令他感到生理上的不适。

Asuka watched as Shinji slowly clenched and unclenched his fists. That eerie sensation of pressure on her throat returned. She quickly decided not to pay the thought any attention, focusing solely on Shinji's clearly distressed face. It wasn't that she didn't forgive the boy; she simply didn't want to talk about the event. It wasn't about her own needs or feelings, she just didn't want Shinji to freak out and blame himself like he always did. She didn't want to talk about it for his sake. It definitely had nothing to do with her. She decided to change the subject. Her current thoughts were getting a little too upsetting.  
明日香注视着真嗣缓缓地握紧又松开拳头。那种诡异的压迫感再次袭上她的喉咙。她迅速决定不去理会这个念头，全神贯注地盯着真嗣明显焦虑的脸庞。并不是她不原谅这个男孩；她只是不想谈论那件事。这无关乎她自己的需求或感受，她只是不想让真嗣像往常一样失控并自责。她不想谈论这件事，是为了他好。这绝对与她无关。她决定换个话题。她现在的思绪变得有些过于令人不安。

"Anyway, what do you dream about?"  
“话说，你都梦见些什么？”

Still working his hands, Shinji spoke in a low voice, barely a whisper. He worried that if he spoke of the dreams too loudly they would hear and come to torment him in the light of day.  
真嗣依旧摆弄着双手，低声细语，几乎是在耳语。他担心如果大声谈论这些梦境，它们就会听见，并在白日里来折磨他。

"I don't know." The boy clasped his hands together, as much to stop them from shaking as anything else. "I see different things all the time, and I don't understand most of it. I think they're memories from that place. All I can remember is uncertainty and regret. Pain and ambiguity."  
"我不知道。" 男孩紧握双手，与其说是为了阻止它们颤抖，不如说是为了其他。"我总是看到不同的东西，但大部分我都不理解。我想那是那个地方的记忆。我能记得的只有不确定和后悔。痛苦和模糊。"

The Teutonic redhead absently scratched her right arm as she leaned back in her chair, suddenly feeling cold. "That seems a weird place for people to want to stay. I mean, there are plenty of idiots who didn't come back. Why would they stay in that sort of place?"  
那位日耳曼血统的红发女子无意识地挠了挠右臂，向后靠在椅背上，突然感到一阵寒意。"那种地方似乎不是人们愿意停留的。我是说，有很多傻瓜没回来。他们为什么还要留在那种地方？"

"I don't know. Maybe they're happy there."  
"我不知道。也许他们在那里很快乐。"

Silence filled the air between them. Asuka quickly stood up, "Well, since neither of us is going to get any sleep tonight, wanna watch TV?" Shinji blinked several times, not quite keeping up with the conversational track change. After a few moments he nodded and followed her to the living room.  
寂静在他们之间弥漫。明日香迅速站起来，“好吧，既然我们今晚都睡不着，要不要看电视？”真嗣眨了几次眼，跟不上话题的突然转变。过了一会儿，他点了点头，跟着她走进客厅。

Plopping unceremoniously down on the couch, Asuka flicked the television on and began channel surfing. Setting down lightly next to her, Shinji lowered himself, sinking into the comfortable cushions. He made sure to leave a comfortable distance between them.  
明日香不拘小节地坐到沙发上，打开电视开始换台。真嗣轻轻地坐在她旁边，身体沉入舒适的靠垫中，特意保持了一段舒适的距离。

The programs gave way to one another in an endless flashing of color and motion as Asuka quickly scanned the range of stations. Finding nothing to her liking, the strawberry haired girl decided to randomly stop and subject herself to whatever fate had in store for her. Finally stopping on a dated murder mystery film, she sank deeply into the sofa.  
节目一个接一个，色彩和动作在屏幕上闪烁不停，明日香迅速浏览着各个频道。找不到喜欢的节目，这位草莓色头发的女孩决定随机停下，任由命运安排。最终停在了一部过时的谋杀悬疑电影上，她深深地陷入了沙发中。

Shinji tried to keep his eyes on the screen, but found that, despite his best efforts, they constantly drifted towards Asuka. She was wearing a long yellow t-shirt that ended near her thighs, and grey cotton shorts that peeked out a short distance from the edge of the bright top. Swallowing hard, he took in the glorious sight of the young woman's legs. They seemed to go on forever. Quickly forcing his errant gaze back to the television, Shinji silently admonished himself. Of course Asuka was attractive, but he shouldn't just treat her as an object. Asuka was a person and deserved to be treated with dignity.  
真嗣试图将目光锁定在屏幕上，但发现自己尽管尽了最大努力，视线还是不由自主地飘向明日香。她穿着一件长及大腿的黄色 T 恤，灰色棉质短裤从亮色上衣边缘稍稍露出。他艰难地咽了口唾沫，尽情欣赏着这位年轻女子那似乎永无止境的美腿。他迅速将游离的目光拉回到电视上，默默地责备自己。当然，明日香很迷人，但他不应该只把她当作一个物品。明日香是一个人，应该得到尊重。

After a few moments of stalwart dedication, the Third Child found his gaze shifting to the young woman at his side. Trying his best to hide his peeking, he took in every aspect of her beauty. Her bright, shining blue eyes, her stunning figure, her perfect lips, her delicate hands. Everything about her exuded grace and splendor. She was almost too perfect. She seemed like an animated sculpture of a goddess. Once again catching his thoughts traveling in less chivalrous directions, Shinji chided himself on his impure thoughts and focused on the glowing screen with all his willpower.  
经过片刻坚定的专注，第三适格者发现自己的目光又转向了身旁的少女。他尽力掩饰自己的偷瞄，尽情欣赏着她的每一处美丽。她那明亮闪耀的蓝眼睛，迷人的身材，完美的嘴唇，纤细的手。她的一切都散发着优雅与辉煌。她几乎完美得过分，仿佛一尊活生生的女神雕像。再次意识到自己的思绪偏离了正轨，真嗣责备自己那些不纯洁的想法，用尽全力将注意力集中在发光的屏幕上。

Asuka glanced out of the corner of her eye and once again caught Shinji trying to surreptitiously observe her. She hid a smile as he quickly looked away and half-heartedly tried to watch the boring movie. In spite of her often heated screams of Shinji being a "pervert" or "degenerate" she found herself taking a strange enjoyment in his attention. Of course, the fiery ex-pilot would never admit that to anyone. She had an image to maintain. If the boy ogling her had been anyone but Shinji, she would have promptly kicked his ass up around his ears. For some reason, she had a soft spot for the awkward boy.  
明日香用眼角余光一瞥，再次捕捉到真嗣正偷偷观察她。她掩藏住笑意，看着他慌忙移开视线，心不在焉地试图观看那部乏味的电影。尽管她时常尖叫着骂真嗣是“变态”或“堕落者”，但她发现自己竟对这种关注感到一种莫名的愉悦。当然，这位火爆的前驾驶员绝不会向任何人承认这一点。她得维护自己的形象。如果偷看她的不是真嗣，她早就毫不犹豫地把他揍得满地找牙了。不知为何，她对这个笨拙的男孩总有一丝柔软之处。

Shinji wasn't bad to look at. He certainly wasn't ugly. He was just cute, perhaps even good looking, in a different manner than she was used to. He was attractive in a sad poet sort of way. His dark blue eyes and dark hair gave his slightly pale face a striking allure. His only problems were his confidence issues. Asuka knew that if Shinji were surer of himself, there would be very few girls who wouldn't be interested in him. The thought made the Second Child uncomfortable. She'd often had thoughts about the nature of Shinji's relationship with Wondergirl. Those two had been close on a strange level Asuka didn't understand, but one which still made the German pilot worry. In truth, Asuka silently rejoiced that Ayanami had yet to return from the Sea of LCL.  
真嗣长得并不差，当然也不丑。他只是可爱，甚至可以说帅气，只是与她习惯的那种风格不同。他有种忧郁诗人的吸引力。深蓝色的眼睛和深色的头发，为他略显苍白的脸庞增添了引人注目的魅力。他唯一的缺点是自信不足。明日香知道，如果真嗣能更自信一些，很少有女孩会对他不感兴趣。这个想法让第二适格者感到不安。她时常思考真嗣与绫波之间的关系本质。那两人在一种明日香无法理解的奇异层面上很亲近，但这种亲近仍让这位德国驾驶员感到担忧。事实上，明日香暗自庆幸绫波还未从 LCL 之海归来。

Asuka quickly derailed her train of thought. _Wait a minute. This is SHINJI I'm thinking about. There's no way I was jealous over him. Wait, what am I saying? I was never jealous of Wondergirl at all._ Slowly biting her lower lip, she continued to argue the point with herself. _I am NOT attracted to Shinji. No way. Never happen. Ok, maybe a little attracted, but he's kinda cute and I have spent a lot of time near him. It's just hormones. Yeah, that's it._ Not quite convinced, Asuka decided to drop the matter and return her attention to the glowing TV screen.  
明日香迅速打断了自己的思绪。等等，我在想的是真嗣啊。我怎么可能因为他而嫉妒呢。等等，我在说什么？我根本就没有嫉妒过绫波。她缓缓咬着下唇，继续在心里争辩。我绝对没有对真嗣动心。不可能的。永远不会。好吧，也许有点动心，但他确实挺可爱的，而且我经常在他身边。这只是荷尔蒙作祟。对，就是这样。尽管不太信服，明日香还是决定不再深究，将注意力转回到发光的电视屏幕上。

For a long time, neither teenager said anything. Basking in the glow of the television, the two simply enjoyed one another's presence in silence. As the movie began to wrap up, Asuka could feel her eyes growing heavy. Shaking her head lightly to keep the edges of sleep from curling around the edges of her mind, Asuka straightened up. She was surprised when she felt a warmth press against her shoulder.  
很长一段时间里，两个少年都没有说话。沐浴在电视的光辉中，两人只是静静地享受着彼此的存在。随着电影接近尾声，明日香感到自己的眼皮越来越沉。她轻轻摇头，试图驱赶睡意的边缘，不让它们缠绕在思绪的边缘，明日香坐直了身子。当她感觉到一股温暖触碰到她的肩膀时，她感到惊讶。

Shinji had nodded off and slumped over, resting against his redheaded roommate. When the moment of stunned surprise passed, Asuka smiled lightly at the boy leaning against her. It was nice to have him so close. She quickly shoved the sleeping body hard enough to wake him. His head snapping around, Shinji realized he had fallen asleep and quickly began to apologize. He was cut short when Asuka rested her head on his shoulder and leaned against him.  
真嗣不知不觉间打起了瞌睡，身体倾斜，靠在了他那红发的室友身上。当震惊的瞬间过去后，明日香对着依偎在她身边的男孩微微一笑。能这样靠近他，感觉真好。她迅速用力推了推熟睡的身体，足以将他唤醒。真嗣猛地抬头，意识到自己睡着了，急忙开始道歉。但当明日香将头靠在他的肩膀上，依偎着他时，他的话被打断了。

"You know, you make a pretty decent pillow Shinji. I guess you're not completely useless after all." The girl slowly trailed off as sleep finally claimed her. Not quite sure what to do, Shinji remained motionless, doing his best to give Asuka a restful sleep. A short time after the Second Child, Shinji slowly drifted into sleep.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，你当枕头还挺不错的。看来你也不是完全没用嘛。" 女孩的声音渐渐低沉，最终被睡意征服。真嗣不知所措，一动不动，尽力让明日香能有个安稳的睡眠。不久后，第二适格者也渐渐进入了梦乡。

The sun began to crest the horizon, painting the sky a dark pink. The two sleeping children, each content that the other was near, shared their first restful sleep in a long time.  
太阳开始升起，将天空染成深粉色。两个熟睡的孩子，各自满足于对方就在身边，久违地享受了一次安稳的睡眠。
