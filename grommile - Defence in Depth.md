The designers of the Evangelion neural interface had gone to some trouble to protect the pilot from being absorbed or mentally contaminated by the Evangelion.  
设计 EVA 神经接口的设计师们费尽心思，以保护驾驶员不被 EVA 吸收或精神污染。

Unfortunately for Shinji and Asuka, the dual synchronization scenario was not considered.  
遗憾的是，对于真嗣和明日香来说，双重同步的情景并未被考虑在内。

(Fixing the problems I have with this story will take nearly as much work as starting over. The new version is here: [Defensive Design](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46705951).)

### Chapter 1 Prologue - Abstract
Neurological safety and security in the Evangelion Project - a lack of defence in depth  
《福音战士新剧场版》项目中的神经安全与保障——缺乏深度防御

Akagi R, Ibuki M 赤木律子，碇真嗣  
Tokyo-3, 2017 东京-3，2017 年

The primary security boundary in the interface between the pilot and the Evangelion consists of the filter circuits integrated into the Entry Plug. Early designs of this interface featured additional filter circuits in the A10 neural connectors worn by the pilots. Once the Entry Plug's filter circuits were proven to be more than adequate for all reasonable situations, the filters in the A10 connectors were removed on the grounds that they impaired the pilot's synchronization ratio.  
驾驶员与 EVA 之间界面的主要安全边界包括集成在插入栓中的滤波电路。该界面的早期设计在驾驶员佩戴的 A10 神经连接器中还包含额外的滤波电路。一旦插入栓的滤波电路被证明在所有合理情况下都绰绰有余，基于它们会损害驾驶员同步率的理由，A10 连接器中的滤波器就被移除了。

In this paper, the authors report on the psychological and physiological consequences of this design decision for two pilots who underwent emergency dual synchronization during the Angel attack on the UN Pacific Fleet.  
本文中，作者报告了这一设计决策对两名飞行员在联合国太平洋舰队遭受使徒攻击时紧急双人同步的心理和生理后果。

Before you ask, no, Shinji did not bring Aida and Suzuhara into the entry plug during the fight with Shamshel.  
在你问之前，不，真嗣在对抗夏姆榭尔的战斗中并没有将相田和铃原带入插入栓。

### Chapter 2 Debriefing - Gaghiel
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki Kōzō looked at the red-headed teenage girl in front of him and wondered again why he had ever let himself be caught up in this madness. "Pilot Sōryū, what was your rationale for bringing Pilot Ikari into the Entry Plug with you?"  
副司令官冬月耕造看着面前这位红发少女，再次疑惑自己为何会卷入这场疯狂。“驾驶员惣流，你带驾驶员碇进入插入栓的依据是什么？”

Asuka glanced sideways at Captain Katsuragi as if seeking comfort or support. "I... The safest place in an Angel battle is the inside of an Entry Plug, sir."  
明日香侧眼瞥向葛城美里队长，仿佛在寻求安慰或支持。“我……在使徒战斗中，最安全的地方就是插入栓内部，长官。”

Fuyutsuki sighed and raised an eyebrow. "While certainly true, that doesn't quite justify your behaviour. Let me phrase my question differently. What was your rationale for putting Pilot Ikari in a situation where bringing him with you into the Entry Plug was the most suitable choice?"  
冬月叹了口气，扬起眉毛。“虽然确实如此，但这并不能完全解释你的行为。让我换个方式提问。你把碇司令置于必须带你进入插入栓的情境，背后的逻辑是什么？”

"I wanted to show off my Evangelion to him," admitted Asuka, cheeks colouring as she again looked towards Katsuragi. "We were right there in the hangar when the alarm sounded."  
“我想向他炫耀我的 EVA，”明日香承认道，脸颊泛红，再次看向葛城。“警报响起时，我们正好在机库。”

"I can understand that. Contrary to popular belief, I too was once young and enthusiastic." Fuyutsuki glanced down at the slim manila folder containing the initial report from the Pacific Fleet. "The admiral had a great deal to say about this incident, very little of it friendly, and I will be directing most of it to the attention of NERV Berlin. Their decision to transport your Evangelion by sea fitted with standard B-Type equipment is a shocking oversight."  
“我能理解那种心情。与普遍看法相反，我也曾年轻且充满热情。”冬月瞥了一眼装有太平洋舰队初步报告的薄薄马尼拉文件夹。“上将对这次事件有很多话要说，几乎没有友善的，我将大部分内容转达给 NERV 柏林。他们决定用海运方式运输你的 EVA，并配备标准 B 型设备，这是一个令人震惊的疏忽。”

Asuka frowned at him, but kept her reply brief. "Thank you, sir."  
明日香皱着眉头看向他，但回应简洁。"谢谢您，先生。"

Fuyutsuki sat back in his chair. "Captain Katsuragi, do you have anything to add?"  
冬月坐回椅子上。"葛城司令，您有什么要补充的吗？"

"You did a good job out there, Asuka," said Katsuragi, smiling. "Nobody could have done better."  
“你做得很好，明日香，”葛城笑着说，“没有人能做得比你更好。”

"Thank you, ma'am." Asuka looked like she'd bitten down on a lemon.  
"谢谢您，女士。" 明日香看起来像是咬了一口柠檬似的。

"Well, Pilot Sōryū," said Fuyutsuki, doing his best to keep his tone light, "you are very welcome here at NERV Tokyo-3. Dismissed."  
"那么，驾驶员惣流，" 冬月说道，尽力让自己的语气保持轻松，"你在 NERV 东京-3 非常受欢迎。解散。"

Lieutenant Ibuki Maya had been staring at the psychograph readings on her computer screen for ten minutes before raising an empty coffee cup to her lips sparked a sudden insight. She switched over to a command line window, tapped in a few adjustments to the analysis settings, and rose wearily from a chair really not designed to be occupied for hours on end. "Akagi-sempai, would you like another coffee?"  
一尉伊吹玛雅盯着电脑屏幕上的心理图表读数已经十分钟了，直到她将空咖啡杯举到唇边时突然灵光一闪。她切换到一个命令行窗口，敲入了几个调整分析设置的指令，然后疲惫地从一把本不适合长时间坐着的椅子上站了起来。"赤木前辈，您要再来杯咖啡吗？"

Akagi Ritsuko rose equally wearily from her seat, shaking her head. "Not now. I scored some spare go-pills from an SDF pilot a few days ago. Should still be some left, just let me find them."  
赤木律子同样疲惫地从座位上起身，摇了摇头。“现在不行。前几天从一个 SDF 飞行员那里弄了些备用的高能药丸。应该还剩一些，让我找找。”

Maya looked down into her empty cup, trying to hide her shock. "I... I don't take drugs, sempai."  
Maya 低头看着自己空空如也的杯子，试图掩饰她的震惊。“我……我不吸毒，前辈。”

"Caffeine just makes you wired. Speed makes you smarter." Ritsuko grinned. "Paul Erdős stopped taking speed once. He didn't write a single paper that month."  
“咖啡因只会让你兴奋。兴奋剂让你更聪明。”律子咧嘴一笑。“保罗·埃尔德什有一次停止服用兴奋剂。那个月他一篇论文都没写。”

"I'll just, uh, stick to coffee, sempai," squeaked Maya as she retreated from their shared office. Walking as briskly as she could manage down the hall, Maya found Captain Katsuragi standing opposite the coffee machine, muttering to herself.  
"我还是喝咖啡吧，前辈，" 玛雅紧张地低声说道，从他们共用的办公室退了出来。她尽可能快步走在走廊上，发现葛城司令正站在咖啡机对面，自言自语地嘀咕着。

"Ah, Captain? Are you all right?" asked Maya.  
"啊，司令？您还好吗？" 玛雅问道。

"Oh, just paperwork. The fleet wants us to pay for its ships. Replacing those destroyers costs less than the repair bill from Operation Yashima, but it's the principle of the thing. We're not the Navy's paymasters." Katsuragi knocked back the contents of her cup. "How's life treating you, Lieutenant?"  
"哦，只是些文书工作。舰队要我们为他们的船只买单。更换那些驱逐舰的费用比耶志魔作战的修理费要低，但这事关原则问题。我们不是海军的财务主管。" 葛城一口喝干了杯中的咖啡。"你最近过得怎么样，中尉？

Maya hesitated for a moment, wondering whether to mention her sempai's little habit. "Um, I had an unusual offer this evening," she said, as she keyed in her order on the coffee machine. "And I think I'm getting somewhere with the data from Asuka's fight."  
玛雅犹豫了一下，不知道是否该提到她的前辈的小习惯。“嗯，今晚我收到了一个不寻常的提议，”她一边说，一边在咖啡机上输入订单。“而且我觉得我从明日香战斗的数据中找到了一些线索。”

"Your sempai trying to lead you into temptation, is she?" asked Katsuragi, waggling her eyebrows.  
“你的前辈是想引你入歧途吗？”克图里亚挑了挑眉毛问道。

Maya felt her cheeks burning. "Captain! Nothing like that! She just, uh, likes something a bit stronger than coffee to keep her going."  
玛雅感到脸颊发烫。“队长！不是那样的！她只是，呃，喜欢喝比咖啡更浓烈的东西来提神。”

"Oh, right. Yeah, that sounds like Ritz. Anyway. I'll get back to my numbers and let you get back to yours. G'night!"  
"哦，对。是啊，听起来很像丽兹。总之。我会继续处理我的数据，你也可以继续你的了。晚安！"

Maya grabbed her coffee from the machine and headed back down the hall. As she approached the office door, she heard Ritsuko cursing loudly.  
玛雅从咖啡机里拿了咖啡，沿着走廊往回走。当她走近办公室门口时，听到了律子大声咒骂的声音。

"That pig! That absolute pig! I'll..." Ritsuko tailed off as Maya walked back in. "Um. It seems I don't have those go-pills any more. Could I trouble you to get me a coffee?"  
"那个混蛋！那个彻头彻尾的混蛋！我要……"" 律子话说到一半，看到玛雅走了进来。""呃。看来我的提神药已经没了。能麻烦你帮我拿杯咖啡吗？"

Maya sighed. "Sempai. I think I'm getting somewhere with these psychographs. Let me just check the results first."  
玛雅叹了口气。“前辈，我觉得我对这些心理图谱有些进展了。让我先检查一下结果。”

Settling into her seat, Maya unlocked her screen and grinned. The idea she'd had when she ran out of coffee had worked. "Sempai, I know what's wrong with these psychographs."  
玛雅坐定后，解锁了屏幕，露出了笑容。她没咖啡时想到的那个主意奏效了。“前辈，我知道这些心理图谱的问题出在哪儿了。”

"Go on." “说下去。”

"The Entry Plug protects the pilot from being contaminated by the Evangelion, but in a dual sync scenario, the pilots are both on the same side of the filter circuit. At high sync ratio..."  
"Entry Plug 保护驾驶员不受 EVA 污染，但在双人同步的情况下，两位驾驶员都处于过滤电路的同一侧。在高同步率时..."

"I'll be damned." Ritsuko smacked herself on the forehead. "Misato mentioned Asuka and Shinji both seemed a little _off_ after the battle, and not just in the way Shinji always is. I'll get them in for a sync test ASAP."  
"真是见鬼了。" 律子拍了拍自己的额头。"美里提到明日香和真嗣战斗后都显得有些不对劲，不仅仅是真嗣一贯的样子。我会尽快安排他们进行同步测试。"

### Chapter 3 Resonance
Ikari Shinji lay in the darkness staring at his bedroom ceiling, unable to sleep despite an exhausting day. He'd wanted to say something to Asuka - it felt strange to think so familiarly of a girl he'd only just met, but it felt even stranger _not_ to - as she came out of her debriefing, but the thunderous look on her face as she stalked down the hallway made him hold his tongue. Misato had come out a few minutes later, apologized to him for having "all the paperwork ever" to do, and asked a Section Two agent to drive him home.  
碇真嗣躺在黑暗中，盯着卧室的天花板，尽管疲惫不堪却无法入睡。他想对明日香说些什么——对一个刚认识的女孩如此熟悉地思考，感觉很奇怪，但什么都不说感觉更奇怪——当她从简报室出来时，但她怒气冲冲地走在走廊上的表情让他闭上了嘴。几分钟之后，美里出来了，为有“永远做不完的文书工作”向他道歉，并请第二分部的特工开车送他回家。

Now he was stuck with only his racing thoughts for company. Synchronizing to Asuka's Unit 02 had been a very different experience to synchronizing to Unit 01, yet even that paled in comparison to the strangeness of having someone else in the loop. He'd tried to concentrate on the sensory inputs of the Evangelion itself, but keeping Asuka's thoughts out of his head entirely had proven impossible. Given the way she'd looked at him after they finally got out of the Entry Plug, he suspected she'd had exactly the same problem in reverse.  
现在，他只能与自己纷乱的思绪为伴。与明日香的二号机同步，与和零号机同步截然不同，但即便如此，也比不上与他人共享思维的奇异感。他试图专注于 EVA 本身的感官输入，但完全屏蔽明日香的思绪却是不可能的。从她最终离开驾驶舱后看他的眼神来看，他怀疑她同样遇到了相反的问题。

Some of those thoughts wouldn't leave his head. For her, piloting Eva was the best possible thing in the world. She was fascinated by the ponytailed man accompanying her - Mr Kaji - and determined to win his favour, even though it had been perfectly clear to _Shinji_ that Kaji was far more interested in Misato, who he'd obviously met before. Her thoughts about Shinji, in turn, were a confusing muddle he couldn't follow and couldn't forget.  
有些思绪挥之不去。对她来说，驾驶 EVA 是世界上最美好的事情。她对陪同她的马尾男子——加持先生——着迷，并决心赢得他的青睐，尽管对真嗣来说，加持显然对美里更感兴趣，他们显然之前就认识。她对真嗣的想法则是一团混乱，他无法理解也无法忘却。

That was a little, he conceded, like his own thoughts about Asuka. She was pretty. She was good at piloting Eva. She was full of herself. She had a very short temper. He didn't really like her, but he still wanted to get to know her better. He wanted to understand where those thoughts stuck in his head came from.  
他不得不承认，这有点像他自己对明日香的想法。她很漂亮。她擅长驾驶 Eva。她自视甚高。她脾气很暴躁。他其实并不喜欢她，但他仍然想更好地了解她。他想弄明白那些萦绕在他脑海中的念头究竟从何而来。

Shaking his head, he got up and walked through to the kitchen. Maybe a glass of water would help.  
他摇了摇头，起身走向厨房。或许一杯水会有所帮助。

---

Asuka Langley Sōryū lay in the darkness staring at the ceiling of Kaji's guest bedroom, her eyes still red from crying. She'd tried to make another pass at Kaji when they got to his apartment, and it had gone even worse than the first. It would have been easier if he'd said the same things she was thinking about herself now, or even if he'd just been cold and blunt, but no. He'd had to be _kind_ about it and point out his own vices.  
在黑暗中，惣流·明日香·兰格雷躺在加持的客房里，盯着天花板，眼睛因哭泣而依然红肿。他们到达加持的公寓后，她试图再次接近他，结果比第一次还要糟糕。如果他说出她现在对自己想的那些话，或者哪怕只是冷酷直接地拒绝，事情都会简单些，但并没有。他必须以善意的方式指出自己的缺点。

Her luggage being a casualty of the battle didn't help. NERV had provided a change of clothes for her so she could get out of her plugsuit and shower away the LCL, of course, but going to her debriefing in a T-shirt and sweatpants - because even though this was Japan, the quartermaster didn't have a regular uniform in her size - was not an experience she wanted to repeat.  
她的行李在战斗中成了牺牲品，这并没有带来任何帮助。NERV 为她提供了一套换洗衣物，这样她就可以脱下插入栓服并洗掉 LCL，当然，但在 T 恤和运动裤中参加简报会——因为即使在日本，军需官也没有她尺寸的常规制服——这不是她想再次经历的事情。

_Shinji_ had been fine, of course. He'd gone to his debriefing in a perfectly normal shirt and slacks. Perks of being the Commander's son, she wanted to say, but the unwanted thoughts that had leaked into her head during the battle made it impossible to believe. Even she had more of a connection with her adulterous father than Shinji did with his.  
当然，真嗣一直都没事。他穿着一件完全正常的衬衫和长裤去参加简报会。作为司令的儿子的特权，她想这么说，但战斗中无意间涌入她脑海的那些念头让她无法相信。即使她与她那有外遇的父亲之间也有更多的联系，而真嗣与他父亲之间却没有。

Oh yes, those thoughts. She wanted them out of her head. She didn't want to know what it felt like to have your Evangelion blasted with a particle beam that made a mockery of AT Fields, and she _certainly_ didn't want to know what that other female pilot's breast felt like - he was a pervert remembering something like that so sharply - but she couldn't quite make herself hate someone who'd watched his mother...  
哦，是的，那些念头。她希望它们从她的脑海中消失。她不想知道被粒子束击中使 AT 力场成为笑柄的 EVA 是什么感觉，她当然也不想知道另一位女飞行员胸部的感觉——他是个变态，记得那么清楚——但她无法让自己恨一个目睹了自己母亲的人...

Someone who'd watched his mother...  
一个曾目睹母亲...

She thought she'd run out of tears for one night.  
她以为自己那一晚已经流尽了眼泪。

---

Shinji was standing by the sink when the kitchen light came on. He blinked, wincing in the sudden brightness, and turned towards the door. His guardian stood there, a slightly dumbfounded look on her face. "M-Misato-san?"  
厨房的灯亮起时，真嗣正站在水槽旁。他眨了眨眼，因突如其来的光亮而皱眉，转身面向门口。他的监护人站在那里，脸上带着些许茫然的表情。“美里小姐？”

"Are you all right, Shinji?"  
"你还好吗，真嗣？"

"I'm..." Shinji glanced down at his half-empty glass. "Misato-san, is... is Asuka all right? She looked really angry when she came out of her debriefing."  
"我...我..." 真嗣瞥了一眼他那半空的杯子。"美里小姐，...明日香她还好吗？她从简报室出来时看起来真的很生气。"

Misato smirked and opened her mouth as if to crack wise, then stopped and shook her head. "I don't know. Kaji lined himself up a two-bedroom apartment. I think he took her back there. I don't think she'll be staying there long."  
美里轻蔑地笑了笑，张嘴似乎要开个玩笑，然后停了下来，摇了摇头。"我不知道。加持给自己安排了一个两居室的公寓。我想他带她回那里了。我觉得她不会在那里住很久。"

"You were going to say something else, weren't you?"  
"你本来还想说些别的，对吧？"

"I was going to say something stupid, Shinji. Grown-ups are good at that." She pulled off her beret and tossed it over her shoulder. "We say things like 'I need a beer'. Want one? It might help you sleep."  
"我本来想说些蠢话，真嗣。大人们在这方面很擅长。"" 她摘下贝雷帽，随手扔到肩后。""我们常说'我需要一杯啤酒'。想喝吗？或许能帮你入睡。"

Shinji shook his head vigorously. Watching her pour cans of the stuff down her throat every night was enough to make him very sure he didn't want to try it himself. "I'll be all right. Just needed to clear my head. Good night, Misato-san. Sleep well."  
真嗣用力摇了摇头。每晚看她灌下那些罐装啤酒的情景，足以让他确信自己不想尝试。""我会没事的。只是需要清醒一下头脑。晚安，美里小姐。祝你睡个好觉。""

> So you may notice that I have been switching names of Japanese characters to native order, having previously written them in Western order.  
> 所以你可能会注意到，我已将日本角色的名字从西式顺序改为本国顺序，之前我一直是按西式顺序书写的。

> Asuka, having been raised in a Western household by a Western father and Western stepmother, does not get this treatment. (Partly because it interacts really weirdly with three-part names.)  
> 明日香，由于在一个西方家庭中长大，由西方父亲和西方继母抚养，所以没有采用这种处理方式。（部分原因是这与三部分名字的组合方式真的很奇怪。）

### Chapter 4 Surface Tension
Misato looked at the stack of paperwork on her desk and sighed. Improbably for a Sunday morning, there was _more_ of it than when she went to sleep the night before. Most of it, she was sure, could perfectly well be dealt with by civilian clerks, but she couldn't hand any of it off without reading it all first. She grabbed the first folder from the top of the stack and was just about to start reading when her phone rang.  
美里看着桌上堆积如山的文件，叹了口气。不可思议的是，尽管今天是星期天早晨，文件却比昨晚睡觉前还要多。她确信其中大部分完全可以由文职人员处理，但她不先读一遍就无法交给任何人。她从文件堆顶上抓起第一个文件夹，正准备开始阅读时，电话响了。

"Katsuragi here," she answered.  
“我是葛城，”她接起电话。

"It's Kaji. Look, I screwed up and made a girl cry."  
"是加持。瞧，我搞砸了，把一个女孩弄哭了。"

Misato pinched the bridge of her nose. Kaji had been back in Japan less than twenty-four hours and he was already giving her a headache. "What happened?"  
美里捏了捏鼻梁。加持回到日本还不到二十四小时，就已经让她头疼了。“发生了什么？”

"Asuka made a pass at me again. I turned her down, because _hell no_, and I was even nice about it, but..."  
"明日香又对我示好了。我拒绝了，当然不行，而且我还很客气，但是……"

Misato leaned back and looked at the texturing pattern of the acoustic tile ceiling. "But nothing upsets a teenage girl with a crush on an older man like being reminded she's too young for him."  
美里向后靠去，凝视着吸音瓷砖天花板的纹理。“但没有什么比提醒一个暗恋年长男性的少女她太年轻更让她心烦的了。”

"Right." “好的。”

"Fine. Obviously she can't stay at your place, then." Misato stuck the folder back on top of the stack and pondered the practical options.  
“好吧。显然她不能住在你那里了。”美里将文件夹重新放回那一摞文件上，思考着实际的选项。

"Obviously. Any room at yours?"  
“显然。你那里有空房间吗？”

"Not rea-" She stopped, as a tolerable option came to mind. "Oh, to hell with it. Asuka can have my room. The storeroom's got a window, I don't have time to bring dates home, and I don't need any of the crap in there."  
"不是真——" 她顿住了，一个可行的选项闪过脑海。"哦，去他的。明日香可以住我的房间。储藏室有窗户，我没时间带人回家，而且我也不需要里面的那些破烂。"

"Seriously?" "真的吗？"

"Yes. You're paying for the removals van and the new furniture." A whimsical impulse seized her at that moment. "Oh, and for yakiniku and fancy beers for two next Saturday."  
"是的。你负责搬家货车和新家具的费用。" 那一刻，她突然心血来潮。"哦，还有下周六的烤肉和高级啤酒，两人份。"

"Deal. See you later." "成交。回头见。"

Misato sighed as Kaji hung up. She didn't need a teenage girl living in her apartment, she didn't need to be turning the place upside down at no notice, and she _definitely_ didn't need to have just invited herself on a dinner date with her idiot ex. She returned the handset to the cradle, pulled her beret back on, and walked out of the office, realizing as she left that Asuka was going to need to go _shopping_ as well.  
美里叹了口气，看着加持挂断电话。她不需要一个十几岁的女孩住在她的公寓里，不需要在没有任何通知的情况下把地方翻个底朝天，更不需要刚刚邀请自己那个白痴前男友共进晚餐。她将手机放回底座，重新戴上贝雷帽，走出办公室，离开时意识到明日香也需要去购物。

---

"I'm home!" announced Misato's voice from the hallway.  
"我回来了！" 美里的声音从走廊传来。

Shinji started at the sound of her arrival, and nearly dropped the glass he was drying up on the floor. "Misato-san? What's wrong?"  
真嗣听到她的到来声，差点把手中的玻璃杯掉在地上。“美里小姐？怎么了？”

Misato walked into the kitchen, typing a text message into her mobile phone. "That idiot Kaji upset Asuka last night, and she's moving in here."  
美里走进厨房，在手机上输入着短信。“那个笨蛋加持昨晚惹恼了明日香，她要搬来这里住。”

Shinji scratched his head, trying to make sense of this announcement. He was pretty sure Asuka wouldn't want to share a room with either of them, and there wasn't a third bedroom. "Ah, Misato-san..."  
真嗣挠了挠头，试图理解这个消息。他很确定明日香不会想和他们中的任何一个共用房间，而且这里也没有第三间卧室。“啊，美里小姐……”

"Don't worry, Shinji, your modesty will not be in peril! I'm giving her my room. I'll sleep in the storeroom." She stuffed her phone back into her jacket pocket. "They'll be here soon. I'll take Asuka clothes shopping. Could you help Kaji clear out my junk so there's room for a bed?"  
"别担心，真嗣，你的谦逊不会受到威胁！我把我的房间让给她。我睡储藏室。" 她把手机塞回夹克口袋。"他们很快就会到了。我带明日香去买衣服。你能帮加持清理一下我的杂物，腾出放床的空间吗？"

Shinji felt a sudden and not-quite-unfamiliar sense of _irritation_ with his guardian. "Why aren't you staying to help?"  
真嗣突然感到一种并不陌生的恼怒，针对他的监护人。"你为什么不留下帮忙？"

"Because Asuka's luggage got trashed during the fight," replied Misato.  
"因为明日香的行李在战斗中被毁了，" 美里回答道。"

"... Right." Shinji sighed. He'd been hoping for a nice, quiet, relaxing day, with maybe a trip to buy groceries. At that thought, a random flicker of Asuka's tastes sprang to mind. "Asuka hates fish. Could you get some pork or chicken?"  
"...好吧。" 真嗣叹了口气。他原本期待着能有一个宁静放松的日子，或许还能去买点杂货。想到这里，明日香对食物的偏好突然在他脑海中闪过。"明日香讨厌鱼。你能买些猪肉或鸡肉吗？"

"I'll try and fit that in. We can get delivery if it's easier." Misato paused for a moment. "Wait, how did-"  
"我会尽量安排。如果更方便的话，我们可以叫外卖。" 美里顿了一下。"等等，你怎么会知道——"

The doorbell interrupted her. "Coming!" she shouted, as she spun on her heel and headed back to the front hall. Shinji set down the glass and followed behind her, wanting to at least briefly see Asuka now instead of waiting until evening.  
门铃打断了她的话。"来了！" 她喊道，随即转身快步走向前厅。真嗣放下杯子，跟在她后面，想至少现在就见见明日香，而不是等到晚上。

The front door slid open to reveal an underslept-looking and gloomy Asuka and her scruffy, ponytailed crush. "Hi Katsuragi. One Second Child, safe and sound."  
前门滑开，露出了一脸疲惫、神情阴郁的明日香和她那扎着马尾、邋遢的暗恋对象。“嗨，葛城。二号机驾驶员，安然无恙。”

Asuka sighed. "So you're taking me shopping in your uniform?"  
明日香叹了口气。“所以你是穿着制服带我去购物？”

"Only if I need to intimidate the store staff," replied Misato. "Right, Kaji. We'll be back once Asuka's got a decent set of outfits. Do try and have the removals done by then. Shinji, keep an eye on this scoundrel and make sure he doesn't try to pilfer my panties."  
“只有当我需要震慑店员时才会这么做，”美里回答道，“对吧，加持。等明日香买完像样的衣服我们就回来。到时希望你已经把搬家的事搞定了。真嗣，看好这家伙，别让他偷我的内裤。”

Shinji snorted at that remark. "As if he'd want to."  
真嗣对那句话嗤之以鼻。“好像他会想要似的。”

Misato gave him an odd look over her shoulder, then shook her head. "Ready, Asuka?"  
美里回头给了他一个奇怪的眼神，然后摇了摇头。“准备好了吗，明日香？”

"No, but let's go." “没有，但我们走吧。”

Shinji watched Misato and Asuka depart, feeling discomfited by Asuka's manner. She didn't seem like the girl he'd met yesterday. "So, ah, where do we start?" he asked Kaji.  
真嗣看着美里和明日香离开，因明日香的态度感到不安。她似乎不再是昨天遇见的那个女孩了。“那么，呃，我们从哪里开始呢？”他问加持。

"You're the man of the house, Shinji," said Kaji, grinning broadly. "Tell me, does Katsuragi still starfish in her sleep?"  
“你是家里的男人，真嗣，”加持咧嘴笑着说，“告诉我，葛城还是睡觉时像海星那样摊开吗？”

### [Chapter 5](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/42250910): Awareness  
第五章：觉醒

### Chapter Text 正文

Asuka prodded half-heartedly at her lunch. Despite having only eaten half her breakfast, she just wasn't hungry. She looked up from the plate to see a worried look on Misato's face.  
明日香无精打采地戳着午餐。尽管早餐只吃了一半，她就是没有胃口。她从盘子上抬起头，看到美里脸上带着担忧的表情。

"Talk to me?" said Misato.  
“跟我说说？”美里说道。

"What about?" riposted Asuka, the walls around her heart snapping up with reflexive ease.  
"什么意思？"明日香反驳道，心中的壁垒瞬间筑起，轻松自如。

"Why a growing teenage girl who hasn't eaten since 8am is picking at her lunch like she's stuffed, maybe."  
"或许是因为一个从早上 8 点就没吃过东西的青春期少女，现在却像吃饱了一样挑挑拣拣地吃着午餐。"

"Not hungry." "不饿。"

Misato reached across the table with her chopsticks and plucked a piece of tonkatsu out of Asuka's bowl.  
美里用筷子越过桌子，从明日香的碗里夹走了一块炸猪排。

"Hey! That's my lunch!" 嘿！那是我的午饭！

"You said you weren't hungry." Misato flashed a brief grin before turning serious again. "If you eat up, we can have this conversation later. If you don't, we'll have it right here and now."  
你说过你不饿的。" 美里短暂地露出一丝笑容，随即又恢复了严肃。"如果你吃完，我们可以稍后再谈。如果你不吃，我们就现在这里谈。

Asuka poked at her lunch again with her own chopsticks. "Fine," she said, laying the utensils down. "Kaji's an asshole."  
明日香再次用她自己的筷子戳了戳午餐。“好吧，”她说着放下餐具，“加持是个混蛋。”

"I know, but that's not why he turned you down." Misato's expression went from 'serious' to 'stern'. "If anyone had got wind of him saying 'yes', he'd be having a very interesting conversation with Section Two right about now."  
“我知道，但这不是他拒绝你的原因。”美里从‘严肃’转为‘严厉’。“如果有人听到他说‘好’，他现在就得跟第二课进行一场非常有趣的对话了。”

"What do you-" Asuka stopped as her brain caught up with Misato's implications. "But... but _I_ asked _him_!"  
“你什么意思——”明日香话说到一半，脑子跟上了美里的暗示。“但是……但是我问的他！”

"That just means he'd only fall down the stairs _once_. I know you're upset, but, well."  
“那只是意味着他只会从楼梯上摔下来一次。我知道你很沮丧，但是，嗯。”

_I mustn't run away._ Asuka blinked. _That_ was certainly a sentiment she'd never felt a need for before. "Fine, fine, I get it. You're right. Can we finish the shopping now?"  
“我不能逃避。”明日香眨了眨眼。这种感觉她以前确实从未需要过。“好吧，好吧，我明白了。你说得对。我们现在可以完成购物了吗？”

Misato smiled and nodded. "Sure. I have to warn you, though, you might not appreciate the next bit."  
美里微笑着点点头。“当然。不过我得提醒你，接下来的部分你可能不会喜欢。”

"Why's that?" “为什么这么说？”

"Well, you're starting school with Shinji and Rei on Tuesday, so you'll need a set of school uniforms."  
“嗯，你周二就要和真嗣、绫波一起上学了，所以你需要一套校服。”

Asuka rolled her eyes, but bit back the urge to challenge Misato on either point. It wasn't an argument she was likely to win. "Let's get it over with."  
明日香翻了个白眼，但还是忍住了反驳美里任何一个观点的冲动。这场争论她不太可能赢。“那就赶紧办完吧。”

---

Looking down from the balcony, Shinji watched the unmarked white van pull away. There was something suspicious about the removals men Kaji had brought in; they were rather better spoken than he would've expected, and they'd steadfastly kept their gloves and long-sleeved turtlenecks on despite doing manual labour in Japan's eternal summer. "Uh, Mr Kaji, who _were_ those men?" he asked as the van disappeared in the distance.  
从阳台俯视，真嗣看着那辆无标记的白色货车驶离。加持带来的搬家工人有些可疑；他们的谈吐比他预期的要好得多，而且尽管在日本永恒的夏天里从事体力劳动，他们仍坚持戴着手套和长袖高领衫。“呃，加持先生，那些人是谁？”他问道，当货车消失在远方。

"Oh, some guys whose boss still owes me a few more favours," replied Kaji, flicking imaginary dust off the front of his shirt. "Don't worry, they're not going to steal any of Katsuragi's junk. It's all going to sit perfectly safe in a warehouse until she wants it back. Their boss knows what's good for him."  
“哦，一些老板还欠我几个恩惠的家伙，”加持回答，弹去衬衫前襟上想象中的灰尘。“别担心，他们不会偷走葛城的东西。所有东西都会安全地存放在仓库里，直到她想要回来。他们的老板知道什么对他有好处。”

Shinji could think of a dozen more questions he wanted to ask, but somehow, he suspected he didn't want the answers. "Right. So, uh, how long have you known Misato?"  
真嗣能想到十几個想问的问题，但不知为何，他怀疑自己并不想知道答案。“好吧。那么，呃，你认识美里多久了？”

"We met at uni. We saw each other for a while. It..." Kaji looked up at the sky for a moment. "It worked, but it didn't work out."  
"我们在大学相遇的。相处了一段时间。它..." 加持抬头望向天空片刻。"它奏效了，但最终没能走下去。"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"Men and women are different, Shinji. And I don't just mean in the fun ways." Kaji mimed voluptuous breasts with his hands. "Whatever we were looking for, I don't think we found it."  
"男女有别，真嗣。我指的不仅仅是那些有趣的地方。" 加持用手比划着丰满的胸部。"无论我们在寻找什么，我想我们并未找到。"

"You don't know?" "你不知道吗？"

"Twenty isn't really old enough to know what you're looking for. Hell, I'm not even sure about thirty."  
"二十岁其实还不足以知道自己真正想要什么。见鬼，我甚至不确定三十岁是否能明白。"

Shinji found himself wondering why, exactly, Asuka was so keen on Kaji. From a brief impression, he seemed to veer between flippant and just plain evasive at the drop of a hat. "What did you do to upset Asuka?"  
真嗣发现自己不禁好奇，究竟为什么明日香对加持如此着迷。从短暂的印象来看，他似乎随时都能在轻浮和完全回避之间摇摆不定。“你做了什么惹明日香生气？”

"I didn't do anything I shouldn't. Anything else is her story to tell."  
"我没做任何不该做的事。其他的事，是她自己的故事。"

Shinji scowled. "That's not an answer."  
真嗣皱眉。“那不是答案。”

"True. On the other hand, she hardly knows you and I'm not going to tell tales behind her back. If she wants you to know, I'm sure she'll tell you."  
“确实。另一方面，她对你几乎一无所知，我也不会在她背后说闲话。如果她想让你知道，我相信她会告诉你的。”

"She-" Gritting his teeth, Shinji held back his outburst. Kaji had a point, and talking about why it might not be as valid as he thought didn't seem like a good idea. "Fine, you're right."  
“她——”真嗣咬紧牙关，忍住了爆发。加持有他的道理，讨论为什么这可能不像他认为的那么有效似乎不是个好主意。“好吧，你是对的。”

### [Chapter 6](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/48091753): Unfamiliarity  
第六章：陌生感

### Chapter Text 正文

Asuka sat on the bed in her new room, contemplating her situation.  
明日香坐在新房间的床上，思索着自己的处境。

On the up side, the bed was reasonably comfortable, the wardrobes and drawers had swallowed her new purchases with room to spare, and the room itself wasn't as pokey as she'd been expecting from a Japanese apartment.  
好在床还算舒适，衣柜和抽屉吞下了她的新衣物后还有余地，而且房间也没有她预想中的日本公寓那么狭小。

On the down side, it felt pretty soulless without the nick-nacks her room back home had accumulated, and there was a faint, unnameable smell that the air freshener Shinji must have spritzed the room with couldn't conceal.  
美中不足的是，这里少了她家乡房间里那些小摆设，显得有些空洞无魂，而且空气中还隐约飘着一股难以名状的气味，尽管真嗣肯定喷了空气清新剂，却依然无法掩盖。

And of course, there was the door. The sliding door. The sliding door with no damned lock. It was ridiculous, asking her to share an apartment with a teenage boy and not giving her a door that locked. She yanked it open, rollers clattering noisily against the rails, and stepped out into the living room as soon as the door thumped against its end stop.  
当然，还有那扇门。那扇滑动门。那扇该死的没有锁的滑动门。这太荒谬了，让她和一个十几岁的男孩合租公寓，却不给她一扇能上锁的门。她猛地拉开它，滑轮在轨道上发出刺耳的响声，门一撞到尽头，她就踏进了客厅。

Misato was sat on the couch in a skimpy tank top and cutoffs, leafing through a magazine with two buff-looking men in speedos on the front cover. Asuka snorted in disgust, and her erstwhile guardian looked up at her. "What's up, Asuka?"  
美里穿着一件紧身背心和短裤坐在沙发上，翻阅着一本杂志，封面是两个穿着泳裤、肌肉发达的男人。明日香厌恶地哼了一声，她的临时监护人抬头看向她。"怎么了，明日香？"

"This stupid door doesn't lock and the room smells funny and why are you reading porn in the living room?"  
"这破门锁不上，房间还有股怪味，你干嘛在客厅看那种东西？"

"It's not porn," replied Misato, laying the open magazine flat on the coffee table. "See?"  
"这不是色情杂志，""美里回答道，将摊开的杂志平放在茶几上。""看清楚了？"

Asuka hesitated, wary of Misato's tendency to tease, and looked down. There wasn't a human in sight on the two-page spread - just pictures of exercise machines and what looked like price/feature comparison boxes above them. Cheeks burning, she tried to regain some kind of composure. "I didn't know you were in charge of the PT programme here."  
明日香犹豫了一下，警惕着美里爱捉弄人的习惯，低头看去。那两页上没有一个人影——只有健身器材的图片和上方看似价格/功能对比的框格。她脸颊发烫，试图恢复些许镇定。""我还不知道你负责这里的体能训练项目呢。"

Misato smiled wryly. "Neither did I until Fuyutsuki dropped it in my lap last week. One of our visitors from the JSDF kicked up a stink about us not having one."  
美里苦笑了一下。“我也是直到上周副司令福音次郎把它甩到我头上才知道。我们的一位自卫队访客对我们没有这个大发雷霆。”

"Right." Asuka's stomach rumbled, reminding her she hadn't finished her lunch. "When's dinner?"  
“好吧。”明日香的肚子咕噜作响，提醒她还没吃完午饭。“晚饭什么时候？”

"Half an hour," replied Shinji from the kitchen. "Chicken curry and rice."  
“半小时后，”真嗣从厨房回答道。“咖喱鸡和米饭。”

---

With a belly full of beer and Shjnji's cooking, Misato leaned back in her chair and pondered her teenage charges' behaviour. Neither of them quite seemed themselves today. Asuka was actually backing down from confrontations, however gracelessly, and Shinji had acquired a sharp tongue from somewhere. The first could be chalked up to the thing with that idiot Kaji, but the second didn't really seem to have a cause behind it.  
酒足饭饱之后，美里靠在椅背上，思索着她那两个未成年学生的行为。今天他们俩都不太对劲。明日香竟然在冲突中退缩了，尽管方式不太优雅，而真嗣不知从哪儿学来了一副尖刻的口舌。前者可能是因为那个白痴加持的事情，但后者似乎并没有明显的原因。

Her mobile buzzed annoyingly from the living room. Grumbling under her breath she headed over to see who was texting her on a Sunday evening.  
客厅里，她的手机恼人地嗡嗡作响。她低声抱怨着，走过去看看是谁在周日晚给她发短信。

It was Ritsuko. "We need Shinji and Asuka for emergency testing tomorrow morning. Everything's set up and I've told the school Shinji won't be in." 是律子。 "We need Shinji and Asuka for emergency testing tomorrow morning. Everything's set up and I've told the school Shinji won't be in."

"I'll be in my room," said Misato, heading down the short corridor. "Play nice."  
"我回房间了，" 美里说着，走向那条短走廊。"好好相处。"

Her new room was, she realized, unpleasantly poky, but she was going to have to put up with it. "Emergency?" she texted back.  
她意识到自己的新房间相当狭小，令人不快，但她不得不忍受。 "Emergency?" 她回复了短信。

"We need clean psychograph readings. Dual sync is an untested configuration."

She scowled at her phone. "What's wrong with the readings you've got from the Angel encounter? If there's something wrong with my pilots I need to know."  
她对着手机皱眉。 "What's wrong with the readings you've got from the Angel encounter? If there's something wrong with my pilots I need to know."

"Interference. There's only so much the MAGI can do with that data."

Misato gave an exasperated sigh. "Fine. We're going to talk about this tomorrow."  
美里无奈地叹了口气。 "Fine. We're going to talk about this tomorrow."

---

Shinji hummed an unfamiliar tune to himself as he washed the curry residue out of the saucepan. It was an aggressive and choppy tune, and he'd never actually heard it, but there was something remarkably appealing about it.  
真嗣一边清洗着平底锅里的咖喱残留，一边哼着一首他不熟悉的曲调。那是一首激进而又断断续续的曲子，他其实从未真正听过，但不知为何，它却异常吸引人。

"I didn't think you'd be into Rammstein," remarked Asuka from her seat at the table.  
“没想到你会喜欢 Rammstein。”明日香坐在桌旁说道。

"Rammstein?"

She stared at him like he'd grown a second head. "You're humming one of their best songs!"  
她盯着他，仿佛他头上长出了第二个脑袋。"你哼的是他们最棒的歌之一！"

Shinji glanced nervously at the front door. "Oh. It's one of your favourites, right?"  
真嗣紧张地瞥了一眼前门。"哦，那是你最喜欢的之一，对吧？"

"Yes." Asuka looked past him, also keeping an eye on the front door. "You... you got that from my brain. When we fought the Angel."  
"是的。" 明日香越过他望向门口，同时留意着前门。"你……你从我的脑海中得到了那个。当我们与使徒战斗时。"

"I guess I must have—" He paused as he heard the front door opening. He wanted to explore this some more with Asuka, but not with Misato listening. "Later?"  
"我想我一定是——" 他听到前门打开的声音，停了下来。他想和明日香进一步探讨这个问题，但不想让美里听到。"待会儿？"

Asuka nodded. "Sure." 明日香点点头。"当然。"

"Hey kids, you've got a sync test first thing tomorrow," announced Misato, her annoyance with the situation plain to see in her expression. "And I have a meeting with Ritz at the same time."  
“嘿，孩子们，明天一大早你们有个同步测试，”美里宣布道，她的不满在表情中一览无余。“而我同一时间还要和里兹开会。”

### [Chapter 7](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/48455975): Observed  
第七章：被观察

### Chapter Text 正文

Asuka had never been bothered by the figure-hugging fit of her plugsuit. She liked the feel of the hi-tech fabric against her skin and the way it conformed to her movements without pinching or bunching. It let people know who she was - the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 - and if some of the gazes it attracted were improper or disapproving, well, those prudes and perverts were beneath her notice.  
明日香从未对她的插入栓服的紧身设计感到困扰。她喜欢高科技面料贴合肌肤的感觉，以及它如何随着她的动作而贴合，既不挤压也不皱褶。这让人知道她是谁——二号机驾驶员——如果其中有些目光不恰当或不赞同，好吧，那些守旧派和变态不值得她注意。

And yet, this morning she stood in the locker room with her still-slack plugsuit hanging loosely around her body, hesitating for once to activate the tensioning system. Today, the prospect of those improper gazes felt... troubling. Unpleasant. Intimidating.  
然而，今早她站在更衣室里，身上那件尚未紧绷的插座服松松垮垮地裹着身体，她破天荒地犹豫着是否要启动张紧系统。今天，那些不当目光的前景让她感到……困扰。不愉快。令人畏惧。

She slapped her hand against the locker. "Stupid Shinji," she muttered. It had to be something from his brain, another piece of him that had leaked into her. She triggered the tensioning system, checked that her A10 connectors were in place, and walked out into the hallway.  
她一巴掌拍在储物柜上。“笨蛋真嗣，”她低声抱怨。这一定是他脑子里的东西，又一片他渗入她内心的碎片。她启动了张紧系统，检查了 A10 连接器是否到位，然后走出了走廊。

---

"Ah, Misato. Have a seat."  
“啊，美里。请坐。”

Misato hefted a stack of papers off the visitor's chair in Ritsuko's office and onto the floor before sitting down. "All right, Ritz, why don't you tell me what this is all about?"  
美里从律子办公室的访客椅上搬起一摞文件，放到地板上，然后坐了下来。“好吧，律子，你为什么不告诉我这到底是怎么回事？”

"Dual sync is a completely untested scenario. We didn't even know whether an Evangelion would function with two pilots." Ritsuko leaned back in her chair. "Obviously it did, but the results just give us a new set of questions to answer."  
“双重同步是一个完全未经测试的场景。我们甚至不知道一台 EVA 能否与两名驾驶员一起运作。”律子靠在椅背上。“显然它成功了，但结果只是给我们带来了一堆新的问题需要解答。”

Misato pinched the bridge of her nose. "So what's wrong with my pilots?"  
美里捏了捏鼻梁。“那我的驾驶员们有什么问题？”

"It looks like there was some mental contamination," said Ritsuko. "Maya spotted something on the psychograph readings, and given what you said about Shinji, it all fits. What we need now is a clearer sense of how much."  
"看起来像是受到了某种精神污染，" 律子说道。"真嗣在心理图谱读数上发现了异常，结合你提到的关于真嗣的情况，这一切都吻合。我们现在需要的是更清楚地了解污染的程度。"

"Couldn't you at least pretend to care about _them_?"  
"你就不能至少假装关心一下他们吗？"

"If I didn't care, Shinji would be at school and Asuka would be having the day off." Ritsuko fished her cigarettes out of her pocket. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a nicotine habit to feed and a simulator test to supervise."  
"如果我不关心，真嗣现在应该在学校，而明日香则可以放假一天。" 律子从口袋里掏出香烟。"现在请原谅，我得去满足一下尼古丁的瘾，还得监督模拟测试。"

---

Asuka walked into the simulator bay to find Shinji leaning against a safety railing, tapping his foot on the floor. The sight of him in a correctly fitted plugsuit instead of her spare was, she had to concede, quite appealing. "Hey, Shinji," she called to him.  
明日香走进模拟器舱，发现真嗣正靠在安全栏杆上，脚尖轻敲着地面。看到他穿着合身的插入栓服而不是她的备用服装，她不得不承认，这确实相当吸引人。“嘿，真嗣，”她向他喊道。

Shinji looked up and smiled at her. "Hi Asuka. How are you feeling?"  
真嗣抬头朝她微笑。“嗨，明日香。你感觉怎么样？”

She wanted to say 'fine', but the word stuck in her throat. He'd know she was bullshitting. "Weird," she admitted. "Does... does it bother you, wearing a plugsuit?"  
她本想说“很好”，但这个词卡在了喉咙里。他肯定会知道她在撒谎。“奇怪，”她承认道，“穿插入栓服……会让你觉得困扰吗？”

"I'm mostly getting used to it. I still don't like the way Technician Kimura looks at me when I'm wearing it, though."  
"我基本上已经习惯了。不过，我还是不喜欢技术员木村看我穿这身衣服时的眼神。"

Asuka smiled weakly at the confirmation that _that_ thought was one of his. "I... we should make some time to talk. About things. You know."  
明日香虚弱地笑了笑，确认了这也是他的想法。 "我...我们应该找个时间谈谈。关于一些事情。你知道的。"

"I know a good café," said Shinji. "We could go there when we're done here?"  
"我知道一家不错的咖啡馆，" 真嗣说。 "我们这里结束后可以去那里吗？"

Asuka hesitated. It would look like a date. She'd look like she was on a date with this... actually kind of cute and talented boy, who'd got into an Eva even when he didn't want to, because his father was going to force a wounded girl to do it instead. What could it hurt? "Sure. But we're paying for our own drinks."  
明日香犹豫了一下。这看起来会像是一场约会。她会显得像是在和这个……实际上相当可爱且有才华的男孩约会，他甚至在自己并不情愿的情况下进入了 Eva，只因他的父亲原本打算强迫一个受伤的女孩去驾驶。这又能有什么坏处呢？“当然可以。但我们各自付自己的饮料钱。”

"Don't want to give people the wrong impression, right?"  
“不想让人产生误会，对吧？”

"R-right!" Asuka felt her cheeks flushing. Having someone around who actually understood her was going to take some getting used to. "So why are we waiting?"  
“对-对啊！”明日香感到自己的脸颊在发烫。身边有个真正理解她的人，这需要一些时间来适应。“那我们还在等什么呢？”

"Lieutenant Ibuki says there's a circuit fault with the simulator and she didn't want to make us wait _inside_ the plugs."  
“伊吹曹长说模拟器电路出了故障，她不想让我们在插头里干等着。”

"Huh. Someone nice works here?"  
“哈，这里还有好人啊？”

Shinji smiled wryly. "There had to be _someone_, I guess."  
“总得有那么一个吧，我想。”真嗣苦笑着说。

The PA system chimed. "We've traced the fault and replaced the damaged parts," announced Lieutenant Ibuki. "Simulator plugs will be open shortly."  
扩音系统响起提示音。“我们已经定位故障并更换了损坏的部件，”伊吹中尉宣布，“模拟器插头很快就会开放。”

---

Misato paced nervously at the window of the observation bay. This wasn't like waiting for a live launch. She was in her element there, directing her pilots in a tactical situation.  
美里在观察舱的窗前紧张地踱步。这不像等待实况发射。在那里，她如鱼得水，指挥她的飞行员应对战术情况。

It was more like when she'd been waiting to hear about her mother's condition. There was nothing she could do, and even once she had an answer it might not change anything.  
这更像是在等待母亲病情的消息时的心情。她无能为力，即便得到了答案，也可能什么都不会改变。

"Simulator online," announced Lieutenant Aoba, leaning back in his chair. "Looks pretty boring."  
"模拟器已上线。" 青叶中尉靠在椅背上宣布，"看起来挺无聊的。"

"It's supposed to be," responded Ritsuko. "We want clean psychograph readings. Ibuki, enable synchronization."  
"本来就是，" 律子回应道，"我们需要清晰的脑波读数。伊吹，启用同步。"

Misato turned her attention to the status displays that were now flickering into life. There wasn't much to see yet, but it was actual information to focus on.  
美里将注意力转向那些正闪烁着亮起的状态显示器。目前能看到的还不多，但这是实实在在的信息，值得关注。

---

A simulated world flickered into being around Asuka. It wasn't really an improvement on the inside of an entry plug; she was surrounded by a flat, featureless plain under a flat, overcast sky. She thumbed the commlink switch. "Hey, what's with this simulation? We always had scenery in Berlin."  
一个模拟世界在明日香周围闪现。这其实并没有比插入栓内部好多少；她被一片平坦、毫无特色的平原包围，头顶是灰蒙蒙的天空。她按下通讯开关。“嘿，这个模拟是怎么回事？我们在柏林时总有风景的。”

A video pane showing Dr Akagi popped up in her view. "We'll be loading a real scenario shortly. We need a psychograph baseline from a zero-threat environment, without your Evangelion complicating the results."  
一个显示着赤木博士的视频窗口出现在她的视野中。“我们很快会加载一个真实场景。我们需要在没有威胁的环境中获取心理图谱基线，不让你驾驶的 EVA 干扰结果。”

Another pane showing Shinji in his entry plug appeared. "Could be worse. At least the sky and the ground are different colours."  
另一个显示着真嗣在他插入栓中的窗口出现。“可能更糟。至少天空和地面颜色不同。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow. "Seriously?"  
明日香挑了挑眉。“真的假的？”

"That was a programming error, Shinji," said Dr Akagi, before suddenly frowning. "Talk amongst yourselves. I may be some time." Her video pane vanished.  
“那是编程错误，真嗣，”赤木律子博士说道，随即突然皱起眉头。“你们先自己聊聊。我可能需要一些时间。”她的视频窗口消失了。

Asuka tapped her fingers on the control grips. She didn't want to talk about _that_ over the commlink, and there wasn't anything else she could think of worth talking about. There was the other pilot, she supposed, but...  
明日香用手指敲打着控制握把。她不想在通讯链接上谈论那个话题，也想不出还有什么值得聊的事情。她想到了另一位驾驶员，但是……

Her cheeks flushed as the unwanted memory from Shinji replayed itself. No. Definitely not talking about her.  
她的脸颊因不愿回想的真嗣记忆而泛红。不，绝对不是在说她。

---

Ritsuko stared intently at the psychograph traces on the wall display. The cross-contamination between the pilots was clearly highlighted by the MAGI's analysis, but the observable effects were not at all what she'd have expected. Neither pilot had exhibited any frank psychiatric symptoms, just modest behavioural changes.  
律子专注地盯着墙上的心理图谱。MAGI 的分析清楚地指出了驾驶员之间的交叉污染，但观察到的效果完全出乎她的意料。两位驾驶员都没有表现出明显的精神症状，只是行为上有些微变化。

She sighed. There were bound to be latent issues. Maybe a stress test was needed. "Maya, load Test Angel 16."  
她叹了口气。潜在问题在所难免。或许需要进行压力测试。“摩耶，加载测试天使 16 号。”

"16, sempai? Isn't that the—"  
"16 期，前辈？那不是——"

"Yes. Asuka's been trained properly and Shinji has field experience. They should be able to handle it."  
"是的。明日香受过正规训练，而真嗣有实战经验。他们应该能应付得来。"

Misato interjected in a tone that would have frozen a penguin to death on the spot. "Would you like to explain to me why Lieutenant Ibuki is cavilling over your choice of testing material for my pilots, _Doctor Akagi_?"  
美里用一种能让企鹅当场冻死的语气插话道：“你能向我解释一下，为什么伊吹副官对您为我的飞行员选择的测试材料有异议吗，赤木博士？”

"I... have to concede her point, Captain," said Ritsuko, weighing her words carefully. "The baseline data is solid. Their stability in light of the data is surprising, but I'm sure some more analysis will give us some insight. I think we can let them go about their day in peace."  
"我...不得不承认她的观点，舰长，" 赤木律子谨慎地斟酌着言辞，"基准数据很扎实。他们在数据面前的稳定性令人惊讶，但我确信进一步的分析会给我们一些启示。我认为我们可以让他们平静地度过这一天。"

Misato's voice thawed very slightly. "I'm glad to hear it. We should have a proper planning session soon."  
美里的话语稍稍缓和了一些。"我很高兴听到这个。我们应该尽快举行一次正式的规划会议。"

Ritsuko toggled the commlink. "Change of plan. The data we have is enough to work with, so we'll be giving you the rest of the day to yourselves. Shinji, Rei will be collecting the day's schoolwork for you. Make sure you're in when she comes to drop it off."  
赤木律子切换了通讯链接。"计划变更。我们现有的数据已经足够进行工作，所以我们将给你们今天剩下的自由时间。真嗣，绫波会为你收集今天的学校作业。确保她来送作业时你在家里。"

第八章：连接

### Chapter Text 正文

Asuka was sitting in a café with her fellow pilot to discuss serious matters that might impact their combat performance.  
明日香正与她的同僚驾驶员坐在咖啡馆里，讨论可能影响他们战斗表现的重要事宜。

The fact that her fellow pilot was a boy her own age who looked good in a plugsuit and actually understood some of what she was going through didn't make it a date. After all, if it was a date she'd be making him pick up the tab.  
她的同僚是个与她同龄的男孩，穿上插头服看起来很帅气，并且确实能理解她的一些经历，但这并不意味着这是一场约会。毕竟，如果是约会的话，她会让他买单的。

She set down her lemonade – there was no way she was drinking anything hot after a kilometre and a half walk in Japan's infernal humidity – and looked at her fellow pilot. "So, Shinji. We need to talk about... _that_."  
她放下手中的柠檬水——在日本的酷热潮湿中步行了一公里半后，她绝不会碰任何热饮——然后看向她的同伴驾驶员。“那么，真嗣。我们需要谈谈……那个。”

"Yes." "是的。"

There was a pause. Asuka realized she was looking a boy in the eyes at a café and not saying anything. Quite a cute boy. He wasn't as handsome as Kaji, of course, but Kaji was too handsome for his own good, and an asshole to boot.  
一阵沉默。明日香意识到自己在咖啡馆里与一个男孩对视，却一言不发。这个男孩相当可爱。当然，他不如加持英俊，但加持过于英俊，反而自讨苦吃，而且还是个混蛋。

Cheeks turning pink, she dipped her gaze. "So! Where are we going to start?"  
她的脸颊泛起红晕，垂下目光。“那么！我们从哪里开始呢？”

"You like piloting Eva, don't you?"  
"你喜欢驾驶 EVA，对吧？"

"Yes. It's what I'm best at, and when the next Angel comes, I'll show you what I can do. You... you don't, do you?"  
"是的。这是我最擅长的，等下一个使徒来的时候，我会展示给你看我的能力。你...你不介意吧，对吧？"

He shook his head vigorously. "It's... I didn't want to, but he was going to make Ayanami do it if I didn't. She had a broken arm and bandages everywhere and he was going to send her out to fight an Angel."  
他用力地摇了摇头。"我...我本不想这么做，但如果我不去，他就会让绫波去。她手臂骨折，全身都是绷带，而他却打算让她去对抗使徒。"

"Ayanami's the one you fell on top of, isn't she?"  
"碇司令是你压在身上的那个人，对吧？"

Shinji blushed furiously and looked away. "You got... you got that? When we were in the entry plug?"  
真嗣的脸红得像熟透的番茄，目光移向别处。 "你...你看到了？在我们进入插入栓的时候？"

"Yes, I did." Why wouldn't that verdammt memory just _go away_? She didn't want to know what Ayanami's boob felt like. Especially if it felt nice. "What were you _doing_?"  
"是的，我看到了。" 为什么那个该死的记忆就是挥之不去呢？她并不想知道碇司令的胸部是什么感觉。尤其是如果感觉还不错的话。 "你当时在做什么？"

"Nothing like... like that." He took a deep breath. Then another. "I went to give her her replacement security pass. She hadn't shut her front door properly and I went inside. She came out of the shower and walked towards me and I panicked and somehow we fell over and my hand ended up on her... her chest."  
"没什么像...像那样的。" 他深吸了一口气。然后又吸了一口。"我去给她送替换的安全通行证。她没把前门关好，我就进去了。她从浴室出来，朝我走来，我慌了神，不知怎么我们就摔倒了，我的手就放在了她的...她的胸上。"

"You know that makes no fucking sense, right?"  
"你知道这他妈的说不通，对吧？"

"Yes." He looked up at the ceiling. "Can we talk about something else?"  
"是的。" 他抬头看向天花板。"我们能谈点别的吗？"

She took mercy on him. She needed him to stay mentally fit to pilot. She'd need support if they had another Angel like that blue one. "Fine, but we need to talk about girls' privacy later. So, you liked that Rammstein song, I guess?"  
她对他心生怜悯。她需要他保持头脑清醒来驾驶。如果再遇到像那只蓝色使徒那样的敌人，她会需要支援。“好吧，但我们稍后得谈谈女生的隐私问题。所以，你猜你喜欢那首 Rammstein 的歌？”

His eyes lit up at that. "Yes! It wasn't at all the sort of thing I usually listen to but I'd like to hear it properly."  
听到这个，他的眼睛亮了起来。“是的！虽然这完全不是我平常听的类型，但我很想好好听听。”

A plan came together in Asuka's head as she took a generous swig of her remaining lemonade. She could build a stronger connection with her fellow pilot _and_ replace some of the music that had found its way to the bottom of the Pacific. "I think I saw a record shop a few doors down. Let's go shopping."  
当明日香大口喝着剩下的柠檬水时，一个计划在她脑海中成型。她可以与她的同伴驾驶员建立更紧密的联系，并替换掉那些沉入太平洋底的音乐。“我想我看到过几家门面外有一家唱片店。我们去逛逛吧。”

"Sounds good," said Shinji. "I just need to—"  
"听起来不错，" 真嗣说道。"我只是需要——"

Even attenuated by distance and double glazing, Asuka recognized the sound that interrupted his response. "Get down!" she snapped, ducking under the table to put the decorative planter between herself and the window as people outside started screaming. "That was a gun!"  
即使被距离和双层玻璃削弱，明日香还是辨认出了打断他回答的声音。"快趴下！"她厉声喝道，迅速钻到桌子底下，将装饰用的花盆置于自己和窗户之间，与此同时外面的人们开始尖叫。"那是枪声！"

Shinji joined her under the table, looking distinctly wild-eyed. "Why is someone shooting?"  
真嗣跟着她躲到桌子下，眼神明显带着惊慌。"为什么有人在开枪？"

Asuka shook her head, fishing her new NERV-issued phone out of her bag. "Who cares? That's security's job." She flipped open the mollyguard on the back cover and held down the panic button. "Let's see if they're on the ball."  
明日香摇了摇头，从包里掏出她新领的 NERV 配发手机。“谁在乎？那是保安的工作。”她翻开手机后盖上的保护套，按下了紧急按钮。“看看他们是不是在状态。”

Rei Ayanami was prone to spend her afternoons at school in a daze, not really listening to what the teacher was saying. Knowing her purpose as she did, she saw no value in absorbing knowledge she would never need.  
绫波零习惯于在学校的下午陷入恍惚，并不真正听老师在讲什么。她深知自己的使命，认为吸收那些她永远不会用到的知识毫无价值。

The buzzing of her NERV-issue phone intruded on her daze, bringing her instantly to full alertness in a conditioned reflex. She rose from her seat and headed for the door.  
她的 NERV 配发手机嗡嗡作响，打断了她的恍惚，条件反射般让她立刻警觉起来。她从座位上站起身，朝门口走去。

"Miss Ayanami, are you—" "绫波小姐，您这是——"

"I must respond to an emergency signal," she said, not even breaking stride as she interrupted the teacher's query.  
"我必须回应一个紧急信号，"她打断了老师的询问，步伐丝毫未减。"

Stepping out into the corridor, she looked at the message on her phone. "PILOTS IKARI AND SOURYUU UNDER FIRE. PROTECTION PROTOCOLS ACTIVATED. PICKUP DRIVER EN ROUTE."  
走出走廊，她看了一眼手机上的信息。"碇与惣流遭遇攻击。保护协议已启动。接应司机正在途中。"

The feeling she experienced as she hurried through the school to the designated collection point was the same novel and unpleasant one she had felt when Pilot Ikari was injured fighting the octahedral Angel. It was not part of her purpose, and that fact bothered her almost as much as the feeling itself.  
当她匆匆穿过学校前往指定集合点时，那种既新奇又不快的感觉再次袭来，就像当初飞行员碇真嗣在与八面体使徒战斗中受伤时她所感受到的那样。这并非她的职责所在，这一事实几乎和那种感觉本身一样困扰着她。

She swiped her NERV ID over a proximity reader and pushed open the door that led to the collection point. The floor was still covered in construction dust that puffed up around her ankles as she walked to the reinforced door, and she made a mental note of the shortcomings in the cleanup work. Her own health would not be impaired, but an ordinary human pilot might suffer respiratory distress as a result.  
她用 NERV ID 在近距读卡器上刷了一下，推开了通往集合点的门。地板上仍覆盖着施工留下的灰尘，随着她的脚步扬起，围绕在她的脚踝周围。她暗自记下了清理工作的不足之处。虽然这不会影响她的健康，但一个普通的人类驾驶员可能会因此遭受呼吸困难。

The green light above the door winked on, confirming that the Section Two van was correctly positioned for pickup. Rei swiped her card over the second proximity reader and stepped directly into the van's cabin.  
门上的绿灯闪烁，确认第二科的货车已正确就位，准备接载。绫波丽再次刷卡通过第二个近距读卡器，直接进入了货车的驾驶舱。

As it moved off, Rei wondered why anyone would start attacking the other pilots.  
随着它离去，丽不禁疑惑，为何会有人开始攻击其他驾驶员。

第九章：五十

### Chapter Text 正文

Asuka hated waiting. 明日香讨厌等待。

With a nutter with a rifle overlooking the street outside, it was all she could do.  
面对一个手持步枪、俯瞰街道的疯子，她只能尽力而为。

She looked over at Shinji. He was holding together, just about. That was good. He wasn't going to freak out on her yet. She took a deep breath. "Looks like we'll have to postpone the record shopping," she quipped.  
她看向真嗣，他勉强支撑着。这很好，他还没有在她面前崩溃。她深吸了一口气。“看来我们得推迟买唱片了，”她打趣道。

He made a short, tense sound that might have been a laugh. "I guess so." He fished out his phone, holding it in a white-knuckled grip. "Have they told you anything?"  
他发出了一声短促而紧张的声响，可能是笑声。“我想是的。”他掏出手机，紧紧握住，指节发白。“他们告诉你什么了吗？”

She glanced down at her own, and started to say 'no' when it buzzed in her hand. The message from Misato read "Section Two en route. Sit tight. Confirm response."  
她低头看了看自己的手机，正要开口说“不”时，手机在她手中震动起来。来自美里的一条信息显示：“第二课正在途中。稍安勿躁。确认回复。”

"Confirmed." Asuka texted back. She wasn't about to try texting more than that in Japanese. She smiled at Shinji. "Someone's on the way. Misato says 'sit tight'."  
“已确认。”明日香回复道。她不打算用日语发更多的信息。她对真嗣笑了笑。“有人正在赶来。美里说‘稍安勿躁’。”

Shinji looked at his phone, and then back at Asuka. "I... I guess we do that then."  
真嗣看了看自己的手机，然后又看向明日香。“我……我想我们只能这样了。”

"Yeah. Not the best afternoon out I've had."  
“是啊，不是我经历过的最愉快的下午。”

---

Dressed in the only garment remotely as comfortable as her own skin, the icon of her publicly admitted purpose, Rei Ayanami sat in the locker room and waited.  
穿着唯一一件与她自身肌肤同样舒适的衣物，作为她公开承认目的的象征，绫波零坐在更衣室里等待着。

An outside observer might have noted her relaxed muscles, neutral expression, and static pose, and from these things inferred a placid mental state.  
一个外部观察者或许会注意到她放松的肌肉、中性的表情和静止的姿态，从而推断出她内心的平静状态。

They would – for once – be wrong. Two subjects preyed on her mind, leaving it in turmoil behind the mask of her self-discipline, and with no credible prospect of an imminent Angel attack, there was no higher priority to focus on.  
他们这次——终于——错了。两个问题困扰着她的思绪，让她的内心在自我约束的面具下陷入混乱，而且由于近期没有可信的天使攻击迹象，她找不到更高优先级的事情来集中注意力。

The fortress city of Tokyo-3 was the ultimate bastion of humanity, the heart of its defences against the Angels, and the Evangelion pilots were its foremost defenders. She could not rightly comprehend how and why they could come under fire from a human.  
东京-3 这座堡垒城市是人类的终极堡垒，是抵御天使的核心防线，而 EVA 驾驶员则是其最前线的守护者。她无法真正理解他们为何会受到来自人类的攻击，以及这一切是如何发生的。

There was also the matter of the feelings she was experiencing regarding Pilot Ikari. His presence was pleasant, and the prospect of him being injured or distressed was... not pleasant.  
还有关于她对碇真嗣驾驶员的感情问题。他的存在令人愉快，而想到他可能受伤或陷入困境的前景则……并不愉快。

A concept became an urge became an impulse.  
一个概念化作冲动，冲动又转为冲动。

With the rest of her fingers plaited, her left thumb rolled over her right, and her right, in turn, over her left.  
其余手指交缠在一起，她的左拇指在右拇指上滚动，右拇指又反过来在左拇指上滚动。

She noted the action to be relaxing, and repeated it.  
她注意到这个动作能让人放松，于是重复了一遍。

---

Shinji looked at his phone again. No new messages. Nothing to tell him _when_ Section Two would be turning up like Misato said. Maybe they'd got stuck. Maybe the—  
真嗣再次看向手机。没有新消息。没有告诉他第二课何时会像美里说的那样出现。也许他们被卡住了。也许——

"Hey, Shinji." Asuka's tone sounded brittle, but it was still something to focus on. "When we go to the record store, let's pick something out for each other."  
“嘿，真嗣。”明日香的声音听起来有些生硬，但至少有个焦点。“我们去唱片店的时候，互相挑点什么吧。”

He looked across at the beautiful red-haired girl he was hiding under a table with and took in the worried smile on her face. _Words. She's talking to me. Use words._ "I... I'd like that a lot. We should do that."  
他看向那位与他一起躲在桌子下的美丽红发女孩，注意到了她脸上的担忧微笑。说话。她在跟我说话。用语言。“我……我很乐意。我们应该这么做。”

She extended a hand. "Shake on it?"  
她伸出手。“一言为定？”

Nervously, he reached out and took her hand in his. The contact was... nice. Her hand was warm. Her grip was firm. He managed to firm up his own grip and shake her hand properly and tried not to think too hard about the fact that he was touching a girl and a girl was touching him and—  
他紧张地伸出手，握住了她的手。这种接触...感觉很好。她的手温暖，握力坚定。他努力加强自己的握力，正确地摇了摇她的手，并尽量不去多想自己正在触碰一个女孩，而那个女孩也在触碰他——

"Then it's a deal," she said. "No getting shot before then, all right? Even a great pilot like me needs backup."  
“那就成交了，”她说。“在那之前别被打中了，好吗？即使是像我这样出色的飞行员，也需要支援。”

"All right," he said, cheeks burning as Asuka's hand slipped out of his grip.  
“好吧，”他说道，脸颊因阿斯卡的手从他手中滑落而发烫。

Outside, there was an explosion.  
外面，一声爆炸响起。

---

Seated in one of the observer stations, Misato stared at the command centre's tactical display in disbelief. 'Air-launched HE missile' was _not_ how she'd expected the SDF counter-terrorist unit to deal with the sniper.  
坐在其中一个观察站里，美里难以置信地盯着指挥中心的战术显示屏。她没想到 SDF 反恐部队会用“空射高爆导弹”来对付狙击手。

"I believe your people are safe," said the SDF duty officer to her right.  
"我相信您的人民是安全的，" 她右侧的 SDF 值班军官说道。

"A missile seems like overkill."  
"用导弹似乎有点过头了。"

"The upper storeys were vacant. You value your people, Captain, and we value ours. Read about Charles Whitman."  
"上面的楼层是空的。您珍视您的人民，上尉，我们也珍视我们的。去了解一下查尔斯·惠特曼的事吧。"

### [Chapter 10](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/53461435): Decompression  
第十章：减压

### Chapter Text 正文

Misato hated Commander Ikari's office. It had very obviously been designed to intimidate whoever visited it, and the man made full use of that effect. The inevitable familiarity that came with visiting it in the line of duty softened the impact, but couldn't quite suppress it. "Six dead civilians – it could be eight by tomorrow – and twenty assorted lesser injuries," she said. "The SDF killed whoever did it so hard we can't even use dental records."  
美里讨厌碇司令的办公室。它显然是为了震慑来访者而设计的，而碇司令充分利用了这种效果。随着因公务频繁造访而产生的熟悉感虽然能减轻冲击，但无法完全消除。“六名平民死亡——到明天可能变成八名——还有二十名不同程度的伤者，”她说道，“自卫队把凶手击毙得面目全非，连牙科记录都用不上。”

"I agree that Colonel Nakajima's choice of tactics was questionable," replied Ikari. Misato caught the telltale shift in his facial muscles that said he was smirking behind those steepled hands and amber glasses. "I will express our displeasure to General Kurita in person. Please attend to your pilots. It would be inconvenient if they were to be incapacitated by this incident. Dismissed."  
“我同意中田上校的战术选择值得商榷，”碇司令回答道。美里注意到他面部肌肉的细微变化，表明他在那双交叠的手和琥珀色眼镜后正暗自得意。“我会亲自向栗田将军表达我们的不满。请照顾好你的驾驶员们，如果他们因这次事件而丧失行动能力，那就太不方便了。解散。”

_That's your fucking son, you ingrate. Allegedly._ "Of course, sir," she said, turning to depart.  
那是你他妈的儿子，你这忘恩负义的家伙。据说是。“当然，先生，”她说着，转身离开。

For a moment, as she made the long walk out of the Commander's office, she could have sworn she heard another voice, faint and muffled, from behind her. However piqued her curiosity might have been, though, she had no desire to linger, or even look behind her as she departed.  
有那么一会儿，当她从指挥官办公室走出来时，她几乎可以发誓听到身后传来另一个声音，微弱而模糊。尽管她的好奇心被激起，但她并没有停留的欲望，甚至没有回头看一眼就离开了。

---

Sat with his gaze directed at a safety poster on the break room wall in front of him, Shinji wasn't really looking at the poster, or anything else.  
真嗣坐在休息室的墙前，目光投向一张安全海报，但他并没有真正在看那张海报，或是其他任何东西。

The van didn't have windows in the back, and Section Two had parked it very close to the café door when they came to collect him and Asuka, but it hadn't blocked his view of the square completely as he emerged. He'd seen a man who'd been shot in the head, and a little girl tugging at him like she was trying to wake him up.  
那辆货车后面没有窗户，第二支部在来接他和明日香时，将车停得离咖啡馆门口很近，但当他走出来时，并没有完全挡住他对广场的视线。他看到了一个头部中枪的男人，还有一个小女孩拉着他的衣服，好像在试图唤醒他。

He knew people had gotten killed during Angel attacks, of course, but there was... _distance_ to it. He hadn't seen the bodies. He hadn't even been to visit Touji's little sister who was in hospital with broken legs thanks to falling rubble because _he_ hadn't been good enough to actually fight the Third Angel. The Angels' victims had been inside buildings, or tanks crushed by Sachiel, or planes vapourized by Ramiel's particle beams, or ships sunk when Gaghiel broke their hulls open, and for all he could tell, the Angels were just monsters. There didn't seem to be any kind of _conscious_ intent behind their violence – they just destroyed whatever threatened them or got between them and their goal.  
他当然知道天使袭击时会有人丧生，但那其中有...距离感。他没见过尸体。他甚至没有去医院看望过因为天使战斗中倒塌的瓦砾而腿部骨折的东治的妹妹，因为他没能强大到真正去对抗第三使徒。使徒的受害者们要么在建筑物内，要么是被萨基尔压扁的坦克，要么是被拉米尔的粒子束蒸发的飞机，要么是被加吉尔击沉的船只，就他所知，使徒只是怪物。他们的暴力行为似乎没有任何意识的意图——他们只是摧毁任何威胁到他们或挡在他们目标前的东西。

This was something a man had done. One of the billions of people he was fighting the Angels to save. A man had gone up a building with a gun and started shooting people as they went about their daily business. They weren't even people he'd have any particular reason to hate. Just... people.  
这是一名男子所为。他是他为了拯救数十亿人而与使徒战斗中的一员。一名男子带着枪登上了一座建筑，开始向那些忙于日常事务的人们射击。这些人甚至都不是他有特定理由去憎恨的对象。只是……普通人。

A red and black shape moved between him and the poster. "Shinji? Shinji, how are you feeling?"  
一个红黑相间的身影在他和海报之间移动。“真嗣？真嗣，你感觉怎么样？”

Shinji blinked and shook his head, then blushed as he realized he was now basically staring at Misato's... _Misato_. "I... uh... why did..." He rubbed his face. "Why did that..."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，摇了摇头，随即脸红了起来，因为他意识到自己现在基本上是在盯着美里……美里。“我……呃……为什么……”他揉了揉脸。“为什么那……”

"We don't know yet, Shinji," said Misato, squatting down so her face was level with his. "But we're going to find out, even though the SDF blew him to pieces."  
“我们还不知道，真嗣，”美里蹲下身来，让自己的脸与他的齐平。“但我们会查清楚的，尽管自卫队已经把他炸成了碎片。”

Shinji looked around, and realized he and Misato were the only people in the room. "Wh-where's Asuka?"  
真嗣环顾四周，意识到房间里只有他和美里两个人。“明日香在哪里？”

As if on cue, the red-haired girl emerged from the women's restroom looking slightly dishevelled and even paler than normal, with one hand clapped over her abdomen. "Right here, id— _Shinji_. Can we go home now, Misato?"  
仿佛是按了提示键，红发女孩从女洗手间走了出来，看起来有些凌乱，脸色比平时更加苍白，一只手捂着腹部。“就在这儿，笨——真嗣。我们现在可以回家了吗，美里？”

"Yes," said Misato, pulling her beret out from under her epaulette strap and getting to her feet. "I'll get us a takeaway. And then we can... talk, I guess. If you want to."  
“好的，”美里说着，从肩章带下抽出贝雷帽，站起身来，“我去买外卖。然后我们可以……聊聊，如果你愿意的话。”

Asuka pulled a face. "Nothing too greasy. Please."  
明日香皱了皱眉，“不要太油腻的，拜托了。”

Maya sat at the MAGI cluster's main visualization terminal, with the file the Section Two agent had provided open in her lap. She'd fed the first section into the hopper on the scanner as soon as she saw one of the photographs, and moved on to delivering the drier, more technical information by voice.  
玛雅坐在 MAGI 集群的主可视化终端前，膝上摊开着第二课课员提供的文件。她一看到其中一张照片，就立即将文件的第一部分放入扫描仪中，随后通过语音传递更为枯燥、技术性的信息。

"Bullets recovered from semi-hard targets consistent with use of .338 Lapua Magnum," she read aloud. "Attacker fired from the 15th floor of the Yamagawa Building. Victims did not hold high-clearance roles."  
“从半硬目标中回收的子弹与使用.338 拉普阿·马格南弹药一致，”她大声读道。“袭击者从山川大厦的第 15 层开枪。受害者未持有高权限角色。”

Meaningless streams of pixels ran up the side of the visualization terminal, letting Maya know that the system was working on the information she was providing, and a list of names started appearing, followed by a red-boxed prompt. "CORRELATION OF EVIDENCE REQUIRES INTERROGATION OF JSDF SYSTEMS. THE IDENTITY OF THE CONFIRMING OPERATOR WILL BE RECORDED TO NERV SYSTEMS. PROCEED?"  
无意义的像素流沿着可视化终端的侧面向上滚动，让真希波知道系统正在处理她提供的信息，随后出现了一系列名字，紧接着是一个红色框的提示。“证据关联需要审讯自卫队系统。确认操作员的身份将被记录到 NERV 系统中。继续？”

Maya took a deep breath. NERV had _authority_ to do this sort of thing, but there was still something intimidating about the prospect of actually doing it. "Proceed," she said.  
真希波深吸了一口气。NERV 有权进行此类操作，但实际执行的前景仍令人感到一丝威慑。“继续，”她说。

The prompt vanished, and the pixel bands at the sides widened to represent the heightened activity. Another prompt appeared. "ANALYSIS TIME AT CURRENT SYSTEM LOAD: 17 HOURS 23 MINUTES. NO FURTHER DATA REQUIRED AT THIS TIME."  
提示消失，两侧的像素带随之扩展，象征着活动加剧。又一个提示出现。“当前系统负载下的分析时间：17 小时 23 分钟。目前无需更多数据。”

Maya scooped the contents of the scanner's output hopper back into the folder without looking at it, and stashed the folder in one of the locking drawers under the terminal. "Suspend display," she ordered the system. There wouldn't be much point in leaving the terminal running once she'd left for the evening.  
玛雅没有看扫描仪输出槽的内容，直接将其倒回文件夹，并把文件夹藏入终端下方的锁柜中。“暂停显示，”她命令系统。既然她晚上要离开，继续运行终端也没什么意义了。

第 11 章：转移

### Chapter Text 正文

When the sun rose that Tuesday, Rei was already out of bed, recovering her hateful garments from where she had flung them the previous evening. The same conditioning that allowed a simple signal to break her habitual daze in an instant had instilled expectations about what would follow from an alert. Those expectations had not been fulfilled, and her senses were undimmed even after a fitful and near-sleepless night. The bedsheets were no more pleasant than her clothes, and even her own hair brushing against her neck when she turned her head had become a source of irritation. She dumped the previous day's garments into the laundry hamper and pondered her situation.  
那个周二太阳升起时，丽已经起床，从昨晚她扔掉的地方捡回那些讨厌的衣服。同样的条件反射让她能在一瞬间打破日常的恍惚状态，也让她对警报后的发展有了预期。这些预期并未实现，即便经历了几乎无眠的夜晚，她的感官依旧敏锐。床单和她的衣服一样不舒适，甚至她自己头发拂过脖颈的感觉也成了恼人的刺激。她将昨天的衣物扔进洗衣篮，思索着自己的处境。

Staying at home was out of the question; for all that her attendance was pointless, it would be unpleasant to have to explain such a large wilful deviation from routine to the Commander or Dr Akagi.  
待在家里是不可能的；尽管她的出席毫无意义，但向司令或赤木博士解释如此大的故意偏离常规的行为会令人不快。

She could not plead a gastrointestinal upset; her biochemical makeup was anathema to every pathogen and parasite known to humanity, and for all that she found the tastes and textures of flesh unpleasant, she had no dietary intolerances in the biological sense.  
她不能以肠胃不适为由；她的生化构成对所有已知的人类病原体和寄生虫都是天敌，尽管她觉得肉类的味道和质地令人不快，但从生物学角度来看，她没有任何饮食不耐受的问题。

Pondering that last point, Rei walked into the kitchen. The Section Two agent who had helped her move her things – such as they were – into the apartment had left some jars of herbs and spices in one of the cupboards. She had never even bothered to unseal them, having no context for how they might be used. She picked up one of the jars, pondering the flat yellowish seeds and red flakes inside, and remembered that humans sometimes used strong, ostensibly unpleasant stimuli to distract themselves from weaker but more vexing stimuli.  
思索着这一点，丽走进了厨房。那位帮助她搬运行李——尽管并不多——到公寓的第二部门特工，在其中一个橱柜里留下了一些香草和香料罐。她甚至从未费心去开封它们，因为不知道如何使用。她拿起其中一个罐子，凝视着里面扁平的黄褐色种子和红色碎屑，想起了人类有时会利用强烈、表面上不愉快的刺激来分散自己对较弱但更令人烦恼的刺激的注意力。

She peeled the plastic seal off the jar and unscrewed the lid.  
她撕开罐子上的塑料封条，旋开了盖子。

---

Shoulders squared in the best impression of "imperious" she could manage, Asuka swept her gaze over the class, contemplating the people she was about to spend six hours a day with.  
阿斯卡挺直肩膀，尽可能地模仿出“威严”的姿态，目光扫过整个班级，思考着即将与她每天共度六小时的人们。

There was Shinji, of course, but thinking about that too much was a bad idea.  
当然有真嗣，但过多地思考这件事可不是个好主意。

There was the jock and the nerd who'd been with Shinji on the _Over the Rainbow_. The nerd flinched and the jock met her gaze with a scowl.  
还有那个运动员和书呆子，他们和真嗣一起在《彩虹之上》。书呆子畏缩了一下，而运动员则皱着眉头迎上了她的目光。

There was the blue-haired pilot – Ayanami, was it? She looked back at Asuka with a terrifying intensity that didn't mesh with that memory of Shinji's.  
还有那个蓝发的驾驶员——是绫波吗？她以一种与真嗣记忆中不相符的可怕强度回望着明日香。

One of the girls, who'd been "blessed" by her hormones, smirked; the rest had nothing to make them stand out.  
其中一个女孩，被她的荷尔蒙“眷顾”了，轻蔑地笑了笑；其他人则没有什么能让自己脱颖而出的特点。

"Good morning," she said. "I'm Asuka Langley Souryuu. I'm here to protect you all from the Angels, and if anyone sticks a love letter in my locker I'll make him eat it."  
“早上好，”她说道，“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我来这里是为了保护你们免受使徒的侵害，如果有人敢在我的储物柜里塞情书，我就让他把它吃下去。”

A hushed murmur ran around the classroom, only to be stilled when the aged fossil purportedly employed as their teacher cleared his throat. "Thank you, Miss Souryuu. Please be seated. Gentlemen, please remember that lockers are not mailboxes."  
教室里响起一阵低语，直到那位据说是他们老师的年迈化石清了清嗓子，才安静下来。“谢谢你，惣流小姐。请坐。先生们，请记住，储物柜不是邮箱。”

Asuka walked over to the desk in front of Ayanami. Up close, she could see that her fellow pilot's expression was not so much one of "intensity" as one of discomfort. "Hi," said Asuka before settling into her seat.  
明日香走到绫波面前的桌子旁。近距离看，她发现这位同僚驾驶员的表情与其说是“专注”，不如说是不适。“嗨，”明日香说着，坐到了自己的座位上。

"Good morning, Pilot Souryuu." Ayanami paused and tilted her head. "You remind me of Pilot Ikari. Can we talk later?"  
“早上好，惣流驾驶员。”绫波停顿了一下，歪了歪头。“你让我想起了碇驾驶员。我们稍后能谈谈吗？”

The teacher started speaking in a flat, droning voice that could almost have been calculated to make his pupils zone out. "Now, in the wake of Second Impact, old Tokyo was struck by both geological upheaval and a deliberate nuclear attack..."  
老师开始用一种平板、单调的声音讲课，那声音几乎像是精心设计来让学生们走神的。“现在，在第二次冲击之后，旧东京不仅遭受了地质剧变，还遭到了蓄意的核攻击……”

---

Sitting up on the roof with Rei and Asuka, Shinii stared in shock as Rei produced a jar of chilli flakes from her bag and shook a generous dose out onto her lunch. "Ah, Ayanami, are you—"  
坐在屋顶上与丽和明日香一起，真嗣震惊地看着丽从包里拿出一罐辣椒粉，慷慨地撒在她的午餐上。“啊，绫波，你这是——”

"My clothes are deeply uncomfortable," replied Rei. "Intense sensory stimuli make it less noticeable. Capsaicin is a convenient source."  
“我的衣服非常不舒服，”丽回答道，“强烈的感官刺激会减轻这种感觉。辣椒素是个方便的来源。”

Asuka snorted. "I know these uniforms are ridiculous, but they're not _that_ bad, are they?"  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“我知道这些制服很荒谬，但也没那么糟糕吧？”

Rei took a bite of her lunch before responding. "Cloth is unpleasant, and my senses are heightened due to yesterday's alert not bringing me into combat."  
丽咬了一口午餐，然后回答道：“布料让人不适，而且昨天的警报并未让我进入战斗状态，我的感官因此变得更加敏锐。”

"Why don't you tell Dr Akagi?" asked Shinji.  
“你为什么不告诉赤木博士呢？”真嗣问道。

"You were visibly distressed by the condition of my apartment. Dr Akagi is not." Rei took another bite of her lunch. "She is not concerned with my comfort."  
“你明显对我的公寓状况感到不安。赤木博士不会。”丽又吃了一口午餐，“她并不关心我的舒适。”

His opinion of the scientist lurching further downward, Shinji decided to move the conversation on. "I guess that wasn't what you wanted to talk to us about, though."  
他对这位科学家的看法进一步下滑，真嗣决定转移话题。“我想那不是你想和我们谈的事情吧。”

"You are experiencing mutual mental contamination," said Rei. "It is a very strange sight. Have you touched each other since then?"  
“你们正在经历相互的精神污染，”绫波说，“这景象非常奇特。你们在那之后有接触过吗？”

"What the hell kind of question is that?" asked Asuka, scowling at the bluenette as she devoured more of her chilli-strewn lunch.  
“这算什么鬼问题？”明日香皱眉看着蓝发女孩，同时继续大口吃着满是辣椒的午餐。

"It's a Rei kind of question," said Shinji. "You get used to it. Anyway. No, we haven't touched each other since we left the entry plug."  
"这是个丽式的问题，" 真嗣说。"你慢慢就习惯了。总之，没有，自从离开插入栓后我们就没有碰过对方。"

"Thank you, Pilot Ikari."  
"谢谢你，碇司令。"

"You said it was a strange sight. What do you mean?"  
"你说过那是个奇怪的景象。你指的是什么？"

"I may have said too much. You are..." Rei tilted her head, then smiled very slightly. "You are Evangelion pilots. Your performance against the Angels would be well served by understanding your situation. This is not an ideal venue. May I come home with you this afternoon?"  
"我可能说得太多。你是……" 丽微微侧头，然后略带微笑地说，"你们是 EVA 驾驶员。对天使的战斗表现需要你们理解自己的处境。这里不是理想的场所。今天下午我可以跟你回家吗？"

Shinji smiled back at Rei. "All right by me," he said.  
真嗣对丽回以微笑。"我完全没问题，"他说。

Asuka looked at Rei and shifted uncomfortably. "I... guess. I can't really argue with the idea."  
明日香看着丽，不安地挪动了一下。"我……我想可以。这个提议我没什么好反驳的。"

Rei's smile widened a little further. "I look forward to visiting you."  
丽的眼神微微一亮。“我很期待拜访您。”

Seated in his office, Kouzou looked across the shougi table at his superior. "The First Child is connecting with the other pilots," he observed, moving a pawn.  
坐在办公室里，耕助隔着将棋桌看向他的上级。“初号机驾驶员正在与其他飞行员建立联系，”他观察道，移动了一个步兵。

"If her loyalty wavers, she can be replaced. If it doesn't, she becomes a means to influence the others." Gendou dropped his bishop in an attacking position. "The scenario is not unacceptably perturbed."  
“如果她的忠诚动摇，她可以被替换。如果不动摇，她就成了影响其他人的手段。”源堂放下了一个攻击性的角行。“局势并未受到不可接受的干扰。”

It was a bold move. Kouzou sat back in his chair and pondered it. "What is the Committee's angle?"  
这是一个大胆的举动。高雄靠回椅背，沉思着。“委员会的意图是什么？”

"Irrelevant." Gendou looked at the clock. "I have an appointment with a uniformed fool. Excuse me. Let us continue this later."  
“无关紧要。”源堂看了看时钟。“我有个和穿制服的傻瓜的约会。失陪了。我们稍后再继续。”

"Of course." “当然可以。”

### [Chapter 12](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/54413122): Crosstalk  
第十二章：对口相声

### Chapter Text 正文

The three pilots sat around Misato's dining table, with Asuka and Shinji facing each other and Rei sat at the end of the table watching them both. Shinji's right hand was palm-down on the table, and Asuka's left was palm-down on top of it.  
三位驾驶员围坐在美里家的餐桌旁，明日香和真嗣面对面坐着，而绫波则坐在桌尾，注视着他们两人。真嗣的右手掌心朝下放在桌上，明日香的左手掌心朝下覆盖其上。

Shinji felt pressure against the palm of his left hand, like he was resting it on top of someone else's, and an entirely unfamiliar band of pressure around his ribcage.  
真嗣感到左手掌心传来压力，仿佛正置于他人手掌之上，同时肋骨周围环绕着一种完全陌生的压迫感。

Asuka felt pressure against the back and the palm of her right hand, like it was sandwiched between someone else's hand and something hard and flat.  
明日香感到右手背和掌心都有压力，像是被夹在别人的手和某个坚硬平坦的物体之间。

Rei's inhuman senses showed her the transposed fragments of her fellow pilots' souls lighting up.  
丽那非人的感官向她展示了她的同伴驾驶员灵魂碎片的错位，正闪烁着光芒。

"This is weird," declared Asuka, flexing her right hand. "It's like I'm feeling what you're touching."  
“这太奇怪了，”明日香伸了伸右手说道，“感觉就像我能感受到你触摸的东西。”

Shinji shifted slightly in his seat, and Asuka felt a bundle of sensation, mostly an uncomfortable pressure, that seemed to be coming from somewhere she didn't—  
真嗣在座位上稍微挪动了一下，明日香随即感受到一股感觉，主要是种不适的压力，似乎来自一个她未曾——

Facts connected in her brain, and with a cry of "pervert!" she slapped him with her right hand. The impact registered in her hand and her face simultaneously, making her flinch and breaking the sensory connection.  
事实在她脑海中串联起来，伴随着一声“变态！”她用右手扇了他一巴掌。冲击力同时传到她的手和脸上，让她不由得一缩，感官联系也随之断裂。

"Ow!" cried Shinji and Asuka in unison.  
“哎哟！”真嗣和明日香异口同声地叫道。

"What was that for?" added Shinji.  
“你这是干什么？”真嗣补充道。

Asuka rubbed her cheek, despite the pain having vanished as soon as she stopped touching Shinji. "You were being a perv!"  
尽管疼痛在她停止触碰真嗣的那一刻就消失了，明日香还是揉了揉脸颊。“你刚才太变态了！”

"What do you mean?" interjected Rei, confused by the exchange.  
“你什么意思？”绫波插话道，对这场对话感到困惑。

Asuka and Shinji both went red, and Asuka managed to get some words out. "Look, I know what the pressure I felt means, OK?"  
明日香和真嗣都脸红了，明日香勉强挤出几句话。“听着，我知道我感受到的压力意味着什么，好吗？”

Rei put together the pieces of the situation in her head and nodded. She didn't entirely understand why it bothered Asuka, but it was good enough to work with. "I see. I'm sorry this upset you. It proves I was right about your status, though."  
丽在脑海中拼凑出情况的片段，点了点头。她并不完全理解为什么这让明日香感到困扰，但足够用来应对了。“我明白了。很抱歉这让你不安。不过，这证明了我对你状态的判断是正确的。”

"So... there's part of my soul in Asuka, and part of hers in me?"  
“所以... 我的灵魂有一部分在明日香体内，她的也有一部分在我这里？”

"Yes," replied Rei. "When you touch each other, you connect to the missing part and receive sensory impressions from it."  
“是的，”丽回答道，“当你们彼此接触时，你们会连接到缺失的那部分，并从中接收到感官印象。”

"I don't want part of Shinji in me!"  
“我不要带有真嗣的一部分在我身上！”

Shinji blinked at the outburst. Asuka stopped, looked at him, and fled the table with her cheeks blazing.  
真嗣对这突如其来的爆发眨了眨眼。明日香停了下来，看了他一眼，然后满脸通红地逃离了餐桌。

---

Misato looked over the front page of the report Lieutenant Ibuki had given her. The minimalist summary at the top was discouraging enough – "43% confidence" was a bad sign – but the longer summary was worse.  
美里翻阅着伊吹摩耶中尉递给她的报告首页。顶部简洁的摘要已经够让人沮丧了——“43%的信心”是个不祥的征兆——但更长的摘要则更糟糕。

The man the MAGI were proposing as the shooter had been a sniper in the JGSDF who went AWOL four days before the shooting. He had no surviving family on record and had been raised in an orphanage before enlisting straight out of high school. Nothing unusual there – Japan's orphanages had been overloaded since Second Impact, and enlisting gave you better opportunities, both in service and after discharge, than waiting until you got conscripted.  
MAGI 系统所指认的枪手曾是日本陆上自卫队的一名狙击手，他在枪击事件发生前四天擅自离队。记录中他没有幸存的家人，高中毕业后直接从孤儿院参军。这并不罕见——第二次冲击后，日本的孤儿院一直人满为患，参军能提供比等待征召更好的机会，无论是在服役期间还是退役后。

His SDF disciplinary record, on the other hand, appeared to be complete bullshit; he should have been court-martialled and dishonorably discharged three times over, but he'd never received anything worse than a formal reprimand.  
另一方面，他的自卫队纪律记录看起来完全是胡扯；他本应三次被送上军事法庭并被勒令退伍，但他从未受到比正式训斥更严重的处罚。

On top of that, he was the only survivor from his platoon following an ambush while doing COIN work in the Mekong Protectorate, yet he'd been passed fit for duty before being transferred to an undermanned platoon and rotated back to Japan. The closing line of the front page was an understatement. "Records associated with this suspect exhibit peculiarities consistent with deliberate tampering."  
除此之外，他在湄公河保护区执行反叛乱任务时遭遇伏击，全排只有他一人幸存，然而他在被调往人手不足的排并轮换回日本之前，却被判定适合继续服役。头版结尾的那句话颇为含蓄。“与此嫌疑人相关的记录显示出与蓄意篡改一致的特殊性。”

She looked up from the report to see Kaji standing in the doorway of her office. "Hello, you," she said.  
她从报告上抬起头，看到加持站在办公室门口。“你好，你，”她说。

"Good afternoon." He smiled sympathetically at her. "The look on your face says you don't like what you're reading."  
“下午好。”他同情地对她微笑。“你脸上的表情说明你不喜欢正在读的东西。”

"Those romances Ibuki reads make more sense than this shit."  
“伊吹读的那些言情小说都比这堆垃圾有逻辑。”

"Sounds like something a dashing, handsome UN Inspector needs to investigate."  
"听起来像是某个英俊潇洒的联合国调查员需要调查的事情。"

Some things never changed. Misato rolled her eyes and extended the report towards him. "Well, when you find one, hand him this."  
有些事情永远不会改变。美里翻了个白眼，将报告递给他。“好吧，当你找到他时，把这个交给他。”

He took the document off her hands and started reading the first page. After a few moments, he sighed and shook his head. "This is going to be a fun case. Are we still on for Saturday?"  
他从她手中接过文件，开始阅读第一页。片刻后，他叹了口气，摇了摇头。“这案子会很有趣。我们周六的计划没变吧？”

"Why would I miss having fancy dinner at your expense? Of course."  
"为什么要错过你请客的豪华晚餐呢？当然去。"

"Glad to hear it." Kaji grinned. "See you later, Katsuragi."  
"很高兴听你这么说。" 加持笑了笑。"回头见，葛城。"

"See you later, Kaji." "回头见，加持。"

Misato wondered, as her idiot ex departed, just what she'd got herself into.  
美里在她那白痴前男友离开时，不禁疑惑自己究竟卷入了什么麻烦。

---

"Would you like to stay for dinner?"  
“你愿意留下来吃晚饭吗？”

Rei contemplated the invitation. On the one hand, spending more time in Shinji's company would be pleasant. On the other hand, she was not entirely comfortable with Asuka's company, and there was the question of how the Commander and Dr Akagi would react to her seeking to reinforce social bonds. "Does Asuka like vegetarian food?"  
绫波思考着这个邀请。一方面，与真嗣共度更多时光会很愉快。另一方面，她对与明日香相处并不完全自在，还有指挥官和赤木博士对她试图加强社交联系会有何反应的问题。“明日香喜欢素食吗？”

Shinji looked towards the redhead's room and sighed. "Probably not," he admitted. "And I've left it a little late to prepare two different mains."  
真嗣朝红发女孩的房间望去，叹了口气。“可能不会吧，”他承认道，“而且我也没留出足够时间准备两道主菜。”

"Then I should thank you for the invitation, but regretfully decline. It would be pleasant to dine with you another time." She reached into her school bag, pulled out the jar of chilli flakes, and shook it to settle the contents. "I need to buy more of these. I don't know how long my present state will persist."  
“那么我应该感谢你的邀请，但很遗憾地婉拒。改天与你共进晚餐会很愉快。”她伸手进书包，拿出那罐辣椒片，摇了摇以压实内容物。“我需要多买些这个。不知道我现在的状态会持续多久。”

The look on Shinji's face appeared to be one of alarm. "Is it healthy eating that much chilli?"  
真嗣脸上的表情似乎是惊慌。“吃那么多辣椒健康吗？”

"Humans not used to it would suffer considerable discomfort throughout the alimentary canal." She smiled a little, in a manner she hoped was reassuring. "I do not anticipate experiencing any difficulty. Good night, Shinji. I will see you tomorrow."  
"不习惯的人会在整个消化道中感到相当不适。" 她微微一笑，希望这种方式能让人安心。"我不认为我会遇到任何困难。晚安，真嗣。明天见。"

### [Chapter 13](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/57486826): Point of Contact  
第十三章：接触点

### Chapter Text 正文

Wednesday morning at school found Rei watching her fellow pilots. Shinji was glancing occasionally at Asuka, and there was a visible tension in Asuka's posture as the redhead kept her eyes fixed on the blackboard. Whatever had happened after she left, Rei sensed that it had not been any kind of _resolution_.  
周三早晨在学校，丽观察着她的同伴驾驶员们。真嗣偶尔瞥向明日香，而明日香则明显紧张地保持着目光紧盯黑板的姿势。无论她离开后发生了什么，丽感觉到那并不是任何形式的解决。

She turned her thoughts to her own problems. There were advantages to her heightened awareness – after all, she wouldn't have been able to notice and investigate the interesting phenomenon that was Shinji and Asuka's connection without it – but it was very wearying, and her steady intake of capsaicin to distract from the wretched garments she was compelled to wear was... not ideal, for all that she had deflected Shinji's concerns the previous evening.  
她将思绪转向自己的问题。这种增强的意识有其优势——毕竟，没有它，她也无法察觉并调查碇真嗣和明日香之间那有趣的现象——但它非常耗神，而她为了分散对被迫穿着的糟糕衣物的注意力，不断摄入辣椒素的做法……并不理想，尽管她昨晚巧妙地打消了真嗣的担忧。

She couldn't approach Dr Akagi about the subject. She was unsure whether the scientist could be trusted to use anything but the most direct of methods, and she had no wish to return to the depths of her habitual daze.  
她不能向赤木律子博士咨询这个问题。她不确定这位科学家是否只会采用最直接的方法，而且她也不想回到那种习惯性的恍惚状态。

She couldn't approach the Commander. Her mental state was outside his expertise. He might very well simply ask Dr Akagi to address the situation.  
她也不能去找司令。她的精神状态超出了他的专业范畴。他很可能会直接让赤木律子博士来处理这种情况。

Captain Katsuragi was a possibility, but Shinji's occasional remarks about their superior raised questions over her suitability.  
葛城美里队长是一个可能的人选，但真嗣偶尔对她上司的评价让人对她是否合适产生了疑问。

She opened the messaging application on her school laptop, and was immediately reminded why she didn't use it. The logs were littered with inane requests from other students. A few moments' work allowed an indiscriminate purge, and then she typed a message to Shinji. "May I sit with you and Asuka for lunch again? It was pleasant."  
她打开学校笔记本上的消息应用程序，立刻明白了为什么她不常用它。日志里充斥着其他学生无聊的请求。片刻的工作让她得以进行无差别的清理，然后她给真嗣发了一条消息。" May I sit with you and Asuka for lunch again? It was pleasant. "

Shinji's response was disappointing. "Not sure she wants to sit with me. She wouldn't look at me at breakfast this morning. I can sit with you if you'd like."  
真嗣的回复令人失望。" Not sure she wants to sit with me. She wouldn't look at me at breakfast this morning. I can sit with you if you'd like. "

"That would be pleasant. Do you mind if I ask Asuka? I think it would be better for us if we were able to interact with each other regularly."

"OK."

---

Asuka frowned at the message from Rei on her laptop. "Would you like to sit with me and Shinji for lunch today?"  
明日香对着笔记本上来自绫波的消息皱起了眉头。" Would you like to sit with me and Shinji for lunch today? "

Her cheeks flushed as she remembered the previous afternoon. The id— _Shinji_ had started thinking pervy thoughts about her. She supposed it shouldn't really be a surprise. Boys were like that and she had an inkling he'd more or less never touched a girl apart from the time she was trying to not think about his memory of, so touching a girl who he could feel what she was touching probably would make him perv out over something.  
她想起前一天下午，脸颊不由得泛红。那个笨蛋——真嗣开始对她产生了一些色色的想法。她觉得这并不意外。男生就是这样，而且她隐约感觉到，除了她试图不去想的那次经历外，他几乎从未接触过其他女孩，所以触摸一个能让他感受到她所触摸之物的女孩，很可能会让他产生一些不纯洁的念头。

There was the question of why she hadn't noticed anything like that when they held hands in the café, but they _had_ both had bigger concerns than 'feeling a bit weird' at that point.  
至于为什么他们在咖啡馆牵手时她没有注意到这种感觉，但那时他们都有比“感觉有点奇怪”更重要的担忧。

And she still had to share Misato's apartment with him, because Kaji was an arsehole and there was no way she was doing her own laundry if she could help it. Even if it meant a risk that maybe he was _doing things_ with it.  
而且她还不得不和他共享美里小姐的公寓，因为加持是个混蛋，如果可以避免的话，她绝不会自己洗衣服。即便这意味着可能会有风险，也许他会用它做些什么。

No, she thought. He wasn't quite that kind of perv. With a sigh, she typed a reply to Rei. "All right, then." Sitting together as the three of them would probably help stop people getting the wrong idea about her and Shinji.  
不，她想。他还没到那种变态的程度。她叹了口气，给绫波回了一条消息。" All right, then. "三个人坐在一起，或许能阻止别人对她和真嗣产生误会。

---

Something was amiss, Asuka realized, as she wolfed down her lunch. Sitting with Rei and Shinji, she could feel an odd, nagging sensation like... like something wasn't there when it should be, which was stupid. She definitely wasn't missing any body parts. She set down her chopsticks. Eating lunch with people in silence was too weird. "So, Rei, what kind of music do you listen to?"  
明日香意识到有些不对劲，她狼吞虎咽地吃着午餐。和绫波与真嗣坐在一起，她能感觉到一种奇怪的、令人不安的感觉，就像...就像有些东西本该存在却不在，这很愚蠢。她肯定没有缺少任何身体部位。她放下筷子。和别人一起沉默地吃午饭太奇怪了。"那么，绫波，你喜欢听什么类型的音乐？"

The bluenette shrugged. "I don't."  
蓝发少年耸了耸肩。“我不听。”

Asuka blinked. "Who the hell doesn't listen to music? Apart from deaf people, I mean. Obviously they don't."  
明日香眨了眨眼。“除了聋子，还有谁不听音乐？我的意思是，他们显然不会听。”

"I don't have any equipment to do so. It never felt necessary."  
“我没有设备来听音乐。一直觉得没必要。”

_Who even raised her?_ "Well, we should do something about that, shouldn't we, Shinji?"  
谁把她养大的？“好吧，我们得处理一下这事，对吧，真嗣？”

At the opposite corner of the table, Shinji looked up from his lunch. "Uh, sorry, I didn't catch that."  
在桌子的另一角，真嗣从午餐中抬起头来。“呃，抱歉，我没听清。”

"I said we should find some music for Rei to listen to! Can you believe she doesn't listen to any? And _we_ still need to go to a record shop anyway, because _I_ need to replace what got sunk and _you_ need to listen to something written after 1850!"  
“我说我们应该找些音乐给绫波听！你能相信她从不听音乐吗？而且我们还得去唱片店，因为我需要替换那些沉没的东西，而你需要听听 1850 年后的作品！”

"I like Stravinsky. He was after 1850."  
"我喜欢斯特拉文斯基。他生于 1850 年之后。"

"Fine, after 1950, then! And it needs to be something with electric gui—" As she leaned across the table, her hand touched Shinji's, and she gave a yelp of surprise as she realized her sense of something _missing_ was gone. She recoiled from the accidental contact, and the _missingness_ returned.  
"好吧，那就 1950 年之后的！而且得是带电吉他的那种——" 当她俯身越过桌子时，她的手碰到了真嗣的手，她惊叫一声，意识到那种缺失感消失了。她因意外的接触而退缩，那种缺失感又回来了。"

"You are very passionate about this," observed Rei, as Asuka flopped back down into her seat.  
"你对这个很热衷啊，" 丽观察道，看着明日香又瘫坐回她的座位。"

"It's really important," replied Asuka in a voice much smaller than usual. _I mustn't run away._  
"这真的很重要，" 明日香用比平时小得多的声音回答。我不能逃避。

"All right," said Shinji. "Let's go record shopping. I guess Rei might need something to play things on as well. If we go at the weekend we'll have time to browse properly and sit down afterwards and listen to things."  
"好吧，" 真嗣说。"我们去唱片店逛逛吧。我想丽可能也需要播放设备。如果周末去的话，我们就有足够的时间仔细挑选，之后还可以坐下来听听音乐。"

Asuka nodded and returned her attention to her lunch. Food was good. Food didn't complicate her life.  
明日香点点头，重新将注意力集中在午餐上。食物很好。食物不会让她的生活变得复杂。

### [Chapter 14](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/58184392): Resynchronization  
第十四章：再同步

### Chapter Text 正文

Down in the deepest parts of NERV HQ, with only the floor – and ten layers of armour – separating her from the "LCL Production Plant", Ritsuko tapped her fingers nervously on the workbench. Ayanami's behaviour was different, and the fact the girl was suspended in LCL behind an inch of armoured glass did very little to make that less worrying.  
在 NERV 总部最深处，仅有一层地板——以及十层装甲——将她与“LCL 生产工厂”隔开，律子紧张地用手指敲打着工作台。绫波的行为有所不同，而女孩悬浮在 LCL 中，背后是一英寸厚的装甲玻璃，这一点并没有减少她的担忧。

Gendou taking so long to answer her call wasn't helping. _Come on, you bastard, pick up._  
源堂迟迟不接她的电话也无济于事。快点，混蛋，接电话。

Click. "Doctor. Is something wrong?"  
咔嗒。“医生。有什么不对劲吗？”

"Ayanami seemed agitated when she arrived for her backup. I'm not sure I've ever seen her undress that fast before outside of combat prep." She looked at the rack of drug cartridges next to the workstation. Formula three would be easiest, but six would probably yield the best results. A couple of buttons, a few squirts of carefully chosen chemicals into the suspension tank, and she could have her peace of mind back. "I can address the issue easily enough, but I knew you'd want to offer some input."  
“绫波来支援时显得很焦躁。我不确定我是否见过她在战斗准备之外脱衣服这么快。”她看向工作台旁边的一排药物注射筒。三号配方最容易，但六号可能效果最好。按几个按钮，往悬浮罐里喷几下精心挑选的化学品，她就能恢复平静了。“我可以轻松解决这个问题，但我知道你会想提供一些意见。”

"I'm aware of a shift in her behaviour. If it causes a serious problem, it will be dealt with. Until then, do not interfere."  
“我注意到了她的行为变化。如果这造成严重问题，会处理的。在那之前，不要干预。”

That wasn't the answer she wanted. She pressed the issue. "The MAGI estimate a 200% increase in the size of the backup delta compared to last week. It's not going to finish in the normal time window. That's going to cause a problem right there."  
那不是她想要的答案。她继续追问。“MAGI 估计备份三角洲的大小比上周增加了 200%。它无法在正常时间内完成。这将直接导致问题。”

"Move the backup window to Saturday nights." Gendou's tone shifted subtly, even if his language remained professional. "I believe that would be a suitable time for a conference once the process is under way."  
“将备份时间调整到周六晚上。”源渡的语气微妙地转变，尽管他的措辞依然专业。“我认为一旦进程开始，那个时间适合召开会议。”

Ritsuko hesitated, grateful that this was a voice-only connection. Their last couple of... _conferences_ had not been to her taste, in more ways than one. She couldn't help wondering if he'd changed his diet. "Of course, Commander."  
律子犹豫了一下，庆幸这只是语音通话。他们最近几次的...会议，她并不喜欢，而且不止一个方面。她不禁猜想他是否改变了饮食习惯。“当然，指挥官。”

"Very good. Cancel tonight's backup. Have Section Two return Ayanami to her accommodation." Click.  
“非常好。取消今晚的备用计划。让第二部门将绫波送回她的住处。”咔哒。

Ritsuko rubbed her upper arms as she looked towards the suspension cylinder. She could have done with a break before interacting with Ayanami again.  
律子揉了揉上臂，目光投向悬浮圆柱体。她本可以在再次与绫波接触前休息一下。

---

As the hot spray of the shower sent orange rivulets of diluted LCL streaming down the drain, Rei pondered the incidents of the evening.  
当热水喷洒在身上，橙色的 LCL 稀释液顺着排水管流下时，绫波思考着今晚发生的事情。

Given how unpleasant cloth felt against her skin, she had been looking forward to the backup process, and the multiple hours of being suspended in LCL without even a plugsuit. To have it interrupted after less than an hour and be ordered to wash, dress, and report to Section Two's motor pool to be driven home was... displeasing.  
考虑到布料贴在皮肤上的不适感，她一直期待着备份过程，以及连续数小时悬浮在 LCL 中，甚至连紧身衣都不用穿。然而，不到一小时就被打断，被命令去洗澡、更衣，并前往第二区的车库乘车回家，这实在令人不快。

Dr Akagi's behaviour towards her was different, too. Normally the scientist treated her with a certain disdain, like she regarded Rei as barely more than an animated object. This evening, though, there was anxiety and tension in Dr Akagi's movement and manner.  
赤木博士对她的态度也不同以往。通常这位科学家对她带着某种轻蔑，仿佛把丽视作一个活生生的物体。但今晚，赤木博士的动作和举止中流露出焦虑和紧张。

Rei wondered what inspired such a reaction. She could not imagine herself engaging in violence towards Dr Akagi. She had no motive to do so, and in any event the likely result would be the termination of her current body and the continuous sedation of its replacement.  
丽想知道是什么引发了这样的反应。她无法想象自己会对赤木博士施以暴力。她没有这样做的动机，而且无论如何，最可能的结果是当前身体的终结和替代者的持续麻醉。

She ran her fingers through her hair, separating her locks to allow the shower to loosen every last trace of LCL. Immersion was pleasant, but letting it dry and congeal was not.  
她用手指梳理着头发，分开发丝，让淋浴冲走每一丝 LCL 的痕迹。沉浸其中固然舒适，但任其干燥凝结却并非所愿。

"Ayanami!" shouted Dr Akagi from the doorway. "What's taking so long?"  
“绫波！”赤城博士在门口喊道，“怎么这么久？”

Rei sighed and twisted this way and that under the shower one last time before turning off the water. "I wished to be particularly sure I had cleaned all the LCL out of my hair before getting in a Section Two vehicle. It would be inappropriate to contaminate the headrests."  
绫波叹了口气，在淋浴下又扭动了几下，确保无遗漏后才关掉水。“我想特别确保头发中的 LCL 都清洗干净，再进入二号区的车辆。污染头枕是不合适的。”

She started towelling off. The rough cotton was no more pleasant against her skin than her school uniform, but the contact was brief, and entirely in her own control. She left her hair wetter than usual; if it was wet, it would cling to her instead of brushing against her neck.  
她开始用毛巾擦干身体。粗糙的棉质毛巾触感并不比她的校服更舒适，但接触时间短暂，完全由她掌控。她让头发比平时更湿；如果头发是湿的，就会贴在她身上，而不是拂过她的脖子。

Reluctantly re-dressed in her school uniform, Rei emerged from the bathroom and met Dr Akagi's gaze. "When is my next backup going to be?"  
不情愿地重新穿上校服，丽从浴室出来，迎上了赤木博士的目光。"下一次支援是什么时候？"

The scientist recoiled slightly and looked away. "Saturday. 18:00. Don't be late. The MAGI estimate it could take as much as 24 hours."  
科学家微微后退，移开了视线。"星期六。18:00。别迟到。MAGI 估计可能需要长达 24 小时。"

"Is Unit 02 ready for use? It would be unfortunate to leave Shin— Pilot Ikari as the only pilot capable of deployment."  
"02 号机准备好了吗？让真嗣——碇驾驶员成为唯一可部署的驾驶员，这可不太妙。"

"We'll be holding full sync tests for all three of you tomorrow afternoon. Now get upstairs. Section Two are waiting for you."  
"明天下午将对你们三人进行全面同步测试。现在上楼去吧。第二部门在等你们。"

---

Arriving in class on Thursday morning, Asuka started at the sight of Rei. She'd replaced her usual scruffy bob with a much shorter – but equally scruffy, like she'd hacked it into being with nail scissors – style that left her face unframed and her ears exposed. After the class rep had run them through that pointlessly deferential stand-bow-sit routine, Asuka sent a message to the bluenette.  
周四早上到校时，看到绫波，明日香愣了一下。她把平时凌乱的短发剪得更短了——但同样凌乱，像是用指甲剪随意剪出来的——这种发型让她的脸庞毫无修饰，耳朵也露了出来。班长带着他们完成了那套毫无必要的恭敬起立鞠躬坐下流程后，明日香给蓝发女孩发了条信息。

"What's with the lesbian hair?"

"I don't understand the question."

"Your new haircut. It's going to make people think you're into girls."

"As far as I know I am not 'into' any kind of human."

"If you say it like that people will wonder if you're some kind of freak who's into tentacle monsters or something."

"Humans are strange."

"You say that like you aren't one."

Rei stiffened in her seat. "Later. Bring Shinji."  
丽在座位上僵住了。" Later. Bring Shinji. "

"Hey, we're not joined at the hip, you know."

As Asuka sent that last rejoinder to Rei, the teacher cleared his throat. "Miss Souryuu, your kanji work could do with a great deal of improvement. Please pay attention to the lesson."  
当明日香向丽发出最后一击时，老师清了清嗓子。"惣流同学，你的汉字作业还有很大的提升空间。请专心听课。"

Asuka opened her mouth to protest, then thought better of it. _He'll just have that Horaki girl march me to the office or something._  
明日香张嘴想要抗议，随即又改变了主意。他只会让那个洞木女孩把我带到办公室去之类的。

There was a final message from Rei on her laptop. "Indeed. You are joined at the soul."  
她的笔记本上有一条来自丽最后的留言。" Indeed. You are joined at the soul. "

### [Chapter 15](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/59741011): Testing Times  
第十五章：考验时刻

### Chapter Text 正文

Sat at the back of the observation bay, Ritsuko ignored the hustle and bustle of technicians setting up the extra equipment to manage three live sync tests from one bay. After all, they knew their jobs and could do them perfectly well without her supervision. Her attention was instead focused on the window, and the blue-armoured giant in the test bay beyond it. How, she wondered, was that... _thing_ going to react to the Commander's precious doll's current state of agitation?  
坐在观测区的后排，律子无视了技术人员们为在一个观测区同时进行三场实时同步测试而忙碌安装额外设备的喧嚣。毕竟，他们熟悉自己的工作，无需她的监督也能完美执行。她的注意力反而集中在窗户上，以及窗外测试区里那个身披蓝色装甲的巨人。她不禁思索，那东西将如何应对指挥官珍爱的玩偶当前的躁动状态？

Would it reject her? That would be convenient.  
它会拒绝她吗？那倒是方便了。

Would it fly into a rage and try to murder them all again? That would... not be convenient, even if the window had been given extra reinforcement and a catch net to block at least the larger pieces of glass.  
它会暴怒并试图再次谋杀他们所有人吗？那样的话……就不太方便了，即便窗户已经加固并安装了捕捉网以阻挡至少较大的玻璃碎片。

Maybe everything would go smoothly and let Gendou smirk at her this Saturday during their 'conference' and tell her everything was going to the scenario. That would be annoying, but possibly for the best. Quite apart from the whole practical question of having three deployable pilots, if he was relaxed about the state of the scenario, he'd probably be more... considerate. And maybe even take some feedback on _taste_.  
也许一切都会顺利进行，让源渡这周六在他们的‘会议’上对她冷笑，并告诉她一切都在按照剧本走。那会很烦人，但可能也是最好的结果。撇开拥有三名可部署驾驶员的实际问题不谈，如果他对剧本的状况感到放松，他可能会更加……体贴。甚至可能会考虑一些口味上的反馈。

She pushed aside a treacherous and unhelpful thought about that, and fished her cigarettes out of her labcoat pocket. "Ibuki! I'm going for a smoke."  
她将那个危险而无用的念头抛诸脑后，从白大褂口袋里掏出香烟。“伊吹！我去抽根烟。”

She had a cigarette between her lips by the time the door closed behind her. Alone in the hallway, she sparked up and took a long drag. As she blew the smoke ceilingward, the elevator door across the hall slid open and Misato stepped out.  
门在她身后关上时，她已经叼着一根烟。独自站在走廊里，她点燃了烟，深深吸了一口。随着她将烟雾朝天花板吹去，对面电梯门缓缓打开，赤木律子走了出来。

"Ugh, Ritz, are you still smoking the same shitty cigarettes? At least Kaji managed to find a decent brand."  
“呃，丽兹，你还在抽那种烂烟吗？至少加治还找到了个像样的牌子。”

"If they tasted good I'd smoke more. How are your pilots?"  
"如果它们味道不错，我会多抽些。你的飞行员们怎么样？"

Misato shrugged. "Rei seems twitchy. Shinji and Asuka are... well, I told you before, Shinji's grown a sharp tongue, and Asuka's a little bit less... forceful than I'd expect. And they're probably both still a bit rattled from the shootings. The body they saw wasn't a pretty sight."  
美里耸了耸肩。“丽看起来有些紧张。真嗣和明日香...嗯，我之前跟你提过，真嗣变得言辞尖锐，而明日香则比我预期的要稍微温和一些。他们可能都还在为枪击事件感到震惊。他们看到的尸体可不是什么美好的景象。”

"Keep me posted. Anything that stands out could be important." Ritsuko glanced down at her cigarette. "Especially with _that_ throwing a wrench into things."  
“随时向我汇报。任何突出的情况都可能很重要。”律子瞥了一眼她的香烟。“尤其是这个，可能会打乱我们的计划。”

Misato's eyes narrowed. "You know, you're not very good at sounding like you care."  
美里眯起了眼睛。“你知道吗，你装关心的样子一点也不像。”

"When was I ever good at..." Ritsuko paused, and remembered a certain weekend back in uni, just after Misato and Kaji had broken up. "Don't answer that."  
“我什么时候擅长过……”律子顿了顿，想起了大学时期某个周末，就在美里和加持分手后不久。“别回答了。”

"See you inside, Ritz," said Misato with a grin as she brushed past Ritsuko, the accidental contact giving that troublesome memory a signal boost.  
“里面见，律子，”美里笑着擦身而过，无意间的触碰让那段烦人的记忆更加清晰。

She smoked the rest of her cigarette far faster than was sensible and headed back inside where there would be _work_ to do, at least if the technicians were finished.  
她将剩下的烟抽得比理智允许的要快得多，然后返回室内，那里至少还有工作要做，如果技术人员已经完成的话。

---

"Synchronization complete."  
"同步完成。"

Asuka shifted uneasily in her seat. Something wasn't quite right. She was used to Unit 02's barely-contained rage seeping through the link, but today it felt different. Blurred. Confused. She toggled on her commlink. "So what's my score?"  
明日香在座位上不安地挪动。有些不对劲。她习惯了 02 号机几乎无法控制的愤怒通过链接渗透过来，但今天感觉不同。模糊。混乱。她打开了通讯链接。“那我的得分是多少？”

"You're averaging fifty seven point three, Asuka," replied the voice of that nice friendly lieutenant – Ibuki, her name was. "There's some jitter on that, though. You're swinging by two percent either way."  
"你现在的平均分是五十七点三分，明日香。"那位友好的中尉——她的名字是伊吹——的声音回应道，"不过有些波动。你的分数在正负两个百分点之间摆动。"

_Three percent down on my last test at NERV Berlin._ "Huh. You sure that reading's correctly calibrated?"  
比上次在柏林 NERV 的测试低了三个百分点。"嗯，你确定这个读数校准正确吗？"

"We're using the calibration curve that was sent over with you and Unit 02."  
"我们使用的是随你和二号机一起送来的校准曲线。"

_Oh, wonderful._ She looked around the inside of the Evangelion cage, comparing it to its counterpart in Berlin. "Tell them to make sure they sent the latest curve. They sent me by sea without underwater gear, after all."  
哦，太好了。她环顾零号机的内部，与柏林的那台进行比较。“告诉他们确保发送的是最新曲线。毕竟，他们让我走海路却没有水下装备。”

"I'll get that double-checked for you, Asuka."  
“我会帮你再确认一遍，明日香。”

The commlink fell silent, leaving Asuka sitting in an entry plug in an idle Evangelion with nothing to do.  
通讯链接陷入沉默，留下明日香坐在闲置的初号机插入栓内无所事事。

---

"Synchronization complete."  
"同步完成。"

Shinji's grip on the controls relaxed slightly. Everything was... off. The intangible warmth he was used to was a little cooler, a little harder to grasp. He reached up to his A10 connectors to check they were properly in place, but everything seemed to be in order. He toggled on his commlink. "This doesn't feel right. It should feel warmer."  
真嗣握着操纵杆的手稍稍放松了些。一切都...不对劲。他习惯的那种无形温暖变得稍冷，更难以把握。他伸手去检查 A10 连接器是否正确安装，但一切似乎都井然有序。他切换到通讯链接。“感觉不对。应该更温暖些。”

"Hang on, Shinji, let me check the thermal readouts for the plug," replied Lieutenant Ibuki. "Does anything else feels unusual?"  
“等等，真嗣，让我检查一下插头的温度读数，”伊吹副官回应道。“还有其他什么感觉不寻常的吗？”

"No, just that." “不，只是那样。”

"OK." Ibuki paused, and Shinji heard a clatter of typing. "Thermal profile says the temperature in the entry plug is the same as usual. No hot or cold spots."  
“好的。” 碇真嗣听到一阵键盘敲击声，随后伊吹玛丽说道：“热成像显示插入栓内的温度与往常相同，没有热点或冷点。”

Shinji looked up, through Unit 01's gaze, at the empty observation box, and shook his head. "I'm not talking about that kind of warmth," he said. "When I sync with the Eva, it feels warm inside. Like..." He trailed off, unable to find the words to express it.  
真嗣抬头，通过初号机的视线望向空无一人的观察室，摇了摇头。“我不是指那种温暖，”他说，“当我与 Eva 同步时，内部感觉很温暖。就像……”他停了下来，找不到合适的词来表达。

"Well, your sync score _is_ lower than last time. You're on 51%." More typing. "You and Asuka are both showing some jitter on your score – about 2% either way."  
"嗯，你的同步率比上次低了。现在是 51%。" 更多的打字声。"你和明日香都显示出了一些波动——大约正负 2%。"

Dr Akagi joined in the conversation. "Hello, Shinji. We'll have to look more closely at these results, but for the moment, there's no major concern. You should be fine to pilot in the field if an Angel attacks – just be mindful of the jitter. We might need to run a field exercise with you and Asuka."  
赤木律子博士加入了对话。"你好，真嗣。我们需要更仔细地分析这些结果，但目前没有重大担忧。如果使徒来袭，你应该可以继续驾驶 EVA——只是要注意波动。我们可能需要安排你和明日香进行一次实地训练。"

---

"There's no 'might' about it, Ritz."  
"没有'可能'这回事，律子。"

The voice in Ritsuko's ear was friendly enough, but the remark reminded her that all was still not entirely well between herself and Misato. She nodded. "Of course. When should we run it?"  
"耳边传来的声音足够友好，但这句话提醒了 Ritsuko，她和 Misato 之间的问题并未完全解决。她点点头。“当然。我们什么时候进行？””

"Sunday." “周日。”

"Possible. Let's see Ayanami's results first. Maya, do the honours."  
“有可能。我们先看看 Ayanami 的结果。Maya，请展示一下。”

---

"Synchronization complete."  
"同步完成。"

Rei looked around the cage. This was not how a sync test should feel. Sync tests were supposed to happen in her baseline neurological state. All of her results had been taken in that state. As long as her sync ratio in that state was adequate, she would be certain of being able to operate Unit 00.  
绫波环视着牢笼。这不是同步测试应有的感觉。同步测试本应在她的基准神经状态下进行。她所有的结果都是在那种状态下取得的。只要她在那种状态下的同步率足够，她就能确定自己能够操作零号机。

"Congratulations, Rei! Your score is up five points from your last sync test. You're almost level with Asuka. Whatever you're doing, keep it up."  
"恭喜你，绫波！你的分数比上次同步测试提高了五分。你几乎和明日香持平了。无论你在做什么，继续保持。"

Rei paused. She wished to dispel Lieutenant Ibuki's impression that her sync rate improvement was the result of something she had done, but she did not wish to draw Dr Akagi's attention to the anomaly. Her continued heightened awareness was a difficult burden to bear, but any intervention would be... blunt.  
丽停顿了一下。她希望消除伊吹中尉对她同步率提升的印象，认为这是她所做的事情的结果，但她不希望引起赤城博士对这一异常现象的注意。她持续的高度警觉是一个难以承受的负担，但任何干预都会是...粗暴的。

"Thank you, Lieutenant. I shall do my best." An idea occurred to her. Sitting in the entry plug, wearing her plugsuit and immersed in LCL, was a much more pleasant condition than any practically maintainable condition she could reach in her living quarters. "Would you like to get an extended data set?"  
“谢谢你，中尉。我会尽力的。”一个想法闪过她的脑海。坐在插入栓里，穿着插入栓服并沉浸在 LCL 中，比她在生活区能维持的任何实际条件都要舒适得多。“你想获取更长时间的数据集吗？”

---

Ritsuko wanted the data in front of her to go away. Ayanami's sync rate was stable, and higher than normal for a sync test. Gendou's decision to leave her be would stand up to scrutiny. "Excellent work," she said, trying not to sound like she was gritting her teeth. "Let's get a few more minutes of background data before shutdown."  
律子希望眼前的数据消失。绫波的同步率稳定，且高于正常同步测试的水平。源渡决定让她自由行动的决定经得起审查。“干得好，”她说，尽量不让自己听起来像是在咬牙切齿。“让我们在关机前再获取几分钟的背景数据。”

"So, Ritz, are we good for Sunday?"  
"那么，丽兹，周日我们没问题吧？"

Ritsuko looked at her old friend and nodded. "I suppose. Ayanami and I will be unavailable due to an essential procedure, but I believe Lieutenant Ibuki can handle the Project E side of the exercise."  
律子看着老朋友点了点头。“我想可以。绫波和我因为一个重要程序无法参加，但我相信伊吹副官能处理好‘E 计划’方面的演练。”

"I can live with that. What kind of 'essential procedure' are we talking about?"  
“我可以接受。你说的‘重要程序’是什么？”

Ritsuko recalled the 'conference' following the last time she'd given Misato more information than Gendou thought was strictly necessary where the surveillance systems were online, and barely suppressed a shudder. "That information's only available at the Commander's discretion. If you don't feel like asking him, you'll just have to trust me."  
律子回想起上次她向美里透露了比碇认为严格必要的更多关于监控系统的信息后召开的'会议'，几乎忍不住打了个寒颤。“那些信息只有在指挥官的授权下才能获取。如果你不想问他，那就只能相信我了。”

"Right." Misato paused. "Everything OK, Ritz?"  
“好吧。”美里停顿了一下。“一切都好吗，律子？”

"As good as can be expected given the threats we face."  
“考虑到我们面临的威胁，情况还算可以接受。”

If she said it enough, maybe she'd believe it herself.  
如果她重复得足够多，也许她自己也会相信。

### Chapter Text 正文

Rei felt an unfamiliar, and distinctly unpleasant, emotion as she settled into a chair at Captain Katsuragi's dining table. It seemed to rise from an awareness that Shinji and Asuka's living arrangements – however much Asuka, in particular, might display discontent with them – were clearly 'better' than her own in several ways.  
丽坐在葛城美里队长的餐桌前，感受到一种陌生且明显不愉快的情绪。这种感觉似乎源于她意识到真嗣和明日香的居住安排——尽管明日香尤其可能表现出对它们的不满——在多个方面显然比她自己的要好。

The fabric of the apartment was sound, with no visible damage to the walls. The windows were double glazed and free of cracks. The refrigerator was quiet. The right rear element on the hob did not trip the circuit breaker after a minute's use. The water from the kitchen tap ran clear immediately. Visiting such a residence, a pleasant enough experience in itself, was leading her to make comparisons, and she did not like the results.  
公寓的结构完好无损，墙壁未见明显损伤。窗户是双层玻璃的，没有裂痕。冰箱运转静谧。炉灶上的右后炉头使用一分钟后并未触发断路器。厨房水龙头流出的水立刻变得清澈。参观这样的住所，本身已是一种愉快的体验，却让她不由自主地进行比较，而她并不喜欢这样的结果。

"So, Rei. What did you want to talk to us about?" asked Asuka.  
“那么，丽。你想和我们谈些什么？”明日香问道。

Rei looked at Asuka, then at Shinji. "When we were talking about my haircut and how it might be interpreted, you made a remark about how my choice of words might make people think I'm not human."  
丽看着明日香，然后转向真嗣。“当我们谈论我的发型以及它可能被如何解读时，你提到了我的措辞选择可能会让人认为我不是人类。”

"I remember that," affirmed Asuka. "I wasn't being serious, really."  
"我记得那件事，" 明日香肯定地说，"我当时并不是认真的，真的。"

Rei weighed her words carefully. If she disclosed the wrong facts, it was likely that a great deal of disruption would ensue. On the other hand, she needed to disclose enough to secure the trust of her comrades in arms. "The fact that I am... not human in the strictest sense of the word is not for public consumption. I should not do things that encourage speculation in that direction."  
绫波丽仔细斟酌着言辞。如果她说错了事实，很可能会引起很大的混乱。另一方面，她需要透露足够的信息来确保战友们的信任。"严格来说，我不是人类这一事实不宜公开。我不应该做任何鼓励这方面猜测的事情。"

"The Commander enrolled you in school without making you wear cosmetic lenses, right?" asked Asuka.  
"指挥官让你上学时没有让你戴隐形眼镜，对吧？" 明日香问道。"

"Yes." "是的。"

"And you change for PE in front of the other girls?"  
"你会在其他女生面前换体育课的衣服吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"You're a red-eyed natural bluenette with no bellybutton. Someone's going to have noticed." Asuka gave Shinji a sidelong glance. "Certainly this per— I mean, Shinji has."  
"你是个红眼自然蓝发的无肚脐人。总会有人注意到的。" 明日香给了真嗣一个斜眼。"当然这个变态——我是说，真嗣已经注意到了。"

Shinji looked confused for a moment, then blushed furiously . "I didn't— I mean, I was trying not to look! I didn't mean to..."  
真嗣一时显得困惑，随即满脸通红。"我没——我是说，我尽量不去看！我不是故意的……"

Rei pondered the implications. It was hard to reconcile the Commander's far-ranging insistence on secrecy with such an oversight. "Thank you for pointing this out to me." She tapped her fingers on the table. Properly, she should tell the Commander about Asuka's observation, but the likely outcomes were undesirable. If he felt the leak was a problem, he would withdraw her from school, and then her only contact with the other pilots would be at official NERV activities, drastically reducing her opportunity to observe their souls. If he did not, then raising it with him would be a waste of his time and hers.  
丽思索着其中的含义。指挥官对保密性的极端坚持与这样的疏忽难以调和。“谢谢你指出这一点。”她用手指轻敲着桌面。按理说，她应该将明日香的这个发现告诉指挥官，但可能的结果都不尽如人意。如果他认为泄露是个问题，就会将她从学校撤回，那样她与其他驾驶员的唯一接触就仅限于 NERV 的官方活动，大大减少了观察他们灵魂的机会。如果不这样做，那么向他提起这件事只会浪费他的时间和她的。

"So," said Asuka, "I guess I have to ask, if you're not human, what are you? Some kind of alien or something?"  
“那么，”明日香说，“我想我得问一下，如果你不是人类，那你是什么？某种外星生物之类的吗？”

"I was created as part of the Evangelion project." Careful words. Factual words. Words that did not betray secrets it would be dangerous to reveal. "My creators hoped to avoid the need for a human pilot. They did not succeed. They could create as many bodies as they wished, but they could not give them all souls. There are many of this body, but only one can act at a time."  
“我是作为 EVA 项目的一部分被创造出来的。”谨慎的言辞。事实性的言辞。没有泄露任何危险秘密的言辞。“我的创造者希望避免需要人类驾驶员。他们没有成功。他们可以随心所欲地创造身体，但他们无法赋予它们灵魂。有许多这样的身体，但一次只能有一个行动。”

"Where did your soul come from, then?" asked Shinji.  
“那么，你的灵魂是从哪儿来的呢？”真嗣问道。

Rei froze, not even blinking, as she realized she had misstepped.  
意识到自己失言，绫波愣住了，连眼睛都不眨一下。

Asuka's hand waved in front of her face. "Earth to Rei, Earth to Rei. Come in Rei Ayanami."  
明日香的手在绫波面前挥了挥。“绫波，绫波，听到请回答。”

Rei closed her eyes and shook her head. She needed to provide enough of a fact. "An experimental process." Everything was an experiment. "It turned out to not be repeatable, despite their best efforts." There. That should suffice.  
丽闭上眼睛，摇了摇头。她需要提供足够的事实。“一个实验性过程。”一切都是实验。“结果证明无法重复，尽管他们尽了最大努力。”好了，这应该足够了。

Shinji frowned a little, then shrugged. "I... well, I have no idea how difficult it was. I guess that makes sense."  
真嗣微微皱眉，然后耸了耸肩。“我……嗯，我不知道那有多难。我想这说得通。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.  
明日香挑了挑眉，但什么也没说。

Silence hung over the table, only to be pierced by the sound of the front door and Captain Katsuragi's call of "I'm home!"  
沉默笼罩着餐桌，直到被前门的声响和葛城美里上尉的喊声打破：“我回来了！”

"Welcome home!" called Shinji.  
“欢迎回家！”真嗣喊道。

"Huh. When did that workaholic last get home before dinner?" asked Asuka.  
“咦。那个工作狂上次什么时候回家比晚饭还早？”明日香问道。

---

"Ayanami dined with Katsuragi and the other pilots today," observed Fuyutsuki. "She was late home."  
"绫波今天和葛城以及其他驾驶员一起用餐了，" 副司令冬月观察道，"她回家晚了。"

Gendou nodded, his hand hovering over the shougi board. "Did Section Two note any other discrepancies?"  
碇点点头，手悬停在将棋盘上。"二课有没有注意到其他异常？"

"She remarked on one of the agents' smell."  
"她提到了一名特工身上的气味。"

The pieces clicked against the board as Gendou made his move. "Nothing to be concerned about, then. We already know she is more alert to her surroundings now."  
棋子在棋盘上咔嗒作响，源渡走了一步。“那么，没什么好担心的。我们已经知道她现在对周围环境更加警觉了。”

"The agent smelled of marijuana, though of course she didn't recognize it." Fuyutsuki looked at the board, and dropped a knight. "Unprofessional."  
“那位特工身上有股大麻味，尽管她当然没有意识到。”冬月看着棋盘，放下一枚马。“不专业。”

Gendou sighed as he saw the checkmate. It was a rarer sight than it used to be. "I lose, sensei."  
源渡叹了口气，看到被将死的一刻。这比以前少见了。“我输了，老师。”

### Chapter Text 正文

Chewing chilli flakes as she dressed for school that Saturday morning, Rei came to an inconvenient realization: her body was starting to get used to her attempts at self-distraction by capsaicin exposure, and she was going to need a new strategy. Picking up her school bag, she focused on what the day held in store.  
那个周六早晨，Rei 一边为上学打扮一边嚼着辣椒片，突然意识到一个不便的事实：她的身体开始适应通过辣椒素暴露来分散注意力的尝试，她需要一个新的策略。拿起书包，她专注于当天即将发生的事情。

School itself would be just another spell of pointless tedium, offering her knowledge that she would never need. Only the fact that Shinji and Asuka, and their fascinating souls, would be there offered any prospect of mental stimulus.  
学校本身将只是一段无意义的枯燥时光，提供她永远不会需要的知识。只有 Shinji 和 Asuka，以及他们迷人的灵魂在场，才有可能提供精神上的刺激。

The evening would be a pleasant void, floating in a tank of LCL in Terminal Dogma while her latest memories were recorded by the MAGI. It held no interest, but at least she would be free of all the aggravating stimuli of daily life for the duration.  
晚上将是一个愉快的空白，在 Terminal Dogma 的 LCL 池中漂浮，同时 MAGI 记录她最新的记忆。这毫无兴趣，但至少在那时她可以摆脱日常生活中所有令人恼火的刺激。

The afternoon held dread and excitement in equal measure. On the one hand, Saturday afternoon in Tokyo-3's shopping district would be full of noise and confusion. On the other, she would be able to watch the interaction between Shinji and Asuka, and they would be introducing her to the world of music.  
那个下午充满了恐惧与兴奋，两者平分秋色。一方面，东京-3 购物区的周六下午必定是喧嚣混乱的。另一方面，她将能观察到真嗣和明日香之间的互动，而且他们还会带她进入音乐的世界。

She wondered if they would touch each other. Their souls were at their most interesting when that happened, as the transferred fragments lit up from the connection to their origin.  
她好奇他们是否会彼此触碰。每当那时，他们的灵魂最为引人入胜，因为转移的碎片会因与源头的连接而闪耀。

On her way out, she frowned at her front door with its broken lock that had allowed Shinji's intrusion into her apartment. It left a new doubt lingering in her mind as she headed downstairs. The Commander undoubtedly prized her safety – his response to the activation accident told her that – yet nobody had thought to repair the lock on her living quarters. It was another troubling oversight to add to the one Asuka had brought to her attention.  
出门时，她对着那扇破损的门锁皱眉，正是这扇门让真嗣闯入了她的公寓。这让她心中又添了一丝疑虑，下楼时仍挥之不去。司令无疑重视她的安全——激活事故时他的反应告诉了她这一点——然而却无人想到要修理她住处的门锁。这是另一个令人不安的疏忽，与明日香之前指出的问题如出一辙。

---

Shinji frowned at the sign above the shop Asuka was pointing to. The bizarrely angular style of the red-on-black writing, embedded in a tangle of meaningless lines, made it nearly impossible to read, but he thought it might say "KHAOS NOIZ" in romaji. The rest of the storefront wasn't any more reassuring. The front door was painted black, and the window displays (with black backdrops) either side of it featured mannequins in outlandish outfits, posed with battered-looking electric guitars. "Asuka, is that really the right place?"  
真嗣对着明日香所指的店铺招牌皱起了眉头。那红黑相间的文字以怪异的棱角风格呈现，嵌在一团无意义的线条中，几乎难以辨认，但他觉得那可能是用罗马字写的“KHAOS NOIZ”。店铺的外观同样令人不安。前门漆成黑色，两侧的橱窗展示（以黑色为背景）中，人偶穿着奇异的服装，摆出姿势，手持破旧的电吉他。“明日香，那里真的是正确的地方吗？”

She glared at him. "Look at it!" she snapped. She'd been short-tempered all day. Misato had even said something about "back to your old self, eh?" at breakfast.  
她瞪了他一眼。“看看它！”她厉声说道。她一整天都脾气暴躁。美里甚至在早餐时说了句“又变回原来的你了，嗯？”

"Okay, okay, I guess we should go in."  
“好吧，好吧，我想我们应该进去。”

"Damn right. Let's get some decent music!" Asuka forged ahead, Rei following close behind. Shinji brought up the rear, not quite knowing what to expect.  
“没错，来点像样的音乐吧！”明日香一马当先，绫波紧随其后。真嗣殿后，不太确定接下来会发生什么。

The interior upheld the black-and-red scheme of the shopfront, and Shinji felt profoundly out of place as he saw the handful of other customers, mostly older than himself and dressed in black with outlandishly styled hair. A new song had just started playing from the ceiling speakers, a woman chanting wordlessly over some sort of background noise.  
店内延续了店面黑红相间的风格，真嗣看到其他几位顾客，大多比自己年长，身着黑色服装，发型奇特，深感自己格格不入。天花板扬声器中刚换了一首新曲，一位女声无词地吟唱，伴随着某种背景噪音。

The English lyrics, when they began, seemed confusing and disjointed, but the texture of the sounds alone was enough to send an uncanny chill down his spine. He looked over at Rei, and saw her staring intently at the speakers, tapping her fingers lightly against her thigh in time to whatever structure might be found.  
当英文歌词开始时，它们显得混乱无序，但仅凭声音的质感就足以让他脊背发凉。他瞥向绫波，见她正凝视着扬声器，手指轻轻敲打大腿，似乎在跟随某种潜在的节奏。

"Hey Shinji, stop lollygagging and get over here," called Asuka. As Shinji headed towards her, she added, "You too, Rei."  
"嘿，真嗣，别磨蹭了，快过来，" 明日香喊道。真嗣朝她走去时，她又补充道，"丽也是。"

Rei's hand came to a rest as she blinked and shook her head. "Do you know this song?" she asked as she joined Shinji and Asuka.  
丽的双手停了下来，眨了眨眼，摇了摇头。"你知道这首歌吗？"她问道，随即加入了真嗣和明日香的行列。

Asuka pulled a face and clapped a hand to her belly. "Ugh, no. And I could do without those fucking lyrics right now."  
明日香做了个鬼脸，一手捂住肚子。"呃，不知道。我现在可不想听到那些该死的歌词。"

"Oh. Why? They are intriguing," said Rei, starting to tap her leg again.  
“哦，为什么？它们很有趣，”丽说道，又开始轻敲她的腿。

Asuka glared at Rei. "You... you really don't know, do you?" she said, before muttering in a low voice, "Lucky bitch."  
明日香瞪着丽。“你……你真的不知道，对吧？”她说，然后低声嘀咕，“幸运的婊子。”

Rei seemed not to notice the insult, but Shinji did. "What was that for?" he asked.  
丽似乎没有注意到这句侮辱，但真嗣注意到了。“那是什么意思？”他问道。

Asuka gave him the same glare, then stepped away to put Rei between them. "Ask me later and I'll help you understand. I don't want to get thrown out for causing a scene."  
明日香给了他同样的眼神，然后退开一步，让绫波挡在他们中间。“晚点问我，我会帮你理解。我不想因为引起骚动而被赶出去。”

Shinji looked back at her and nodded. "Fine."  
真嗣回头看着她，点了点头。“好吧。”

---

Rei had very little to pay attention to, floating in the tank. The petty discomforts of daily life were far away, the flotation medium obscured her vision, and the layers of armoured glass shut out all sound beyond the gentle whirr of the recirculator pumps.  
绫波在罐子里漂浮，几乎没有什么需要关注的事情。日常生活中的琐碎不适都远离了她，漂浮介质模糊了她的视线，而层层装甲玻璃隔绝了所有声音，只留下循环泵轻微的嗡嗡声。

Very little, though, was not nothing. She could sense Dr Akagi's soul. She could sense Commander Ikari's soul arriving.  
虽然很少，但并非无足轻重。她能感受到赤城博士的灵魂。她能感受到碇司令的灵魂正在到来。

She could sense the dim scrap of some other soul that was attached to his.  
她能感受到依附于他的某个模糊的灵魂碎片。

That was new, and troubling. She had faith that it was part of the Scenario, but it seemed a strange choice to have made.  
这是新的，也是令人不安的。她相信这是剧本的一部分，但似乎是一个奇怪的选择。

---

"So, you said you were going to 'help me understand'?" asked Shinji as he put away the last of the washing up.  
"所以，你说你要'帮我理解'？" 真嗣边说边收拾完最后一点餐具。

Asuka looked up from the sofa. "Yes. How much of the lyrics _did_ you understand?"  
明日香从沙发上抬起头来。"是的。你理解了多少歌词？"

"Not much? Something about jagged glass and stars and angels? English isn't my best subject."  
"不多？好像是关于碎玻璃、星星和天使的？英语不是我的强项。"

"Right." She got up and walked back towards him. "Give me your hand, and don't pull away."  
“好的。”她站起身，朝他走回去。“把手给我，别缩回去。”

He extended his hand nervously. Her choice of words was worrying, but he wanted to not be confused.  
他紧张地伸出手。她选择的措辞令人担忧，但他希望自己不再困惑。

She grabbed his wrist, rather harder than he'd have liked, but his attempt to complain turned into a yelp of pain as he started to feel what she was feeling. The tenderness across his... no, her chest. The raw, tense, knotted pain in her abdomen. He tried to pull away, but with her grip so tight on his wrist he only succeeded in pulling her closer, nearly overbalancing them both before she let go and stepped back.  
她抓住他的手腕，力度比他希望的要大，但当他开始感受到她的感受时，他的抱怨变成了痛苦的叫声。她胸前的温柔。她腹部那种原始、紧张、纠结的疼痛。他试图挣脱，但她的手紧紧抓着他的手腕，他只能把她拉得更近，差点让他们俩都失去平衡，直到她松开手，后退一步。

A faint ghost of her pain lingered for a few moments as he caught his breath. "That hurt," he muttered.  
他喘息间，她痛苦的淡淡痕迹萦绕了几秒。“那很疼，”他低声抱怨。

"That's what that song was about. Mostly. I think. Maybe about wanting to end the world because of it, too."  
“那首歌大概就是关于这个的。我想。也许还关于因为这想要终结世界。”

"Shouldn't you see a doctor or something?"  
“你不该去看医生什么的吗？”

Asuka snorted and rolled her eyes. "Already did. 'Just part of becoming a woman,' she said. 'Just take some painkillers and carry on, it's only a few days a month.' Stupid stoic bullshit. She doesn't have to pilot Eva like this."  
"明日香哼了一声，翻了个白眼。“早就做了。她说‘这只是成为女人的一部分’。‘吃点止痛药，继续前进，每个月也就那么几天。’愚蠢的硬汉废话。她可不用在这种情况下驾驶 EVA。”

---

The taste that lingered in Ritsuko's mouth, despite gargling and brushing her teeth, was much less unpleasant than after her last 'conference' with Gendou. It still made her wonder what he'd been eating, but it was just a matter of scientific curiosity, rather than a desire to not taste him after he'd eaten it.  
尽管漱口刷牙，留在律子嘴里的味道，比起上次与源渡‘开会’后要轻微得多。她仍然好奇他吃了什么，但这只是出于科学好奇心，而不是不想在他吃过之后尝到那味道。

She walked into her office and saw Lieutenant Ibuki staring intently at whatever report she was working on. There was something endearing about the younger woman's enthusiasm. Aoba and Hyuuga would never stay up this late working on a Saturday, short of a direct order.  
她走进办公室，看到伊吹副官正专注地盯着她正在处理的报告。这位年轻女性的热情有些令人喜爱。青叶和日向绝不会在没有直接命令的情况下，在周六熬夜工作。

"Ibuki?" she called. “伊吹？”她喊道。

Ibuki jolted in her seat and turned towards Ritsuko. "Sempai?" Ibuki frowned. "Are you all right, sempai? Did some— Did something happen?"  
伊吹在座位上猛地一惊，转向了律子。“前辈？”伊吹皱眉。“你还好吗，前辈？是不是发生了什么事？”

Ritsuko blinked, taking a moment to process Ibuki's concern. _Oh. Right. I didn't brush my hair, my lipstick is a mess, and I'm not smiling about it. Rumour control time._ "Nothing I said 'no' to, Lieutenant. No need to worry. Go home and get some sleep. Those numbers will keep until morning, whatever they are."  
律子眨了眨眼，花了一点时间来理解伊吹的担忧。哦，对了。我没梳头发，口红也乱了，而且我对此并不感到高兴。该控制一下谣言了。“我拒绝了，中尉。不用担心。回家好好睡一觉吧。那些数据等到早上再看也不迟，不管它们是什么。”

"R-right!" Ibuki locked the terminal and stood up. "Thank you, sempai. If you need it, I know a... service. They helped a friend of mine."  
"好-好的！" 伊吹锁好终端站起身来。"谢谢你，前辈。如果你需要，我知道一个...服务。他们帮过我一个朋友。"

"I told you, it was nothing I said 'no' to. But thank you for your concern. Sleep well, Ibuki."  
"我告诉过你，那没什么，我拒绝了。但谢谢你的关心。晚安，伊吹。"

### Chapter Text 正文

This was stupid, Misato told herself.  
美里对自己说，这真是愚蠢。

She was eating yakiniku with the man she'd fucked six ways to Sunday at university.  
她在和大学时把她搞得七荤八素的男人一起吃烤肉。

She was drinking fancy beers with the man she'd broken up with by answering machine.  
她在和那个通过答录机分手的男人喝着高档啤酒。

She was gazing into the eyes of the man who was supposed to be investigating anyone and everyone at Tokyo-3, herself included.  
她凝视着那个本应在第三新东京市调查所有人，包括她自己的男人的眼睛。

The only way it could get any stupider was if she actually made a pass at him instead of just pressing her foot against his leg under the table.  
唯一能让这变得更蠢的办法就是，她真的向他示好，而不是仅仅在桌子底下用脚蹭他的腿。

He didn't even look like he'd noticed that part.  
他甚至看起来都没注意到那部分。

She grabbed her beer glass and necked the last third of it. It was good. Too good. She drank a premium brand at home, but this was better.  
她抓起啤酒杯，一口气喝掉了最后三分之一。这酒不错，太好了。她在家喝的是高档品牌，但这酒更胜一筹。

Stronger, too. Belgian import.  
也更强劲。比利时进口的。

"Are you going to eat that?"  
“你打算吃那个吗？”

She looked down at her last piece of yakiniku. She picked it up in her chopsticks, and fought down the stupid impulse that resulted. "Yes," she said, and popped it in her mouth.  
她低头看着最后一片烤肉。她用筷子夹起它，努力压制住那股愚蠢的冲动。“是的，”她说着，将肉片送入口中。

"I'll settle up." He tilted his head. "And I'll get you a cab."  
“我来结账。”他微微侧头，“再帮你叫辆出租车。”

Bastard. "Just me?" she pressed.  
“混蛋。”她追问，“就我一个人？”

He leaned across the table. "I have a lead to follow up in the morning," he said in an almost-whisper before standing up. "I can come as far as your front door."  
他俯身靠近桌子，几乎耳语般地说：“我明天有个线索要跟进，”随后站起身，“我可以送你到门口。”

She steadied herself against the table as she stood up. "Next time, then?"  
她扶着桌子站稳。“那么，下次见？”

He grinned. 他咧嘴一笑。

---

With the rice cooker loaded for breakfast, Shinji looked back over his shoulder at the sound of door rollers. Misato emerged into the living room a few moments later, looking less hungover than he'd come to expect on Sunday mornings.  
电饭煲里装满了早餐用的米饭，真嗣听到门轮的声响回头望去。几分钟后，美里走进客厅，看起来比他预期的周日早晨要清醒得多。

No happier, though. 虽然并不更快乐。

"Good morning, Misato!" he called. "How was your date?"  
“早上好，美里小姐！”他喊道，“约会怎么样？”

She made a beeline, not for the beer fridge as he expected, but for the cupboard with the glasses in it. "Kaji slept in his bed and I slept in mine," she replied, filling a glass from the tap. She chugged the contents almost as fast as a can of beer, a trickle of water escaping the corner of her mouth. "How was your evening? You two behave yourselves?"  
她径直走向了放玻璃杯的橱柜，而不是像他预料的那样去冰箱拿啤酒。“加持睡在他的床上，我睡在我的床上，”她回答道，从水龙头接满一杯水。她几乎一口气喝完了整杯水，速度快得像喝一罐啤酒，水滴从嘴角滑落。“你昨晚过得怎么样？你们俩没惹事吧？”

"The furniture is in one piece and there are no new burn marks," replied Shinji. He considered asking why she was opening the day with water, but thought better of it. Anything that involved her drinking less beer couldn't be all bad. "Excuse me, Misato, I need to get at the eggs."  
"家具完好无损，也没有新的烧焦痕迹，" 真嗣回答道。他本想问她为什么一大早就开始喝水，但转念一想，她少喝点啤酒总归不是坏事。"不好意思，美里小姐，我要拿鸡蛋。"

Misato stepped out of his way. "Omelettes for breakfast? Or are you going to try your hand at okonomiyaki?"  
美里让开了路。"早餐要做煎蛋卷吗？还是你想尝试做章鱼烧？"

"I'm not from Osaka." “我不是大阪人。”

Asuka emerged from the bathroom in casual clothes, one hand resting on her middle. "Hey Shinji, do we have any painkillers?"  
明日香从浴室出来，穿着休闲装，一只手放在肚子上。“嘿，真嗣，我们有止痛药吗？”

Shinji smiled sympathetically. After last night, he knew exactly how she felt. "There's some ibuprofen in the cabinet. Top shelf."  
真嗣同情地笑了笑。经过昨晚，他完全明白她的感受。“柜子里有些布洛芬。最上层。”

"There's three sets of pills up there." She looked like she'd wanted to slip an extra word in there. "You know I can't read the squiggles half the time."  
“那里有三组药片。”她看起来像是要多说一个词。“你知道我一半时间都看不懂那些小字。”

"Red and white packet," said Misato. "What's up, Asuka?"  
"红白封包，" 美里说道。"怎么了，明日香？"

"What do _you_ think?" Asuka snapped back as she vanished back into the bathroom.  
"你觉得呢？" 明日香厉声回了一句，随即消失在浴室里。

Misato set down her empty glass. "What's that about?" she asked Shinji.  
美里放下空杯子。"那是怎么回事？" 她问真嗣。

He thought back to last night, raised an eyebrow, and echoed Asuka's response. "What do you think?"  
他回想起昨晚，挑了挑眉，模仿着明日香的话：“你觉得呢？”

Misato looked at him oddly, then shook her head. "Right, right, I get it. Tell her there's a hot water bottle in the closet in her room. And if you want to really make her day, go buy her some good chocolate."  
美里奇怪地看了他一眼，然后摇了摇头。“好吧，好吧，我明白了。告诉她她房间的衣柜里有个热水袋。如果你想让她真正开心，就去给她买些好巧克力。”

（注释见章节末尾。）

### Chapter Text 正文

Walking through a real military base, full of clean-shaven men in fatigues with short hair glaring at him, was not Kaji's idea of a good Sunday morning. On the other hand, there was no way he was going to get to the bottom of the bullshit on that one guy's personnel record without talking to someone.  
走过一个真正的军事基地，到处都是剃着平头、穿着迷彩服、目光锐利的男人盯着他，这可不是加持心目中的美好周日早晨。但另一方面，如果不和某个人谈谈，他是不可能揭开那家伙人事档案里的胡言乱语的。

Walking into the base offices, he showed his UN ID to the sergeant on the front desk. "Ryōji Kaji, United Nations Special Inspectorate," he announced. "I'm here to see Colonel Hasegawa."  
走进基地办公室，他将联合国身份证出示给前台的警官。“我是联合国特别监察员加治木亮司，”他宣布道，“我来见长谷川上校。”

The sergeant looked Kaji over, frowned at his ID card, and nodded. "He's waiting for you."  
警官打量了加治木一番，皱着眉头看了看他的身份证，然后点了点头。“他在等你。”

After the third pat-down of the morning and some shenanigans with the security gate, Kaji was ushered into the colonel's office.  
"经过早上的第三次搜身和安检门的折腾，加治木被带进了上校的办公室。”

"Good morning, Inspector," said Hasegawa. "I understand you want to talk about one of my men."  
"早上好，检查官，"长谷川说道，"我明白您想谈谈我的一个手下。"

"Yes, Colonel," replied Kaji, passing his folder across the desk. "We obtained his personnel records, but they appear to be... less than entirely accurate. I'm sure you had nothing to do with the inaccuracies, but you might have some insight into the man."  
"是的，上校，" replied 凯吉，将他的文件夹递过桌子。"我们获取了他的人事档案，但看起来...不太完全准确。我相信这些错误与您无关，但您或许能提供一些关于此人的见解。"

Hasegawa flipped open the folder and started leafing through it, his expression shifting slowly from 'unimpressed', through 'incredulous', to 'downright thunderous'. "Well! NERV's ridiculous computers dug this claptrap up, I presume?"  
长谷川翻开文件夹，开始翻阅，他的表情逐渐从'不以为然'，经过'难以置信'，变为'怒不可遏'。"好吧！我想这是 NERV 那些荒谬的电脑挖出来的废话吧？"

"Yes, Colonel." "是的，上校。"

"Thank you for bringing it to my attention, and I do remember this man. Signing a sole survivor's psychiatric discharge always sticks in the mind, Inspector. What's your interest in him?"  
"谢谢您提醒我，我确实记得这个人。签署唯一幸存者的心理退伍令总是让人印象深刻，警探。您对他有什么兴趣？"

"His name came up in connection with the sniper incident. The Tokyo-3 garrison regiment used a missile to get rid of the sniper, so there's not much to go on."  
"他的名字与狙击手事件有关。东京-3 驻军用导弹消灭了狙击手，所以线索不多。"

"Nakajima was always fond of that approach. Cost him fewer men than trying to countersnipe, he said." Hasegawa looked down at the folder. "Sadly, after his discharge, I couldn't tell you anything about this man. Probably wound up sleeping rough."  
"中岛总是喜欢那种方法。他说，这比试图反狙击要少损失些人手。"长谷川低头看着文件夹。"遗憾的是，他退役后，我无法告诉你关于这个人的任何信息。可能最终流落街头了。"

Kaji took pains to not let his disappointment show. "That's useful in itself. Thank you for your time, Colonel."  
加治努力不让失望显露出来。"这本身就很有用。感谢您抽出时间，上校。"

"You're welcome." Hasegawa handed the folder back to him. "Here. Take your spy thriller away with you."  
"不客气。"长谷川把文件夹递还给他。"拿好。把你的间谍惊悚故事带走吧。"

"Of course." Kaji collected the folder and offered Hasegawa a card with a secure phone number on it. "If something happens to catch your attention, this number might be useful."  
“当然。” 加持收起文件夹，递给长谷川一张印有安全电话号码的名片。“如果有事引起你的注意，这个号码可能会派上用场。”

Standing down in Terminal Dogma, Ritsuko looked over the results on the MAGI terminal. The backup, large though it was, was complete. Ayanami's vital signs were stable. Her last sync score was entirely satisfactory. There was no reason to intervene and adjust her biochemistry. The Commander would not approve of her doing so.  
站在终端教条区，律子审视着 MAGI 终端上的结果。虽然备份庞大，但已经完成。绫波的生理指标稳定，她上一次同步率得分完全令人满意。没有理由介入调整她的生化指标。指挥官不会批准她这么做。

It still took an act of will for her to not drug the hybrid girl to the gills. She keyed in the release sequence for the tank and watched as the flotation medium drained away and the armoured glass retracted into the floor.  
尽管如此，她仍需克制自己不去给这个混血女孩过量用药。她输入释放序列，看着浮选介质排空，装甲玻璃缩回地板。

Ayanami looked her way briefly before heading towards the changing room. It wasn't the strangely impassive look that should have been there. It was focused, alert, even _insightful_. Maybe that was a sign that she _should_ do something. But... no. The moment was gone. The hyposprays were too drastic and there was no reason for her to put Ayanami back in the tank. She turned her attention back to reviewing the data.  
绫波短暂地看了她一眼，然后朝更衣室走去。那并不是应该出现的奇怪冷漠表情。而是专注、警觉，甚至带有洞察力的。或许那是一个她应该采取行动的信号。但是...不。时机已逝。注射器太过激烈，而且没有理由让绫波再次回到培养槽中。她转而继续审查数据。

She was still immersed in cardiograms and biomarker listings when the sound of shoes on metal announced Ayanami's return from the changing room. "Dr Akagi, I am ready to return home."  
当鞋跟敲击金属的声音宣告绫波从更衣室归来时，她仍沉浸在心电图和生物标志物列表中。“赤木博士，我准备好回家了。”

"Fine. Let me show you out." Ritsuko stood up and walked Ayanami to the elevator.  
“好的。我送你出去。”赤木律子站起身，陪绫波走向电梯。

---

Rei walked into her apartment and locked the door behind her. She walked over to the dresser and pressed 'play' on the CD player lying there, starting up one of the discs Shinji had suggested for her.  
丽走进她的公寓，随手锁上了门。她走到梳妆台前，按下了放在那里的 CD 播放器的播放键，开始播放真嗣推荐给她的一张唱片。

The music playing over the speakers was soft at first, slowly building into layers of dissonance and irregular rhythm. It was not _pleasant_, but there was something compelling about it, something that demanded _movement_ despite the difficulty of the rhythm.  
扬声器中传出的音乐起初很柔和，渐渐地叠加上不和谐的音层和无规律的节奏。这并不悦耳，但其中有种引人入胜的东西，即便节奏难以捉摸，却依然催人起舞。

In the quieter, less compelling moments, she found time to slip the booklet out of the CD case and read it in bits and pieces. She read of a near riot at the first performance and ferocious arguments about the work's merit; she read also of the narrative depicted in the ballet, revolving around the rituals of an ancient people, and the choosing of a girl to dance herself to death before her elders.  
在那些较为平静、不那么吸引人的时刻，她抽空从 CD 盒里拿出小册子，断断续续地阅读。她读到了首演时几乎引发骚乱的情景，以及关于这部作品价值的激烈争论；她也读到了芭蕾舞剧中描绘的故事，围绕着古代民族的仪式展开，讲述了一个女孩在长老面前舞至生命尽头的选择。

She paused the disc then, and set aside her clothes. Her hope that loudness might serve the same purpose as the chemical heat of capsaicin had proven unfounded, and the fact of _cloth_ was even more annoying when perspiration became a factor.  
她随即暂停了光盘，将衣物搁置一旁。她原本寄希望于音量能像辣椒素的化学热一样发挥作用，但这一希望落空了，当汗水成为因素时，布料的存在更是令人烦恼。

There had to be a solution. Perhaps the technology of plugsuits could be adapted to civilian clothing. Dr Akagi would not care, but perhaps she could ask the Commander to arrange something.  
总该有个解决办法。或许可以将插件服的技术应用于民用服装。赤木博士不会在意，但也许她可以请指挥官安排一下。

---

Monday came, and once more Asuka found herself zoning out as Nebukawa-sensei droned on about some petty detail of the pre-Impact world. Unable to concentrate on the teacher and the squiggles filling the blackboard, she turned her gaze towards Shinji.  
周一到来，阿斯卡再次发现自己走神了，当黑川老师喋喋不休地讲述着冲击前世界的琐碎细节时。无法集中注意力在老师和黑板上密密麻麻的符号上，她将目光转向了真嗣。

It was annoying, really. She shouldn't be thinking about him this much. She wouldn't be thinking about him this much if she hadn't had to pilot with him inside her Entry Plug. She couldn't get those bits of his memory out of her brain.  
真的很烦人。她不该这么频繁地想着他。如果不是因为不得不和他一起坐在插入栓里，她也不会这么频繁地想着他。她无法将他记忆的碎片从脑海中抹去。

Sharing an apartment with him just made it worse. He could cook the best out of the three of them. He could keep the place tidy even with a drunken slob like Misato living in it. He did everyone's laundry and yet she still hadn't had a single pair of knickers go missing. When she inflicted her uterus on him on Saturday night, he'd sucked it up... and gone out after breakfast on Sunday to buy her chocolate and more painkillers.  
和他合租公寓更是雪上加霜。他的厨艺是三人中最好的。即使像美里这样酗酒邋遢的人住在里面，他也能保持地方整洁。他负责所有人的洗衣，而她的内衣裤却从未丢失过一件。周六晚上她把痛经的痛苦强加给他时，他默默承受了...还在周日早餐后出去给她买了巧克力和更多的止痛药。

He liked good music. He'd taken to Rammstein quite quickly, and that Russian classical CD he'd put on was better than she expected. Very thunderous, very passionate.  
他喜欢好音乐。他很快就喜欢上了 Rammstein，而他放的那张俄罗斯古典 CD 比她预期的还要好。非常震撼，非常激情。

He looked good in a plugsuit. He'd look good in normal clothes if he had any sense of style at all. Maybe she'd have to try doing something about that.  
他穿插件服很好看。如果他有任何一点时尚感的话，穿普通衣服也会很帅。也许她得想办法在这方面做点什么。

"Miss Sōryū." “草薙小姐。”

No. No, she was not going to help Shinji look better. Why would she do that? He wasn't her boyfriend. They hadn't even been on a date. She'd paid for her own drink at the café. He was just her housemate.  
不，不，她不会帮真嗣打扮得更帅。她为什么要这么做？他又不是她的男朋友。他们甚至都没约会过。她在咖啡馆里自己付了饮料钱。他只是她的室友。

"Miss Sōryū," repeated the old fossil at the front of the class, finally breaking her train of thought.  
“Sōryū小姐，”讲台前的老古董重复道，终于打断了她的思绪。

"Yes?" she asked.  “是？”她问道。

"I understand you were raised in Germany. I'm sure your school curriculum covered how Second Impact changed people's lives. Perhaps you could share a few examples with us."  
“我明白你在德国长大。我确信你的学校课程涵盖了第二次冲击如何改变人们的生活。或许你可以与我们分享几个例子。”

"Our modern history classes focused on the 1930s and 1940s," she replied, not bothering to stand up. "In Germany we think it's important to remember our country's sins as well as its glories."  
"我们的现代历史课程主要集中在 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代，"她回答道，没有费心站起来。"在德国，我们认为记住我们国家的罪行和荣耀同样重要。"

There was a silence in Classroom 2-A around the space of half a minute, and some of the looks sent her way felt less than friendly.  
在 2-A 教室里，有半分钟的沉默，其中一些投向她的目光显得不那么友好。

"I see," said the teacher, when no more words were forthcoming. "Very well, Miss Sōryū. Now, as I was saying regarding the railway system following Second Impact..."  
"我明白了，"老师说道，当再没有更多话语时。"很好，惣流小姐。现在，正如我之前所说的关于第二次冲击后的铁路系统……"

"The SDF have one of their destroyers shadowing something big and slow approaching the Kii Peninsula. They can't get a decent visual, but they're confident it's not a whale."  
“SDF 的一艘驱逐舰正在跟踪一个庞大而缓慢接近纪伊半岛的目标。他们无法获得清晰的图像，但确信那不是鲸鱼。”

"Thank you, Aoba." Misato looked up at the map on screen. It had to be an Angel, really, even if it hadn't set off the alarms yet. "Have we got any readings from it?"  
“谢谢你，青叶。”美里抬头看着屏幕上的地图。这肯定是一个使徒，尽管它尚未触发警报。“我们有没有从它那里获得任何读数？”

"The MAGI are still—"  
“MAGI 系统仍在——”

The alarm started blaring.  
警报开始尖锐地响起。

AT FIELD DETECTED AT 力场已探测到  
PATTERN TYPE BLUE 模式类型：蓝色  
ANGEL CONFIRMED 天使确认  
DESIGNATION: ISRAFEL 指定名：伊斯瑞尔

In Classroom 2-A, three young people reacted to the sound of their phones going off in unison.  
在 2-A 教室里，三个年轻人对手机同时响起的声响做出了反应。

Shinji sighed heavily, steeling himself for the prospect of another life or death struggle. For all that, he felt a certain thrill that had to come from the parts of Asuka's soul he was carrying. He gathered his things and hurried out the door without glancing back.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，为自己即将面对的生死较量做好了心理准备。尽管如此，他感到一种莫名的兴奋，这必定源自他所承载的明日香灵魂的一部分。他收拾好东西，匆匆出门，没有回头看一眼。

Asuka grinned as she saw the alert text on her phone. She'd finally get a chance to show off what Unit 02 could do when it wasn't stuck underwater with standard equipment. She'd just finished gathering her things when she glanced over at Shinji and _remembered_ the pain he'd felt in his chest. He'd nearly died the first time he was launched against the blue crystal Angel. They'd actually needed to use the shock electrodes built into the chest of his suit. Gritting her teeth and silently cursing, she did her best to look confident as she headed for the door.  
明日香看到手机上的警报信息，咧嘴一笑。她终于有机会展示零二号机在不被困水下且装备标准设备时的实力了。她刚收拾好东西，瞥了一眼真嗣，想起了他胸口的疼痛。他第一次迎战蓝色水晶使徒时差点丧命，他们甚至不得不使用了他战斗服胸部的电击电极。她咬紧牙关，暗自咒骂，尽量表现得自信地向门口走去。

Across the classroom, by the window, Rei dug her nails into her palms and took slow deep breaths. Everything was the sharpest it had ever been, from the aftertaste of her toothpaste, through the slowly diffusing scents of her classmates' deodorants and suchlike, to the already hateful texture of her clothing. The only hope, if any was to be found, lay in defeating the Angel. Perhaps that would persuade her brain that the threat was gone for now, that she could sink back into the comforting fog of her daily routine.  
教室的另一边，靠窗的位置，丽用指甲深深掐入掌心，缓缓深呼吸。一切都变得前所未有的尖锐，从牙膏的余味，到同学们渐渐散开的体香和类似气味，再到她已经感到厌恶的衣物质感。唯一的希望，如果有的话，就在于击败使徒。或许那样能说服她的大脑，威胁暂时消失了，她可以重新沉入日常生活的舒适迷雾中。

She needed guidance. Dr Akagi would just use the drugs she had in ample supply. The Commander might even decide she needed to be transferred into a fresh body and reconditioned from the beginning.  
她需要指引。赤城博士只会用她充足供应的药物。指挥官甚至可能决定她需要转移到一具新身体中，从头开始重新训练。

Disappointed in herself, she gathered her things and hurried after her comrades in arms.  
对自己感到失望，她收拾好东西，匆匆追赶她的战友们。

"Because the repairs following Operation Yashima are still in progress, we have agreed with the SDF to intercept this new Angel, designated 'Israfel', in an unpopulated area. Captain Katsuragi, please brief your pilots on the details of the operation."  
"由于‘屋岛作战’后的修复工作仍在进行中，我们已与 SDF 达成一致，将在无人区域拦截这只新出现的使徒，代号为‘伊斯拉斐尔’。葛城美里队长，请向你的驾驶员们详细说明作战计划。"

Rei turned her attention from the Sub-Commander to the Captain.  
绫波零将注意力从副司令转向了葛城队长。

"Right. The MAGI recommends a two-Eva team to engage this Angel. Mostly because we only have two of the airdrop transporters available. Rei will remain in reserve at Tokyo-3. Shinji and Asuka, you will..."  
"好的。MAGI 建议由两名 EVA 驾驶员组成团队来应对这只使徒。主要是因为我们目前只有两架空投运输机可用。绫波将留守在第三新东京市作为预备。真嗣和明日香，你们将……"

Rei bit the inside of her cheek. The pain and the taste of blood distracted her from Captain Katsuragi's description of an operation she would not be participating in and the scent of Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki's cologne and Asuka's strawberry shampoo. She was not being deployed. Her current state might persist even longer. Would it escalate further if another Angel encounter saw her sidelined yet again?  
绫波咬了咬内颊。疼痛和血的味道让她从葛城队长对一项她无法参与的行动的描述中分心，还有副司令冬月古怪的香水味和明日香草莓味的洗发水。她不会被派遣。她目前的状况可能会持续更久。如果再次遭遇使徒而她又被排除在外，情况会进一步恶化吗？

She bit the inside of her other cheek. Eating would likely be unpleasant for several days. Perhaps that would be useful.  
她咬了咬另一边的内颊。接下来的几天里，进食可能会很不愉快。或许这会有所帮助。

A hand on her shoulder, shaking her lightly, broke her train of thought. "Earth to Rei!" called Asuka. "Are you okay there?"  
一只手搭在她的肩上，轻轻摇晃着她，打断了她的思绪。"绫波，回神啦！"明日香喊道，"你还好吗？"

Rei blinked and shook her head. "I was thinking about my role in this encounter."  
丽眨了眨眼，摇了摇头。“我在思考我在这场遭遇中的角色。”

"Relax, you get to stay at home with your crappy prototype," said Asuka.  
“放松，你可以在家陪着你那糟糕的原型机，”明日香说道。

Rei felt like she should protest Asuka's description of Unit 00, but she couldn't think of a reason to actually do so. Objectively, Unit 00 was inferior as an anti-Angel weapon to either of the other units. "I was hoping to be useful."  
丽觉得她应该对明日香描述零号机的说法提出抗议，但她想不出一个实际的理由来这么做。客观上，作为对抗使徒的武器，零号机在性能上确实不如其他两台机体。“我希望能派上用场。”

"Well, you know what they say. 'They also serve, who stand at home and wait.' Garrison duty sucks, but somebody's gotta do it."  
"嗯，你知道他们怎么说。'那些守候在家的人同样在服务。'驻守任务很糟糕，但总得有人来做。"

Rei tried to dig her nails into her palms, but was blocked by the gloves of her plugsuit. Asuka did not understand. That was reasonable, because she did not know, but it was still frustrating. "I... you are right."  
绫波试图用指甲掐进手掌，但被她的插入栓服手套挡住了。明日香不明白。这是合理的，因为她不知道，但这仍然令人沮丧。"我...你说得对。"

---

"Hey, Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

Shinji stopped a couple of paces past the door to Unit 02's cage and turned around. Asuka was lingering at the door, one hand on the frame and the other held out towards him. "Asuka?"  
真嗣在距离二号机笼子门口几步远的地方停下，转过身来。明日香正徘徊在门口，一只手搭在门框上，另一只手向他伸出来。“明日香？”

"Come back here a moment."  
“回来一下。”

Quirking an eyebrow suspiciously, he walked over to her. "What is it?"  
他怀疑地扬起眉毛，向她走去。“什么事？”

She leaned in and whispered to him. "I have a theory. About that. And plugsuits." More loudly, she commanded, "Shake my hand."  
她倾身向他低语。“我有个理论。关于那个。还有紧身衣。”她提高声音命令道：“握住我的手。”

He wasn't sure why he hesitated. They were both wearing gloves. It wouldn't do anything. It wouldn't affect the way being so close to her made him so very aware that something was missing. He took a deep breath and took her hand in his.  
他不明白自己为何犹豫。他们都戴着手套。这不会有什么影响。这不会改变他如此靠近她时，那种强烈意识到有什么缺失的感觉。他深吸一口气，握住了她的手。

It was like touching bare-handed. He could feel the doorframe, hard in the grip of her other hand. He could feel the way her plugsuit fit her, including the places where it was very different to how his fit him. He tried not to think about that. They had a mission to accomplish, an Angel to kill. He shook her hand as firmly as he could manage. "Deal," he announced for the benefit of the other as if she'd suggested a bet or something.  
这感觉就像赤手相触。他能感受到她另一只手紧握的门框，坚硬无比。他能感受到她的紧身衣如何贴合她，包括那些与他所穿之处截然不同的地方。他尽量不去想这些。他们有任务要完成，有使徒要消灭。他尽可能坚定地握了握她的手。“成交，”他为了其他人的缘故宣布道，仿佛她提议了一场赌注或别的什么。

She blinked. "Right. Deal." She pulled her hand away. "Now go get in the fucking robot."  
她眨了眨眼。“好，成交。”她抽回手。“现在去那该死的机器人里。”

---

Asuka couldn't fault the principle of the modified entry plug, but she didn't have to like it. The gimbal rings keeping her seat upright regardless of Unit 02's attitude were ugly and interfered with her field of view, and the inconsistency between the Eva's sense of balance and her own left her one step short of dizzy.  
对于改装后的插入栓，明日香无法质疑其原理，但她不必喜欢它。无论二号机姿态如何，保持她座位直立的万向环既丑陋又干扰视野，而 EVA 的平衡感与她自身的不一致让她几乎感到晕眩。

She wondered how Shinji was dealing with it. He hadn't had proper centrifuge training, after all. She guessed, from the lack of panicked voices on the commlink, that it hadn't made him spew, but would he still be effective? It would be a real mess if he started flopping around on the battlefield because he couldn't tell which way was 'up' any more.  
她想知道真嗣是如何应对的。毕竟他并未接受过正规的离心训练。从通讯链路中缺乏恐慌的声音来看，她猜测这并未让他呕吐，但他还能有效作战吗？如果他在战场上因为分不清“上”而开始乱晃，那可真是一团糟。

"Two minutes to drop point," called Lt Ibuki. "Ground umbilical stations are primed for use."  
“两分钟到达投放点。”伊吹摩耶少尉呼叫道，“地面对接站已准备就绪。”

The transporter started to dive, tipping Unit 02 head-down, and Asuka reflexively tightened her grip on the controls. There she was, worrying about the— about Shinji's ability to cope, when she wasn't a hundred percent sure about her own. To take her mind off it, she thumbed the talk button. "Hey Shinji, remember our deal. If I get the kill you have to cook me a proper German dinner."  
运输机开始俯冲，使二号机头部朝下，明日香本能地握紧了操纵杆。她一直在担心——担心真嗣能否应对，而她自己也没有百分之百的把握。为了转移注意力，她按下了通话按钮。“嘿，真嗣，记得我们的约定。如果我击落了敌人，你得给我做一顿正宗的德国晚餐。”

Was it going to work?  
这会奏效吗？

"I remember. And if I get the kill, you have to actually try my fish soup."  
“我记得。如果我拿到了击杀，你就得真的尝尝我的鱼汤。”

Not quite the result she wanted. But she couldn't get into an argument about it. "Oh yeah, I am not letting you feed me that. I am going to kill this bastard."  
这并非她所期望的结果。但她也无法为此争论。“哦，是的，我不会让你喂我吃那个的。我要干掉这个混蛋。”

---

The way Rei sat on the gantry railing next to her entry plug was not comfortable. It required constant fine shifts in muscle tension to remain stable. It made her tendons ache.  
丽坐在她驾驶舱旁边的悬臂栏杆上的方式并不舒适。为了保持稳定，需要不断细微地调整肌肉张力。这让她的肌腱感到疼痛。

It wasn't enough, but it made things better. With her eyes closed, and her cheeks aching from their earlier biting, and her body encased in the smooth, compressive comfort of a plugsuit, the only things truly left outside her control were the smells and sounds of Unit 00's cage.  
这并不足够，但它让情况好转了些。她闭上眼睛，脸颊因之前的刺痛而僵硬，身体被紧身衣的平滑压迫感包裹着，唯一真正超出她控制的是零号机的牢笼中的气味和声音。

She wondered how Shinji and Asuka were doing.  
她想知道真嗣和明日香怎么样了。

---

Shinji sighed with relief as the battery countdown that had started when Unit 01 detached from the transporter disappeared. "Power attached," he confirmed over the commlink.  
当零一机从运输车上分离后启动的电池倒计时消失时，真嗣松了一口气。“电源已连接，”他通过通讯器确认道。

"Power attached," echoed Asuka. "So where's the Angel?"  
"能量已连接，" 明日香重复道，"那么使徒在哪里？"

"Making landfall right about now," replied Misato.  
"即将登陆，" 美里回答道。"

The water in the bay parted, and a black and white bipedal figure slowly emerged. It reminded him a little of the first Angel he'd fought, with no head or neck, and white ribs visible near an exposed core, but its limbs were much thicker and the face was a red and blue taikyokuzu instead of that odd bird skull. He raised the pallet rifle, aiming at the core, and concentrated on extending Unit 01's AT Field, remembering how the whip-Angel had ignored the gunfire when he forgot.  
海湾中的水流分开，一个黑白相间的双足身影缓缓浮现。这让他想起了他第一次战斗的使徒，没有头颈，白色肋骨清晰可见，核心暴露在外，但它的四肢更为粗壮，面部是红蓝相间的太极图而非那奇怪的鸟类头骨。他举起托盘步枪，瞄准核心，集中精神扩展零号机的 AT 力场，记起当他忘记时，鞭状使徒是如何无视枪火的。

"All right," called Asuka. "Let's kick this thing's arse and go home."  
"好了，" 明日香喊道。"让我们踢爆这东西的屁股，然后回家吧。"

Shinji made contact with the Angel's AT Field. It felt... odd. Almost like it wasn't quite... _there_. Still, it seemed to weaken as he probed, so he let off a short burst from the pallet rifle. Asuka lunged in a moment later, whirling her massive Eva-scale naginata round in a downward stroke that split the angel from the shoulder all the way down to the middle of its core.  
真嗣接触到了使徒的 AT 力场。感觉...很奇怪。几乎像是它并不完全...存在。尽管如此，当他试探时，它似乎在减弱，于是他向着使徒发射了一阵短促的弹幕。明日香紧接着冲了上去，挥舞着她那巨大的 EVA 级薙刀，一击从使徒的肩膀直劈到核心中部。

"AT Field surge detected!" called Lt Ibuki as Asuka tugged at her weapon to pull it free.  
"检测到 AT 力场激增！" 伊吹摩耶中尉喊道，与此同时明日香正用力拽出卡在使徒体内的武器。

"What?!" asked Asuka, overbalancing to land flat on her back as the Angel ripped the rest of the way in half.  
“什么？！”明日香惊呼一声，失去平衡摔了个四脚朝天，只见那使徒猛地从中裂开，彻底一分为二。

The two halves pirouetted away, spinning at ridiculous speed, and when they came to a halt, Shinji thought he was seeing double. There were two of the Angel now, one silver and the other copper, each with half of the original's face.  
两半躯体旋转着飞离，以惊人的速度旋转，当它们最终停下时，真嗣觉得自己眼花了。现在出现了两个使徒，一个银色，一个铜色，各自拥有原使徒的一半面容。

### Chapter Text 正文

Standing in the locker room, senses still keyed up to an unbearable level, Rei hesitated with her finger on the detensioning stud. Her plugsuit was specialist equipment. It was designed as a synchronization aid. It was not intended to be worn for any purpose other than Evangelion operations and training. It was not suitable for everyday wear. She could not go home in it. She could not sleep in it.  
站在更衣室里，感官仍处于难以忍受的高度紧张状态，丽犹豫着将手指放在解除锁定按钮上。她的插件服是专业装备，设计用于同步辅助。它并非为日常穿着而设计，只适用于 EVA 操作和训练。她不能穿着它回家，也不能穿着它睡觉。

She shook her head and pressed the stud. Such thoughts were futile. The Angel was suppressed. There would be no combat engagement for several days. She had to change back into her school uniform and go home. Refusing to do so would simply make Dr Akagi insist that she needed to be taken down to Terminal Dogma for examination.  
她摇了摇头，按下按钮。这些想法毫无意义。天使已被压制。未来几天内不会有战斗。她必须换回校服回家。拒绝这样做只会让赤木博士坚持要带她去最终教条区检查。

She would be content enough when she re-emerged the next day, or maybe the day after. Her behaviour would be as expected. Her senses would operate in their usual envelope. She would not have to grit her teeth as she pulled on garments made of everyday textiles. She would not feel nauseous breathing the tobacco-scented air around Dr Akagi. She would not object to how each of her shoes was ever so slightly the wrong fit in different ways. She would not be distracted by the way Shinji and Asuka's souls behaved.

Dressed in accordance with expectations, she regretfully dropped her plugsuit into the cleaning chute. The one small mercy, as she walked out of the locker room amid a storm of unwanted sensation, was that her crudely hacked-off hair was still short enough not to brush against her neck. She was not going to be able to sleep like this. Sheets in contact with her whole body would be insufferable. She needed something to—  
按照预期穿戴整齐，她遗憾地将紧身衣投入清洁通道。唯一值得庆幸的是，当她走出更衣室，置身于一阵阵不受欢迎的感觉中时，她那粗暴剪短的头发仍然足够短，不会拂过她的脖子。她今晚无法这样入睡。床单与全身接触将难以忍受。她需要一些东西来——

Her gaze lit on a wall-mounted emergency medical kit. Her conditioning was tuned to respond, at least in part, to the hormonal markers of combat. A spike of exogenous epinephrine might serve a similar purpose, but breaking open the inspection seal on the fixed kit would raise questions.  
她的目光落在墙上挂着的紧急医疗包上。她的训练使她至少部分地对战斗中的激素标志做出反应。外源性肾上腺素激增可能起到类似作用，但破坏固定医疗包上的检查封条会引发疑问。

She smelled someone over the cleaning products used to maintain the corridor. She was unsure who, except to exclude Dr Akagi because there was no stink of stale tobacco smoke.  
她在清洁剂的气味中嗅到了某人的气息。她不确定是谁，只知道不是赤城博士，因为没有那股陈旧烟草的臭味。

"Rei?" asked Captain Katsuragi, coming round the corner. "I was just coming down to see how you were."  
"丽？" 葛城美里队长转过拐角问道，"我正要下来看看你怎么样了。"

"I am well enough." Rei paused. Shinji had described the Captain as a caring person, if not always... good at it. She could endure a delay to avoid the attention she did not want. "Captain, I need some standard medication and I do not wish to disrupt Dr Akagi's analysis of the Angel. Could you get me an epinephrine autoinjector?"  
"我很好。" 丽停顿了一下。真嗣曾形容过美里队长是个有爱心的人，尽管并不总是……擅长表达。她可以忍受等待，以避免不想要的关心。"队长，我需要一些常规药物，而且我不想打扰赤木律子博士对使徒的分析。你能帮我拿一支肾上腺素自动注射器吗？"

"An EpiPen? I didn't know you were allergic to anything," replied the Captain. "But sure, I can get you that from Medical."  
"肾上腺素自动注射器？我不知道你对什么东西过敏，" 美里队长回答，"不过当然，我可以从医疗部给你拿一个。"

"Thank you. Please... do not mention it is for me."  
"谢谢。请...不要提到这是为我准备的。"

"Rei?" "丽？"

"Any requisition associated with me is notified to Dr Akagi. It would distract her when her full attention should be on finding a solution to dealing with the Angel. It is very important to me that I not distract her."  
"任何与我相关的申请都会通知给赤城博士。这会分散她的注意力，而她本应全神贯注于寻找对付使徒的解决方案。对我来说，不让她分心非常重要。"

---

Shinji hesitated as he walked into the briefing room. Misato, Dr Akagi, and the three bridge crew were all sitting in the audience seats, leaving the seat next to Asuka as the only one vacant.  
真嗣走进简报室时犹豫了一下。美里、赤城博士以及三位桥员都坐在观众席上，只剩下明日香旁边的座位空着。

It wasn't that he didn't like her. It wasn't that he didn't want to sit near her. He just didn't want to accidentally brush her hand or anything and share the residual sympathetic pain in his left side with her, or find out the hard way that she had the same kind of problem. But he couldn't really make a thing of it because he didn't want to land himself any extra prodding and poking by Dr Akagi "in the name of science".  
并非他不喜欢她，也不是他不想坐在她旁边。他只是不想无意中碰到她的手或任何部位，从而将他左侧残留的同感痛传递给她，或者以艰难的方式发现她也有同样的问题。但他又不能真的对此事大惊小怪，因为他不想因此招致更多来自赤城博士的“科学名义”下的额外检查和触碰。

So he sat down next to Asuka and clasped his hands together in his lap. She looked up from her notebook at him, frowning slightly. "Hi," she said.  
于是他坐在了明日香旁边，双手合十放在膝上。她从笔记本上抬起头来看着他，微微皱眉。“嗨，”她说。

"Hi," he replied. “嗨，”他回应道。

Any further conversation was curtailed by the lights dimming and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki walking into the room. "Good evening," said Fuyutsuki, as a slide showing the identically charred figures of the Angel's duplicates appeared on the screen behind him. "We are here to review the unsuccessful engagement with the Angel called Israfel."  
灯光渐暗，副司令官冬月走进房间，打断了所有进一步的交谈。“晚上好，”冬月说道，他身后屏幕上显示出天使伊斯拉斐尔的复制体被烧焦的相同影像。“我们聚集于此，是为了回顾与名为伊斯拉斐尔的天使那次不成功的交战。”

Shinji braced himself. 真嗣做好了心理准备。

"Let me begin by saying that this incident demonstrates why it is not enough simply to have the right weapons to defeat the Angels. They must be used correctly."  
“让我先说明，这次事件证明了仅仅拥有击败天使的正确武器是不够的，它们必须被正确使用。”

The slide advanced to show a still image captured halfway through the Angel dividing. Shinji heard Asuka give a sharp intake of breath, but she didn't say anything.  
幻灯片推进，展示了一张在使徒分裂中途捕捉到的静态图像。真嗣听到明日香倒吸了一口凉气，但她没有说什么。

"Unit 02's blow at the start of the engagement should have been decisive, but as we have now learned, 'should' means nothing when the Angels are involved. Instead, the Angel split into two copies of itself, which the MAGI system has called 'Banach' and 'Tarski', and began to actively engage the Evangelions."  
初号机在战斗开始时的那一击本应是决定性的，但正如我们现在所知，当涉及到使徒时，'本应'毫无意义。相反，使徒分裂成了两个自身副本，MAGI 系统称之为'巴拿赫'和'塔斯基'，并开始积极地与福音战士交战。

A new slide showed Asuka and Shinji attacking the coppery duplicate. "The Pilots demonstrated an awareness of their tactical situation, and an ability to focus their attacks on a single target when presented with multiple. Unfortunately, despite landing multiple blows on duplicate Tarski, including strikes causing visible fractures of the core, they were unable to inflict any lasting damage."  
新的一张幻灯片展示了明日香和真嗣攻击铜色副本的情景。'驾驶员们展现了对战术形势的意识，以及在面对多个目标时集中攻击单一目标的能力。不幸的是，尽管对塔斯基副本造成了多次打击，包括导致核心可见裂缝的攻击，他们仍未能造成任何持久性伤害。'

Unit 02 – or at least, its legs, poking out from under a rockslide – appeared on screen. "The duplicates made a combined attack on Unit 02, seizing it and throwing it into a nearby hillside. The impact destabilized the terrain, leaving Unit 02 incapacitated."  
初号机 02——或者说，至少是它的双腿，从岩石崩塌下露了出来——出现在屏幕上。“复制体联合对初号机 02 发起了攻击，将其抓住并抛向附近的斜坡。撞击导致地形不稳定，使初号机 02 失去了行动能力。”

Unit 02 was replaced by Unit 01, lying face down with a severed power cable. "Pilot Ikari offered a valiant resistance, but was unable to harm the duplicates or prevent them from destroying Unit 01's power cable. The SDF launched an N2 missile at NERV's request, causing extensive damage to both duplicates. Dr Akagi, I believe you have some input."  
初号机 02 被初号机 01 取代，后者面朝下躺着，电源线被切断。“碇司令进行了英勇的抵抗，但无法伤害到复制体或阻止它们摧毁初号机 01 的电源线。在 NERV 的请求下，SDF 发射了一枚 N2 导弹，对两个复制体造成了严重破坏。赤木博士，我认为您有一些意见。”

"Yes." The blonde-haired scientist walked to the front of the room – a little more awkwardly than usual, Shinji couldn't help noticing – and took Fuyutsuki's place at the lectern. "Any part of either duplicate where the other took no damage recovered almost instantly. The parts where both duplicates took damage from the blast remained injured. Our best forecast indicates the Angel will take a week to recover to combat readiness."  
“是的。”金发科学家走到房间前面——比平时略显笨拙，这让真嗣不禁注意到——并接替了冬月的讲台位置。“任何一方复制体未受损伤的部分几乎立即恢复。双方都受到爆炸伤害的部分则保持受伤状态。我们最好的预测表明，使徒需要一周时间才能恢复到战斗准备状态。”

A new slide appeared, showing two horizontal lines with identically spaced marks on them. "The MAGI's analysis notes that while the duplicates moved independently, their attacks – whether on the same or different targets – were always very closely synchronized. The detailed AT Field analysis is ongoing, but we have a proposed plan of attack. Pilots Sōryū and Ikari will need to synchronize their movements so that they score blows against the duplicates as close to simultaneously as possible."  
一张新的幻灯片出现，显示了两条带有相同间距标记的水平线。“MAGI 的分析指出，尽管复制体独立移动，但它们的攻击——无论是针对相同还是不同的目标——总是非常紧密地同步。详细的 AT 力场分析正在进行中，但我们有一个拟定的攻击计划。碇真嗣和绫波零两位驾驶员需要同步他们的动作，以便尽可能同时对复制体造成打击。”

Shinji looked at Asuka. She looked like she wanted to say something – probably something rude – but obviously thought better of it. He allowed himself to smile a little... _just_ as she turned towards him and frowned.  
真嗣看着明日香。她看起来想说些什么——可能是些刻薄的话——但显然她想了想还是放弃了。他让自己微微一笑...就在她转向他并皱眉的那一刻。

Before any words could be exchanged, Misato stood up, her chair scraping against the floor. "I have a training plan to help with that before we put them in the simulator again," she announced. "Kaji's getting the equipment delivered as we speak."  
在任何话语交换之前，美里站了起来，她的椅子刮擦着地板。“我有一个训练计划，帮助他们在再次进入模拟器之前做好准备，”她宣布道。“加持正在把设备送来，我们说话间他可能已经到了。”

---

Asuka frowned as she, Shinji, and Misato approached the apartment building. There was an unmarked white box van parked outside, with two men in long-sleeved turtlenecks and gloves busy closing up the back. "Who even dresses like that in this heat?" she asked, plucking at her school blouse.  
明日香皱着眉头，和真嗣、美里一起走近公寓楼。外面停着一辆没有标记的白色厢式货车，两个穿着长袖高领衫和手套的男人正忙着关上后门。“这么热的天，谁还会穿成那样？”她问道，拉扯着自己的校服衬衫。

"Good question," replied Misato, just as Kaji emerged from the building. He grinned at the trio and waved, then turned to shake the hands of the delivery men. For a moment, Asuka thought she saw a flash of colour at the wrist of one of the men where his glove didn't quite overlap his sleeve.  
“好问题，”美里回答道，就在这时，加持从大楼里走了出来。他对着三人咧嘴一笑，挥了挥手，然后转身与送货员握手。有那么一瞬间，明日香觉得她看到其中一个男人的手腕处，手套没有完全盖住袖口，露出了一抹颜色。

The van drove off, and Misato walked over to poke Kaji in the chest. "What's with hiring guys like that for delivery?"  
货车开走了，美里走过去戳了戳加持的胸口。“干嘛雇这种人来做送货的？”

"How else was I going to get a good deal at short notice?" he countered. "Don't worry, the gear's all perfectly legitimate. Their boss knows what's good for him."  
"否则我怎么能在短时间内谈成一笔好交易呢？" 他反驳道，"别担心，这些装备都是完全合法的。他们的老板知道什么对他有好处。"

"Those were the same men as last time," observed Shinji. "I recognized the short one."  
"那些人和上次是同一伙，" 真嗣观察道，"我认出了那个矮个子。"

Misato turned to face Shinji. "Wait, you mean he had those guys haul my junk away?!"  
美里转向真嗣，"等等，你是说他让那些人把我的东西搬走了？！"

"I told you, their boss knows what's good for him. And besides, they're not the shadiest people in town." Kaji bowed apologetically and tossed the house keys towards Misato. "Let me buy you yakiniku next Saturday to make amends?"  
“我告诉过你，他们老板知道什么对他有好处。而且，他们也不是镇上最阴暗的人。” 加持抱歉地鞠了一躬，将房门钥匙抛向美里。“下周六我请你吃烤肉赔罪，怎么样？”

Suddenly blushing, Misato snagged the keys out of the air and glared at him. "Fine. Now scram."  
美里突然脸红，一把抓住钥匙，瞪了他一眼。“好吧。现在快滚。”

Asuka watched Kaji departing, facts clicking into place. This was the man she'd been fascinated with? A man who apologized for hiring the Mob to deliver whatever-it-was by _asking Misato on a date_? "Ugh, that man!"  
明日香看着加持离开，事实逐渐清晰。这就是她一直感兴趣的男人吗？一个因为雇佣了黑帮送东西而向美里道歉，甚至提出约会的男人？“呃，那个男人！”

Shinji shrugged. "He's better than my father."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。"他比我的父亲要好。"

### Chapter Text 正文

Shinji stared at the living room. The furniture had all been pushed against the walls, and pride of place was now given to a pair of thick white floor mats with red circles on them. Cables ran this way and that, connecting the mats to various bits and pieces of electronics, including a pair of black boxes mounted on the wall. "What's all this for?" he asked.  
真嗣盯着客厅。家具都被推到了墙边，现在最显眼的位置是一对厚厚的白色地板垫，上面有红色的圆圈。电缆四处延伸，将垫子连接到各种电子设备上，包括墙上安装的一对黑色盒子。“这都是干什么用的？”他问道。

"It's a rhythm action system," said Asuka. "You know, a dance game! Haven't you seen one before? They were invented here!"  
"这是节奏动作系统，" 明日香说，"你知道的，就是跳舞游戏！以前没见过吗？这可是这里发明的！"

Shinji shook his head. "Not one like this. I've only seen the one in the arcade Ken and Tōji go to, and the boards for that are square."  
真嗣摇了摇头。"没见过这样的。我只见过健和东治去游戏厅玩的那种，那里的踏板是方形的。"

Misato grabbed them both round the shoulders. "This, kids, is your new training setup! You have to learn to match your movements with each other so you can hit both of those Angel clones at the same time."  
美里一把搂住他们俩的肩膀。"孩子们，这是你们新的训练设备！你们得学会同步动作，这样才能同时击中那两个使徒分身。"

Asuka squirmed out of Misato's grip. "And we're using this lot for training? Seriously?"  
明日香从美里手中挣脱出来。“我们用这块地进行训练？认真的吗？”

"Seriously. There's a few other things on the cards, but we can talk about that after a lovely dinner from Shin-chan." Misato ruffled Shinji's hair and let go of him. "I'm going to get changed. Behave yourselves!"  
“认真的。还有几件事要安排，不过我们可以吃完新酱做的美味晚餐再谈。”美里揉了揉真嗣的头发，放开了他。“我去换衣服。你们乖乖的！”

The pilots watched their guardian vanish into her bedroom. After a few moments, Asuka shook her head. "That woman is impossible. So, 'Shin-chan', what are you making for dinner?"  
驾驶员们看着他们的监护人消失在卧室里。片刻后，明日香摇了摇头。“那女人真是没救了。那么，‘新酱’，你晚餐打算做什么？”

Shinji looked at the kitchen and sighed. "I have no idea. I was going to go for groceries after school."  
真嗣看着厨房叹了口气。“我不知道。我原本打算放学后去买菜的。”

"Hmph. Well, I'm not waiting for you to do a grocery run! Why didn't you get some in yesterday?"  
“哼。我才不会等你去买菜呢！你昨天怎么没买？”

"Because I had enough ingredients yesterday, and I wanted fresh ingredients today." Shinji's fingers curled, and he took a deep breath. "Look, there's a delivery place sent out menus a few days ago, we can order out and then I can get groceries tomorrow."  
“因为昨天食材够了，我想今天用新鲜的。”真嗣的手指蜷缩起来，深吸了一口气。“听着，前几天有家送餐的地方发了菜单，我们可以叫外卖，然后我明天再去买菜。”

Asuka glowered at him for a moment, then sighed and nodded. "Fine. But you'd better do something special tomorrow to make up for it."  
明日香瞪了他一会儿，然后叹了口气点点头。“好吧。但你最好明天做点特别的事来弥补。”

"No promises," said Shinji, fishing the menu out from behind the rice cooker. "We don't know how tired we're going to be or what else Misato has up her sleeve."  
“不保证，”真嗣说着从电饭煲后面拿出菜单。“我们不知道会有多累，也不知道美里还有什么别的花招。”

---

The delivery Chinese wasn't as good as Shinji's cooking, Misato mused as she cracked open her third beer of the evening, but there was plenty of it. Finish this beer, and then she'd be able to weather any shrieking from Asuka over the crazy, crazy plan Ritz insisted was toned down from the MAGI's proposal. She raised the can and poured its contents down her gullet, wishing it was one of those fancy beers from the yakiniku place.  
外卖的中餐没有真嗣做的那么好吃，美里一边想着一边打开当晚的第三罐啤酒，但量倒是足够。喝完这罐，她就能应对明日香对丽坚持说是从 MAGI 提案中简化了的疯狂计划的任何尖叫了。她举起罐子，将里面的啤酒一饮而尽，心里却想着要是能喝到烤肉店里的那种高档啤酒就好了。

"Right, kids! It's time to talk about the training plan!"  
"好了，孩子们！是时候谈谈训练计划了！"

"There's more than just those dance mats?" asked Shinji.  
"不仅仅是那些跳舞垫吗？" 真嗣问道。"

"Uh-huh." This was it. Three beers and a deep breath. That should be enough. "So the MAGI analysis is, and Ritz swears blind that she actually had to reject the first version, that you two need to do as much as possible together. Even sleep in the same room and keep the exact same hours."  
"嗯哼。" 就是这样。三瓶啤酒和一个深呼吸。应该足够了。"所以 MAGI 分析的结果是，而且丽兹发誓她真的不得不拒绝了第一版，你们俩需要尽可能多地在一起。甚至睡在同一个房间，保持完全相同的作息时间。"

"What?!" asked Shinji and Asuka, almost in unison, as they glared at her.  
"什么？！" 真嗣和明日香几乎异口同声地问道，同时瞪着她。

Misato looked longingly at the beer fridge. Maybe three wasn't enough after all. "Hey, you don't have to get changed in front of each other. We're not having you share a bed, just a room."  
美里渴望地看着啤酒冰箱。或许三罐终究还是不够。"嘿，你们不必在彼此面前换衣服。我们不是要让你们共用一张床，只是同一个房间。"

Asuka sprang to her feet and slammed her hands down on the table. "A boy and a girl our age shouldn't even be sharing a room!"  
明日香猛地站起身，双手重重拍在桌上。"我们这个年纪的男孩和女孩根本就不该共用一个房间！"

Misato pinched the bridge of her nose. "Asuka, I'm not negotiating with you about this. You're sharing a bedroom with Shinji until after this Angel is beaten. You're both going to bed at the same time, and you're getting up as early as he does."  
美里捏了捏鼻梁。“明日香，这件事我不会和你讨价还价。在这只使徒被打败之前，你得和真嗣共用一个卧室。你们俩要同时上床睡觉，也要和他一样早起。”

"But he only gets up that early to make the food!"  
“但他那么早起只是为了做早饭！”

"Well then, you can help him. You're supposed to do as much as possible together, after all."  
“那就对了，你可以帮他。毕竟，你们应该尽可能一起做事情。”

Asuka looked at Shinji. "I don't know how to cook Japanese food."  
明日香看着真嗣。“我不懂怎么做日本菜。”

Shinji looked at Asuka and held out a hand. "You can help chop the vegetables?"  
真嗣看着明日香，伸出手。“你可以帮忙切菜吗？”

Asuka looked down, glanced sideways at Misato, and shook Shinji's hand. Did they flinch a little just then? "Fine," said the redhead. "But don't get used to it. I'm not the housewife type."  
明日香低头瞥了一眼美里，然后握住了真嗣的手。他们刚才是不是有点退缩？“好吧，”红发女孩说。“但别习惯。我不是那种家庭主妇型的。”

Misato felt very proud of herself for not actually sighing with relief. "Fantastic! Great to see you working together." She waved a hand in the general direction of the lounge. "Now, Ritz says you two should start getting used to how that lot works ASAP."  
美里为自己没有真正松一口气而感到非常自豪。“太棒了！很高兴看到你们一起工作。”她向客厅的大致方向挥了挥手。“现在，丽兹说你们俩应该尽快习惯那帮人的工作方式。”

Rei lay on her bed, looking up at the ceiling through half-closed eyes.  
绫波零躺在床上，半闭着眼睛望着天花板。

Her ears were ringing from the music Asuka had recommended, played as loud as her stereo could manage. It was fortunate the building, being near derelict, was otherwise vacant.  
她的耳朵被明日香推荐的音量开到最大的音乐震得嗡嗡作响。幸运的是，这栋近乎废弃的建筑里没有其他人。

Her neck was stiff and her arms and legs ached, most especially where she'd driven the autoinjector home in her right thigh.  
她的脖子僵硬，四肢酸痛，尤其是她在大腿右侧用力扎下自动注射器的地方。

Her feet hurt from repeatedly landing hard on uncushioned flooring. She thought she might even have slightly twisted her right ankle.  
她的脚因为反复重重地落在无缓冲的地板上而疼痛。她甚至觉得自己的右脚踝可能有点扭到了。

She was curious, after hearing the lyrics, why Asuka liked the songs so much.  
听完歌词后，她很好奇为什么明日香会这么喜欢这些歌曲。

But none of that mattered.  
但这些都不重要。

What mattered was the feeling of the sheet against her skin where she'd flopped down onto the bed without showering off her sweat first.  
重要的是床单贴着她皮肤的触感，她没洗澡就一头倒在床上，汗水还黏在身上。

It was bearable. She could lie still. She could imagine succumbing to her fatigue and sleeping until her morning alarm went off.  
这还能忍受。她可以静静躺着。她可以想象自己屈服于疲劳，一直睡到早上的闹钟响起。

None of this was something she could share with the Commander. None of this was something she could share with Dr Akagi. Her curiosity about the lyrics, in particular, would not be acceptable.  
这些事情她无法与指挥官分享。这些事情她无法与赤木博士分享。尤其是她对歌词的好奇，是不会被接受的。

Reluctantly, she stood up and started stripping the bed. Bearable or not, sleeping in sweat-stained bedding would make her poor company in the morning. Sleep would have to wait until she finished changing the sheets and took a shower.  
不情愿地，她站起身开始整理床铺。无论是否能忍受，睡在汗湿的床单上，明早她肯定会状态不佳。睡觉只能等到她换好床单并洗完澡之后了。

### Chapter Text 正文

Despite the weariness in her muscles from a dismal trial round on the dance mats, Asuka found herself lying awake in the darkness.  
尽管因在跳舞垫上糟糕的试跳而肌肉疲惫，明日香发现自己躺在黑暗中却无法入睡。

With Shinji lying there on his futon, less than a metre away, that sense of _missingness_ gnawed away at her. It was exactly as bad as she'd feared. The rest of her soul was so close by. She could practically reach out and touch it. She'd feel complete like that.  
新治就躺在离她不到一米远的被褥上，那种缺失感在她心中啃噬。情况正如她所担心的那样糟糕。她的另一半灵魂近在咫尺。她几乎可以伸手触及。那样她就会感到完整。

She'd also be touching a boy. A boy who shouldn't be in her room at all. A boy who should be safely hidden in his own room, far enough away that the feeling plaguing her could sink below the ache in her muscles. A boy who piloted an Eva. A boy she couldn't slap because it would be like slapping herself. A boy who was easy on her eyes.  
同时，她也会触碰到一个男孩。一个本不该出现在她房间的男孩。一个应该安全地躲在自己房间里，远到让她困扰的感觉沉入肌肉酸痛之下的男孩。一个驾驶着 Eva 的男孩。一个她不能扇耳光的男孩，因为那就像在扇自己。一个外表让她赏心悦目的男孩。

"Shinji?" she asked, quietly so he wouldn't wake up if he'd managed to get to sleep like a lucky bastard.  
“新治？”她轻声问道，生怕吵醒他，如果他像幸运的混蛋一样睡着了的话。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She rolled over, not trying to move slowly, letting the mattress springs make whatever noise they made as she hung her hand off the side of the bed. She'd have deniability like that. Just tossing and turning, not deliberately putting her hand where he could reach it. She wasn't trying to touch him. She was just—  
她翻身过去，没有刻意放慢动作，任由床垫弹簧发出它们该有的声响，同时将手悬在床边。这样一来，她就有否认的余地了。只是在辗转反侧，并非有意将手放在他能触及的地方。她并非试图触碰他。她只是——

His hand brushed against hers. She snatched at it before he could pull away. However weird it felt, feeling his clothes and his bedding and the ghost of her own hand around her fingers, it made _that_ feeling go away, the one she couldn't bear for long at this distance.  
他的手轻拂过她的。在她能抓住之前，他差点抽回手。尽管感觉怪异，触摸着他的衣物、床单，以及手指间仿佛自己手的幽灵，这感觉驱散了那个她无法长时间忍受的距离感。

To his credit, to her simultaneous satisfaction and disorientation, he let her keep hold of his hand. "Asuka, I..."  
值得称赞的是，同时让她既满足又困惑的是，他任由她握住他的手。“明日香，我……”

She was holding a boy's hand.  
她正牵着一个男孩的手。

She was holding onto a boy's hand with an iron grip because it made her feel complete.  
她紧紧握住一个男孩的手，因为这让她感到完整。

And he... he was holding onto hers in return.  
而他……也紧紧回握着她的手。

She hated that it worked. She told herself it wasn't like some gooey romantic nonsense from a love song. It really did make her feel like she was all there.  
她讨厌这方法奏效。她告诉自己，这不像爱情歌曲里那种黏糊糊的浪漫废话。它真的让她感觉自己完全在那里。

But they couldn't get to sleep like this. She couldn't lie like this all night with her arm hanging off the bed to hold Shinji's hand.  
但他们不能这样入睡。她不能整晚这样躺着，手臂悬在床边，只为了握住真嗣的手。

"Shinji. Get up here. Don't get any pervy ideas."  
“真嗣，上来。别有什么奇怪的想法。”

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"_Gott im Himmel_. A pretty girl asks you to get in bed with her and you just lie there like a lump. Look. You can think whatever you want. I just..."  
"我的天啊。一个漂亮的女孩让你上床，你却像个木头一样躺在那里。听着，你想怎么想就怎么想。我只是……"

She couldn't say it. 她说不出口。

She needed to say it.  
她必须说出来。

"You said a boy and a girl shouldn't share a bed," he pointed out.  
"你说男孩和女孩不应该共睡一张床，" 他指出。

Bastard, using her own words like that.  
混蛋，用她自己的话来对付她。

"We need to sleep. I can't sleep like this. Get up here. I'll be big spoon. I promise I won't hit you just for thinking _boy thoughts_ as long as you don't try anything funny."  
"我们需要睡觉。我这样睡不着。上来吧。我来当大勺子。我保证只要你不想些乱七八糟的事，我就不会揍你。"

He moved. She let go for a moment and shuffled back from the edge of the bed. He climbed in and did exactly what she'd told him. Legs touched legs and she felt the completeness come back.  
他动了动。她暂时松开手，从床边退后几步。他爬上床，完全按照她的指示做了。双腿相触，她感受到了那份完整感的回归。

She could sleep like this. She wrapped an arm around him like...  
她可以这样入睡。她用一只手臂环抱住他，就像……

Like some kind of teddy bear.  
就像某种泰迪熊一样。

Yes. Definitely a teddy bear. Definitely not a do— one of those.  
是的。绝对是个泰迪熊。绝对不是那种——其中一个。

Her eyelids sagged shut.  
她的眼皮沉重地合上了。

---

Shinji awoke to the blaring of the alarm clock. Groping blearily for where it should have been, slow realizations crept into his brain.  
真嗣被闹钟的响声吵醒。他迷迷糊糊地摸索着闹钟应该在的地方，渐渐地，一些认知慢慢涌入他的脑海。

He wasn't in his futon.  
他不在自己的被窝里。

The alarm clock wasn't where it should be.  
闹钟不在它应该在的地方。

The alarm clock didn't sound like his.  
闹钟的声音听起来也不像他的。

Asuka was spooned up behind him with her arm wrapped around him. He remembered now, falling asleep like this.  
明日香从背后紧紧地抱着他，手臂环绕在他身上。他现在记起来了，就是这样睡着的。

Asuka was between him and the alarm clock. If he let it keep blaring away much longer, Misato would probably come and check on them.  
明日香挡在他和闹钟之间。如果他再让闹钟继续响下去，美里可能会过来看看他们。

Misato would tease Asuka until the end of time if she saw them like this. He... didn't want Misato to do that. He didn't want to explain to Misato why he didn't want her to do that, because she'd either make salacious comments about it or tell Dr Akagi.  
如果美里看到他们这样，她会一直取笑明日香直到世界末日。他...不希望美里这么做。他也不想向美里解释为什么他不希望她这么做，因为她要么会对此发表一些下流的评论，要么会告诉赤城博士。

"Mrfl," Asuka mumbled into his hair.  
"Mrfl," 明日香咕哝着，声音埋在他的发间。

"Asuka!" he hissed, trying to gently nudge her with his elbow. "Asuka, wake up!"  
"明日香！" 他低声说道，试图用肘部轻轻推醒她。"明日香，醒醒！"

"Mrrf? Gah!" "嗯？啊！"

Asuka pulled away from him, taking the sheet with her.  
明日香从他身边抽离，顺手带走了床单。

The missingness returned. It was cold and hollow.  
那种缺失感再次袭来。它冰冷而空洞。

There was a thud and a yelp behind him.  
身后传来一声闷响和一声惊叫。

He rolled over, reaching out to slap the alarm clock's snooze button, and watched Asuka get to her feet, rubbing her elbow. "Ouch. Stupid dual sync bullshit," she grumbled. "Give me your hand."  
他翻身伸手拍下闹钟的贪睡按钮，看着明日香站起身来，揉着肘部。“哎哟。这该死的双重同步真烦人。”她咕哝着。“把手给我。”

Shinji sat up in bed and held his hand out. Asuka grabbed it, gripping a little too hard for a moment then slackening off as the connection returned. "You know we can't make breakfast like this, right?" he pointed out.  
真嗣坐在床上伸出手。明日香抓住了它，起初握得太紧，随后随着连接恢复而放松。“你知道我们这样没法做早餐，对吧？”他指出。

She glared at him, then sighed. "I know. Just let me have this moment, okay? It's... you know, right? The way it feels inside?"  
她瞪了他一眼，然后叹了口气。“我知道。就让我享受这一刻，好吗？那种……你知道的，对吧？内心的感觉？”

"Yes." He glanced at the bedroom door. "When you're ready..."  
"好的。" 他瞥了一眼卧室门。"你准备好了就……"

She grimaced and reluctantly released her grip. "Yeah, yeah. Dibs on the bathroom."  
她皱了皱眉，不情愿地松开了手。"知道了，知道了。浴室我先用。"

Asuka dashed for the door, the hollowness inside Shinji fading with every step she took. It was still _there_, but when she was in another room he could ignore it.  
明日香冲向门口，随着她每走一步，真嗣内心的空虚感逐渐消退。它依然存在，但当她在另一个房间时，他可以暂时忽略它。

---

Rei awoke, and felt a small but fierce joy despite the stiffness in her muscles. The feeling of the bedding against skin was still not entirely pleasant, but it was bearable. It held the prospect that she could spend the day fully clothed without wanting to tear her garments to shreds. As she went about her morning routine, she wondered how Shinji and Asuka would fare with their training.  
丽醒来，尽管肌肉僵硬，却感到一丝强烈的喜悦。床单与肌肤的触感依旧不甚舒适，但已可忍受。这让她觉得，今天或许能穿着衣服度过而不至于想将衣物撕成碎片。她在进行晨间例行时，不禁思索真嗣和明日香在训练中会如何应对。

---

Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, her hairbrush lying abandoned on the side, Asuka cursed a blue streak in German as she frantically flipped sections of her hair this way and that, trying to find a way to hide the patches where her roots had turned a very Japanese near-black instead of her proper red.  
站在浴室镜子前，梳子被弃置一旁，明日香用德语连珠炮般地咒骂着，她急切地翻弄着头发的各个部分，试图找到方法掩盖那些根部变黑而非她应有的红色的斑块。

It was no good. There were just too many of those little patches, dotted about here and there.  
无济于事。那些小斑块实在太多，零星散布各处。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji from the other side of the door. "Asuka, are you all right?"  
“明日香？”真嗣在门外问道，“明日香，你还好吗？”

She took a deep breath, gripping the edge of the washbasin as she tried to calm herself. It wouldn't show too much from a distance yet. She had time to do something about it.  
她深吸一口气，紧紧抓住洗手台边缘试图让自己平静下来。从远处看还不至于太明显。她还有时间做些什么。

Then she looked down at the backs of her hands. It was like vitiligo in reverse, patches just too big to be freckles where her skin tone had darkened a little to nearly match Shinji's.  
接着她低头看向自己的手背。这就像是白癜风的反向症状，那些斑块大到不可能是雀斑，她的肤色略微加深，几乎与真嗣的肤色相匹配。

She turned and flung the door open, even though getting closer to him would mean being able to _feel_ her incompleteness. "You! This is your fault! If you hadn't been in my entry plug this wouldn't be happening!"  
她转身猛地推开门，尽管靠近他意味着能感受到自己的不完整。“你！这都是你的错！如果不是你在我驾驶舱里，这一切就不会发生！”

She wanted to punch him. If it wasn't like punching herself she would have. She wanted to grab him, but she couldn't allow herself to rely on him like that. He'd think she was weak. It wasn't like last night when neither of them could sleep if they weren't touching.  
她真想揍他一顿。如果不是像在揍自己，她早就动手了。她想抓住他，但她不能让自己依赖他到那种地步。他会认为她软弱。这不像昨晚，如果他们不互相触碰就无法入睡。

"What's my fault?" he asked. "I don't see what's happening!'  
“什么我的错？”他问道，“我不明白发生了什么！”

"Look at my hair, you... you. Look at it." Her eyes widened as he moved closer. Were those little pale patches on his neck like the dark ones on her hands? Were his roots growing in the colour hers should be, here and there?  
"看看我的头发，你……你。看看它。"她的眼睛在他靠近时睁大了。他脖子上的那些小淡斑，就像她手上的深色斑点一样吗？他的发根是不是也在某些地方长出了她应有的颜色？

"I don't... wait. I thought you were a natural redhead."  
"我不……等等。我以为你是天生的红发。"

"I am! My roots weren't doing that before. And look at your neck in the mirror!"  
"我就是！我的发根以前不是这样的。而且你看看镜子里的脖子！"

It was Shinji's turn to stare wide-eyed at something impossible. "A-Asuka... what are we going to do about this?"  
轮到真嗣瞪大眼睛盯着那不可思议的事物了。“A-明日香...我们该怎么办？”

"How should I know? Ugh, Misato's going to tell Blondie about this when she notices, and then Blondie's going to call us in so she can poke and prod us and measure our brains again and God knows what else."  
“我怎么知道？唉，美里一旦注意到这事，肯定会告诉那个金发女，然后她就会把我们叫去，又是戳又是测，还要检查我们的大脑，天知道还有什么。”

### [Chapter 24](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17598851/chapters/109015074): Dappled  
第二十四章：斑驳光影

### Chapter Text 正文

Misato's gaze flicked from side to side as she ate her breakfast. For some reason, Shinji had taken his breakfast past the dance mats to the beanbag closest to the window, while Asuka was in the dining chair closest to the cooker and sink. "You're supposed to be doing everything _together_, you two." She paused, and noticed little dark patches growing in at the base of Asuka's hair. A tease sprang to her lips. "Asuka, your roots are show—"  
美里一边吃着早餐，一边左右打量。不知为何，真嗣把早餐端到了离窗户最近的豆袋沙发上，而明日香则坐在离炉子和水槽最近的餐椅上。“你们俩应该一起行动才对。”她顿了顿，注意到明日香发根处渐渐长出了深色的小斑点。她差点脱口而出：“明日香，你的发根露出来了——”

No, wait. Asuka was genuinely a redhead. Misato knew that from her time in Germany.  
不对，等等。明日香确实是红发。美里从她在德国的时候就知道这一点。

Asuka looked... scared? "Don't tell Dr Akagi, all right? She'll just insist on poking and prodding at us both."  
明日香看起来...害怕吗？“别告诉赤木博士，好吗？她只会坚持对我们俩进行各种检查。”

Misato pinched the bridge of her nose. She did _not_ need this, not when the pilots had a training exercise to complete. "If you post good scores from your training today, I'll leave it be until after the Angel is dealt with."  
美里捏了捏鼻梁。她不需要这个，尤其是在驾驶员们还有训练任务要完成的时候。“如果你们今天训练成绩好，我就暂时不管，等处理完使徒再说。”

Asuka frowned. "What if it's his fault?"  
明日香皱眉。“如果这是他的错呢？”

Misato began to doubt the wisdom of skipping her morning beer. "If there's any poking and prodding to be done she'll probably want both of you in the lab anyway."  
美里开始怀疑自己早上没喝啤酒的决定是否明智。“如果有任何检查和测试要做，她可能会要求你们两个都在实验室里。”

Asuka's grip on her fork tightened, but she nodded. "Fine. Hear that, Shinji? If you mess up today the blonde is going to start poking us to find out what's up with my hair."  
明日香握紧了手中的叉子，但还是点了点头。“好吧。听到了吗，真嗣？如果你今天搞砸了，那个金发女郎就会开始对我们进行检查，看看我的头发到底怎么了。”

"Same if _you_ mess up," he snapped back.  
“你搞砸也一样，”他立刻回敬道。

"Hmph." "哼。"

Misato sighed and shook her head. She needed to get away before they drove her any crazier. She stood up, leaving her omelette half eaten, and grabbed the last piece of toast from the rack. "Work together, you two. We're counting on you."  
美里叹了口气，摇了摇头。她需要离开，以免他们把她逼得更疯。她站起身，留下半吃的煎蛋卷，从架子上抓起最后一片吐司。“你们俩好好合作，我们可指望你们了。”

Asuka watched Misato heading into the front hall, and waited for the sounds of the front door. "Get over here," she ordered, when she was sure Misato had gone.  
明日香看着美里走向前厅，等待着前门的声音。“过来这里，”她命令道，确信美里已经离开。

"Why?" asked Shinji. “为什么？” 真嗣问道。

She glared at him. "You know why, ..." No. Calling him an idiot wouldn't actually help.  
她瞪着他。“你知道为什么，...”不，叫他白痴并不能真正解决问题。

He smiled a little and got up from the beanbag. Asuka gritted her teeth as the emptiness became more intrusive with every step he took. She was _not_ going to look weak in front of him.  
他微微一笑，从豆袋椅上站了起来。随着他每走一步，空虚感愈发强烈，这让明日香咬紧了牙关。她绝不会在他面前显得软弱。

He took the seat closest to her and laid his hand on the table. She looked down at it, weighing up her options, and laid her hand down on top of his. Nobody was watching to misinterpret it, after all. Finishing her breakfast one-handed was annoying, but it was worth it to not feel that emptiness nagging and gnawing away inside.  
他坐在离她最近的位子上，把手放在桌上。她低头看着他的手，权衡着各种选择，最终将自己的手放在了他的手上面。毕竟，没有人会看到这一幕而误解什么。用一只手吃完早餐虽然有些麻烦，但为了不再感受到内心那股空虚的啃噬，这一切都是值得的。

Shinji smiled at her. Why did he have to do that? It was like he wanted to make things complicated. _She_ wasn't going to smile back at him, that was for sure. Even if touching his hand made life easier to handle.  
真嗣朝她微笑。他为什么要这么做？仿佛他想要把事情弄得复杂。她肯定不会对他回以微笑。尽管触碰他的手让生活变得更容易应对。

Even if her stupid muscles twitched the corners of her mouth up. That was just because it felt odd to feel his smile clashing with her straight face.  
即使她那愚蠢的肌肉让嘴角不自觉地上扬。那只是因为感受到他的笑容与她严肃的表情相冲突，感觉有些奇怪罢了。

"Those mats are too close together," she declared, when she'd finished her breakfast.  
“那些垫子挨得太近了，”她吃完早餐后宣布道。

He looked over at them, then nodded. "We can't rearrange them, though. It's the only way they'll fit."  
他朝那边看了看，然后点点头。“不过我们没法重新排列它们。这是唯一能让它们放下的方式。”

She took a deep breath. She had an idea. She didn't want to say it. Even if they both knew the reason for it, and it didn't mean anything, it would sound like something some sappy girl would be asking her boyfriend.  
她深吸了一口气。她有个主意。她不想说出口。即使他们都知道原因，而且这并不意味着什么，但听起来就像某个多愁善感的女孩在向她的男朋友提出请求。

"We'll just have to put up with it," he said. "I guess we can make contact between stints."  
"我们只能忍受这一点，" 他说。"我想我们可以在休息间隙联系。"

Bastard. Who gave him permission to phrase it better than she was trying to?! "Yes. No funny business."  
混蛋。谁允许他说得比她试图表达的还要好？！ "是的。别搞怪。"

"No funny business." "别搞怪。"

Rei found her feelings about the day _mixed_.  
丽发现她对这一天的感觉颇为复杂。

In its favour, her clothes were tolerable against her skin. She would not be in danger of damaging them in her haste when she got home and undressed.  
值得庆幸的是，她的衣服贴在皮肤上还算舒适。回家后急忙脱下时，也不至于因匆忙而损坏它们。

On the other hand, she was still more alert than she needed to be in Nebukawa-sensei's class, and she did not have the fascinating phenomenon of Asuka and Shinji's souls to hold her interest.  
另一方面，她在椙河老师的课上仍然比平时更加警觉，而且也没有明日香和真嗣灵魂的奇异现象来吸引她的注意力。

An idea occurred to her. It would mean spending more of the day clothed, but it might give her an opportunity to observe Shinji and Asuka some more. She typed a message. "Horaki-san, do you need someone to deliver Shinji and Asuka's work to them?"  
她突然有了个主意。这意味着她需要多穿些衣服度过这一天，但这或许能让她有更多机会观察真嗣和明日香。她打了一条信息。" Horaki-san, do you need someone to deliver Shinji and Asuka's work to them? "

"I was going to send Suzuhara-kun but if you want to, you can."

Rei couldn't help smiling.  
绫波不禁微笑起来。

### Chapter Text 正文

Hi, grommile here. 嗨，我是 grommile。

Thank you for coming with me on this journey. Your comments have encouraged me, but sadly, I remain profoundly dissatisfied with how I have written this story. It will be left to stand as it is, flawed and unfinished, because I am too conscious of its foundations of sand to keep building on it in its current form.  
感谢你与我一同踏上这段旅程。你的评论给予了我鼓励，但遗憾的是，我仍深感对这部作品的写作方式不满。它将保持现状，缺陷重重且未完成，因为我太过清楚其沙基般的根基，无法在当前形式上继续构建。

The first chapter of a new attempt at the core narrative, provisionally titled _Defensive Design_, will be posted in the next few days.  
新尝试的核心叙事第一章，暂定名为《防御性设计》，将在接下来几天内发布。

Thank you again for your support, and I hope to see you there!  
再次感谢你的支持，期待在那里与你相见！
