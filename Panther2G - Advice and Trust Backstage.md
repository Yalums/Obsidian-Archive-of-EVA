[Panther2G](https://fanfiction.net/u/4474090/)

Sometimes, when I need to do something a little silly, or the idea for some scenes present themselves, I have the characters step back from the 'set' for a bit, and see what's going on 'behind the camera'. What began as some random comedy bits has become a big enough parallel story in A&T that I thought it was time to post them here… especially since the 2017 A&T Christmas Special hit 5200 words, all written on Christmas Eve.  
有时候，当我需要做点小蠢事，或是某些场景的点子浮现时，我会让角色们暂时离开“片场”，去看看“镜头背后”发生了什么。这些起初只是些随性的喜剧片段，如今在《A&T》中已发展成足够庞大的平行故事，我觉得是时候将它们发布于此了……尤其是 2017 年的《A&T 圣诞特辑》在圣诞夜写到了 5200 字。

And keep in mind, one of the main jokes I started and ran with is the 'actors' playing each part are usually as different as possible from their characters in the 'show': Shinji's a quietly confident young man who has a great relationship with his parents, Asuka's a shy ingénue off-stage, Rei is an extroverted social butterfly, Gendo is a laid back cool dad and the most friendly member of the cast, and so on…  
记住，我最初并一直延续的主要笑点之一是，扮演每个角色的'演员'通常与他们在'剧中'的角色截然不同：真嗣是一个自信内敛的年轻人，与父母关系良好，明日香在台下是个害羞的新人，绫波则是外向的社交蝴蝶，碇源堂是个随和的酷爸爸，也是剧组中最友好的成员，以此类推……

Actually… Gendo is pretty much The Dude from The Big Lebowski.  
实际上……碇源堂几乎就是《谋杀绿脚趾》里的那个家伙。

Hey, I'm stuck in Baghdad and 6723.19 miles from my family, (yes, I checked) so why not?  
嘿，我被困在巴格达和离家 6723.19 英里（没错，我查过了）的地方，那为什么不呢？

We're up to 10 Backstage segments now, though the early ones are short.  
我们已经制作了 10 期后台花絮，尽管早期的那些比较简短。

In the meantime, enjoy!  
在此期间，尽情享受吧！

Filming a major series like Advice & Trust is hard work, but the dedicated crew of actors make it happen. But from the wild social butterfly playing Rei Ayanami to the globetrotting adventurer playing Gendo Ikari, things can get a little strange. These are the true stories of what goes on behind the scenes and between takes at Avalon Studios…  
拍摄像《建议与信任》这样的大型系列剧是一项艰巨的工作，但敬业的演员团队使之成为可能。从扮演绫波零的社交蝴蝶到扮演碇源堂的环球冒险家，事情有时会变得有点奇怪。这些是阿瓦隆工作室幕后和拍摄间隙的真实故事……

### Backstage #1 - Griping  
后台篇 #1 - 抱怨

Rei: "Man, I hate doing some of these comedy omakes. I always come off sounding like a total space-case. Or worse, like I'm obsessing over the new guy. I mean, he does have a great ass, but still..."  
丽：“天啊，我讨厌做这些喜剧番外。我总是听起来像个完全的怪人。或者更糟，好像我对新来的家伙着迷了。我是说，他的确有很棒的屁股，但还是……”

Asuka: "Hey, you liked doing the Heartwarming one. Or all the 'We Can't Post This Here!' ones for the 'Israfel Special AU!'."  
明日香：“嘿，你喜欢做那个温馨的番外。还有所有那些‘我们不能在这里发！’的‘伊斯拉斐尔特别 AU’篇。”

Rei: "Oh yeah, I loved those. Especially the rehearsals." :-3  
丽：“哦，是啊，我超喜欢那些。尤其是排练的时候。” :-3

Shinji: "Am I going to have to take more vitamin E tonight?"  
真嗣：“今晚我是不是得多吃点维生素 E？”

Asuka: "Like you're complaining?"  
明日香：“好像你还有意见似的？”

Shinji: "Do I look stupid?"  
真嗣：“我看起来很傻吗？”

Asuka: "Not yet, but I can guarantee you're gonna have one of those 'ahegao's by tonight!"  
明日香：“现在还不傻，但我敢保证你今晚会有那种‘啊嘿颜’！”

Shinji: "I love this project..."  
真嗣：“我喜欢这个项目……”

Elsewhere:

Ritsuko: "We can't film this next part! Me and Maya chasing Rei with tranq guns while she terrifies Aoba in a closet? GreggHL's going to sue!"  
律子：“我们不能拍下一场戏！我和玛雅拿着麻醉枪追零，而她在衣柜里吓唬青叶？GreggHL 会起诉我们的！”

Fuyutsuki: "At least you've got a part. The way things are going, I'm half worried I'm going to end up shipped with the Commander."  
冬月：“至少你还有角色。照这样发展下去，我一半担心自己会和司令官配对。”

Hyuga: "...MY EYES! I CAN'T UNSEE IT!"  
日向：“……我的眼睛！我无法直视了！”

Gendo: "My character would say 'Fuck all y'all', but I'm just going to put out the sandwiches I made for everyone and pack another bowl. Anyone want a hit?" ~~bong gurgles~~  
源度：“我这角色会说‘去你们的’，但我还是给大家端上我做的三明治，再装一斗烟吧。有人想来一口吗？”烟斗咕噜作响

Aoba: ~~takes the bong, does a hit~~ "Dude, you are so much more chill than your character." ~~coughs~~  
青叶：接过烟斗，吸了一口，“伙计，你可比你那角色随和多了。”咳嗽起来

Gendo: "I know, I'm awesome. Who wants chips?"  
源度：“我知道，我超棒的。谁要吃薯片？”

---

### Backstage #2 - Rei & Kaworu

Meanwhile, backstage: 与此同时，后台：

Rei: "I hate it when the Director demands we 'Be Funny! Camera's running!'. Jerk."  
丽：“我讨厌导演要求我们‘要搞笑！摄像机开着呢！’。混蛋。”

Kaworu: "You're grumpy. Usually the end of the day's shooting means you're all happy and stuff. Then you grab me or Shinji or Asuka or a combination of us and drag us off to your trailer for 'rehearsals'. What's the matter?"  
薰：“你心情不好。通常一天的拍摄结束时，你都会很开心。然后你会抓住我、真嗣、明日香或者我们中的几个，把我们拖到你的拖车里去‘排练’。怎么了？”

Rei: "That scene he just made us do, that's what! Fuck, that was depressing! I hate it when he makes me cry just from reading the script! God, I want a drink or something."  
丽：“他刚刚让我们演的那场戏，就是那个！妈的，太压抑了！我讨厌他只凭剧本就能让我哭出来！天啊，我想喝点什么。”

Gendo: ~~walks by, puffing on a huge joint. Hands another one, already lit, to Rei~~ "Relax, babe. You're too cute to get worry lines so young. Enjoy being 18, young, and surrounded by hot people!"  
源渡：一边走过，一边抽着一根大麻烟。递给丽另一根已经点燃的，“放松点，宝贝。你这么可爱，这么年轻就别皱眉了。享受 18 岁的青春，年轻，被帅哥美女环绕吧！”

Rei: ~~takes a deep hit~~ "Oh, God, thank you, Gendo. I love you. You always have the most dank sticky icky."  
丽：深深吸了一口，“哦，天啊，谢谢你，源渡。我爱你。你总是有最棒的顶级货。”

Gendo: "I know, I'm the shit. Remember: 'Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head'." ~~sage nod~~  
源渡：“我知道，我超厉害的。记住：‘努力工作是好的，努力工作是妙的，但首先得照顾好脑袋。’” 贤者点头

Kaworu: "...that was Bob Marley. You just quoted Bob Marley at us like it was Zen."  
渚薰：“……那是鲍勃·马利。你刚刚用鲍勃·马利的名言像是在引用禅语一样对我们说。”

Gendo: "At least it was in English?"  
源渡：“至少那是用英语说的？”

Kaworu: "Aren't we theoretically speaking Japanese?"  
渚薰：“我们理论上不是在说日语吗？”

Gendo: "Fuck if I know, dude. I'm so baked it could be Esperanto for all I can tell." ~~takes a drag on the joint~~  
碇源堂：“鬼知道，老兄。我嗨得不行，就算是世界语我也听不出来。” 吸了一口大麻烟

Kaworu: "I have no idea how you manage to do all your scenes like that."  
渚薰：“我真不知道你是怎么做到在那种状态下完成所有场景的。”

Gendo: "Why do you think I'm always wearing those sunglasses? My eyes are so red most of the time, I look like I'm about to start crying blood."  
源渡：“你以为我为什么总戴着那副墨镜？我的眼睛大部分时间红得吓人，看起来就像要哭出血来。”

Rei: "Aww yeah, it's kickin' in... I feel more mellow already."  
丽：“哦耶，感觉来了...我现在感觉更平静了。”

Aoba: "Miss Ayanami! Miss Ayanami! The Director needs you two back on set right away! He's got some more pages to shoot."  
青叶：“绫波小姐！绫波小姐！导演需要你们俩立刻回到片场！他还有几页要拍。”

Rei: ~~coughs out a lungful of Acapulco Gold~~ "...aw fuck. This is going to be a weird scene. I'm already feeling a buzz comin' on..."  
"丽：咳出一口阿卡普尔科黄金'...我操。这场景要变得诡异了。我已经感觉到有点飘飘然了...'”

Kaworu: "Damn it. The last time this happened, she kept giggling in the middle of when she was supposed to be mad at me, and 'booping' my nose instead of slapping me."  
"薰：“该死。上次发生这种事时，她本该生我气的时候却一直在笑，还用‘戳’我鼻子代替了打我。””

Gendo: "Aw, yeah, that one was awesome! Totally goin' in the blooper reel. Like the time I pantsed Fuyutsuki right before we shot the first battle scene in Central Dogma! Tighty-whities, who knew?"  
"碇源堂：“啊，没错，那次真棒！绝对要放进花絮里。就像那次在中央教条区拍摄第一场战斗场景前，我把冬月裤子扒了的那一幕！紧身内裤，谁猜得到呢？””

Rei: "C'mon, Rainbow Trout. If I gotta shoot another scene while stoned, I'm gonna at least get some good snogging in."  
丽：“来吧，彩虹鳟鱼。如果我得在嗑药状态下再拍一场戏，至少得让我亲热一番。”

Kaworu: "Rei, there's not supposed to be any making out in this scene. We just had a tense, emotionally draining conversation, remember?"  
薰：“丽，这场戏里不应该有亲吻的情节。我们刚刚经历了一场紧张、情感耗尽的对话，记得吗？”

Rei: "Hey, bigshot Director calls us back in after he told us we were done for the day, he gets me in full 'I wanna snog' mode and takes his chances. 'Sides, are you complaining?"  
丽：“嘿，大牌导演在我们被告知今天收工后把我们叫回去，让我进入‘我想亲热’的状态，他就得承担风险。再说了，你在抱怨吗？”

Kaworu: "You know what? You're right." ~~takes the joint from Rei, takes a big hit, and hands it back to Gendo~~ "Alright!" ~~cough, cough, cough~~ "Let's do this shit!"  
渚薰：“你知道吗？你说得对。”从绫波手里接过烟，深深吸了一口，然后递还给碇司令，“好！”咳，咳，咳，“咱们干吧！”

### Backstage #3 - Mari Makinami, PA  
后台 #3 - 真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯，PA

The young, handsome Eva Pilot on the roof had no idea what was about to hit him. The predator stalking him was too fast, too good, too _hot_ to be evaded. Her parachute swept swiftly downward, swooping in like a sexy, skirt-clad hawk.  
屋顶上那位年轻英俊的 EVA 驾驶员完全不知道即将发生什么。潜伏在他身后的猎手速度太快，技巧太高，魅力太强，无法躲避。她的降落伞迅速向下扫过，宛如一只身着短裙的性感鹰隼般俯冲而来。

The young man had only a half-second to look up, his eyes widening and jaw dropping before the hottest girl he'd ever seen plowed right into him, chest-first.  
年轻人只有半秒钟的时间抬头，眼睛睁大，下巴掉下，紧接着他见过的最火辣的女孩就直冲他而来，胸口先撞上了他。

The lithe, be-stockinged woman was rather pleased she was so on-target, and didn't mind at all the feeling of wrapping her legs around him for a second. The landing did bounce her stylish red-framed glasses off her face, though. They clattered to a landing near her as she popped the parachute's harness off. Figuring the young man would be staring at this beauteous creature that had just fallen on him from Heaven, she made sure to arch her back and point her toned, athletic rear at him while she hunted for her glasses. Soon, she'd have him right under her hands, and she'd-  
这位身姿轻盈、穿着长筒袜的女子颇为得意自己的准确无误，丝毫不介意双腿环绕他片刻的感觉。不过，着陆时她的时尚红色边框眼镜确实从脸上弹飞了。眼镜在她解开降落伞背带时叮当作响地落在她身边。她猜想这位年轻人定会盯着这位刚从天而降的美人儿发愣，于是特意挺直腰背，将她那健美、运动型的臀部对着他，同时寻找眼镜。很快，她就能将他完全掌控在手，她会——

Asuka: "**Mari**! Where's my lunch?!"  
明日香：“真希波！我的午饭呢？！”

Mari: ~~dropping her notebook in surprise~~ "Ah! Um! Er, Miss Soryu! I was...was just on my way to get it!"  
玛丽：惊讶地掉落笔记本 "啊！呃！嗯，丽人小姐！我正……正要去拿它！"

Asuka: "...I told you I'd be back off set in 45 minutes, and to have my lunch ready. You're _supposed_ to be my Personal Assistant, remember? Not... are you writing your stupid fanfic again?"  
明日香：“……我告诉过你我会在 45 分钟后离开片场，并准备好我的午餐。你应该是我的私人助理，记得吗？不是……你又在写你那愚蠢的同人文了吗？”

Mari: "N-no, of course not! Ahahah! Why would I do that?" ~~tries to hide the notebook~~  
玛丽：“不-不，当然没有！哈哈哈！我怎么会做那种事呢？”试图藏起笔记本

Asuka: ~~glaring at the notebook in Mari's lap~~ "You totally were, weren't you? That stuff is terrible! You're always making your obvious self-insert such a Mary Sue!"  
明日香：瞪着真希波膝上的笔记本“你绝对是这样，对吧？那些内容糟透了！你总是把你的明显自设弄得像个玛丽苏！”

Mari: "I was not! And Miss Illustrious is _not_ a Mary Sue! She's just hot and awesome and all the boys like her and she's the best Pilot and... and..."  
真希波：“我没有！而且光辉小姐才不是玛丽苏！她只是又辣又棒，所有男生都喜欢她，她是最棒的驾驶员，而且……而且……”

Asuka: ~~just stares at Mari and taps her foot~~  
明日香：只是盯着真希波，脚尖轻敲地面

Mari: "...I'll go get your lunch, ma'am."  
真希：“……我去给您拿午餐，女士。”

Asuka: "You go do that. I've got a scene with Misato and Ritsuko in an hour, and I am not doing that on an empty stomach. I swear, that fake-blonde can't do _one_ scene without forgetting a line. She's going to make it take all afternoon. And if you see that sexy boyfriend of mine, tell him I'll be in my trailer."  
明日香：“你去吧。我一小时后要和美里还有律子拍一场戏，空着肚子可不行。我发誓，那个假金发连一场戏都记不住台词。她会拖到整个下午的。要是你看到我那性感的男朋友，告诉他我在拖车里。”

Mari: "Yes, ma'am." ~~skitters off towards the catering trucks~~ ~~muttering~~ "...I'm totally putting a scene in the next chapter where I steal your Eva and do _awesome, cool things_ with it that not even you can do! Like a secret backdoor codeword only I know to access the super-power mode! Yeah, that's it! And I save the day and get Shinji's attention!"  
真希：“是，女士。”一边朝餐饮车跑去，一边嘀咕着，“……我一定要在下一章加个情节，偷走你的 EVA，做些连你都做不到的超酷事情！比如只有我知道的秘密后门密码，能启动超级模式！没错！然后我拯救了世界，吸引了真嗣的注意！”

Asuka: ~~shouting after her~~ "And quit trying to sneak pages of your story into the script! An Angel that's nothing but bones? That was ridiculous!"  
明日香：冲着她喊道 "别再偷偷往剧本里塞你的故事页了！一个全是骨头的使徒？太荒谬了！"

Mari: ~~mutter mutter mutter~~ "My legs look better in a skirt..."  
真希波：嘀咕着 "我的腿穿裙子更好看..."

### Backstage #4 - Naughtilus

"And a double Knob Creek on the rocks. Make it snappy. I've got a headache," The Director growled at him. On the set in front of him, Rei and Kaworu kept breaking into giggles every time their eyes met.  
"再来一杯双份的 Knob Creek 加冰。快点。我头疼，" 导演对他咆哮道。在他面前的片场上，绫波和渚每次眼神交汇都会忍不住笑出声来。

The tall, relatively lean Production Assistant nodded tiredly. "Yessir." He turned to the short bird sitting in the chair next to the Director. "And you, Mr. Pen Pen?"  
那位高挑而相对瘦削的制作助理疲惫地点了点头。“是的，先生。”他转向坐在导演旁边椅子上的短腿企鹅。“那么你呢，Pen Pen 先生？”

The hot-springs penguin waved a flipper at him. "My usual, Naughtilus. And stop and get me some decent tuna sushi on the way, I'm feeling peckish," he said without looking up from his copy of _The Times_. The crossword puzzle was mostly filled out. He somehow put a pen back behind where he didn't even have an ear, then rubbed the chin he didn't have either.  
温泉企鹅朝他挥了挥鳍。“照旧，Naughtilus。顺便在路上给我带点像样的金枪鱼寿司，我有点饿了。”他头也不抬地从《泰晤士报》上说。填字游戏已经差不多完成了。他不知怎么地把笔放回了连耳朵都没有的地方，然后揉了揉同样不存在的下巴。

The Director threw a prop pillow at the pair on set. "Goddamit, you two!" he roared at the two still snickering in the set of Rei's bedroom. "Go make out behind the set for a minute, whatever it takes to stop you from breaking into giggles every time we try to shoot this scene! We're a week behind shooting schedule!"  
导演朝片场上的两人扔了一个道具枕头。“该死的，你们两个！”他对着还在丽卧室布景中窃笑的两人咆哮道。“去布景后面亲热一下，不管用什么方法，只要能让你们不再每次拍摄这个场景时都笑出声来！我们的拍摄进度已经落后一周了！”

"No, no, we got this! Really!" Kaworu said, smothering the last of his chortling. "Right, Rei?"  
"不，不，我们搞得定！真的！" 渚薰说着，压下了最后一丝窃笑。"对吧，绫波？"

"Hee hee AHEM! Ok, yeah, we're good!" She took one last drag on the her 'cigarette' and flicked it off to the side, neatly nailing a trash can full of shredded scraps of paper, which promptly caught fire.  
"嘻嘻咳咳！好吧，没错，我们没问题！" 她又吸了一口手中的'香烟'，然后潇洒地弹到一旁，准确地命中了一个装满碎纸的垃圾桶，随即垃圾桶便燃起了火。

"I see Miss Makinami latest attempt to 'improve' the master script has been caught and intercepted?" Pen Pen said dryly, his Oxford accent adding an arch note to the inquiry.  
"看来玛基纳小姐最近试图'改进'主剧本的尝试又被截获了？" 企鹅 Pen Pen 干巴巴地说道，他那牛津口音给这句问话增添了一丝嘲讽的意味。

The Director nodded, wincing. "This time it was some garbage about her sniping robots from orbit while she's falling in reentry or something. Who has Evas flying around in space? What does she think this is, some Gundam knock-off? Fortunately, we have plenty of expendable interns and PAs to stand guard." He waved at the retreating PA. "He's still kinda weird. His shirt is giving me a headache."  
导演点点头，皱了皱眉。“这次她又在胡扯什么从轨道上狙击机器人，同时还在重返大气层什么的。谁家的 EVA 会在太空里飞来飞去？她以为这是什么，高达的山寨版吗？幸好我们有的是可以牺牲的实习生和助理来站岗。”他朝远去的助理挥了挥手。“他还是有点怪。他的衬衫让我头疼。”

.

.

"So tired... no sleep... Mari will eat me..." the tall PA mumbled, slouching half-awake towards the catering area cum bar at the far end of the cavernous set warehouse.  
“好累啊……没睡觉……真希波会吃了我的……”高个子助理喃喃自语，半睡半醒地朝巨大的摄影棚远端的餐饮区兼酒吧走去。

Narrowed eyes behind red-rimmed glasses watched him go past from the shadows. It had been a difficult week getting her scenes added to the shooting script. The Director was getting canny to her usual tricks, and Miss Soryu had kept her occupied nearly every moment with task after task. Still, she persevered! Her great works must be seen to the world! She would make this project _even better_ by adding her parts! At least, Mister Ikari the Younger hadn't seemed to mind the one time she'd trick-AHEM... suggested and they'd run through a rough version of the part where she introduced her character to him chest and thighs first. It had been going great until Miss Soryu had...um... caught her.  
红色边框眼镜后，一双狭长的眼睛从阴影中注视着他走过。这一周为了将自己的戏份加入拍摄剧本，她可谓费尽周折。导演对她惯用的伎俩越来越警觉，而索留小姐几乎每时每刻都用任务缠住她。尽管如此，她依然坚持不懈！她的伟大作品必须让世人看到！她将通过加入自己的部分使这个项目更加出色！至少，年轻的碇先生似乎并不介意她那次巧妙地...咳咳...提议，并且他们粗略地排练了她先以胸部和大腿向他介绍自己角色的那场戏。一切都很顺利，直到索留小姐...呃...撞见了她。

But still! Setbacks were for overcoming! And now the guards had been worn down and distracted. And now, though her first draft was currently on fire, she had a backup set ready! And some _more_ scenes, with her blowing the head off a rogue Eva and looking awesome! Yes!  
但即便如此！挫折是为了克服的！现在守卫们已经疲惫分心。而且，尽管她的第一稿目前正在燃烧，但她已经准备好了备份！还有更多场景，包括她击毙一台失控的 EVA 并显得酷炫无比的镜头！没错！

She stealthily moved from shadow to shadow, and unseen, undetectable ghost in the background. She made it to within sight of the master script book, laying in the open on a table near the middle of the planning area. No one was in sight. Perfect! She scooted closer, and began flipping through the pages still to be shot, looking for a good spot to insert her-  
她悄无声息地在阴影间移动，如同背景中一个无形无迹的幽灵。她成功接近了那本主剧本，它就摊开放在规划区中央的一张桌子上。四周空无一人。完美！她悄悄挪近，开始翻阅那些尚未拍摄的页码，寻找一个合适的插入点——

"Whatcha doin'?"

Mari Illustrious Makinami, future superstar and great author, did _not_ spring into the air with a startled shriek, flailing her arms as she spun around. It just looked that way to the uninitiated. "WhatwhowhereIwasn'tdoinganythingMissSoryu!"  
未来巨星兼伟大作家真希波·真理·真希波，并没有惊跳起来尖叫，也没有挥舞手臂转圈。在外行人看来，她只是显得有些慌张。“什么哪里我什么都没做草薙小姐！”

The young girl with the blue kerchief staring at her just blinked. "I'm Sakura Suzuhara! Are you in the tv show?" she introduced herself cheerfully.  
那位戴着蓝色头巾的年轻女孩只是眨了眨眼，然后愉快地自我介绍：“我是铃原樱！你是在拍电视剧吗？”

"Sakura Su-" Mari looked nervously around. The stoic, erudite, and entirely too muscular and strong other Suzuhara was nowhere in sight. "Are... shouldn't you be with your big brother? I didn't know you were allowed to run around without him." If he wasn't here, that was fine with Mari. The classically-trained and wickedly intelligent young man was #1 the only guy who could keep up with Pen Pen and Fuyutsuki when the frequent philosophical discussions sprang up, and #2 had a very low tolerance for Mari's messin- _improving_ the script.  
"樱华介——" 真希波紧张地环顾四周。那位冷静、博学，且肌肉过于发达、力量过人的另一苏哈拉却不见踪影。"你...不应该和你哥哥在一起吗？我不知道你可以在没有他的情况下四处乱跑。"如果他不在这里，真希波倒是无所谓。这位受过古典训练、极其聪明的年轻人是#1 唯一一个能在频繁的哲学讨论中跟上企鹅和冬月的人，#2 他对真希波的捣乱——改进剧本——容忍度很低。

"Big brother is off with his fiancée looking at boring books on fabric patterns or something," the young girl complained. "Whatcha doin'?"  
"哥哥和他的未婚妻去看那些无聊的关于织物图案的书了，"小女孩抱怨道。"你在做什么？"

"I'm... just helping out with the script," Mari said, an innocent smile on her face. Behind her, her hands resumed sliding new pages into place in the book. "It needed a little something extra to-"  
"我...只是在帮忙修改剧本，"真希波脸上带着无辜的微笑说。在她身后，她的手继续将新页滑入书中的位置。"它需要一点额外的——"

"My big brother says you're not supposed to do that, I think. I'm gonna tell."  
"我大哥说你不该那么做，我觉得。我要去告状。"

"No no no no, don't do that!" Mari waved her hands. "I'll... I'll... um... hey! Do _you_ want to be in the TV show?"  
"不不不不，别那样！" 玛丽挥着手。"我...我...呃...嘿！你想不想上电视节目？"

The young girl looked warily interested. "...keep talkin'."  
小女孩看起来既警惕又感兴趣。"...继续说。"

.

.

The Director looked down at the page, back up at the set, and back at the page again. "When did _she_ get a part? Who built this set? Who names a ship the _AAA Wunder_? What the _fuck_ is going on in this scene? Why is Miss Suzuhara suddenly listed as 'totally a grown up, like 22 and everything!'?"  
导演低头看着剧本，又抬头看向布景，再次低头看剧本。“她什么时候拿到角色的？这布景是谁搭的？谁会给船起名叫 AAA 奇迹号？这幕戏到底在搞什么鬼？为什么铃原小姐突然被标注为‘完全是个成年人，像 22 岁什么的’！”

"...why am I suddenly a fucking _pirate_?" Asuka growled. "I don't care how cute this hat is, I want to know why I suddenly need to borrow costume gear from the gottverdammten _Pirates of the Caribbean_ set!"  
“...为什么我突然变成该死的 pirate 了？”明日香咆哮道，“我不管这帽子有多可爱，我想知道为什么我突然需要从《加勒比海盗》片场借服装道具！”

The Director pulled off his hat and smacked himself in the face with it. "Naughtilus, I'm going to have you fed to Zeruel for this. You had _one_ job!"  
导演摘下帽子，用它拍了拍自己的脸。“纳特尼尔，我要把你喂给 Zeruel。你只有一项任务！”

"He's just a animatronic set, right?" the PA asked nervously. "Haha, this is a joke, right?"  
"他只是个机器人套装，对吧？" 助理紧张地问道。"哈哈，这是个玩笑，对吧？"

"And he hates funny t-shirts," Pen Pen put in. He blew a puff of smoke out of his pipe.  
"而且他讨厌有趣的 T 恤，" 企鹅 Pen Pen 插话道。他从烟斗中吹出一口烟雾。

Naughtilus gulped. "I'm dead."

### Backstage #5 - You Can (Not) Sober Up  
后台 #5 - 你无法清醒

"Psssst."

Gendo looked up from lighting the next bowl. He took a deep drag first, though. Never hurt to have a little more, be a bit more mellow, when meeting new people. This was new people, right? Wait, he needed to look at them first to find out.  
源堂从点燃下一个烟斗中抬起头来。他先深深吸了一口。在见新人时，多一点，更放松些，总没坏处。这是新人，对吧？等等，他需要先看看他们才能确定。

"Hello? Whozzat?" he inquired carefully. "This is for personal use, officer," he added as a just-in-case.  
“喂？谁在那儿？”他小心翼翼地问道。“这是私人用途，警官，”他补充了一句，以防万一。

"Down here," the voice whispered from somewhere above him.  
“在这下面，”声音从他上方某处低语道。

Gendo thought for a moment, then looked up. "Hah, you can't fool me, you're not to my left!"  
碇源堂沉思片刻，然后抬头说道：“哈，你骗不了我，你不在我的左边！”

Mari Makinami looked down at him from her perch among the lighting racks over the Central Dogma set. "Man, you _are_ stoned. Ok, quick, I've sent that PA and his new assistant chasing Sakura again. They think she's got some more of my script pages. They don't know those are right _here_!" Mari brandished a sheaf of papers."  
真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯从中央教条区布景上方的灯光架上俯视着他。“老兄，你真是醉了。好吧，快点，我已经让那个 PA 和他的新助手再次去追樱了。他们以为她拿了我的剧本页。他们不知道这些就在这儿！”真希波挥舞着一叠纸张。

"So what's she got?" Gendo chased the key mystery.  
“那她到底拿了什么？”碇源堂追问着关键谜团。

"Some Chinese takeout menus with Sakura's crayon embellishments."  
"一些带有樱花用蜡笔装饰的中餐外卖菜单。"

"Cool." Gendo took another hit. "Ok, two questions. #1, you want a hit of this? And #2, what are you showing me these pages for? I'm not in the next scene, as far as I know." He scratched at his head. "Well, as far as I can _remember_, anyhow. It's still Tuesday, right?"  
"酷。" 源渡又吸了一口。"好吧，两个问题。#1，你想来一口吗？#2，你给我看这些页码干嘛？据我所知，我并没有出现在下一个场景中。" 他挠了挠头。"嗯，至少我记得是这样。现在还是星期二，对吧？""

"Saturday."

"...fuck, I missed taco night!"  
"...该死，我错过了玉米卷之夜！""

Mari warily looked around for any lurking production assistants or Directors before uncurling from the lighting rack like a large cat and dropping nimbly to the floor, landing in a picture-perfect three-point crouch. Gendo would have been impressed if he hadn't been looking at an actual cat that had wandered across the far side of the set.  
玛丽警惕地环顾四周，寻找是否有潜伏的制作助理或导演，然后像一只大猫一样从灯光架上舒展开来，敏捷地跳到地板上，以一个完美的三点着陆姿势稳稳落地。如果碇源堂没有看到一只真正的猫从片场远端闲逛而过，他可能会对此印象深刻。

"Whoa... a cat..." Gendo looked back up. "Hey, where'd you go?"  
“哇...一只猫...”碇源堂抬头望去。“嘿，你去哪儿了？”

Mari tapped him on his left shoulder. "Er, I'm right here?"  
玛丽轻轻拍了拍他的左肩。“呃，我就在这儿啊？”

"Oh holy shit, you _are_ to my left! Whoa, I can predict the future!" Gendo exclaimed.  
"哦天哪，你在我左边！哇，我能预知未来了！" 源堂惊呼道。

"Ah, look, you're obviously a very... busy man. And I've got to get this stuff," she hefted a large bag in her left hand, "back to Miss Soryu's trailer in the next 20 minutes or she's going to notice I've been gone a suspiciously long time, even for getting this weird shopping list of hers."  
"啊，看样子你显然是个非常……忙碌的人。而我得把这些东西，" 她用左手提着一个大袋子，"在接下来的 20 分钟内送回丽小姐的拖车里，否则她会注意到我离开得太久了，即使是为了完成她那奇怪的购物清单。"

"Weird?"

"Indian takeout, 10m of silk rope, six candles, 8 D-Cell batteries, some matches, and a jar of salt blessed by a Eastern Orthodox Priest," Mari explained. "I have no idea why, but she was very insistent I go get all this for her _right_ away." Mari snorted. "She smelled like rum and I _know_ that super-hot boytoy of herrrrrrrrrrrrrr, I mean your handsome and intelligent son," she hastily corrected, "was already in her trailer with her. I think she just wanted me to go away. She _could_ have just let me have a break." Mari glanced to the side. "Ok, so maybe the last time I 'took a break' we shot that scene with me parachuting onto Shinji, but still..."  
"印度外卖，10 米丝绸绳，六根蜡烛，8 节 D 型电池，一些火柴，还有一瓶东正教神父祝福过的盐，" 玛丽解释道。"我不知道为什么，但她非常坚持要我立刻去给她买齐这些东西。" 玛丽哼了一声。"她身上有朗姆酒的味道，而且我知道她那个超级火辣的小男友，我是说你英俊聪明的儿子，" 她急忙纠正道，"已经在她的拖车里了。我觉得她只是想让我离开。她本可以让我休息一下的。" 玛丽瞥了一眼旁边。"好吧，也许上次我‘休息’时，我们拍了那场我跳伞降落在真嗣身上的戏，但即便如此……"

Gendo blinked. "She wanted all that in a hurry, smelled like rum, and was in her trailer with my son? All afternoon?"  
源堂眨了眨眼。“她急着要这些，闻起来像朗姆酒，还和我的儿子在她拖车里？整个下午？”

"Yeah."

"Man, that's my boy!" Gendo took another hit. "So, whatcha need me for? I've got the hook up, if you need," he said with a cough.  
“老兄，那可是我的儿子！”源堂又吸了一口。“所以，你需要我做什么？如果你需要，我有门路，”他咳嗽着说。

Mari grinned and held up the sheaf in her other hand. "I think you'll like these pages."  
真希咧嘴一笑，举起另一只手里的那叠纸。“我想你会喜欢这些页面的。”

"I dunno, the last time you said that, the Director said I wasn't allowed to take anymore from you. Even if scene with the giant exploding Rei head that cried blood was pretty metal. Or was that Yui's head? Uh, what was that supposed to symbolize, again?"  
"我不知道，上次你这么说，导演说我不能再从你那儿拿东西了。即便那个巨型爆炸的绫波头颅流血的场景确实很酷。还是那是唯的头？呃，那到底是要象征什么来着？"

Mari waved the sheaf at him. "It's too deep for you, don't worry about it," she said. "You'll get it after you sleep on it. Anyhow, you'll like this stuff. You get another scene with your son! And a way cool space-future visor. Way better than Kihl's!"  
玛丽挥动着手中的文件对他说：“这对你来说太深奥了，别担心。”她说，“睡一觉后你就会明白的。反正，你会喜欢这些东西的。你又有机会和你的儿子同框了！还有一个超酷的未来太空面罩。比基尔的好多了！”

"I'm in."

"Shinji."

"Father..." the young Pilot said tremulously, trying not to hunch over in the spotlight. The cavernous chamber housing the huge, steam hissing dome with EVA UNIT-13 stenciled across it was at the same time oppressively hot and humid, but still somehow left him chilled to the bone.  
"父亲……"年轻的驾驶员颤抖着说，努力不在聚光灯下蜷缩。这个巨大的洞穴里，装着印有 EVA UNIT-13 字样、蒸汽嘶嘶作响的圆顶，既闷热又潮湿，但不知为何仍让他感到彻骨的寒冷。

"You will Pilot Unit-13. You will do it with the Fifth Child," Gendo said ominously from within the beam of his own spotlight, on the balcony far above the hissing dome. A third spotlight snapped on behind Shinji, illuminating a smiling Kaworu Nagisa, who waved.  
"你将驾驶 13 号机。你将与第五适格者一同执行任务，" 源渡从上方遥远的阳台上，他的聚光灯束中阴沉地说道。第三束灯光在真嗣身后亮起，照亮了微笑着的渚薰，他挥了挥手。

"Father, I have questions!" Shinji found the nerve to speak up. "What happened to NERV? Why was Misato-san and the others fighting? What happened... to... everything."  
"父亲，我有问题！" 真嗣鼓起勇气开口，"NERV 发生了什么？为什么美里小姐和其他人在战斗？一切...都...怎么了。"

Gendo's way-cool space future visor glittered coldly in the spotlight's beam. "Shinji," Gendo said even more darkly. "Quit whining and get in the fucking giant robot."  
源渡那酷炫的未来太空面罩在聚光灯束中冷冷地闪烁。"真嗣，" 源渡更加阴沉地说，"别再抱怨了，快进那该死的巨型机器人里去。"

"CUT!" Director Strype threw his hat at the ground. "Gendo, that's not even the line! That's that same old memetic joke you keep throwing in the blooper reels! You do it in _every_ goddamn scene you and Shinji do together!"  
"CUT!" 导演斯特赖普把帽子扔到地上。"源堂，那根本不是台词！那是你一直塞在花絮里的老梗笑话！你和你儿子每场戏都要来这么一出！"

Gendo bent over, giggling helplessly. "I'm sorry, dude, I had to! That set up was _perfect_!" He pointed at the First, Third, and Fifth Children, all of whom were likewise cracking up at the far end of the set. "Look, I just killed it! Everyone's happy!"  
源堂弯下腰，忍不住笑了起来。"对不起，伙计，我忍不住！那个铺垫太完美了！"他指向第一、第三和第五适格者，他们都在片场另一头笑得前仰后合。"看，我这效果多好！大家都开心！"

"I don't want 'happy', I want what's in the bloody _script_! We are already three weeks behind the shooting schedule, and _what the Hell is that thing on your face?!"_  
"我要的不是'开心'，我要的是剧本里的内容！我们已经比拍摄计划落后三周了，你脸上那玩意儿又是什么鬼？！"

"My way-cool space future visor."  
"我超酷的未来太空护目镜。"

The Director's face was a study in shades of Wut. "What is this I don't even..." He scrubbed at his face. "Fine, you know? Whatever. Space future visor. Sure. Why not?"  
主任的脸色变幻莫测，简直是一幅‘我完全不懂’的表情。“这是什么鬼……我甚至……”他揉了揉脸。“好吧，你懂的？无所谓。太空未来护目镜。当然，为什么不呢？”

"_Way-cool_ space future visor."  
"超酷的未来太空护目镜。"

Strype gripped the copy of the script in his hands tighter and tighter until it squeaked, and slowly turned the color of Unit-02. "Going. To Murder. **Everyone**..."  
斯特莱普紧握着手中的剧本副本，越来越用力，直到它发出吱吱声，颜色也慢慢变成了零二号机的色调。“要杀。光所有人……”

"You look like you need some of Uncle Gendo's Special Medicine," Gendo said, nodding sagely. He pulled a bag of green buds out of his pocket. "Just what the doctor ordered!"  
“你看起来需要一些源堂叔叔的特效药。”源堂睿智地点点头，从口袋里掏出一袋绿色花蕾。“正是医生所开！”

Strype glared at him. "Since when are _you_ a doctor?"  
斯特莱普瞪着他。“你什么时候成医生了？”

"Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, Class of '93. I specialized in pharmacology," Gendo said peaceably. "So, you like some?"  
"巴黎主宫医院，93 届。我专攻药理学，" 源渡平和地说道，"那么，你想要一些吗？"

Strype stared at him. "...you're a doctor. A medical doctor. At 26."  
斯特莱普盯着他。"...你是个医生。一名医学博士。才 26 岁。"

"I had a few years free, seemed like a thing to do. I needed something with a bit more intellectual bite after I finished the Tour de France."  
"我有几年空闲时间，这似乎是个不错的选择。在环法自行车赛结束后，我需要一些更具智力挑战的事情来做。"

"Wut."

"Ah, Mister Director? I _told_ you my dad had been everywhere, done everything," Shinji said, still wiping tears out of his eyes. "Wait until he tells you about his time in _La Légion_."  
"啊，总监先生？我告诉过你我爸爸去过世界各地，做过各种事情，" 真嗣说道，仍然擦着眼泪。"等他告诉你他在外籍军团的经历时，你就知道了。"

"Oui," Gendo nodded. "C'était une période de grandes aventures. Et de chevaux."  
"是的，" 碇点点头。"那是一段充满伟大冒险的时期。还有马匹。"

"Wut." Strype shook his head again. "I'm too sober for this."  
"什么鬼。" 斯特莱普再次摇头。"我太清醒了，听不懂这些。"

"I can fix that!" Gendo said, smiling helpfully. He held up the baggie again.  
"我能修好它！" 源度笑着，热心地举起了塑料袋。

"You shut up!" Strype picked up his hat and carefully, calmly uncrumpled his copy of the script. "Ok, now, where were we?" He peered more closely at the pages. "What, what the fuck _is_ this scene? I don't remember any 'Unit-13' in the storyboards."  
"你闭嘴！" 斯特莱普拿起他的帽子，小心翼翼、平静地展开他的剧本副本。"好了，我们现在到哪儿了？" 他更仔细地看着页面。"什么，这他妈是什么场景？我不记得故事板里有'13 号机'。"

"It did seem a little odd," Kaworu put in. "I mean, I thought Unit-13 was one of the Mass Production Series?"  
"确实有点奇怪，" 渚薰插话道。"我是说，我以为 13 号机是量产系列之一？"

"Shhh, that hasn't happened yet," Shinji stage whispered to him.  
"嘘，那还没发生呢，" 真嗣小声地对他说。

"Oh, right. Nevermind me!"  
"哦，对。别介意我！"

"Wait, this is more of that crack Makinami keeps slipping in, isn't it?" Strype said warily. "I _knew_ it! Makinami, get _down_ here! I'm going to make you an extra in _Rebuild of Aeon Entelechy Evangelion_!"  
"等等，这是真希波一直在偷偷加进去的那些奇怪内容，对吧？" 斯揣普警觉地说。"我就知道！真希波，下来这里！我要让你在《新世纪福音战士新剧场版：永劫回归》中的一个配角！"

"Wasn't that a rewrite of _Aeon Natum Engel_ to start with? So, that's like Rebuild-ception!" Mari said from the rafters.  
"那不是从《Aeon Natum Engel》重写开始的吗？所以，这就像是重制版的套娃！" 玛丽从椽子上说道。

"Ah HAH! There she is!" Strype cried. "Pen Pen, grab her!"  
"啊哈！她在那儿！" 斯特莱普喊道。"Pen Pen，抓住她！"

"Tally-ho!" said the hot-springs penguin, taking flight towards the voice.  
"出发！" 温泉企鹅说着，朝着声音的方向飞去。

"Uh oh," Mari said. Skittering noises rapidly heading away were heard overhead, mixed in with the flapping of penguin wings.  
“哎呀，”玛丽说道。头顶上传来急速远去的窸窣声，夹杂着企鹅翅膀的扑腾声。

"I thought penguins were _flightless_ birds?" Shinji said, watching Pen Pen zoom in and out of the lighting rig.  
“我以为企鹅是不会飞的鸟？”真嗣说道，看着 Pen Pen 在灯光设备间穿梭。

Strype scoffed. "Shows what you know, kid. Pen Pen went to _Oxford_. He learned a lot."  
斯特莱普嗤之以鼻。“说明你见识少，小子。Pen Pen 可是去过牛津的。他学到了不少东西。”

Shinji boggled at him. "To _fly_?"  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛看着他。“飞？”

"Did _you_ go to Oxford? Can _you_ fly?" Strype retorted.  
“你去过牛津吗？你会飞吗？”斯特莱普反驳道。

"...no, but... huh?"

"Everyone, take five while we chase her down," Strype called to the set at large. "Gendo, get down here and take that... thing off."  
“大家，休息五分钟，我们去找她，”斯特莱普向整个剧组喊道，“源堂，下来，把那...东西摘掉。”

"Awww..."

"But... but... but... penguins can't _fly_..." Shinji complained to Kaworu, who slung an arm around his shoulder.  
"但是...但是...但是...企鹅不能飞啊..." 真嗣向薰抱怨道，薰则用一只手臂搭在他的肩膀上。

"Eh, don't worry about it too much, bro. This is only a TV show," Kaworu said.  
"哎，别太在意了，兄弟。这只是个电视节目，" 薰说。

"What? What? But... he... flying penguin?"  
"什么？什么？但是...他...会飞的企鹅？"

"Who went to Oxford. Keep up, here."  
"谁去了牛津。跟上，这里。"

"I'm too sober for this," Shinji complained.

"Let's go see the girls, and you'll feel better. Everything's better when you've got Asuka around, right?"  
"我们去看看女孩们，你会感觉好些的。有明日香在身边，一切都更好，对吧？"

"Ok..." Shinji let the smiling Fifth Child lead him off towards the trailers.  
"好吧..." 真嗣让微笑的第五适格者领着他向拖车走去。"

### Backstage #6 - Secrets  
后台 #6 - 秘密

Asuka put down the bottle of rum she'd ostentatiously taken a big swig from and locked the trailer door again. "There! That 'totally not for kinky sex' shopping list ought to keep that weird Production Assistant busy for awhile, and fuel some rumors." She happily bounced back over to the small bed in the corner of the trailer and flopped gently back down on top of the occupant already laying there. "Now, where were we?"  
明日香放下那瓶她故意大口喝过的朗姆酒，再次锁上了拖车门的锁。“好了！那张‘绝对不是为了搞色情’的购物清单应该能让那个奇怪的制作助理忙上一阵子，还能引发一些流言。”她开心地蹦回拖车角落的小床，轻轻地倒在已经躺在那里的那个人身上。“那么，我们刚才进行到哪儿了？”

"About right here," Shinji smiled, and wrapped his arms around her again.  
"“就在这儿，”真嗣微笑着，再次用双臂环抱住她。”

"Ah, good! I like this spot," Asuka said with a grin, and kissed him. She made a disappointed mew when he pulled away after just a minute.  
"啊，太好了！我喜欢这个地方，" 明日香笑着说，并吻了他。当他仅仅一分钟后就抽身离开时，她发出了一声失望的喵叫。

"Asuka… I wish we didn't have to do this," he said, pursing his lips.  
"明日香…我希望我们不必这么做，" 他说着，抿紧了嘴唇。

"Funny, you usually like making out with me."  
"奇怪，你通常喜欢和我亲热的。"

He frowned. "You know what I mean. The whole 'spread rumors of constant wild sex, bacchanalias, threesomes, moresomes, and such' to keep the tabloids occupied and the project in the news. I want to tell everyone the truth."  
他皱起眉头。“你知道我的意思。用那些‘不断传出疯狂性爱、狂欢派对、三人行、多人行之类的谣言’来让八卦小报忙个不停，让项目保持新闻热度。我想告诉大家真相。”

"To be fair, _most_ of those things are true, and we both enjoy it," Asuka deflected.  
“公平地说，那些事大部分都是真的，而且我们俩都乐在其中，”明日香巧妙地转移了话题。

"Asuka…"

"We can't just tell the press, Shinji. They'll just go crazier if they have something real to report. And… I want you to stay my secret treasure for a bit longer, alright? I don't want to tell anyone."  
“我们不能就这样告诉媒体，真嗣。他们要是有了真实报道，只会更加疯狂。而且……我想让你再做我一段时间的秘密宝贝，好吗？我不想告诉任何人。”

"We told Rei and Kaworu?"  
"我们告诉了丽和薰吗？"

Asuka snorted. "'Told them'? We didn't tell them anything. They were there!" Asuka wiggled enough to free her left arm and take his left hand across Shinji's chest. The matching rings sparkled. "They were our dang witnesses. Rei wouldn't stop hooting, for one thing."  
明日香哼了一声。“告诉他们？我们什么都没告诉他们。他们就在那儿！”明日香扭动身体，腾出左手，穿过真嗣的胸前握住他的左手。一对戒指闪闪发光。“他们是我们的见证人。丽还一直欢呼呢，就举一例。”

"She was also the one who shouted 'VEGAS TRIP!' when I proposed," Shinji noted. "Seeing as how she was lying next to us."  
“她也是在我求婚时大喊‘去拉斯维加斯！’的那个人，”真嗣补充道，“考虑到她当时就躺在我们旁边。”

Asuka grinned back at him. They'd 'accidentally' let the press hear about the four stars of _Advice & Trust_ skipping town for a weekend in Vegas, but only the four of them knew they'd done more than drink, gamble, and hit the strip clubs while there. Shinji and her had found just enough time to find a discreet little chapel, and become more than just a on-set fling.  
明日香朝他咧嘴一笑。他们'不小心'让媒体得知了建议与信任四位明星逃离小镇去拉斯维加斯度周末的消息，但只有他们四人知道，他们在那里所做的不仅仅是喝酒、赌博和逛脱衣舞俱乐部。真嗣和她找到了足够的时间，在一个隐蔽的小教堂里，让他们的关系超越了片场上的短暂恋情。

_"Holy shit, I'm_ _**married**__!"_ Asuka had screamed at the parking lot on their way out, grinning from ear to ear.  
“天哪，我结婚了！”明日香在离开时对着停车场尖叫，笑得合不拢嘴。

"Are you sure it's all legal?" Shinji's question dragged her back to the present.  
“你确定这一切都合法吗？”真嗣的问题将她拉回了现实。

"Eh? Oh, that. Yes, of course I'm sure, baka. I'm a US citizen, and we're both 19. Perfectly legal for us to get married in Vegas. Japan has to recognize it." She nuzzled his cheek. "What are you so worried about?"  
"嗯？哦，那个啊。当然，我很确定，笨蛋。我是美国公民，我们俩都 19 岁。在拉斯维加斯结婚对我们来说完全合法。日本也必须承认。" 她蹭了蹭他的脸颊。"你到底在担心什么？"

He pulled his hand from hers to wrap his arms around her again. "I don't want you to… slip away somehow. I can't be this lucky. This doesn't seem real."  
他松开她的手，再次用双臂环抱住她。"我不想你……不知怎么就溜走了。我不可能这么幸运。这感觉不真实。"

"Pfft. You don't think you're this lucky? You, my dear baka, are Shinji Ikari, the famous son of the world famous actor slash adventurer slash _doctor_ Gendo Ikari. This may be your first role as the main hero, but I'm nobody. I'm only here because I was the only cute redhead at the auditions that could actually speak German, Japanese, and English fluently. And I still almost didn't get the role over that strawberry blonde chick. Now I'm the female lead in a huge new franchise and I got to date you as part of all this? That was wild enough. The 'pretend' bedroom antics with the one and only Rei Ayanami were a bonus. And that new guy. But that you _proposed_ to me? I about passed out on the spot!"  
"噗。你不觉得自己这么幸运吗？亲爱的笨蛋，你是真嗣·碇，世界著名演员兼冒险家兼医生源堂·碇的著名儿子。这可能是你第一次担任主角，但我什么都不是。我能在这里只是因为我是试镜时唯一能流利说德语、日语和英语的可爱红发女孩。而且我还是险胜那个草莓金发女郎才得到这个角色的。现在我成了一个全新大系列的女主角，还能和你约会作为这一切的一部分？这已经够疯狂了。和独一无二的绫波丽进行的'假装'卧室戏码更是额外的福利。还有那个新来的家伙。但你向我求婚？我当时差点当场晕倒！"

"I… thought we'd have to wait, anyhow. Not an adult in Japan until you hit 20, after all. Rei's idea for Vegas was actually… really smart." Shinji blushed. That Rei had been the one to prod Shinji into making the proposal as they all lay there after some… vigorous exertion was somehow fitting for all of them. Rei was an endlessly cheerful social butterfly off-set, with a first-class brain underneath. Somehow having her in bed with both of them, and her nudging Shinji to propose to Asuka in the afterglow felt… natural. Like Rei was supposed to be there too. She'd let off a nearly ultrasonic 'squeee' when he did and Asuka instantly accepted. "I'm glad we didn't. And you're not 'nothing', Asuka. You're… amazing. Every other girl I've dated turned out to be just after the 'me' she saw on the screen. Dad always warned me about them, and I never listened. But he liked you right away, remember?"  
"我…以为我们无论如何都得等。毕竟，在日本，20 岁才算成年。丽提议去拉斯维加斯其实…真的很聪明。" 真嗣脸红了。丽是那个在他们激烈运动后躺在那里时，怂恿真嗣求婚的人，这似乎对他们所有人都很合适。丽在镜头外是个永远快乐的社交蝴蝶，脑子里装着一流的智慧。不知怎的，她和他们俩一起躺在床上，并在余韵中催促真嗣向明日香求婚，感觉…很自然。就像丽也应该在那里一样。当他求婚时，她发出了几乎超声波般的'哇'声，而明日香立刻就接受了。"我很高兴我们没有等。而且你不是'什么都不是'，明日香。你是…令人惊叹的。我之前约会的每个女孩都只是看上了屏幕上的'我'。爸爸总是警告我那些人，我从来不听。但他从一开始就喜欢你，记得吗？"

"That's because your dad is like, super-dad. _Everybody_ likes him. He's the most weirdly social guy I've ever met. And so laid back, too." Asuka shrugged. "And he approves of me?"  
"那是因为你爸爸就像，超级爸爸。每个人都喜欢他。他是我见过的最奇怪的社交达人。而且也非常随和。" 明日香耸了耸肩。"他认可我吗？"

"Asuka, the day we met, my dad pulled me aside after you and I had our first scene together, pointed at you, and just said 'Her.'" Shinji rolled his eyes. "Of course, he then wandered off to go smoke half a kilo of weed with Pen Pen, but I got what he meant."  
"明日香，我们第一次见面那天，我和你拍完第一场戏后，我爸把我拉到一边，指着你，就说了句'她'。" 真嗣翻了个白眼。"当然，他接着就跑去和 Pen Pen 抽了半公斤大麻，但我明白他的意思。"

"Huh… cool," Asuka marveled. "Anyway, yes, we still have to… keep the fact that we are no-shit 100% married under wraps for a while longer. Even from your dad."  
"嗯……酷啊，" 明日香赞叹道。"总之，没错，我们还得……暂时保密我们真真正正百分之百结婚的事实。甚至对你爸也不能说。"

"Why?"

"Well, on top of all the 'keep the press chasing rumors' stuff, number one, because I'm pretty sure he's going to flip his lid in a good way when he does find out, and be useless for at least a week of shooting, and number two," Asuka took a calming breath, "I'm not ready to go public yet. I'm nob-...ok, I'll stop that. But I'm still a new face on her first big production, and you and everyone else here are huge stars like you, Rei, and your dad, classically trained naturals like Suzuhara, or serious, veteran actors like Katsuragi and Kaji! I can't even face the press without collapsing into meebling mush without acting the whole 'wild child' persona Rei taught me! I'm… scared to be 'real' with the public just yet." She buried her face into his neck. "Especially with something like this. I'm still terrified sometimes that this is just a dream, and next year I'll be just some 'on-set fling' in your rear-view mirror."  
“好吧，除了那些‘让媒体追逐谣言’的事情之外，第一，因为我确信他一旦发现会非常高兴，但至少一周的拍摄时间里会变得毫无用处；第二，”明日香深吸一口气，“我还没准备好公开。我不是……好了，我停下。但在这部大制作中，我还是个新人，而你们，丽，还有你爸爸，都是像你们这样的大明星，像铃原那样的科班出身的天才，或是像葛城和加持那样的资深演员！没有丽教我的‘野孩子’面具，我连面对媒体都会变成喃喃自语的软泥！我……还不敢在公众面前展现真实的自己。”她把脸埋进他的脖颈。“尤其是这种事。我有时还会害怕这只是一个梦，明年我就会成为你后视镜里的‘片场恋情’。”

Shinji shook his head and held her close. "Not happening. You and I are going to still be together when they call us all back in 20 years to film the Reunion specials and such for this franchise. My agent tells me this thing is going to be huge. Like, we could retire and coast our entire careers on just this alone." He kissed the side of her head gently. "Asuka, no one _gets_ me like you do. Even Rei thinks we're some kind of 'destined pair', or whatever other crazy stuff she says about us. I'm not giving you up for the whole world."  
真嗣摇了摇头，紧紧抱住她。“不可能的。20 年后他们召集我们回来拍摄这部系列的 reunion 特别节目时，你和我还会在一起。我的经纪人告诉我，这东西将会非常火爆。就像，我们完全可以靠这个退休，整个职业生涯都靠它来维持。”他轻轻吻了吻她的头侧。“明日香，没有人能像你这样理解我。就连丽也认为我们是某种‘命中注定的一对’，或者其他她说的那些疯狂的话。我不会为了全世界而放弃你。”

"Good," Asuka said quietly. "Because I may be afraid right now, but I know when I'm ready, I'm going to want to tell the whole world."  
“那就好，”明日香轻声说，“因为尽管我现在很害怕，但我知道当我准备好了，我会想要告诉全世界。”

Shinji chuckled. "We time it right, like during the premiere red carpet walk, we might really get the whole world to notice."  
真嗣轻笑道：“我们如果时机把握得好，比如在首映红毯走秀时，可能会真的让全世界都注意到。”

Asuka stiffened in his arms. "Ok, back to being terrified."  
明日香在他怀里僵住了。“好吧，回到被吓坏的状态。”

"Good thing we've got at least an hour to just cuddle before anyone comes looking for us," Shinji said, matching his actions to his words.  
“幸好我们至少还有一个小时可以抱抱，没人来找我们，”真嗣说道，言行一致地拥紧了她。

"No one would believe us if we told them this part," Asuka said, still trying to burrow into his arms. "That we're just sitting here being dopey-sweet and not engaged in some kind of carnal endurance marathon."  
“就算我们告诉别人这部分，也没人会相信，”明日香还在试图钻进他的怀里。“我们只是坐在这里傻乎乎地甜蜜，而不是在进行什么肉体耐力马拉松。”

"I don't care. This is the part I love, Asuka. I've had more sex than I can remember. I've never made love to someone until I met you."  
"我不在乎。这就是我热爱的部分，明日香。我经历过的性爱多到数不清。直到遇见你，我才真正与人相爱。"

"And there's the super-sweet baka I feel for," Asuka purred. "Love you too, my suave Shinji. Happy birthday, my sweet baka."  
"还有那个让我心动的超级甜心笨蛋，"明日香轻声细语。"我也爱你，我的潇洒真嗣。生日快乐，我的甜心笨蛋。"

### Backstage #7 - Getting Real Meta Up In Here  
后台 #7 - 这里变得超级元了

_"Doctor, we're losing him! Blood pressure still dropping!"  
医生，我们快失去他了！血压还在下降！_

Careful, steady hands squeezed the long-nosed forceps, grasping the twisted shard of metal right beside the frantically pulsing artery. The tiny nick was spraying blood with every beat. "I've got it. Removing."  
稳健的双手小心翼翼地握紧长鼻钳，准确地夹住了紧贴着狂跳动脉旁的扭曲金属碎片。那微小的切口随着每一次心跳喷涌着鲜血。“我夹住了。正在取出。”

The tiny clink the shrapnel made as it landed in the collection tray held out by the shaking nurse was inaudible over the sounds of approaching gunfire and mortar impacts that had been steadily marching closer.  
随着枪声和迫击炮弹的爆炸声逐渐逼近，金属碎片落入颤抖的护士伸出的收集盘中发出的微小叮当声几乎听不见。

"Nurse, another transfusion. I'm stitching the artery now."  
"护士，再来一次输血。我现在正在缝合动脉。"

No hands hung any blood. Gendo frowned, his hands moving in a precise, utterly steady blur. "Nurse, I've stitched the artery, but Caporal Dumont needs that transfusion no-"  
没有血袋挂着。源堂皱眉，双手以精确、完全稳定的模糊动作移动。""护士，我已经缝合了动脉，但杜蒙特下士需要立即输血——"

A terrified whimper followed by harsh silence made him lift his head from the wounded Legionnaire and look over his shoulder.  
一声惊恐的呜咽后紧跟着严厉的沉默，让他从受伤的军团士兵身上抬起头，转头望去。

The sweating young Hutu man snapped his AK-47 from the petrified nurse to Gendo for a moment, then back. "Do not move! You are my prisoners!" he shouted in accented French.  
那位汗流浃背的年轻胡图族男子猛地将 AK-47 从吓呆的护士手中夺过，转向碇，片刻后又转回去。“不许动！你们是我的俘虏！”他用带有口音的法语喊道。

"Son, you want to put that rifle down and let me finish sewing this man up," Gendo said calmly.  
“孩子，你最好放下那把步枪，让我把这个人缝合完，”碇平静地说道。

The gunman twitched his rifle a fraction more to the left and fired at the wounded man on the operating table. Caporal Dumont now needed that transfusion far more urgently, blood spurting from the ruined mess of his left calf.  
持枪者将步枪微微向左一偏，朝手术台上受伤的男子开了一枪。卡普 oral 杜蒙现在急需输血，他的左小腿血肉模糊，鲜血喷涌而出。

The gunman swung his rifle back at the medical team. "I said you ar-"  
持枪者将步枪转向医疗团队。“我说了你们——”

He looked down in confusion at the hilt of the stiletto protruding from his chest. He had time for a single blink before he crumpled to the floor.  
他困惑地低头看着从胸口突出的匕首柄。他只来得及眨一下眼，便瘫倒在地。

Gendo completed his motion and caught the AK-47 before it hit the floor, tossing it to one of the orderlies that was slowly lowering his hands. "Take this. Make sure no one else barges in like that."  
源度完成了动作，在 AK-47 落地前接住了它，将其抛给一个正慢慢放下双手的护理员。“拿着这个。确保不会再有人这样闯进来。”

The orderly blinked in shock as he awkwardly caught the gun. He hadn't even seen Gendo _move_. "Y-Yes sir!"  
勤务兵震惊地眨了眨眼，尴尬地接住了枪。他甚至没看到源堂动过。“是，长官！”

Gendo spared one look at the corpse on the floor. "I told you you wanted to put that rifle down," he muttered in Japanese. He snapped his fingers at the nurse. "Hey, snap out of it. We've got a Legionnaire to save. Transfusion, now."  
源堂瞥了一眼地板上的尸体。“我告诉过你，你想放下那把步枪。”他用日语低声说道。他朝护士打了个响指。“嘿，振作点。我们得救一个军团士兵。现在开始输血。”

A thunderous crash outside heralded another mortar impacting, this time close enough shrapnel pinged and tore through the medical tent. The nurse collapsed to the ground, clutching at her leg with a scream.  
外面一声雷鸣般的巨响预示着又一发迫击炮弹落下，这次近得弹片嗖嗖作响，撕裂了医疗帐篷。护士尖叫着倒在地上，紧紧捂住腿。

"I do not have _time_ for this..." Gendo muttered, hands moving faster. Caporal Dumont was bleeding faster.  
“我没时间应付这个……” 源度喃喃自语，双手动作加快。杜蒙下士的出血速度更快了。

**.**

---

**.**

Gendo sat up, gasping, shaking off the dream-memory. Rwanda. Again. They hadn't been able to save Caporal Dumont. The next mortar shell had landed on the medical tent barely 10m from him. Dumont had died absorbing the shrapnel that would have killed Gendo. He'd barely been able to save Nurse Roche. He'd done it while literally standing over the body of that random Rwandan man, his blood soaking into Gendo's shoes.  
源度坐起身，喘着气，摆脱梦境的记忆。卢旺达。又一次。他们没能救下杜蒙下士。下一枚迫击炮弹几乎就在他身边 10 米处落在了医疗帐篷上。杜蒙用身体吸收了本会杀死源度的弹片而牺牲。他几乎只能勉强救下护士罗氏。当时他正站在一个无名的卢旺达男子尸体上，鲜血浸透了源度的鞋子。

He shot a look at the clock on the night table. 1047. He'd managed to nap for barely an hour. He didn't have to be on set again until 1530. Plenty of time to relax and sleep some more. Maybe. He reached for the bong by his bed and quickly packed a bowl. Getting back to sleep after these dreams was never easy. Nightmares of blood and death and people he couldn't save... drugs helped. Acting, pretending he was someone else, it wasn't just a profession. It was walking therapy. Physician, heal thyself...  
他瞥了一眼床头柜上的时钟。10 点 47 分。他勉强小睡了一个小时。再次到片场要等到 15 点 30 分。有足够的时间放松和再睡一会儿。也许吧。他伸手去拿床边的烟斗，迅速装了一斗。这些梦后要重新入睡从来都不容易。关于鲜血、死亡和无法拯救的人的噩梦……药物有帮助。表演，假装成另一个人，这不仅仅是一份职业。这是一种行走疗法。医生，自医吧……

"It'd be a damn sight easier to get to sleep if you'd shut up with the overwrought narration. These are supposed to be cracky humor bits of action backstage. Now you're going all 'oooh, let's give Gendo a tragic backstory!' like this is the main plot. Sweet Buddha's tits, just let me smoke this weed and relax," Gendo complained.  
"如果你能闭上那过度渲染的旁白，入睡会容易得多。这本该是后台轻松幽默的小段子。现在你却开始‘哦，让我们给碇一个悲惨的背景故事吧！’好像这是主线剧情一样。佛祖在上，就让我抽口大麻放松一下吧，"碇抱怨道。

...I'm sorry, did you just start arguing with your story's _narration_?  
...抱歉，你刚刚是在和你的故事旁白争论吗？

"Yes, I did. You're too loud, overly dramatic, and trying to inject blood and drama to _crack drabbles_."  
"是的，我这么做了。你太吵，太戏剧化，还试图给这些轻松小品注入血腥和戏剧性。"

Crack _drabbles_? The last one got over 1500 words! It took hours! And... hey, wait a minute! You're not allowed to argue with the narration! Who do you think you are, Wade Wilson?  
搞笑短篇？上一个都超过 1500 字了！花了好几个小时！而且……嘿，等一下！你不能和叙述争论！你以为你是谁，韦德·威尔逊吗？

"Well, I sometimes am high enough I start fights with imaginary copies of Hugh Jackman. Does that count?"  
“好吧，我有时候嗨到会和想象中的休·杰克曼分身打架。这算吗？”

Oh for fuck's sake. Alright, I'm just going to pretend this never happened and you're just high as balls. Try not to bash your stupid head through the fourth wall in the next part, okay?  
哦，该死的。好吧，我就当这事没发生过，你只是嗨到不行。下一部分别再把你的蠢脑袋撞穿第四面墙了，好吗？

Gendo looked down at the bowl. "Oh yeah, baby. This is the good shit, mixed in with a little bit of 'shrooms. I'm so high, I'm arguing with the little yellow boxes again."  
源堂低头看着碗。“哦耶，宝贝。这是好东西，混了点蘑菇。我嗨到不行，又开始跟那些小黄盒子吵架了。”

I don't use little yellow boxes, you twit. This is text! Now stop that, I'm about to cue your son and his wife.  
我不使用小黄盒子，你这个笨蛋。这是文本！现在别闹了，我正要让你儿子和他妻子出场。

"Don't tell me that, I don't know about that part yet."  
“别告诉我这个，那部分我还不知道呢。”

Shut up.

There was a tentative knock at the door to his trailer. He let the latest hit from the bong trickle out of his nose slowly. "Come on in, son," he called.  
他的拖车门外传来了一阵试探性的敲门声。他缓缓地让从烟斗中吸进的最新一口烟雾从鼻孔中流出。“进来吧，孩子。”他喊道。

Shinji opened the door and entered, sniffing at the familiar scent in the air. "Uh... hi, dad. Trouble sleeping again? I... wait, how did you know it was me?"  
真嗣打开门走了进来，嗅着空气中熟悉的气味。“呃……嗨，爸爸。又睡不着了吗？我……等等，你怎么知道是我？”

"It was an inspired guess. Also, you're the one who comes to see me most often, m'boy. And the Director usually pounds on the door like he's trying to break it down." He waved at the chair on the other side of the trailer. "Come on in and have a seat. What's on your mind, son? You look like you've got some heavy duty news for me."  
“这是个灵机一动的猜测。再说了，你是最常来看我的，孩子。而导演通常会像是要把门砸烂一样猛敲门。”他挥手示意拖车另一边的椅子。“过来坐下吧。你心里有什么事，孩子？你看起来像是有重要消息要告诉我。”

Shinji stepped inside, revealing Asuka right behind him. "Ah... hi, Mister Ikari. I hope we didn't wake you up or anything."  
真嗣踏进门内，身后跟着明日香。“啊……嗨，碇先生。希望我们没有吵醒您或什么的。”

Gendo waved the hand unoccupied by the bong. "Nonsense, I'm always happy to see you! And I told you, call me Gendo! 'Mister Ikari' makes me feel like you're a Production Assistant trying to get my attention, not my son's beautiful girlfriend!"  
源渡挥了挥没拿烟斗的那只手。“胡说，见到你们我总是很高兴！而且我告诉过你，叫我源渡！‘碇先生’让我感觉你像个想引起我注意的制作助理，而不是我儿子漂亮的女朋友！”

Asuka blushed and followed Shinji in. She awkwardly took the chair after Shinji waved his hand, refusing to sit while she stood. "Um, thank you, sir. I... um... that's kind of what we're here about."  
明日香脸红了，跟着真嗣进去。她尴尬地接过椅子坐下，真嗣摆手示意她坐下，自己却站着。“嗯，谢谢您，先生。我……嗯……我们来的目的就是这个。”

"Calling me Gendo? Ok, well, that's kind of done. Unless we're going back in time, which would be cool, since that would mean my trailer is a TARDIS."  
"叫我碇司令？好吧，那已经是过去式了。除非我们能回到过去，那倒是挺酷的，因为那就意味着我的拖车是个 TARDIS。"

Asuka blinked, and looked at Shinji in confusion. Shinji shrugged.  
明日香眨了眨眼，困惑地看着真嗣。真嗣耸了耸肩。

"Er... dad, we wanted to tell you something," Shinji began.  
"呃... 爸爸，我们有件事想告诉你，" 真嗣开口道。

"You two got married, didn't you?"  
"你们俩结婚了，对吧？"

Both of Shinji and Asuka's jaws dropped. There was ten seconds of silence before Shinji unfroze. "I... dad, how the Hell did you know that?"  
真嗣和明日香的嘴巴都张大了。沉默了十秒钟后，真嗣才回过神来。“我……爸爸，你怎么会知道的？”

"I may have developed psychic powers from all the drug use. Or the narrator accidentally told me. Or," Gendo smiled. "I've been expecting that to happen for weeks now, and I win that bet with Pen Pen. He thought you'd wait until after we shot the Armisael scene. Come on, son, you and that wonderful girl are so gaga for each other, even that Horaki kid finally noticed, and she's blind as a bat to romance and social interaction."  
“我可能是吸毒太多产生了心灵感应。或者，是旁白不小心告诉我的。再或者，”源渡笑了笑。“我已经预料到这事会发生好几个星期了，我赢了和 Pen Pen 的赌局。他以为你们会等到我们拍完阿米沙尔的戏份之后才结婚。拜托，儿子，你和那个可爱的女孩对彼此那么痴迷，就连那个对浪漫和社交一窍不通的洞木光都注意到了，她可是对这些事情视而不见的人。”

Asuka covered her face as she fought down the blush, then sighed. "Yes, we did, Gen... father." She reached into her blouse and pulled out a chain with a elegant silver and diamond ring dangling from it. She took the ring off the chain and handed it to Shinji. He smiled as he slid it onto her left ring finger. She smiled back and stroked the side of his face once the ring was on her.  
明日香捂住脸，努力压制住脸上的红晕，然后叹了口气。“是的，我们确实做了，元……父亲。”她伸手进衬衫，拉出一条链子，上面挂着一个精致的银钻戒指。她从链子上取下戒指，递给真嗣。他微笑着将戒指滑入她的左手无名指。戒指戴好后，她回以微笑，轻抚他的脸颊。

"Ah... yeah, dad. Two weeks ago, in fact. That little 'getaway' to Vegas was... not quite as we told the paparazzi," Shinji said. "We just... wanted it to be our secret for a bit. But... we decided you should know too."  
“啊……是的，爸爸。实际上是两周前。那次去拉斯维加斯的‘小旅行’……并没有像我们告诉狗仔队的那样，”真嗣说。“我们只是……想暂时保密。但是……我们决定你也应该知道。”

Gendo smiled. "Son, I've never been prouder of you. If only your mother could see you now."  
源渡微笑道：“儿子，我从未如此为你骄傲。要是你母亲能看到你现在的样子就好了。”

"Isn't she coming to the set next week to do her voiceovers?"  
"她不是下周要来录音吗？"

"Yeah, but that's next week! I want to tell her now!"  
"是啊，但那是下周的事！我现在就想告诉她！"

Shinji shook his head, smiling ruefully. "I should have known we wouldn't be able to really surprise you with this, dad. You know me too well."  
真嗣摇了摇头，苦笑着说：“我早该知道我们没法真的给你惊喜，爸爸。你太了解我了。”

"Eh, I'm just a weird old dude who's been around the block a bit, son. You know nothing makes me happier than seeing you do well and walk your own road. And now you've got the best thing in the world: someone you can trust to walk it with you all the way to the end." He nodded at Asuka. "And you, m'dear, please take care of my boy. He's headstrong and wants to live up to his old man's wild life, but I always tell him I'll be proud of him no matter what. He needs someone like you to keep him level. And he has never been so head-over-heels for a girl ever. He wouldn't stop talking about you, that first week!"  
"哎，我只是个有点古怪的老家伙，经历了不少风霜，孩子。你知道吗，没有什么比看到你过得好、走自己的路更让我高兴的了。现在你拥有了世界上最美好的东西：一个你可以信赖，陪你走到最后的人。" 他向明日香点了点头。"还有你，亲爱的，请照顾好我的儿子。他固执己见，总想活出他老爸那种狂野的生活，但我总是告诉他，无论怎样我都会为他骄傲。他需要像你这样的人来让他保持冷静。而且他从未对哪个女孩如此倾心过。那第一周，他不停地谈论你！"

Asuka ducked her head again, blushing. "Y-Yeah, well... I kinda like him too. I'm glad you're... not mad or anything that we kept this to ourselves for a bit. I was... kind of intimidated at suddenly being a part of the _Ikari_ family. I mean, your wife is a member of the Diet, and you're..." Asuka waved her hands. "_Gendo Ikari_. International adventurer, doctor, and actor!"  
明日香再次低下头，脸颊泛红。"嗯，是啊... 我也挺喜欢他的。很高兴你... 没有因为我们暂时保密而生气。我... 突然成为碇家的一员，有点不知所措。我是说，你妻子是国会议员，而你..." 明日香挥了挥手。"碇源堂。国际冒险家、医生兼演员！"

"You're fine, Asuka," Gendo made a calming gesture. "I'm just a guy like Shinji. I had a foolish youth of wild times and distant memories. It's nicer to be here now, seeing my boy grow up and meet a lovely woman like you. You two will do fine."  
"你没事的，明日香，" 碇源堂做出一个安抚的手势。"我只是像真嗣一样的普通人。我有过一段荒唐的青春，充满了狂野的时光和遥远的回忆。现在能在这里，看着我的儿子成长，遇见像你这样可爱的女孩，真是好多了。你们俩会做得很好的。"

Asuka shook her head. "It's hard, sir. Shinji's told me so many stories about you, it's hard to believe you're not a comic-book hero or something."  
明日香摇了摇头。"很难相信，先生。真嗣告诉我那么多关于你的故事，我很难相信你不是漫画书里的英雄什么的。"

Gendo shrugged. "I'm just a dad, proud of his son. Don't worry about my past. It's not worth dwelling on. Look to your future." He grinned. "And brace yourselves for when my dear Yui arrives. You know she won't be able to stop herself from asking about one particular thing before the first day is over..."  
碇源堂耸了耸肩。"我只是个为儿子骄傲的父亲。别担心我的过去。那不值得沉溺。展望你们的未来吧。"他咧嘴一笑。"还有，准备好迎接我亲爱的唯的到来吧。你知道她在一开始的那天结束前，肯定会忍不住问起某件特别的事情..."

Asuka shook her head, unable to guess. She looked to Shinji.  
明日香摇了摇头，猜不出来。她看向真嗣。

Shinji had gone pale and nervous. "Uh oh..." He looked back at Asuka. "_Babies_," he whispered.  
真嗣脸色苍白，显得很紧张。“哎呀...”他回头看着明日香。“婴儿，”他低声说。

### Backstage #8:

Pen Pen threw the script on the table in disgust. "Good God, who is _writing_ this tripe? Someone who thinks there's a market for doujins pairing Commander Ikari and _me_? I am not drunk enough for this. PA! Where's my gin?"  
企鹅 Pen Pen 厌恶地将剧本扔在桌上。“天哪，谁在写这种垃圾？有人以为伊卡洛斯指挥官和我配对的同人志有市场吗？我还没醉到能接受这个。PA！我的琴酒呢？”

The tall, nervous PA handed him the tumbler. "Here, sir."  
那位高个子、紧张的助理递给他一杯酒。“给，先生。”

The penguin took the glass of gin and tossed half of it back in one go, irritation still all over his beak.  
企鹅接过那杯杜松子酒，一口就喝掉了一半，嘴上还满是不悦。

Fuyutsuki puffed at his pipe. "At least you're getting scripts. I've hardly got a part at all, it feels like. I'm damn near Gendo's sock puppet. I really wish they'd get _Mitigation_ going again. I had a real, juicy part in that one. I was practically a main character for once! And the last film ended on a cliffhanger!" He leaned forward and moved a rook. "Check."  
冬月抽着烟斗。“至少你还有剧本。我感觉自己几乎没什么角色，简直快成了碇的傀儡。我真希望他们能重新启动《缓和》。在那部剧里我有个真正有分量的角色，几乎算得上是主角了！而且最后一集还留下了悬念！”他向前倾身，移动了一个车。“将军。”

Pen Pen took one glance at the board before leaning in to move his white bishop to intercede. "I knew you'd try that. I've got mate in 6 unless you're more clever than you were yesterday."  
Pen Pen 瞥了一眼棋盘，随即向前移动他的白象进行干预。“我就知道你会这么走。除非你比昨天更聪明，否则我六步之内就能将死你。”

"WHAAAAAAAAAAAH! WOE IS ME! THE DARK TIMES ARE UPON US AND THE DAWN WILL NEVER COOOOOOOOOOOME!" Rei wailed as she ran by.  
“哇啊啊啊啊啊啊！我好惨啊！黑暗时代降临了，黎明永远不会到来啦！”丽一边哀嚎一边跑过。

Pen Pen didn't look up. "Is she _ever_ going to give that a rest? She's been at it for two bloody hours."  
Pen Pen 没有抬头。“她什么时候才能消停？已经嚎了整整两个小时了。”

Fuyutsuki shrugged. "She says it's fooling at least some of the paparazzi into believing her character is dead. And it's keeping her busy and amused while she's not in any scenes." He moved a pawn to cover his king.  
冬月耸了耸肩。“她说这至少骗过了一些狗仔队，让他们相信她的角色已经死了。而且这让她在没戏份的时候保持忙碌和娱乐。”他移动了一个兵来保护自己的王。

The penguin snorted. "Bloody fools. Like they'd permanently kill off the second most popular character in the show before the season finale? She's only a little ahead of that Soryu girl as it is." He moved a knight up aggressively on the right, threatening Fuyutsuki's defenses.  
企鹅哼了一声。“愚蠢的家伙。就像他们会在季终前永久杀死剧中第二受欢迎的角色一样？她现在只比那个 Soryu 女孩稍微领先一点。”他激进地将马移到右侧，威胁着冬月的防线。

The older man raised an eyebrow. "Second most? Who do you think is first?"  
年长者挑了挑眉。“第二受欢迎？你认为谁是第一？”

The penguin chuckled and sat up straight. He looked Fuyutsuki straight in the eye with a faint smile. "Wark wark." He winked.  
企鹅轻声笑了起来，坐直了身子。他带着一丝微笑，直视着冬月，眨了眨眼。“哇克哇克。”

### Backstage #9 - KSK Backstage  
后台 #9 - KSK 后台

"There is just too much irony in this," Sayaka said, putting her feet up on the table in front of the tiny couch in Kensuke's trailer.  
“这其中的讽刺意味太浓了，”沙耶香说着，把脚翘在了健介拖车里那张小沙发前的桌子上。

"Hmm? In what?" Kyoko asked without looking up from her tablet.  
"嗯？在什么里面？" 筱子没有从她的平板电脑上抬起头来问道。

"Having two straight girls playing the lesbians, and the gay guy playing the straight dude."  
"两个直女演女同性恋，还有那个同性恋演直男。"

Kensuke snorted and kept paging through the script on his own tablet. He was holding it over his head and reading upside-down, thanks to his head being in Kyoko's lap. "I believe the Director did mention it as one of those things that gives him a headache, so at least it wasn't deliberate on his part. I'm here because I nailed the audition, I'm fairly sure. And to be fair, you two make a _darling_ couple, and I'm very happy to have you both as my Sassy Straight Friends."  
健介哼了一声，继续翻阅着他自己的平板电脑上的剧本。由于他的头枕在筱子的大腿上，他不得不把平板举过头顶，倒着阅读。“我相信导演确实提过这是让他头疼的事情之一，所以至少这不是他故意的。我能在这里是因为我试镜表现出色，我相当确定。而且公平地说，你们俩看起来真是一对可爱的情侣，我很高兴有你们两位作为我的俏皮直男朋友。”

Sayaka rolled her eyes. "Very funny, Mister 'I Have A Huge Fanclub From My Indie Days'. It is so not fair that _you_ never seem to have trouble finding a date on weekends. Aren't _we_ cute?"  
沙耶香翻了个白眼。“真是搞笑，‘我独立时期拥有庞大粉丝团’先生。周末你总是能轻松找到约会对象，这也太不公平了吧。我们难道不可爱吗？”

"Yeah, but half the fanbase of _this_ project thinks we really are a couple," Kyoko said, paging through her script. "And it encourages the hype to let them think it, which is why the three of us are sitting here in Ken-chan's trailer trying to convince them we're all shaking the bedframe."  
“是啊，但这个项目的半数粉丝都认为我们真的是一对，”京子翻着剧本说，“让他们这么想有助于炒作，这也是为什么我们三个现在坐在健君的拖车里，试图让他们相信我们都在摇床架。”

"Again, to be fair, you both are lovely, and if I was into girls I _would_ be sweetly and tenderly seducing you both right now," Kensuke said cheerfully. "Alas, I am far, far too gone under the gayroller to look upon either of you with amorous desire, so must content myself with lusting after Nagisa and Ikari, not that I think I'll ever pry either of them away from their ladies. To soften my disappointment, I do have a date tonight with one of the guys from _FREE_! Mmm, swimmer's bods..."  
“再说一遍，公平起见，你们俩都很可爱，如果我喜欢女生的话，我现在就会温柔地诱惑你们俩，”健介愉快地说，“可惜，我已经被同性恋的浪潮深深卷走，对你们俩没有任何爱慕之情，只能满足于对渚和真嗣的渴望，虽然我觉得我永远也抢不走他们中的任何一个。为了缓解失望，我今晚和 FREE!里的一个家伙有约会。嗯，游泳运动员的身材……”

"Quiet down, mister Broadway star. You are _such_ a stereotypical stage actor, too." She sighed. "The things I do for this project. You may have nailed the audition, Ken-chan, but Kyo-chan and I are here since we're currently popular thanks to that magical girl series. We need to branch out some, and I'm just worried we'll get typecast as 'those two lesbians' or something. I mean, the production values in our last movie were sky-high, but the writing just didn't do nearly as much justice to our characters as it should, and-"  
"安静点，百老汇明星先生。你真是典型的舞台演员，太刻板了。" 她叹了口气。"为了这个项目，我真是拼了。你也许在试镜中表现出色，Ken-chan，但我和 Kyo-chan 是因为那部魔法少女系列而走红。我们需要拓展一下，我只是担心我们会因为'那两个女同性恋'而被定型。我是说，我们上一部电影的制作水准极高，但剧本对我们的角色刻画远远不够，而且——"

Kyoko sighed. "Oh dear, there she goes again." She tapped at her tablet again. "This is why I'm looking through scripts, Sayaka. I _am_ looking for more parts for both of us. Not that we're an indissoluble unit, but I _do_ like working with my BFF. You know I'd be all over you if we were gay, dear."  
Kyoko 叹了口气。"哦天哪，她又开始了。" 她再次敲打着平板。"这就是为什么我在看剧本，Sayaka。我在为我们俩寻找更多角色。并不是说我们是一个不可分割的组合，但我确实喜欢和我最好的朋友一起工作。你知道如果我们是同性恋，我会全心全意支持你的，亲爱的。"

Sayaka ducked her head. "Alright, I'll stop griping about that movie. It's just sad when no-budget indie projects have better writing than the giant sequel movies to a hit series."  
Sayaka 低下了头。"好吧，我不再抱怨那部电影了。只是当那些低成本独立项目的剧本比热门系列的续集电影还要好时，真是令人遗憾。"

"You'll probably be able to coast on the revenues from that magical girl show and this thing for years," Kensuke pointed out. "I'm still digging for new parts anyhow, since acting is my life, but you two will be set either way." He reluctantly sat up, slow enough that Kyoko had plenty of warning to move her arms and tablet out of the way.  
"你大概能靠那部魔法少女剧和这个项目赚的钱过上好几年，"健介指出。"我还是在挖掘新角色，毕竟演戏是我的生命，但你们俩无论怎样都会过得很好。"他不太情愿地坐起身，动作慢得让恭子有足够的时间移开手臂和手中的平板。

"We're still looking too," Sayaka said. "I had our agent call Aleph's people. I heard there might be some small parts opening soon in her Kerisgame franchise, or some other Exalted project she's got fingers in."  
"我们也在寻找机会，"沙耶香说。"我让我们的经纪人联系了 Aleph 那边。听说她的 Kerisgame 系列可能会有一些小角色空缺，或者她参与的其他 Exalted 项目。"

"I wish we'd had the wits to get a part in Panopticon when it was doing open casting. I can't _believe_ Soryu got that part! Look what it turned into!" Kyoko huffed. She looked curiously at Kensuke. "Hey, where are you going?"  
"真希望我们在《全景监狱》公开选角时能聪明点去争取个角色。我简直不敢相信曹丽拿到了那个角色！看看它变成了什么！"恭子气呼呼地说。她好奇地看着健介。"嘿，你要去哪儿？"

Kensuke finished pulling a fresh shirt on and smiled over his shoulder at her. "Got to get ready for my date! It's a pure shame to keep prime beefcake like Hazuki waiting long." He opened his closet and started digging through it.  
健介穿好一件新衬衫，回头对她笑了笑。“得准备去约会了！让像风见这样的顶级帅哥久等可真是罪过。”他打开衣柜，开始翻找起来。

Sayaka sighed again. "We are cute, popular, and half the fanbase thinks we're bi. Why is it hard for _us_ to find dates? How is it that we have a harder time finding dates than _Pen Pen_? Seriously, that penguin _always_ has some hot model on his wing when there's a press event or something!"  
纱耶香再次叹了口气。“我们既可爱又受欢迎，粉丝团一半的人都认为我们是双性恋。为什么我们找约会对象这么难？怎么比企鹅潘潘还难？说真的，每次有媒体活动或什么的，那只企鹅身边总有个火辣的模特！”

Kyoko shrugged. "He's just got that suave British charm, and the Oxford accent. I mean, it _is_ pretty hot. And he's smooth as Hell, too..." She trailed off, staring into space.  
京子耸了耸肩。“他就是有那种英国式的潇洒魅力，还有牛津口音。我是说，确实很迷人。而且他处事圆滑得要命……”她话音渐弱，目光飘向远方。

"It also helps that he's the Director's drinking buddy and even _Gendo Ikari_ seems to think he's a cool guy. I..." Sayaka paused, eyes narrowing. "Kyo-chan, what the Hell are you thinking about?"  
"更重要的是，他是总监的酒友，甚至连碇源堂似乎都觉得他是个酷家伙。我..." 沙耶香顿了顿，眼睛眯了起来。"京子，你到底在想什么？"

Kyoko snapped out of her fugue and blushed. "Nothing!"  
京子从恍惚中回过神来，脸红了。"没什么！"

Sayaka gave her a very suspicious look. "You were thinking about trying a little penguin for yourself, weren't you?"  
沙耶香非常怀疑地看着她。"你是不是在想自己也试试小企鹅？"

"No! I..." Kyoko practically shrank into the couch cushions. "...ok, maybe I was. But he's so _cute_! And that accent! Plus, I mean... he _does_ keep getting all those girls, so he must have _something_, right?"  
"不！我..." 恭子几乎缩进了沙发垫里。"...好吧，也许我是这么想的。但他太可爱了！还有那口音！而且，我的意思是...他总是能吸引那么多女孩，肯定有他的魅力，对吧？"

"Ooooh, you _go_ for that gusto, Kyo-chan!" Kensuke said, laughing as he put on an expensive looking pair of tailored trousers. "Do it! And tell me _allllll_ the details when you get back! I'm kind of curious too. Sadly, Pen Pen is as straight as you two, so I'll never know myself, but if you don't mind a little gossip between friends..." He waved as he opened the trailer's door and left.  
"哦哦哦，你追求那种大胆的风格，恭子酱！" 健介笑着说，同时穿上了一双看起来很昂贵的定制长裤。"去吧！回来后告诉我所有的细节！我也挺好奇的。可惜，Pen Pen 和你俩一样直，所以我永远体验不到，但如果你不介意朋友间的小八卦..." 他挥了挥手，打开拖车门离开了。"

Sayaka shook her head. "I cannot _believe_ you're thinking about it, Kyoko_."_  
沙耶香摇了摇头。"我真不敢相信你在考虑这个，恭子。"

Kyoko opened her mouth, then hesitated. "...you're mad I thought of it first, aren't you?"  
Kyoko 张开嘴，随即又犹豫了。“……你生气我先想到这个，对吧？”

Butter wouldn't melt in Sayaka's mouth. "That's immaterial! I am merely concerned with-"  
Sayaka 的嘴角仿佛连黄油都不会融化。“那无关紧要！我只是关心——”

"You totally are. But hey, we're besties, right? Let's _both_ go ask him," Kyoko offered, her fang winking as she smirked at her friend.  
“你绝对是。不过嘿，我们是好姐妹，对吧？我们一起去问他吧，”Kyoko 提议道，她眨了眨眼，对着朋友露出了狡黠的微笑。

"And that's it for today. See you in the morn, old bean." Pen Pen nodded politely to the Director. "Ladies, shall we?" He offered a wing each to Sayaka and Kyoko. They each took one, giggling in embarrassment at their own audacity. The three walked off in high spirits, already chatting animatedly.  
“今天就这样吧。明早见，老兄。”Pen Pen 礼貌地向导演点了点头。“女士们，我们走吧？”他分别向 Sayaka 和 Kyoko 伸出一只翅膀。她们各自接过，因自己的大胆而咯咯笑着，有些不好意思。三人兴高采烈地走开了，已经开始热烈地交谈起来。

Director Strype rubbed his face and sighed. "I swear to fucking Alien Space Bats, this project is getting weirder by the second."  
斯特莱普导演揉了揉脸，叹了口气。“我向上帝发誓，这个项目每秒钟都变得越来越奇怪。”

Rei Ayanami ran by, wearing only a bikini and rainbow bodypaint. "I AM THE SPIRIT OF LOVE AND I ADORE PANCAKES!" She was maintaining a good lead ahead of Shinji and Kaworu pursuing her with large nets.  
绫波零只穿着比基尼，身上涂满了彩虹色的身体彩绘，跑过来说：“我是爱的化身，我热爱煎饼！”她保持着领先优势，而真嗣和薰拿着大网在后面追赶。

"Note to self: _Drink heavily,"_ he muttered. "Ikari! Where are you keeping that bong?! I need some mellow, stat!"  
"提醒自己：多喝点酒，" 他喃喃自语。"碇！你把那烟斗藏哪儿了？！我急需放松一下，立刻！"

"Everything's coming up _Gendo_!" a distant voice answered.  
"一切都如碇所愿！" 一个遥远的声音回答道。"

### Backstage #10 An A&T Backstage Christmas  
后台 #10 一个 A&T 后台的圣诞节

"Come on dear, out of Dr. Ikari's lap..."  
"来吧亲爱的，从碇医生的腿上下来..."

"Hee hee hee! I dun wanna! I've beena gud girl, and I'm gonna tell Santa what I want for Crishmash! And then yur gonna _give_ it to me! Hee hee hee! Boop!"  
"嘻嘻嘻！我不要！我一直都很乖，我要告诉圣诞老人我圣诞节想要什么！然后你就会给我！嘻嘻嘻！啵！"

Gendo Ikari remained remarkably stoic for a man wearing a Santa Claus outfit and beard who was having a fairly drunk Hikari Horaki pried out of his lap by her mildly embarrassed boyfriend. It probably helped that Gendo was baked on half a bag of primo grade Southern California Sunset Gold reefer, and was feeling pretty jolly.  
碇源堂穿着圣诞老人装和大胡子，面对一个相当醉醺醺的洞木光从他腿上被她略显尴尬的男友拉开，依然保持着惊人的镇定。可能是因为碇源堂吸了半袋顶级南加州日落黄金大麻，感觉相当愉快。

"Method acting is the best! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!" he proclaimed, patting Hikari on the head like she was 9.  
"方法派演技最棒了！呵呵呵！圣诞快乐！" 他宣布道，像对待九岁孩子一样拍了拍光的小脑袋。

Touji finally managed to pry her off Dr. Ikari and heft her up over his shoulder, the only way he could keep her from flopping sloppily onto the floor and trying to crawl back into 'Santa's' lap again. Again. She giggled anyhow, and took advantage of her situation to squeeze Touji's firm buns and make honking noises.  
终于，阿薰设法将她从碇博士身边拉开，扛到肩上，只有这样才能防止她再次笨拙地摔到地上，试图爬回'圣诞老人'的膝上。又一次。她还是咯咯笑着，趁机捏了捏阿薰结实的臀部，发出喇叭声。

"Lightweight," Misato snorted as Touji carried her off to find a comfy chair sit it in and engage in the 'turbo-snogging' his girlfriend was loudly demanding. "One measly bottle of agave tequila and she's legless?"  
"真是个小酒鬼，"美里嗤之以鼻，看着阿薰把她扛走去找个舒服的椅子坐下，满足她女友大声要求的'狂热亲吻'。"一瓶龙舌兰酒就把她放倒了？"

"Not everyone's has as hard-trained a liver as you do, m'dear," Kaji pointed out, handing her a plate of snacks as he settled in beside her. He cheerfully adjusted his set of antlers. "She's barely 19. You've been 'training' for years. And we're entitled to cut lose a little at a Christmas Party. We just shot some terribly heavy scenes, no?"  
"并非每个人都有你那样经过严格训练的肝脏，亲爱的，"卡兹指出，递给她一盘小吃，然后在她旁边坐下。他愉快地调整了一下自己的鹿角。"她才 19 岁。你已经'训练'多年了。我们有权在圣诞派对上放松一下。我们刚刚拍了一些非常沉重的场景，不是吗？"

Kaworu nodded from where he sat across from them on the other couch nestled around a small table in the gap between the Central Dogma set and the 'Misato's Apartment' one. "Yes, I could really use the more lighthearted stuff," he said somewhat wearily. "The last few scenes were quite the emotional workout for me, Shinji, and Asuka."  
渚薰坐在他们对面的沙发上，沙发围绕着中央教条区和'美里公寓'区之间的小桌子。"是的，我真的需要一些更轻松的东西，"他有些疲惫地说。"最后几场戏对我和真嗣、明日香来说都是情感上的考验。"

"Not for me!" Rei said cheerily from his lap. She ruthlessly ruffled his hair. "I got to take two weeks off!"  
"对我来说可不是！"丽从他的腿上欢快地说道。她毫不留情地揉乱了他的头发。"我有两周的假期！"

"You were playing _dead_, Rei," Kaworu replied dryly, doing his best to ignore his hair being mussed. "And you spent nearly the entire two weeks 'off' standing right behind the Director and making faces at us while the three of us were trying to do scenes where we were supposed to be 'mourning your death'."  
"你是在装死，丽。" 渚冷冷地回答，尽力忽略自己的头发被弄乱。"而且你几乎整个两周的'休假'期间都站在导演后面，对我们做鬼脸，而我们三个却在努力拍摄那些我们'哀悼你去世'的场景。"

"Just trying to make sure the heavy stuff didn't get you all down off set!" Rei grinned unrepentantly. "And it worked, didn't it?"  
"只是想确保那些沉重的情绪不会让你们在片场都沮丧起来！" 丽毫无悔意地笑着。"而且效果不错，不是吗？"

Shinji gave the bluenette a wry look. "It was a _little_ difficult to cry and wail on camera sometimes when you're standing behind the camera in a rainbow clown wig and crossing your eyes, Rei."  
真嗣对蓝发少年投以苦笑。"有时候在镜头前哭泣和哀嚎确实有点困难，当你站在镜头后面戴着彩虹小丑假发还翻白眼的时候，丽。"

"I'm a helper!"

Asuka snuggled into Shinji's side and handed him a drink. "Eh, it did provide plenty of material for the Blooper Reel we're going to show tonight, right? And like you're going to complain about how Rei also decided the best way to raise our spirits after scenes like that was to kiss the bejeesus out of each of us once the Director yelled 'Cut!'?"  
明日香依偎在真嗣身旁，递给他一杯饮料。“嘿，这可是为我们今晚要播放的花絮提供了不少素材，对吧？而且你也不会抱怨绫波在导演喊‘卡’之后，决定用亲吻来提振我们士气的最佳方式吧？”

Shinji took the drink, immediately put it down next to him, and put his arm around her. He closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh. "That is nice, but I still like yours the best."  
真嗣接过饮料，立刻放在身边，然后搂住她。他闭上眼睛，发出满足的叹息。“那确实很棒，但我还是最喜欢你的。”

Rei and Kaworu shared a look and cat-like grins. "You're going to announce it tonight, right?" Kaworu asked quietly.  
绫波和渚薰交换了一个眼神，露出了猫一般的微笑。“你今晚要宣布这件事，对吧？”渚薰轻声问道。

"Announce what?" Misato asked, catching the question despite the Christmas music on the PA. Her eyebrows climbed and a coy smirk appeared on her lips. "Ohhhh~? Have you gone and asked her a _certain question_, Shin-chan?"  
"宣布什么？" 美里问道，尽管广播里播放着圣诞音乐，她还是捕捉到了这个问题。她的眉毛上扬，嘴角露出一丝狡黠的微笑。"哦~~~？你是不是已经向她提出了某个问题，真嗣君？"

Asuka turned pink and shrank into the protective cover of Shinji's arm. Shinji was nearly as pink himself. "Misato!" he complained. "It's not like that!"  
明日香脸红了起来，缩进了真嗣手臂的保护下。真嗣自己也是满脸通红。"美里！" 他抱怨道。"不是那样的！"

Misato smirked wider and cocked an eyebrow at the redhead attempting to burrow out of sight into his side. "Oh? Could have fooled me, then. Sure looks like you two are about to say... announce an engagem-"  
美里笑得更开了，对着试图钻到他身边躲避的红发少女挑了挑眉。"哦？那我可被你们骗了。看起来你们俩好像要宣布... 订婚什么的..."

"Excuse me, Mrs. Katsuragi!" Mari interrupted brightly, tapping the purple-haired woman on the shoulder, "but your agent is waiting for you in the lobby. Said something about more voice work in _Sailor Moon Crystal_, I think?"  
"打扰一下，葛城女士！" 真希波明快地打断道，轻拍着那位紫发女子的肩膀，"不过你的经纪人正在大厅等你。好像是说《美少女战士 Crystal》有更多的配音工作，我记得是这样？"

"Eh? Oh, right, that. Yes." Misato sighed and stood up. "I suppose I better see what he wants this time." She headed off towards the front of the enormous soundstage housing the many and varied sets of _Advice and Trust_.  
"诶？哦，对了，那个。是的。" 美里叹了口气，站起身来。"我想我还是去看看他这次想要什么吧。" 她朝着容纳了众多各式各样布景的巨大摄影棚的前方走去，那里是《建议与信任》的拍摄地。

Asuka looked up from her protective cuddle and shot her PA a thankful look. Mari just winked back and skipped off in her Just Shy Of Too Sexy Elf costume, jingling merrily. She was having entirely too much fun playing 'Santa's Little Helper' to Gendo.  
明日香从她的保护性拥抱中抬起头，向她的助理投去感激的目光。真希波只是眨了眨眼，然后穿着她那套恰到好处又不失性感的精灵服装，欢快地跳开了，铃声悦耳。她扮演'圣诞老人的小助手'给源堂，玩得不亦乐乎。

Rei followed her with appreciative eyes. "Nyaaaa~ That girl makes a fur-trimmed micro-miniskirt _work_!"  
丽用欣赏的目光跟随着她。“喵~那女孩把毛边超短裙穿得真好看！”

"You are _such_ a wanton hussy, my dear," Kaworu snickered, pinching her on the rump.  
“你真是个放荡的小妖精，亲爱的，”渚薰窃笑着，捏了捏她的臀部。

"Oh, you are one to talk, Mister 'Checks Out More People Than _I_ Do'," Rei snarked right back. She planted a kiss on his lips with a smile, though.  
“哦，你倒是说说看，那位‘比我还要多看别人几眼’的先生，”丽反唇相讥。不过她还是微笑着在他唇上印下一吻。

Shinji cleared his throat. "Er, the bossman is about to speak." He gestured with his recovered cocktail at the dias at the end of the set where the Director had mounted a pile of gift-wrapped prop rifles supporting a full-size Prog Knife.  
真嗣清了清嗓子。“呃，老大要讲话了。”他挥动着重新拿起的鸡尾酒，指向舞台尽头，导演正站在一堆包装好的道具步枪上，上面还支撑着一把全尺寸的 Prog 刀。

The Director knocked back a shot of his drink and then whistled for everyone's attention. "Good evening and Merry Christmas to you all. Now, I'm glad everyone could come, even those of you who are simultaneously working on other projects," he nodded at Kyoko and Sakura, "and those of you who aren't even _in_ this show, which makes me wonder what the Hell you're doing here."  
导演一口喝干杯中的酒，然后吹了声口哨吸引大家的注意。“晚上好，祝大家圣诞快乐。我很高兴大家都能来，包括那些同时在进行其他项目的，”他向响子和樱点了点头，“还有那些根本不在这个节目里的，这让我好奇你们到底来这儿干嘛。”

"Open bar!" Keris Dulmeadokht shouted from the back. Usagi Tsukino, Farah Mansoor, and Rena Van nodded from the seats next to her. Farah was already thoroughly drunk.  
“酒水免费！”克里斯·杜尔梅多赫特在后排喊道。月野兔、法拉·曼苏尔和蕾娜·范坐在她旁边点头附和。法拉已经喝得酩酊大醉。

The Director shook his head. "I don't even know anymore. Anyhow, since I'm the meta-avatar of a guy who's 6,721.93 miles1 from his wife and kids on Christmas Eve, I'd like to thank Doctor Gendo Ikari for providing the 'medical assistance' that is keeping me relatively jolly for tonight's festivities."  
导演摇了摇头。“我甚至都不知道了。无论如何，既然我是某个在圣诞夜与妻子和孩子相隔 6,721.93 英里 1 的人的元化身，我想感谢碇医生提供的‘医疗援助’，它让我今晚的庆祝活动相对愉快。”

"Doctor Gendo always helps out! Ho ho ho!"  
“碇医生总是帮忙！呵呵呵！”

"Shaddup. Alright, we've been shooting some heavy stuff lately, although _some_ people have tried to make it into comedy," he glared at Rei, who giggled without a hint of guilt, "and it's time for some holiday cheer. So everyone sit back and enjoy the Blooper Reel we knocked together out of the best bits, and yes, we will be screening the preview bits from the next update we've already finished the special effects on."  
“闭嘴。好吧，我们最近拍了一些沉重的内容，尽管有些人试图把它变成喜剧，”他瞪了绫波一眼，她毫无愧疚地咯咯笑，“现在是时候来点节日气氛了。所以大家都坐下来享受我们拼凑的搞笑花絮，是的，我们还会放映已经完成特效的下一次更新的预告片段。”

"Ooooh! Does that include the _shower scene_?" Rei asked salaciously.  
"哦哦哦！那包括淋浴戏吗？" 丽色眯眯地问道。

"Yes, the shower scene too," the Director admitted.  
"是的，淋浴戏也包括在内，" 导演承认道。

"Whoo hooo!"

"Oh god..." Shinji and Kaworu said in stereo.  
"哦，天哪..." 真嗣和薰异口同声地说。

The director waved at the tech running the lights and soundboard, and the room went dark. The working monitor on the Central Dogma set lit up, and the first Blooper scene began.  
导演向负责灯光和音响的技术人员挥了挥手，房间随即陷入黑暗。中央教条区的监控屏幕亮起，第一段花絮场景开始了。

Chapter 8.9, take 3 - START -

A pair of bare feet and legs sticking out of shorts poked out from the couch that was still dragged near the TV. Some random action movie was on, and the Child on the couch probably not even watching, their feet idly kicking. Misato smiled again. The usual state of affairs when she came home was back. It would be a nice change after the last few days of oddity. She trudged towards her room to change, pulling her jacket off.  
沙发被拖到电视附近，从上面伸出一双赤脚和腿，穿着短裤。电视上正播放着一部随机的动作片，沙发上的孩子可能根本没在看，脚闲散地踢着。美里再次微笑。她回家时常见的景象又回来了。经过这几天的异常，这将是令人愉快的变化。她拖着沉重的步伐走向自己的房间换衣服，脱下了外套。

_'Now, what to wear to best #1) tease Shinji, #2) make Asuka jealous and provoke her into flaunting her own bod at him in territorial response, and #3) make me look hot in case Kaji drops by? Hmm... if Asuka can lay around in a tank and short-shorts, so can I!'_ She was out of her uniform and most of the way into a nice comfy set of cut-off shorts and a yellow tank when she heard the opening salvo of the usual battle start.  
‘现在，穿什么才能最好地#1) 逗弄真嗣，#2) 让明日香嫉妒并激起她在他面前炫耀自己的身材以示领地反应，以及#3) 让我看起来很性感以防加持突然来访呢？嗯...如果明日香能穿着背心和短裤躺着，我也可以！’她脱下制服，大部分已经换上了舒适的牛仔短裤和黄色背心，这时她听到了日常战斗的序幕。

"OI! BAKA! WHERE'S MY DINNER?!"  
"喂！笨蛋！我的晚饭呢？！"

She started to smile at the familiar opening, then froze. _'Th...that was not... that wasn't Asuka!'_ She rapidly finished tugging on the shorts and styled her hair into a high ponytail as she trotted back into the living room. "Asuka, what's go... what."  
她开始对这熟悉的开场报以微笑，随即僵住了。'那...那不是...那不是明日香！'她迅速拉上短裤，将头发扎成高马尾，小跑回客厅。"明日香，怎...怎么了...什么。"

The Child on the couch had indeed jumped up to yell at the occupant of the kitchen, a bag of potato chips clutched in one fist as the other pointed angrily, a posture Misato had seen the Second Child adopt many times. Legs toned by hours of NERV training led up to a bright yellow sun dress, set off nicely by a blue velvet choker, and an A-10 Interface headset atop the Pilot's head.  
沙发上的孩子确实跳起来对着厨房里的人大喊，一只手紧握着一袋薯片，另一只手指着对方，这种姿势美里见过二号机驾驶员多次采用。经过 NERV 训练的紧实双腿，配上一条亮黄色的太阳裙，蓝色天鹅绒项圈相得益彰，头上还戴着 A-10 接口耳机。

Really, Shinji didn't look half bad in the outfit.  
说真的，真嗣穿上这身衣服看起来还不错。

"I'm _hungry!_ Hurry it up!" he shouted at the cook. "And get on with my laundry! My green dress is in the wash, and I need it for a date tonight! I want to feel _pretty_!"  
“我饿了！快点！”他对厨师喊道，“还有，我的衣服洗好了吗？我的绿色裙子还在洗，今晚约会我需要它！我想漂漂亮亮的！”

He turned to their newly arrived guardian. "Oh, hi Misato!" He did a little twirl. How do I look?"  
他转向他们新来的监护人，“哦，嗨，美里！”他转了一圈，“我看起来怎么样？”

A loud WHIIRRRRRRRR began behind them, and Asuka stepped into shot holding a leafblower. "Oh, man, I've been waiting all week for this! Woohooo!"  
一阵响亮的 WHIIRRRRRRRR 声从他们身后传来，明日香手持吹叶机步入镜头。“哦，天哪，我等这一刻等了一整周了！喔呼！”

He nodded. Still hand-in-hand, they walked to the center of the front of the classroom, right in front of the blackboard. They waited as the last students filed in and the bell rang.  
他点点头。依旧手牵手，他们走到教室前方的中央，正对着黑板。他们等待着最后几名学生进入教室，铃声响起。

They got a few curious looks from the students, wondering why they were standing there. Shinji briefly met the eyes of Touji and Kensuke. Touji had a look of dawning horror as he noticed their handclasp. Kensuke looked up from his palmtop and blinked at the two of them, then started to grin as he reached for his camcorder. Shinji just blushed a bit more. He didn't worry too much about what the rest of the class was going to say, but the opinions of his friends had a bit more weight.  
他们吸引了几个学生好奇的目光，想知道他们为何站在那里。真嗣短暂地与东治和健司对视。东治注意到他们的手握，脸上露出了惊恐的表情。健司从掌上电脑抬起头，眨眼看着他们，随即咧嘴一笑，伸手去拿摄像机。真嗣只是脸更红了。他不太担心班上其他人的看法，但朋友们的意见分量更重。

Once she was satisfied she had everyone's attention, Asuka left off her glaring contest with Tanaka and the other girls who were still pursuing Shinji and began. "I'm sure this will not surprise some of you." She shot a look at Tanaka and followers. "And will disappoint others, but as of today and from now on, Shinji and I are... well..." She turned to Shinji, dropped the handclasp, and put her hands on either side of his face. She pulled him right into the deepest, most intense kiss she could manage.  
一旦她确信吸引了所有人的注意，明日香停止了与田中和那些仍在追求真嗣的女生们的瞪眼比赛，开始说道：“我相信这对某些人来说并不意外。”她瞥了一眼田中和追随者们。“而对其他人则可能失望，但从今天起，我和真嗣……嗯……”她转向真嗣，松开手，双手捧住他的脸颊。她将他拉近，给了他一个最深沉、最热烈的吻。

Shinji heard a wave of gasps ripple through the classroom. He couldn't stop his lips from curling into as much of a broad smile as he could in the middle of a kiss. His eyes drifted shut in synch with Asuka's. It was a long, long minute before he felt her pull away with a tiny sigh of happiness. He reopened his eyes just in time to catch her peaceful expression of contentment shift into a catlike grin as she turned to the class and simply growled, "_Any questions?_"  
真嗣听到教室里传来一阵倒吸凉气的声音。他忍不住在亲吻中尽可能地咧开嘴笑了起来。他的眼睛与明日香同步闭上。过了许久，许久，他才感觉到她带着一丝幸福的叹息轻轻离开。他刚睁开眼睛，就看到她满足的平静表情转变成了一抹狡黠的笑容，她转向全班，简单地低吼道：“有问题吗？”

Chidori Honda slowly raised her hand, staring at them with a shocked, puzzled face.  
本田千凉缓缓举起手，震惊而困惑地盯着他们。

Asuka nodded at her. "Yes?"  
明日香朝她点点头。“怎么了？”

"What is the airspeed of velocity of an unladen swallow?"  
"一只没有负重的燕子，它的飞行速度是多少？"

"What do you mean? African, or European swallow?" Asuka asked back.  
"你指的是哪种？非洲燕子，还是欧洲燕子？" 明日香反问道。

"Uh... I don't know that?"  
"呃... 我不清楚这个？"

With no warning, Chidori rocketed upward, through the ceiling, and vanished with a scream.  
没有任何预兆，千鸟直冲而上，穿透天花板，伴随着一声尖叫消失无踪。

"How did you know that?" Shinji asked, amazed.  
“你怎么知道的？”真嗣惊讶地问。

"You have to know these sorts of things when you're a queen," Asuka said without missing a beat.  
“身为女王，你必须了解这些事情。”明日香毫不犹豫地回答。

"CUT! ...ok, I'm impressed you arranged that with the special effects crew ahead of time, but _what the fuck?_" the Director exclaimed.  
"停！……好吧，我对你提前和特效团队安排好这一幕印象深刻，但到底是怎么回事？" 导演惊呼道。

"You don't sound 'alright'. You sound... like a damn doll again. Did..." Asuka sucked in a shocked breath. She got in front of her and grabbed Rei's shoulders, halting her walk. "Did that fucking witch doctor do something to you again?!"  
"你听起来不像'没事'。你听起来……又像个该死的玩偶了。难道……" 明日香倒吸一口凉气，震惊不已。她走到她面前，抓住绫波的肩膀，阻止她继续前行。"难道那个该死的巫医又对你做了什么？！"

Rei stared at her, blank. "Doctor... Akagi... adjusted my medication," she eventually said very slowly.  
绫波盯着她，面无表情。"赤木博士……调整了我的药物，"她最终缓缓地说道。

Asuka shivered. "_Scheiße_. That _witch_. Fine... ok... Rei, you're going to be alright. We'll get you back to your apartment and... fuck..." She looked at Shinji, still at a loss. "Shinji?"  
"明日香颤抖着。“该死。那个女巫。好吧……行……丽，你会没事的。我们会把你送回你的公寓，然后……该死……”她看着真嗣，依旧茫然无措。“真嗣？””

"Fucking... Ikari... kun... is... your... job," Rei said, slow and dead.  
“该死的……碇……君……是……你的……工作，”丽缓慢而死气沉沉地说。

They both stared at Rei. A hopeful smile started to break out on Asuka's face, matching the one on Shinji's. "Wondergirl, are you still in there?"  
"他们俩都盯着丽。一个充满希望的微笑开始在明日香的脸上绽放，与真嗣脸上的微笑相映成趣。“三无少女，你还在那里吗？””

"I... mean... are you... getting... paid... by... the... hour? You... two... are... like... teenage... monkeys... on... Spring... Break... You're ... goddam... insaitiable... Can... I... borrow... him... for... a... weekend... Asuka? I... think... I... could... use... him... to... dril... for... oil."  
"我...意思是...你们...是按...小时...计酬的吗？你们...两个...简直...像春假...里的...青少年...猴子...你们...真是...该死...的...不知疲倦...能...不能...借我...他...一个...周末...明日香？我...觉得...我...可能...需要...他...来...钻探...石油。"

Asuka stared at her. "Ok, I have to admit, I'm kind of impressed you did all that without breaking character."  
明日香盯着她。"好吧，我得承认，你能在不破功的情况下做到这一切，我有点佩服。"

"I am _high as balls_," Rei said, and broke down giggling. "WOOOOOO!"  
"我嗨得要命，"丽说，然后忍不住咯咯笑了起来。"喔呼！"

Misato examined Asuka's serious look and her own amorous smile faded. "What is it?"  
美里审视着明日香严肃的表情，自己的爱慕微笑也逐渐消失。“怎么了？”

"Rei's in my room right now. She'll be staying the night. Maybe the next too, we're not sure," Asuka said.  
“丽现在在我房间里。她今晚要留宿。也许明天也是，我们还不确定，”明日香说道。

"A little sleepover is fine, Asuka, but she lives right next door, so...?"  
“小小的睡衣派对没问题，明日香，但她就住在隔壁，所以...？”

"Shinji's with her right now."  
"真嗣现在和她在一起。"

"You trust your boyfriend alone with her? My my..." Misato tried to joke, but it fell flat against Asuka's grim look. "Why is he in there, then?"  
"你放心让男朋友单独和她在一起？哎呀呀……" 美里试图开玩笑，但在明日香严肃的表情前显得无力。"那他为什么在里面？"

"Because I trust them to-"  
"因为我相信他们能够……"

"OH MY GOD! YES YES! DRILL, BABY, DRILL! STICK YOUR LANCE OF LONNNNNNGINUS IN MY FIRST ANGEL! THIRD IMPACT!" Rei screamed from just off camera.  
“哦，我的天哪！对对对！钻吧，宝贝，钻吧！把你的长长长枪插入我的第一个使徒！第三次冲击！”丽在镜头外尖叫道。

"-behave themselves without any problems," Asuka finished smoothly, calmly looking at Misato.  
“-他们表现得毫无问题，”明日香流畅地接话，平静地看着美里。

Shinji looked up from his seat on the edge of the bed where he sat holding Rei's hand. His gaze flicked worriedly from Kaji to Misato before settling back to Asuka. She just nodded to him, then walked to the far side of the bed to take Rei's other hand.  
真嗣从床边座位上抬起头，他正握着丽的手。他的目光担忧地在加持和美里之间来回扫视，最后又回到明日香身上。她只是对他点了点头，然后走到床的另一边，握住了丽的另一只手。

"H-hello, Kaji-san. Welcome home, Misato-san," Shinji greeted them quietly. He quickly looked back down at Rei.  
“哈-哈喽，加持先生。欢迎回家，美里小姐，”真嗣轻声向他们打招呼。他迅速又低头看向绫波。

Misato pursed her lips as she noted the IV drip hanging from the stand by the bed, then looked down at the First Child herself.  
美里注意到床边挂着的点滴架，然后低头看向第一适格者本人。

The bluenette was shaking intermittently, her eyes darting around without focusing on anything. Suddenly her eyes fixed on Misato's. "I am the spirit of a four billion year old space goddess who is the source of all life on earth. I can pop your corporeal form like a soap bubble with a mere thought. I can see your soul and every secret your heart and mind have. I am the key to a decades-old conspiracy of a secret cabal of men who rule the world from behind the scenes to usher in the apocalypse and have me turn them into gods. Also, Commander Ikari and Doctor Akagi are fucking. I really think she could do better."  
蓝发少女不时颤抖着，眼神四处游移，没有聚焦在任何东西上。突然，她的目光定格在美里身上。“我是四亿年历史的宇宙女神的灵魂，是地球上所有生命的源泉。我只需一个念头就能像戳肥皂泡一样摧毁你的肉体。我能看见你的灵魂，以及你心灵和思想中的每一个秘密。我是数十年来一个秘密阴谋的关键，这个阴谋由一群幕后统治世界的男人策划，目的是引发末日并让我将他们变成神。另外，碇司令和赤木博士在搞婚外情。我真的觉得她值得更好的。”

Shinji and Misato shared a confused look.  
真嗣和美里交换了一个困惑的眼神。

"Er..." Shinji said cautiously. "That was a bit more coherent than the other bits."  
"呃..." 真嗣谨慎地说道。 "这比其他部分要连贯一些。"

"Shit!" Rei suddenly exclaimed. "I forgot to mention the Geofront is my ancient alien spaceship! Can I do it again?"  
"该死！" 丽突然喊道。 "我忘了提地底都市其实是我的古代外星飞船！我能再来一次吗？"

"CUT!"

Ritsuko barked a bitter laugh. "The last time I talked to Misato, I bit her head off and called her a lazy alcoholic. I'm not doing so well there. And Maya..." She waved at the door. "Thinks I'm someone I'm not."  
律子发出了一声苦笑。“上次我跟美里谈话时，我狠狠地训斥了她一顿，还骂她是懒惰的酒鬼。我在这方面做得并不好。至于真希波……”她朝门口挥了挥手。“她认为我是另一个人。”

"She is very devoted to you. And Major Katsuragi is still concerned about you. You do not need to give up. You are not his doll either," Rei replied quietly.  
“她对你非常忠诚。而葛城少校依然关心你。你不需要放弃。你也不是他的玩偶，”绫波平静地回答。

She stood up. "I will leave you to Lieutenant Ibuki's care." Rei bowed precisely to her, then headed to the door. She unlocked and opened the door just as the running footsteps approaching down the hall reached the room.  
她站起身来。“我会把你交给伊吹副官照顾。”绫波向她精确地鞠了一躬，然后走向门口。她刚解开门锁并打开门，走廊上急促的脚步声就到了房间门口。

Lieutenant Ibuki burst in, holding a scrap of white cloth over her head. "Akagi-sempai, I've... I've... ...fuck, _line_?"  
伊吹副官猛地冲了进来，手里举着一块白布片遮在头顶。“赤城前辈，我……我…………该死，台词是什么？”

"'I've got your panties!'" Ritsuko said flatly from the bed.  
“‘我拿到了你的内裤！’”律子在床上平淡地回答。

Maya blinked at her. "You do? Oh holy shit, so _that's_ where they ended up! I _thought_ it felt a little drafty in here? Can I have them back?"  
真希波眨眼看着她。“你真的拿到了？哦天哪，原来它们在那儿！我还以为这里有点漏风呢？能还给我吗？”

"No."

"CUT!"

She stood up. "I will leave you to Lieutenant Ibuki's care." Rei bowed precisely to her, then headed to the door. She unlocked and opened the door just as the running footsteps approaching down the hall reached the room.

伊吹中尉猛地冲进来，手里高举着一块白布。“赤木前辈，我拿到了你的内裤！”

Ritsuko covered her face with her hands. "Oh god..."  
律子双手捂脸。“哦，天哪……”

"And your wading boots, your six inch stilettos, your assless chaps, and your pogo stick with the dildo on top. I wasn't sure what you wanted, so I grabbed a sample of everything. Man, your closet is _weird_."  
“还有你的涉水靴、六英寸高跟鞋、无臀皮裤，以及顶端装有假阳具的弹簧单高跷。我不确定你想要什么，所以我每样都拿了一些。天啊，你的衣橱真是奇怪。”

Maya tossed the underwear over her shoulder and pushed Rei aside. "Out of the way, First Child! Mama needs her nookie!" She took a running leap and jumped on top of Ritsuko.  
真希把内裤往后一扔，把绫波推到一边。“让开，第一适格者！妈妈需要她的亲热时间！”她一个助跑跳跃，扑到了律子身上。

"CUT! Oh for fuck's sake, you two are impossible!"  
"卡！哦，看在上帝的份上，你们两个真是无可救药！"

His eyes widened as Rei grabbed his shirt collar in both hands and yanked him closer. "Listen to me well, you stupid fish. I _had_ something like that. When I told them I loved them I felt better than I ever have before. They accepted me! I was not alone! I felt better just being around them! _And now because of you I have to flee from them and withhold from them everything I wish to tell them!_ Your masters have _robbed me of my greatest joy!_ And you even _standing here_ threatens everything! It is fantastic that you now begin to understand why I am so ready to end you if you make any move that might threaten them! But… _you will look me in the eye when I am talking to you, Rainbow Trout!"_  
他的眼睛睁大了，因为丽用双手抓住他的衬衫领子，猛地把他拉近。“好好听我说，你这愚蠢的鱼。我曾经有过那样的感觉。当我告诉他们我爱他们时，我感觉比以往任何时候都要好。他们接受了我！我不再孤单！仅仅是和他们在一起就让我感觉更好！而现在，因为你，我不得不逃离他们，对他们隐瞒我所有想说的话！你的主人夺走了我最大的快乐！你甚至站在这里都威胁到了一切！现在你开始明白为什么我如此急于在你做出任何可能威胁到他们的举动时结束你了吧！但是……你得看着我的眼睛，当我跟你说话的时候，彩虹鳟鱼！”

Kaworu had looked away and sweat started heavily beading on his forehead. "I… do not know if that is a good idea…"  
渚薰避开了视线，额头开始大量冒汗。“我……不知道那是不是个好主意……”

"_Why not?_ I am talking to you!"  
“为什么不？我正在跟你说话！”

"Please understand! This body has urges and drives that I cannot control!"  
"请理解！这具身体有着我无法控制的冲动和欲望！"

Rei's eyes narrowed. "I am well aware of the compulsion the Call exerts on you, Tabris. That is no excuse. You bear that every moment and manage to look at me other times. Do so now."  
丽的眼中闪过一丝锐利。“我非常清楚‘召唤’对你的影响，塔布里斯。但这不是借口。你每时每刻都承受着它，却仍能在其他时候面对我。现在也这么做。”

"Not that urge! The Lilim ones!"  
"不是那种冲动！是关于莉莉姆的那些！"

"...what."

"All of my will goes to suppressing the Call! I have little left for… um… stopping the others."  
“我所有的意志都用在压制召唤上了！我几乎没有余力去……呃……阻止其他人。”

"Fifth Child, if you do not start making sense _right now_, I will bounce you off a tree again."  
“第五子，如果你现在还不开始说人话，我就再把你弹到树上去。”

Kaworu swallowed heavily. "...please do not look down."  
渚薰重重地咽了口唾沫。“……请不要低头。”

Rei looked down. 丽低头看去。

There was a long moment of very tense silence.  
一阵异常紧张的沉默持续了许久。

"Is that a salami in your pocket, or are you happy to see me?," Rei said tightly.  
“你口袋里是萨拉米香肠，还是见到我很高兴？”丽紧绷着脸说道。

Kaworu reached into his pocket and whipped it out. "30cm Italian Dry, just picked it up at the market. I brought a picnic basket up here. Want some of my meat?"  
渚薰伸手从口袋里掏出一样东西，迅速展示出来。“30 厘米的意大利风干火腿，刚在市场买的。我还带了个野餐篮上来。想尝尝我的肉吗？”

"Oh, yes, give me about 16cm," Rei said happily. "You can give me some more later." She wiggled her eyebrows.  
“哦，好的，给我大约 16 厘米，”绫波丽开心地说道，“待会儿还可以再给我一些。”她挑了挑眉毛。

"CUT!"

"Angel confirmed," Aoba reported. "Max magnification, on screen."  
“天使确认，”青叶报告道，“最大倍率，屏幕上显示。”

The big screen lit up, showing the Angel. It looked like the electrified skeleton of a bird, glued together by someone who had no idea how the bones were supposed to fit. It had two wings that split into four, but had irregular spikes and shards poking off its whole outline. Even with all the strangeness they'd seen so far, the spiky monster looked subtly _wrong_ to Misato.  
巨大的屏幕亮起，显现出使徒的身影。它看起来像是被电流激活的鸟类骨架，由一个不知骨骼应如何拼接的人胡乱粘合而成。它拥有两对翅膀，分裂成四翼，但整个轮廓上却布满了不规则的尖刺和碎片。尽管他们已经见识过许多奇异之物，这个满是尖刺的怪物仍让美里感到微妙的违和感。

"It's not moving from its satellite orbit," said Hyuga.  
“它没有从卫星轨道上移动。”日向说道。

"Switch to Code Red and put Unit-01 on Standby," Misto ordered.  
“切换到红色警戒状态，让零号机待命。”美里命令道。

"Hey Misato~~, guess what I~~~ have?" Aoba sang.  
"嘿，美里~~，猜猜我~~~有什么？" 青叶唱道。

"Is it a boner?"  
"是勃起吗？"

"Umm..."

"Because if you say 'I have a boner' one more _goddam time_, I will come over and _personally_ kick your ass!"  
"因为如果你再说一次'我勃起了'，我就会亲自过去踢你的屁股！"

"We have a visual of the target," Makoto reported.  
"我们已锁定目标，" 真琴报告道。

Misato sighed. "Great. What can you tell me?"  
美里叹了口气。"太好了。你能告诉我什么信息？"

"The target appears to be... a thing."  
"目标似乎是...一个物品。"

"What the Hell do you mean, 'a thing?'!"  
"你说的'东西'到底是什么鬼？"

Makoto sweated. "Ah... it's a... it's a... thing?"  
真琴冒汗了。"啊...那是个...那是个...东西？"

"Can _none_ of you three do _anything_ useful around here? Maya!"  
"你们三个在这里就一点有用的事都做不了吗？麻耶！"

"Yes!" the brunette tech snapped alertly. "The object is cruising at a steady pace towards Central Dogma, it's constant phase pattern gives it a reflective quality that makes it appear like a massive... thing."  
"是的！" 棕发技术员机敏地回应道。"目标正以稳定速度向中央法则区移动，其恒定的相位模式赋予了它反射特性，使其看起来像是一个巨大的……物体。"

"Massive thing," Aoba giggled. "I'll show you a 'massive thing'."  
"巨大的物体，" 苍井轻笑道。"我会让你见识一下什么叫'巨大的物体'。"

"CUT! Alright, what smartass switched our scripts with Gigguk's?"  
"停！好吧，哪个自作聪明的家伙把我们的剧本换成了 Gigguk 的？"

Shinji numbly trudged into the locker room. Only long habit kept his feet automatically walking him towards the showers and lockers. He stared at nothing as the undressed without thought and dropped his LCL-coated plugsuit into the slot in the wall for it to be taken away and cleaned. He barely remembered to grab his towel before wandering into the showers.  
真嗣麻木地拖着脚步走进更衣室。只有长期的习惯让他的双脚自动走向淋浴间和储物柜。他茫然地盯着前方，毫无意识地脱下沾满 LCL 的插入栓服，将其丢进墙上的槽口以便取走清洗。他几乎忘了拿毛巾，就恍惚地走进了淋浴间。

He was already there before a couple of things registered as more than background: The showers were already running, and they were set at an extremely high temperature. The thick clouds of steam nearly blinded him as he stumbled forward. He hissed as his foot touched the water on the tiles. It was hot enough it hurt to step in, almost hot enough to scald his skin at touch. He edged his way around the full-blast stream from the showerheads and carefully turned the temperature way down.  
他到达时，几件事情才从背景中凸显出来：淋浴已经开启，且温度设定得极高。浓密的蒸汽几乎让他看不清前方，他踉跄着前行。当他一脚踩在瓷砖上的热水时，不禁倒吸一口凉气。那热度足以让人感到疼痛，几乎能烫伤皮肤。他小心翼翼地绕过淋浴头喷出的强力水流，谨慎地将温度调低。

As the temperature dropped, the steam lightened enough for him to see Kaworu, curled into a fetal ball on the floor, the stream blasting right onto him. His skin was very red.  
随着温度下降，蒸汽变得稀薄，使他能够看到卡罗躺在地上，蜷缩成胎儿的姿势，水流直接冲击着他。他的皮肤异常红润。

Shinji's eyes snapped wide. "Kaworu!" He grabbed Kaworu's hand and started to pull him out of the stream. "Are you alright?"  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁大。“卡罗！”他抓住卡罗的手，开始将他从水流中拉出。“你还好吗？”

Kaworu looked up at him with frantic eyes. "T-t-turn the water back up!"  
渚薰抬头望向他，眼中满是慌乱。“把水温调回去！”

"What? No!" Shinji gasped. "That water was almost hot enough to scald! You could have been hurt!"  
“什么？不行！”真嗣喘着气说。“那水几乎热到能烫伤人！你可能会受伤的！”

"Yes! Please! I need the pain!"  
“是的！求你了！我需要那种痛感！”

"What?!"

"It it it it anchors me!" Kaworu stuttered. "I n-n-need the f-f-feeling right now! The pain reminds me who I am! I'm ME! Not him! _Not him!_"  
"它它它它让我安定！" 渚薰结巴着说。"我...我...我现在需要这种感觉！疼痛提醒我是谁！我是我！不是他！不是他！"

"I... I don't understand, Kaworu-kun," Shinji shook his head, "But I'm... I'm not going to let you hurt yourself like this. Come... come on. Let's... get you out of here and-"  
"我...我不明白，渚薰君，" 真嗣摇摇头，"但我不...我不会让你这样伤害自己。来...来吧。我们...带你离开这里，然后-"

"Yes! Please!" Kaworu seized his hand with desperate strength. "Get me away from here! Th-th-th-the C-c-call is _bad_ right now! I... I d-d-d-don't know how l-l-long I can hold..."  
"好的！请！" 渚薰用绝望的力量抓住他的手。"带我离开这里！那...那...那呼唤现在很糟糕！我...我不知...不知道还能坚持多久..."

Shinji felt a chill run down his back at the way Kaworu pleaded with him. "Ok... Ok... come on...we'll...we'll get you home and into bed..."  
听到渚薰这样恳求自己，真嗣感到脊背一阵发凉。“好……好……来吧……我们……我们会送你回家，让你上床休息……”

The lights smoothly dimmed to half strength and a deep base beat began to grow louder, followed by a moaning sax.  
灯光平稳地调暗至半亮度，紧接着，深沉的低音节拍逐渐增强，随后是呻吟般的萨克斯风声。

"And what are you going to _do_ with me once you've got me into bed, Shinji-kun?" Kaworu purred in a suddenly much smoother voice.  
“那么，一旦你把我弄上床，真嗣君，你打算对我做什么呢？”渚薰突然用一种更加圆滑的声音低声说道。

"Why, I can think of a few things to occupy your time, Kaworu-kun," Shinji husked right back. "Maybe that will bring Rei right back. She likes to watch..."  
"哎呀，我能想到几件事来占用你的时间，薰君，" 真嗣沙哑地回应道。"或许那样会让丽立刻回来。她喜欢看..."

"Bow chicka-wow-wow~~!" Rei said from off camera.  
"Bow chicka-wow-wow~~!" 丽在镜头外说道。

"CUT!"

"I can't believe Rei talked us into doing that on the first take," Shinji said, his face in his hands.  
"真不敢相信丽说服我们第一次就拍这个，" 真嗣双手捂脸说道。

"I can't believe we managed to keep a straight face all the way until Rei cracked up," Kaworu said with a smile.  
"真不敢相信我们一直忍到丽笑场才破功，"渚薰微笑着说。

"I can't believe we're not putting that on the 4K Edition Special Features!" Rei complained.  
"真不敢相信我们没把那段放进 4K 版特别花絮里！"丽抱怨道。

The rest of the cast in the couch area looked at her.  
沙发区的其他演员都看着她。

"What? They're hot and it would sell extra copies," she explained.  
"什么？他们很火辣，能多卖几本，" 她解释道。

"Rei, regardless of your actual ages, their _characters_ are not even 16!" Misato pointed out, having returned during the Bloopers.  
"丽，不管你们的实际年龄如何，他们的角色连 16 岁都不到！" 美里指出，她在拍摄花絮时回来了。

"Oh, right... damn it," Rei pouted.  
"哦，对啊...该死，" 丽撅嘴道。

Shinji shook his head and looked at Asuka. "Now?" he asked gently.  
真嗣摇了摇头，看向明日香。“现在吗？”他轻声问道。

Asuka bit her lip nervously, then nodded. Together, they stood up and walked towards the Director and his Prog Knife speaking platform.  
明日香紧张地咬了咬嘴唇，然后点了点头。他们一起站起来，走向导演和他的 Prog Knife 演讲台。

"Sir? We'd like to make an announcement to the cast, if we could," Asuka asked hesitantly.  
“先生？如果我们能的话，我们想向剧组宣布一件事。”明日香犹豫地问道。

The Director looked down at them. "Eh? Sure you can-... wait... you're not pregnant, are you? That would just totally upend the shooting schedule."  
导演低头看着他们。“嗯？你确定可以——等等……你不是怀孕了吧？那可会彻底打乱拍摄计划。”

"Er..." She and Shinji swapped a look. "No, we're... we're not."  
“呃……”她和真嗣交换了一个眼神。“不，我们……我们没有。”

"Ok, sure, go wild then."  
“好吧，那就尽情发挥吧。”

He looked back out over the crowd. "Attention, everyone! Our leads have an announcement to make. I bet half of you think you know what it is, so everyone get ready to settle some bets!"  
他回头望向人群。“大家注意了！我们的主角有事情要宣布。我敢打赌你们中有一半人已经猜到了，所以大家都准备好来解决这些赌注吧！”

He stepped out of the way and let Shinji and Asuka take over the platform-cum-giant-knife.  
他退到一旁，让真嗣和明日香站上了平台兼巨型刀具。

"Ah... Hello, everyone," Shinji opened. "Ah... our parents already know, as do Rei and Kaworu, and I'm betting a few of you have guessed-"  
“啊...大家好，”真嗣开口道。“啊...我们的父母已经知道了，丽和薰也知道，我猜你们中有些人可能也猜到了——”

"You went and proposed, didn't you?" Misato said with a ear-to-ear grin. "Congratulations, you two! Finally!"  
"你真的去求婚了，对吧？" 美里笑得合不拢嘴，"恭喜你们俩！终于等到这一天了！"

"Er, no," Asuka said.

Misato's face fell, and she stopped reaching for the wad of bills Makoto was starting to hand to her. "Huh? Wait, what?!"  
美里的脸色一沉，伸向真琴正要递给她的一叠钞票的手也停住了。"啊？等等，什么？！"

Asuka pulled the chain out of her shirtfront and handed Shinji the ring from it. He knelt down and slipped it on her finger, smiling.  
明日香从衬衫前襟拉出一条链子，把上面的戒指递给真嗣。他跪下，微笑着将戒指套在她的手指上。

Asuka smirked at Misato. "We got _married_. Nyah!"  
明日香对美里得意一笑。"我们结婚了。喵！"

"You know what that means, Mrs. Katsuragi?" Mari said with a cat-grin, tapping her on the shoulder.  
"你知道这意味着什么吧，葛城太太？"真希波带着猫一般的笑容，轻拍她的肩膀说道。"

"I owe you $200," Misato nodded sadly. "Damn it. I was _sure_!"  
"我欠你 200 美元，"美里沮丧地点头。"该死。我可是很有把握的！"

"_I_ spend all day watching them," Mari said smugly. "I saw when they changed." Mari threw a fist in the air. "Vegas, baby!"  
"我整天都在观察他们，"玛丽得意地说道，"我看到了他们换班的时候。"玛丽挥拳向天，"维加斯，宝贝！"

Misato smacked her forehead. "Son of a _bitch_! Those sneaky little-"  
美里拍了拍自己的额头。"该死的！那些狡猾的小——"

"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!" Gendo boomed, and jumped into the sleigh hooked up behind Pen Pen. With a mighty heave, Pen Pen launched himself into the air, the sleigh following right along behind him. "And to all a _good night_!" Gendo proclaimed.  
"呵呵呵！圣诞快乐！"源堂大声宣布，并跳上了佩佩身后挂着的雪橇。随着一声有力的发力，佩佩腾空而起，雪橇紧随其后。"祝大家晚安！"源堂宣告道。
